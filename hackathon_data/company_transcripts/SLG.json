[Operator Instructions]. ","Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to Marc Holliday. Please go ahead, Marc.","Marc Holliday","Okay, thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. The first quarter of 2019 was another strong period of performance for SL Green, and for the New York City economy that continues to drive our success. Yet again, SL Green was far and away the most active player in our market, signing significantly leases, hitting major milestones in our development portfolio, moving swiftly to originate debt and preferred equity opportunities and contracting to dispose-off mature and non-core assets that fund our aggressive share buyback program, thereby capitalizing on the unprecedented discount in our stock. ","At our Investor Conference in December, we detailed 18 specific goals and objectives contained within 7 broad categories of performance. In the leasing category, Q1 is typically our slowest leasing quarter, however, we executed over 400,000 square feet in Manhattan office leases, more than doubling our internal expectations for the quarter. And to start April, we have already angled another 235,000 square feet of leases in the Manhattan portfolio and still have over 680,000 square feet of deals in pipeline. The three new bridges announced yesterday is further evidence of a market moving in the right direction as each of them represented organic growth in space leased. Clearly, the confluence of a strong New York City employment growth, along with the winnowing supply of suitable office inventory, is driving improvement in net effective rents and increase in rents. ","Notably, our mark-to-market for the quarter was 4.5%, above the high end of the range we provided to you in December. And there is 20 million square feet of active tenant searches that we are closing to tracking. In the area of investments, the market continues to demonstrate good support for the deals surprised at the market. There were several sizable deals consummated in the otherwise typical quiet for this quarter. 30 Hudson Yards sold for $2 billion. 237 Park completed a partial sale at $1.25 billion valuation, and 250 church sold for in excess of $860 per square foot, fairly attractive price for a Downtown asset. And of course, SL Green participated in this market by entering into a contract to sell 521 5th Avenue for $381 million, a price level that was above our own internal NAV for this asset. ","During the first quarter, there was $39 billion of private capital raised for global real estate investment, $8 billion more than the prior quarter, and it is now estimated to be at $338 billion of total dry powder for real estate, representing almost $1 trillion of potential buying power for real estate around the world. And certainly, New York City will continue to garner more than its fair share of that dry powder as it did in 2018 with over $50 billion of commercial transactions. ","Obviously, the public market concerned with New York City stands and stark contrast to views in actions of private market investors, who are targeting the exact type of product that we invest in no than anyone. These investors are looking to invest in assets with global appeal and strong quarter tenancy in a market with enormous depth and liquidity. We think private investors, which make up the vast majority of the real estate investment market, have the market analysis right and we trust that the public market will eventually recalibrate and return to a fair valuation for our highly sought-after assets. Throughout this incredible work, we remain true to our core mission of investing, managing and developing world-class properties in New York City. ","We continue to demonstrate our ability to undertake complex development projects with over $7 billion worth of asset, now or soon to be in development or redevelopment. One Vanderbilt construction process is just as vigorous as our leasing activity. As of April, the building superstructure reached the 60th floor, which is just above the height of the off deck and steel is projected to top out in October of this year months and of the original plan. So far this year, we signed expansion deals at One Vanderbilt with the Carlyle Group and McDermott Will & Emery along with a new lease to KPF Capital Partners, bringing the project to 57% leased with more leases spending so we are well underway to our outsize goal of 65% leased by the end of 2019. ","Building on the success of One Vanderbilt, we announced plans in December to reassemble the same design and development team, KPF, Heinz and Gensler, for a sweeping redevelopment of One Madison Avenue to Class A office server across the Madison Square Park. We are excited to break ground in this project in 2020 as we believe 1 Madison will transform Midtown South in the same dramatic with that One Vanderbilt has already done for East Midtown. We commenced our leasing program for the redevelopment of OME and are getting very strong response from tenants, confirming the excellence of the design of our development plan. When you put all these pieces together, you can see that we have a comprehensive plan in place to outperform our peers and stay at the top of our game. But that we know is not enough. Our entire executive team is deeply invested in our stock, and we share your laser focus on doing everything in our power to restore the connection between our share price and the underlying value of our assets. ","In 2019, we will continue to monetize assets and redeploy capital into share buybacks because every time we buy a share, we're buying more of a broad portfolio. And we know it's only a matter of time before the public market follows the private market in recognizing that New York real estate remains a stable, profitable and desirable investment. So with that, we'll open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Emmanuel Korchman with Citi.","Emmanuel Korchman","Marc, or maybe it's appropriate for Andrew, we're looking at your DTE business, you had a few assets and we tell that you've repossessed over the last couple of quarters. Can you talk about how you invented the rest of the assets it within your book performing? And also just maybe an update on the retail environment overall?","Andrew Mathias","Sure. I think we -- as of the end of Q1, we have 6 retail DPE positions remaining after 106 Spring came on board as part of the portfolio. We anticipate repayments in two of those over the next 60 days or so. So we'd be down to four assets remaining. So I think, in terms of retail assets coming back from the book, we're probably towards the end of that unless we find new distressed assets to acquire, which definitely wouldn't rule out than we did in the case of two well. Generally, the retail market, we think most of the majors submarkets have bottomed out. And we've seen -- if you take, for example, 106 spring, we're going to be reducing asking rents on their property from where our borrowers are asking to where we're going to ask as the new owner probably in excess of 30%. So you'll see, we think that will generate activity at that property and you will see activity in other properties where owners are able to meet the market on rents. There are tenants active in all the major retailers are markets in Manhattan. So I think most of the submarkets have bottomed up.","Emmanuel Korchman","Great. And Marc, in your prepared remarks, I think you said there's 20 million square feet of active tenant demand in New York. Could you break that down for us into may be how much of that is may be more musical chairs? And how much of that is tenants either expanding or looking for new space in the market?","Marc Holliday","No, I can't, Emmanuel. But I can tell you that a good chunk of it is growth space for sure. I mean you are seeing, in our portfolio and elsewhere, enormous growth in the market, which is driven by employment growth. Last year was another big year for employment growth in the City. We're off to a good start, private sector job growth is over 20,000 jobs from Paris this year already. So as long as there is a new jobs and office using jobs, there is not a big growth in that segment. First Republic lease that we announced yesterday is a great example of the that, where most, if not all of that, I believe is growth. So I mean that's just enormous and enormously favorable. And that's why financial services have reemerged as a one of the leading sector for both tenant releasing, but also growing. And that's, I think, contrary to what certainly people we've spoken with in the past had thought would be the case a year or 2, 3 years ago.","There is significant growth, obviously, in the technology industry and so that's -- there's a big -- I'd most of the technology demand within the 20 million is almost entirely growth because they're new to the sector. So when you see technology taking down in a given year, let's say 15% of 30 million in Q4 [ph], 3 million to 5 minutes square feet of free space. That's all growth because there -- mostly growth, because they're not rolling legacy leases. They're new to the market. So I can't give you an exact number of the 20 million, but I have to say at least 20% to 25% of that represents growth. But I just want to question them, giving you sort of an off the cuff answer based on just extrapolating from the experience in our own portfolio.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb from Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander Goldfarb","So two questions. First, on a modeling perspective, diesel came out some abducting that, that will get offset later this year by Puma coming on, but then the Ralph Lauren exploration at the end of this year, which would leave a $30 million NOI hole in next year. So maybe you could just provide some perspective on how we should think about the Diesel and PUMA interchange this year? And how we should be thinking about what you guys are doing to backfill their $31 million of Ralph Lauren NOI that's going away at the end of this year so the impact to next year?","Andrew Mathias","I'll cover the first part on Diesel and PUMA. The Diesel outcome is not yet certain, so we have to see that play out over the last couple of months before we know the impact on the numbers expected to be nominal. The charge we took in the first quarter is really to write off a straight line. that's the noncash adjustment that we had to take because of the uncertainty of the future depending on what happens, I don't expect there to be a big impact for that deal, and of course, PUMA coming on is important not so much for '19 because it's probably the back half of the year, very late in the year, but more so for '20, so we'll highlight that in December. And I'll let market address the $625 million situation.","Marc Holliday","At 625, Ralph Lauren, I think, I have the number here are some there has about 385,000 square feet. Every year in the portfolio, we have anywhere between 1 million and 0.25 million feed that gross. Polo seems to get a lot of attention. I think if it goes into the paper, it gets a lot of attention, if it doesn't go into the paper it doesn't. We had a very large tenant at The News Building that rolled and then be backfilled with VNS, and we can go on and on. We had vacancy at 10 East 53rd, now it\u2019s a lease building, we had vacancy [indiscernible] lease building and so we'll have vacancy at 625 Madison, we'll leasing it, we say how are we going to deal with it? I don't see dealing with that in a different fashion than we deal with all of the role in the portfolio. We have 30 million square feet that we own and manage. In any given year, as I said, about 1 million a quarter, 1.25 million square feet roll. So in 2019 -- at the end of '19, Paula will be a part of the. I don't think it's exceptional or notable in its size, nor how we'll deal with it. ","Our typical approach, for any building, and certainly for 625, which has been an earnings horse for 15 years, will be to go through some level of redevelopment of that building and then long-term lease that space to replace POLO. But again, I don't know -- I don't see a different and notable than what we've done over the decades in any building we have when we have a tenant rollout of what I'll call a space that needs to be upgraded because Polo was in that place for, I think, 15 years of. So they space in the building itself is probably in need of a revisit and that's kind of what we do, Alex. It's just is reposition, turning and related building, which is why we are at 96% leased and I don't think really ever been below 94% leased in the history of the company.","Alexander Goldfarb","Right. I understand and thanks for the perspective. Our permanent long-term planning of rehab is on hold until you guys reset the ground lease. That's what I was asking if there is...","Marc Holliday","I wouldn't say necessarily. I mean, we feel very confident in our position in 625. I think I said that on the last call as well or maybe at the Citigroup. I said that, maybe it was at the city meeting that we had, but in one of those 2 venues, I mentioned that we are very experienced as both a leaseholder and a fee owner. I think, we've had probably in the aggregate more experience in those 2 as almost any other owner in the city. And we have an expectation of where rents will land on a revaluation, and we're going to be actively marketing the space in 2020. But you can't really market this kind of space, which -- so you can elaborate on until you have position, you wipe off and you have redevelopment plan. But I could say that about 20 other buildings. So we're not really going to treat this any different, and we think we have a manageable plan for the rent reset, which we fully anticipated when we originally bought the building and now the date is here, and we'll deal with it. By I don't know, Steve you want to add anything to that?","Steven Durels","I don't know at this point of time, we're deep into design development for the repositioning of the space. Polo has the majority of the building. The building's moons are obviously great. It's one of the best locations of the city. It's pricing will be extremely competitive relative to other large blocks of space in that part of town. And we think we've got a very appealing capital program for the -- that we're designing for the lobby, elevator cabs and entrance for the building.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. And then second question, just with the recent passage today of the energy act that the city Council did to upgrade all the buildings you have that the commercial rent control discussion, Marc, as you know is still in discussions. Have you seen any change in the way people are underwriting Commercial Real Estate Banking or NOI profiles or anything that would go into how you guys look at buildings given what's been passed by City Hall today and what potentially could be passed?","Marc Holliday","Not our buildings because we've been -- what's being passed or potentially being passed by city Council was being proposed in any case, is something along the lines of what we've been doing for 10 years. And a lot of the major owners are on this, being good corporate citizens and making their buildings as green as possible and lowest carbon emission with very smart building management systems today and materials that are extraordinary at preserving electricity and conservation and if everything that goes wrong with it. So we -- I think 63% of our portfolio is LEED certified. We have something like 24 energy store levels. We're another -- again, in 2018, EPA, energy star partner of the year. We rank very high on a number of the rating scales that were published and shareholders see. So like the Bloomberg index and over one, we were on top of performance in our sector. So this is -- if you own older buildings that you haven't been investing in and the bill passes as contemplated, there'll be certainly some onetime cost to renovate the benefit of as your operating costs are lowered. But for buildings like ours that I think are already at the leading edge, they'll be some additional compliance, but we would have done it anyway because that's the path we're won. ","You've heard me many times about wanting to be a lead partner in the administration's goal of reducing energy emissions 80% by 2050, and we have our own internal goals that are more accelerated than that. So look, there are elements of the bill that, I think, badly do need to be massaged and revisited because one -- they've taken, in some cases, a 1 shoe fits all approach, which is an appropriate. So there're details of the bill that would help them get changed in the final hour to reflect more fully the input that we've had with the Urban Green Council and other owners have had, and we hope City Council doesn't turn a blind eye to some of those recommendations. But in the general spirit of having a framework within, which to continue down the path and making our buildings more sustainable, I feel like we're already on that path.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our next call comes from the line of Craig Mailman with KeyBanc Capital.","Craig Mailman","Just going back to the DPE book, you guys had a big origination quarter in 1Q, but another target for the year is to have to shrink it by $75 million. But could you maybe just give us how you guys see the trajectory for the balance -- for the rest of the year?","David Schonbraun","It's David. And I think there's any change in our guidance. We can't 100% control when we get past and when we find attractive originations. So I think you'll have probably, as you're seeing, higher front-end originations. And we expect to get more payouts starting in the next quarter and by the end of the year, will be at the level that we set.","Craig Mailman","And then just on the sales environment, you guys got 521 done. Just curious kind of what the depth of the buyer pool was there? And may be just update us on what you guys currently have in the market maybe what else market here in the near-term?","Andrew Mathias","Sure. It's Andrew. We had great demand for that asset, both foreign and domestic. There were -- we went to contract on that asset without a due diligence period, so there were still hard offer, which is kind of unique to the New York market and felt very strong about the process there. Second part of the question?","David Schonbraun","We have to the market?","Andrew Mathias","Out of the market. we're sort of , which we have discussed, we're evaluating next steps and watch as it will be more appropriate rollout next to meet the healthy demand.","Craig Mailman","That's helpful. What was the on 521?","Andrew Mathias","4.6. 4-6.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of [indiscernible].","Unidentified Analyst","UDP looking at 2020, I know you don't want to give guidance on that what you do have $1.3 billion of maturity next year and realizing there is a lot of expansion option in this portfolio, can you just discuss your ability or willingness to replenish this amount of capital?","Marc Holliday","Yes, look, I think we originate well over $1 billion a year, and we're very active working with existing borrowers on extending loans. So I think our average kind of life is usually somewhere between 2 and 3 years in general. So I don't -- maybe it's a little larger than it has been in some prior years. It's probably to provide some junk in your positions, but we're working with ours right now to do some extended deals and do given the historical pipeline we have, I think, we'll have no issue having the levels end up exactly where we want them to be.","Andrew Mathias","Yes, just -- I would also just add to that. There is always this kind of push poll we hear from shareholders, balance too high, can you keep the balance high, is the best too high, can you keep the balance high? So it's always confused us over the years and so we sort of managed low for that 10% mark and it's been a great business, obviously, hugely profitable business in this year. It's yielded a number of very interesting and compelling investment opportunities for us, which isn't always the case, but over the years we can probably rattle off a dozen or more properties that the DPE program led to direct ownership. ","So the programs great. I think we have a very good management of it. But in this sort of unique moment in time, as yields on this paper hovered around 9%, and I think the FFO yield on buying back our own stock is probably close to 7% or 8%, that the conversion of structured finance investment balances that we don't reinvest for any reason into either further debt paydown, but also on a leverage neutral basis into equity into the buying our own shares, is almost a push earnings wise. So it's a very interesting time for us where you mentioned that $1.3 billion of money coming back now, we expect to be very active in the originations front next year as is this year, but again, next year is next year, and we'll have to gauge the market and things could change in which case may be we're not. But with the stock where it is, and the years almost at parity, we certainly have a very interesting alternative if we choose for whatever reason not to put out the same levels into DPE next year.","Unidentified Analyst","And, Marc, you referenced in your prepared remarks, the public market will eventually recalibrate apartment market valuation. Can you just -- what catalyst will be for that? Because a lot of us thought the cutlass would have been selling assets and buy back your shares and it hasn't happened yet?","Marc Holliday","Well, I think, then we just continue, right? Take into its extreme, we've got assets worth what they're worth. I mean again, 521, we put out -- we talk about NAV at levels much higher than, I guess, $87 a share, much, much higher. The NAV underlies that and 521 went for us north of NAV. So again -- and that's just the same as 3 Columbus, and that's same as 1745 Broadway so when we sold those assets last year. So we have a high degree of confidence in being able to properly evaluate, or I would almost say conservatively value, our portfolio. And as we just keep realizing, it's not a theory, when you sell it, you actually get the cash at or above the end of NAV and then you buy back the shares at the very discounted value so that, taken to its limit, is almost self-fulfilling. So whether or not that'll be a catalyst for people to come in and buy the shares, we hope so and we would expect so. But if not, we certainly can continue our program of doing that and fully expect to because this is, as I've said before, probably one of the greatest investment opportunities we've seen in our 21 years as a public company.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of James Feldman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","James Feldman","Matt, it looks like on some of your portfolio metrics, you're trending ahead of where your full year guidance would be like same-store NOI, leasing spreads. Can you talk about how those Audi expect this trend for the rest of the year? And looks like you maintain your guidance, just what your thoughts are around that?","Matthew DiLiberto","Sure. Yes, if there are three months, actually across-the-board, we were ahead -- FFO, we were ahead of our expectations lives in volumes mark-to-market, same-store occupancy, same-store NOI growth, everything was ahead, but it's 3 months in, and so we're encouraged by that but not in a position to just at this point any of our guidance or goals that we set out back in December, but happy to see trending ahead, of course.","James Feldman","Okay. And then may be for Steve, can you talk more about just tenant discussions and what type of tenants you might think might be invested in 1 Madison and even for the last of One Vanderbilt?","Steven Durels","Sure. I'll start with One Vanderbilt. We've got active discussions with several tenants at One Vanderbilt that were all financial services related or in the case of one good sized called business services [indiscernible], but I would think, as we finish off the podium of the building and focus our attention towards the upper third of the house, it will almost be exclusively financial services. The signing of KPIs years. We've got another lease very well done with a private equity fund. And we're doing tours over there of the site tours and board presentations almost on a -- if not daily, every other day basis. So the momentum is really feeding on itself at this point. With regards to 1 Madison, the obvious tenant base there is Tammy. But having said that, we've received RFPs from a large financial services business. So I wouldn't be surprised for sort of a Fintech type tenant to be a likely candidate for that building. But we've been in front of may be 12 or 15 tenants at this point. People are really enthusiastic about the development plans for the building because it's bringing brand-new, large-scale, state-of-the-art product to a submarket where that opportunities does not exist and we're sitting right on top of the subway line across the street from the park. So it checks all the boxes whether your financial services or whether your time and type tenant. But that building, I think, is going to be wild success from a leasing perspective.","James Feldman","And you think it's a full billing user based on discussions?","Steven Durels","I think it will be large space users. So whether there's 4 billion or its 3,000, 4,000, 5,000 square-foot tenants and don't think it will be 1 of leading the way One Vanderbilt is going to finish off its leasing program.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank.","Derek Johnston","Just on pricing power and trends, could you separate out concessions and leasing trends with your interest portfolio versus the development, redeveloped assets and give us any significant differences that are notable?","Marc Holliday","Steve?","Steven Durels","Let's see, let's go sort of brought, that's a mouthful. That's a mouthful. Certainly on new construction and redeveloped buildings, which are good for the vast majority of our portfolio into the camp of the redeveloped buildings, there has been a slight to quality over the past year or two where there's been a lot of tenant demand for better quality buildings. Now we're the beneficiary of that because we have a portfolio, we've reinvested into the buildings and we're continuing on new acquisitions like 460 West 34th Street to make heavy capital investments in those buildings and as evidenced by the First Republic lease finding a strong tenant demand for it. As far as concessions go, there's this odd situation where new construction actually carries a slight TI savings. I don't think we've given a tenant at One Vanderbilt, but we example more than $95 a square foot with all the leasing we've done in that building. Yet you can go to other buildings and more commodity buildings where you sometimes have to spend more than $100 a foot in order to tenant paying a lot less and went. But I think that's a function of supply and demand where the best quality product is in high demand and TI doesn't have to be as [indiscernible] in that case.","Derek Johnston","Okay. Great. And just switching gears, any update on the Suburban markets and interest in the market portfolio that you have out there?","Andrew Mathias","Sure. It's Andrew. Isaacs is not with us today. The capital markets are significantly more challenging in the suburbs. We continue to work through the portfolio and generate decent leasing activity, including our recent renewal with Skadden, Arps at 360 Hamilton in White Plains, which is a big deal for us. But we're trying to be patient because we don't want to accept kind of distressed prices for the assets if you will. So we expect, over the course of the year, to execute some different strategies and wind up the resolution of the portfolio.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Nicholas Yulico with Scotiabank.","Nicholas Yulico","Just turning back to the stock buyback, Marc. You talked about willingness to do more over time if that's what's needed to do to close the valuation gap. But can you just remind us where you're at in terms of whether it is a tax issue or [indiscernible] that would prevent you from doing a larger buyback once this current program ends?","Marc Holliday","No, there's nothing that prevents us that I'm aware of, and Andrew you're in here, correct me. Somewhere that's a question of source of funds and we have source of funds that's completed tax efficient, partially tax efficient, in some cases, tax inefficient. But at the moment, we have a $2.5 billion authorization. I think, we're well $1.8 billion or so into that authorization, may be $1.150 billion. So at least for future, we have sources of revenue that we feel more than comfortable that can finance those acquisitions in the dirt neutral way to get to the 2.5. And then when we get there, really evaluate going for the but somebody on the call earlier referenced, I guess, take into its extreme, $2.3 billion of cash that we have invested in the DPE portfolio, which just -- I was just making the point coincidentally has a yield that's not to differentiated from the FFO deal on the repurchase. So clearly that is another formidable source that could go well beyond the $2.5 billion. So I mean -- we don't -- haven't taken it much further than that nor do we need to sitting here in 2019 with a plant that we think is expendable for the balance of this year and probably a fairly obvious plan for next year. But beyond that, we have other strategies. We have developed have not yet deployed, which would enable us to go further. But I don't want to get ahead of yourself. I think is -- our goal is to see that price reach it's natural level, which would be equal to the value of the assets. And if that happens, then they'll be probably know by the program. Once that occurred and certainly, we over the next year or two, we see that kind of increase occurs, it should.","Nicholas Yulico","Okay. Second question, you mentioned 30 Hudson earlier, I'd like to hear more. What do you thought about the pricing of that asset? And we heard it was around a 5 cap rate 20-year lease long-term credit deal. I was just wondering, is that indicative of what long-term credit deal would trade in the market? Or is the call that within the building does that affect valuation the?","Marc Holliday","I think, certainly, the -- it's a very large transaction, so makes the universe of buyers smaller given $2 billion of aggregate size. And I think given that it's not multitenanted and you have sort of this bullet exploration, if you will, the how the entire space expiring, it takes a certain type of buyer. So I think in terms of cap rate on 1745, we achieved around the same or were we inside of that?","Andrew Mathias","We were inside of it.","Marc Holliday","So I think between 4.5 and 5 cap, depending on the second stated, per foot where the rent stands versus market is a good estimate for sort of large single tenant, credit tenant leases in the city right now.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of [indiscernible].","Unidentified Analyst","As we look out over the next 2 or 3 years, are there any other kind of early renewal similar to Viacom that we should be taken into account from a cash NOI perspective?","Steven Durels","Well, we have several larger leases when you go out in time, but those are 3 to 5 years out. And most of them have significant market mark-to-market increase expectations. In the case, for instance, at 753rd Avenue, where we have advanced magazine and for general publication that's part of county national, all that space with subleased years ago to a variety of different subtenants. The prime lease in that case tenants was paying us of $50 a foot. So we're going to see a big uptick in rent on there, and we're already treating paper people on big of that fish. So I think there's going to be up a couple of big opportunities for us to have a very positive outcome.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And at One Vanderbilt, you guys had a goal for being 55% leased by the end of the year, you limit as it in Q3 of next year. I guess how long after delivering living should we expect the asset to be stabilized?","Andrew Mathias","Well, we put numbers out there I think at the last 2 or 3 December conferences, which has the full lease of scheduled right through the end, I don't have that at my fingertips. I thought it was 21% or 22%, but I don't remember. We'll have to get back to you on that because, unless Matthew, do you have it?","Matthew DiLiberto","I think it wraps up 21% you'd drop of the year starting at 23% on a full year basis.","Andrew Mathias","23% full year, I think, is stabilized. I think that's what was on that schedule.","Matthew DiLiberto","But for revenue recognition purposes, the standard is when the tenant space is ready for its intended use, you start to recognize revenue. But use our earliest we start earning space order tenants later this year. And the building opens in August of 2020 with space then three should be for its intend use. Summaries hundred 3 was sort of the base of the building revenue recognition as early as late 2020.","Steven Durels","Yes, quarter of the building, we turned over for tenants to start their construction by the summer of this year. So a year in advance of completing construction of the building and having a TCO in hand. So all those tenants will construct their space and move in probably within 30 to 60 days of the TCO days, which means we'll recognizing the revenue at that point.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Guinee with Stifel.","John Guinee","First, a quick one for Matthew DiLiberto. If you look at the right use of the asset, the operating lease is about $400 million of value. Do you think that's a good assessment of value to the ground lessor of that -- those ground leases?","Matthew DiLiberto","No. The simple answer is no. That is the new lease accounting for our ground leases finally coming out of the balance sheet. The decade's long odyssey that all the accounts that have gone through to get to this point. That is not an indication of value. You put it on the balance sheet using a discounted cash flows at some as young right, and you put on the balance sheet it just grosses are blessed from my abilities and there's no indication of value and it's probably of no value to the readers of the financial statement either.","Unidentified Analyst","Thought so. Okay. Thanks And\/or not sure who but if you look at 1 Madison, and if this is in your invested a Slide deck, just write me that way but watch their gross and net rents in place now? What your total net rentable square feet going to be when you redevelop this? And as you come -- of you created the development budget yet and figured out who is going to come in as the JV partner or how are you going to finance it?","Andrew Mathias","The question is one, Madison, yes? So on 1 Madison, what's in place now, the 1.1 million square feet, we're going to 1.5 million square feet as we develop. The in-place escalated rents about $82 a foot.","Matthew DiLiberto","Gross.","Andrew Mathias","Gross. And the redevelopment budget is probably the, what, actual construction cost alone order of magnitude $600 million plus or minus. That redevelopment budget, obviously, would that to include -- we'll work it up and have probably by this December's meeting everything with TI, marketing, deficit of scary. When we give a budget, I don't think everyone gives it this way, we give a fully loaded [indiscernible] interest, land at cost with whatever market JV partner comes in at, all the TI commissions and everything. But the actual physical work for completely reimagining the podium and adding the tower for which we've spent extraordinary amount of time over the past 12 months designing and estimating, we think will be somewhere in the range of about $600 million of hard cost.","John Guinee","And do you have a sense for what sort of growth or rent you have 28 for this to value creating?","Matthew DiLiberto","The answer is yes. We know up and down. I think we're going to sort of -- we're going to unveil it all in December as we did with One Vanderbilt because I think having pieces of it without the whole picture can lead people to confusion. So we want to give people a very good sense of those rents, which, obviously, are much higher than $82 gross if that's where the current escalator is. Even from the podium alone, little over the tower. The average rents for much higher price point than that, but still for a product that we expect to deliver in 2023, middle of '23, we're going to have a rent point there what we think will be among the most desirable buildings in all of Midtown South of the Downturn markets at rents that are being achieved daily today in 2019.","So we're not pricing in inflation. Doesn't mean we don't expect there to be inflation, it just means we are modeling this building based on off of a rental business that's based rate not one we hope to exist in 2023, although we hope it's higher. So this deal underwrites extremely well, like One Vanderbilt did. In some ways it's a little bit of an easier exercise because the building exists and it's a large-scale redevelopment at its space, but it's new construction, a very attractive construction, and it's tower, but it's not a high-rise tower, it's a medium sized tower. So the cost unless the timing is more efficient. And I think when we unveil the financial metrics both in terms of cost, returns, rental points, et cetera, the deal will certainly hold its own with any deal we have in the portfolio operator, I think that's the last question, yes?","Operator","Correct, sir.","Marc Holliday","Okay. Well, listen, we've finished 10 minutes early today, so tremendous. So thank you for your questions. It was a great quarter. We look forward to more of the same in Q2 and most importantly, everybody have a very happy holiday upcoming holiday season this weekend. Happy Easter and see you and speak to you soon.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

Earnings Conference Call. My name is Whitley, and I will be your operator for today. At least this time all participants are in listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder this call is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Ms. Heidi Gillette of SL Green Corp. Please proceed.","Heidi Gillette","Thank you, Whitley. Thank you all for joining us today.","At this time the company would like to remind all listeners that during the call, management may make forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ from the forward-looking statements that management may make today. Additional information regarding the factors that could cause such differences appear in the MD&A section of the company\u2019s Form 10-K and other reports filed by the company with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Also during today\u2019s conference call the company may discuss non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC Regulation G. The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to each non-GAAP financial measure discussed and the reconciliation of the differences between each non-GAAP financial measure and the comparable GAAP financial measure can be found on the company\u2019s website at www.slgreen.com, by selecting the press release regarding the company\u2019s second quarter 2014 earnings call.","Two items before turning the call over to Marc Holliday, Chief Executive Officer of SL Green Realty Corp. First off the company yesterday in its earnings release announced that it will host its annual institutional Investor Conference on Monday December 8th, 2014 in New York City. To be added to the conferences email distribution list or to pre-register please email slg2014@slgreen.com. Secondly I ask that those of those of you participating in the Q&A portion of the call please limit your questions to two per person.","Thank you. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Marc Holliday. Please go ahead Marc.","Marc Holliday","Okay. Thank you, Heidi, and good afternoon, and thank you dialing in today. Continuing on the heels of our strong first quarter showing we have now completed an excellent second quarter which is reflective of the vibrant New York City economy, strengthening commercial office market and successful execution of our strategic plan. The foundation of our success begins with the strong New York City economy and expanding jobs market.","The New York City seems like it may be on track to add approximately 100,000 private sector jobs for the year with 50,000 jobs already created through the second quarter. Office using employment one of the key statistics for our industry also showed significant gains with almost 10,000 jobs added primarily in finance and professional business services. So clearly a bit of turnaround and departure from last couple of years. If this trend continuous we would be on track for an approximate 100 basis points reduction in the vacancy rate for calendar year 2014 and I estimate that based upon approximately 20,000 jobs a 200 square feet per job of net absorption.","Further evidence of this employment activity can be seen in our pipeline of lease transactions. Our current leasing pipeline has grown to 1.6 million square feet with approximately half of those deals out for signatures or pending and another 800,000 square feet in the term sheet stage. This 1.6 million square feet being negotiated, represented about a 200,000 square foot increase to the statistics I gave you on the last quarter we call and that\u2019s also net of the approximately 275,000 square feet we leased during the quarter and another 50,000 some odd square feet that was leased in the first three weeks of this current quarter.","To-date we have signed up approximately 900,000 square feet of Manhattan office leases with an expectation that we will convert out of 1.6 million square feet another 1.1 million square feet of that pipeline into signed deals over the remaining quarters to hit our ambitious target for the year of 2 million square feet of leasing over the next, I would say five months.","We have been \u2013 we have experience an uptick in our Suburban portfolio as well. Those leasing stats show occupancy climbing to almost 83% portfolio wide and positive leasing spread of about 3.2% mark-to-market on replacement leases. So this continues a trend that we have highlighted over the past four or five quarters and we hope that that\u2019s trend that will continue and our projections at the moment for the remainder of the year are showing such.","One of the hallmarks of this company and something that was very evident in the press release you read last night or this morning is our willingness to sell mature properties and non-core assets in order to take advantage of favorable market conditions like we have at this moment and we demonstrate the success of our value add approach to investing. So far this year we have executed on five separate sales transactions involving a total of $1 billion of gross consideration with even more under consideration for the balance of the year.","Excluding 673 First Avenue which was an original IPO asset these transactions had holding periods ranging from two years to seven years with a weighted average of approximately 4.7 years. So you can see that the game plan that we execute on these value add assets generally buy, improve reposition and lease and then try and convert within the three to five year window those sales into capital gains clearly held true with four of those five assets and the returns exceeded about 25% on those four assets on a $1 billion of gross sales and total profits approaching $300 million.","So this is very much in line with our previous results on prior assets sales with the bulk of those asset sales recurring at the better part of the last cycle of five or six or seven. I think at this point we probably sold more assets then most of our nearest competitors own. So it is a demonstration of our \u2013 even at 28 million-29 million square feet owned we have you know we have shown over luck to grow for market share sake but rather continue to award our shareholders with the kind of profits that can be achieved when capital rates go to a 4% to 5% level where they are now and there is an incredible demand for vacancy. So you should expect that to continue.","Many analyst that we\u2019ve spoken in the past 24 or maybe 18 hours have expressed to us that these sale prices have far exceeded what was been carried in their respective NAV models. So hopefully these sales have the added benefit of illuminating the substantial embedded value in our portfolio and the voracious demand for well-located and well positioned commercial Manhattan assets.","We have sort of put an exclamation mark behind the fact that we have these two business buy, improve and hold and buy, improve and sell and in the non-core sale portfolio we do generate these capital gains, they are fairly recurring to greater or lesser degrees over time. And in the reports we see that there is this distinction made between underlying recurring earnings and capital gains which has taken on the nomenclature of noise. The reality is capital gains is nothing more than the monetization of those future earnings. And it\u2019s pretty easy to get your hands around whenever we sell an asset what the earnings diminution is from the sale of the asset relative to the price we achieved. And whenever the cap rate is below the earnings contribution rate that\u2019s an accretive sale and that\u2019s something that\u2019s hugely beneficial to our shareholders.","So I think if you look at most if not all of the sale we achieved, they\u2019ve generally been local sales that are accretive to NAV it\u2019s not just the monetization for monetization sake but it\u2019s where we feel that we are getting a price that exceeds the earnings contribution of that asset going forward. And I think that rather than trying to dial out cap gains to get to core earnings we would encourage people to look at both of those as highly rewarding and almost the capital gains in some sense are more important because it is \u2013 it takes the mystery out of what something is worth when you have the market trade and these sales were all done at levels that I think are very supportive of asset pricing for our portfolio and assets in the city market wide at levels that probably exceed where many people have those levels pegged.","So we are happy to have gotten those done. There is certainly more to come. Andrew is going to expand a little bit further on those sales with some details but also talk about our active acquisition campaign that\u2019s been going on as well, because as we\u2019ve been selling we\u2019ve also been buying. And not only identifying very good 1031 receivers but identifying basically the new product that we will be looking in some cases to monetize in three to five years from now and hopefully generate these similar kinds of gains.","So with that said let turn it over to Andrew.","Andrew Mathias","Thanks Marc. As I sales we announced yesterday that Marc mentioned the investment sales market continues to take material steps forward. The Third Avenue site was purchased in December of 2012 and following a frantic 18 months of deal making, via air rights purchases, lot mergers and proceed sharing agreements lo and behold the company was able to turn a $32 million profit in those 18 months. Major credit to Managing Director, [Brad Herschenfeld] who led the charge on this investment.","The 2 Herald sale bring us to conclusion a highly successful investment originated in 2007. One can\u2019t use highly successful when describing too many 2007 investments in the real estate industry, but this structure which stood the test of time in the real estate cycle and returned a cash IRR to SL Green of over 17% on what is a senior fixed income position which would normally earn 6% to 7% as levered. Our returns on this investment almost tripled those normalized returns.","At 180 Broadway another deal purchased in 2007 where we created an enormous value vacating several buildings and constructing a state of the art dormitory for Pace University and investment grade retail box at the base. We sold the building for 4.3% cap rate and it\u2019s easy to see in these kind of numbers how demand for high quality fixed income real estate is accelerating in the Manhattan market. Across this backdrop of our individual transactions I would expect to see significant market transaction volume continue in to the second half.","In the face of all this activity we continue to pick our spots on the acquisition front. We announced three new retail deals at NAREIT, before NAREIT in June as demand for retail properties continues to hit new heights we continue to scour the market for off market deals where we can get better than market returns and take advantage of growing retail rents. And with an interesting pipeline on the office front and the residential front for the balance of the year we would expect acquisition to top $1 billion this year making it one of our most active years in terms of acquisition in the last couple of years. We are actively evaluating the next potential asset sale candidates as well as we continue to view this market as an excellent time to monetize as well as to make new investments.","The structure finance program was on track with our guidance and expectations with several scheduled pay offs occurring in the quarter and new originations slightly more than offsetting those pay-offs. Yields in that portfolio are holding steady and we have a very high quality pipeline in that portfolio as well and would expect to announce some exciting new deals in August. Structured finance continues to be an important part of our overall strategy.","We look forward to a very active second half of the year and with that I guess we\u2019d like to open it for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Bank of America. Please proceed.","James Feldman \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you. And good afternoon. I was hoping you guys could talk a little bit more about your outlook for Midtown. We know of leases that are going to be moving out either go Downtown or the west side. I think if you talk to brokers they\u2019ll say they are not expecting really much in terms of rent growth and even minimal net absorption. I am curious what you guys are seeing from your perspective in thinking about your business over the next 12 to 18 months?","Marc Holliday","Well, we are not seeing that Jamie. So I don\u2019t know exactly which brokers that\u2019s coming from. I think the activity and statistics prove otherwise. We\u2019ve got, we are projecting still as we sit here over the next five months occupancy gain mark to market gain, we have tremendous activity. Steve Durels can kind of walk you through properties where in Midtown where we have vacancies like I don\u2019t know 280 Parks, 600 West, [inaudible] 3, 8 and 7, 3 Columbus all of which have lot of activity. So I\u2019d say anyone that\u2019s describing the market as stagnant is wrong, or off. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s opinion, I think that\u2019s factually incorrect.","If they\u2019re talking about what they are projecting for the future I can\u2019t speak to that. But if they\u2019re talking about what is taking place now, I\u2019d say we have 900,000 square feet leased to date, a 1.6 million in pipe. And we are projecting a 100 basis point pick up in occupancy between now and end of year. Our rents I think are up 13% or 14% mark-to-market over the first six months. So I put that in one of the better markets we\u2019ve operated in since our IPO in \u201897. There has been better markets but there has been many that have been worse. So I\u2019d put this in the top third of those markets. And we think it\u2019s getting stronger for the reasons I tried to set forth at the outset with respect to the job growth we are seeing and increased demand in Midtown.","Steve, you can \u2013 why don\u2019t you add to that your thoughts.","Steven Durels","Sure. Just to add a little more color to it. Of the 800,000 square feet of leases that we have out 740,000 square feet of that are Midtown deals which certainly speaks to velocity that we are seeing within our portfolio. And I would point you to the end of last year where we got lot of questions and there was lot of reporting about Midtown Grand Central Terminal, 6th Avenue in particular about how everybody was leaving and there was trouble on the horizon. And in reality what we\u2019ve seen since the fourth quarter last year through all of this year, is that there have been a number of very large deals done in Midtown particularly on 6th Avenue, White and Case, [Neuberger Burban] being very good examples of that, where it is a cyclical market and each of these submarkets are going through changes right now. And as much as Downtown is the beneficiary of those tenants who are price sensitive, whose businesses are low margin businesses, than that brings us to the Downtown market. But they are only going Downtown because rents are stable to rising in Midtown. And while there is a big rent difference between Midtown and Downtown that creates market relief. And we are seeing good velocity throughout the portfolio. So I think we all remain very bullish on the Midtown market.","James Feldman \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch","And I guess Steve, while we have you on, what are your thoughts as we do start to see some of these larger vacancies in the market? How do you think that plays out?","Steven Durels","Well, I mean give me a specific concern.","James Feldman \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch","Right on\u2026","Steven Durels","Yeah. So [Condinas] has got obviously time left while there are out shopping in that space, they have got a very heavy rent that they are looking for on this space, a rent that\u2019s substantially above what Condinass is vacating, for the simple reason that the big blocks in Manhattan and in Midtown in particular are in fairly short supply. But I think if you ask the \u2013 who own that building, they are seeing a lot of velocity in their portfolio, they have time on their side and quite frankly they are kind of marketing off the backs of the port who is paying the rent on the Condinas space after Condi moves Downtown.","So they are confident that there is going to be strong demand and it\u2019s going to likely come from probably one of two industries. It will be either law firms or it will be financial services because those have been the big drivers for the Midtown leasing. The other one that people throw around is the Time Warner and again that\u2019s so far off in the future, it\u2019s years off in the future as to not be competitive against anything that \u2013 certainly for our portfolio that we\u2019re competing against.","James Feldman \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then secondly can you talk a little bit more about 7-19-7 what do you guys envision there in cost?","Marc Holliday","7-19-7.","Andrew Mathias","All right. The intention is to vacate the building take it down and build a retail box similar to what we\u2019ve done on several other corners in Time Square. So I mean, it\u2019s a very small site, it will be a single tenant occupant that we\u2019re looking for and I would expect cost there to be in the neighborhood of $30 million or so of construction.","James Feldman \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John W. Guinee with Stifel. Please proceed.","John Guinee \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Company","Great. All right thank you very much. Marc or Andrew how should we look at the valuation on the City building 388-390 Greenwich, how you are guys thinking that plays out?","Marc Holliday","Well, I mean in terms of yeah, we don\u2019t do valuations per se let me start with that. So we don\u2019t put valuations on the properties and hang them out there. With that said we would look at this as I think the rental contribution as it currently sits, I think is about a $150 million net rent. So and yeah we\u2019ve got probably remaining maybe $250 million or so of capital between now and 2017 or 2018 that we\u2019re going to put into the building and then there is either an option that city may or may not exercise after that I think sometime between \u201817 and \u201820 or \u201821 which if exercised the value will be capped at $2 billion which I don\u2019t have the number \u2013 we did this on a protocol John but it produced double-digit kind of returns from inception back in 2007, which again Andrew sort of highlighted as making big profits and double-digit returns on 2007 deals are few and far between.","We obviously did it on 2 Herald and 180 Broadway and we would do it on 388 if they hit the option. If they don\u2019t hit the option then you can apply whatever cap you want to apply to that rent and get to whatever value that would bring to you which would likely be at least $2 billion, possibly more. But that sort of depends on A, what is the rent then because it is subject to a CPI adjustment annually. So we can\u2019t sit here today and tell you what that rent would be in \u201817 or \u201818 it\u2019s dependent on CPI.","And two, it depends on what cap rate is at that point in time. But certainly in today\u2019s world I think that\u2019s every bit of a five cap today not less.","John Guinee \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Company","And then a second Herald Square is to me just sort of a fascinating deal. Looks to me like you sold your fee or your land position for a shade over a $1,000 or right about a $1,000 per net rentable square foot for the building. A couple of questions what\u2019s the buyers plan for that building or what\u2019s their plan for the fee position or the land position. And then two what kind of gain would you \u2013 what kind of tax gain you would have on that and how would you \u2013 are you able to roll that sort of gain into another asset on a 1031 basis?","Marc Holliday","I\u2019ll answer the first part and I\u2019ll leave Matt to answer the second part, John. Buyer is a life insurance company and the tenant under the lease does have an option to buy that fee position in 2027 which we sort of highly expect that they will exercise that option as does the buyer. So the buyer is basically looking at it for the fixed income stream it will produce between now and 2027 and you are right on the square footage there, the building is around 365,000 rentable square feet. So Matt?","Matthew Diliberto","And John to the tax side of the things yes we do the gain will be significant but we certainly have the ability to roll that into a 1031.","John Guinee \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Company","Thank you very expect.","Marc Holliday","Yeah we expect to fully have that deck shelved is our current planning.","John Guinee \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Company","All right thank you.","Marc Holliday","Thank you John.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Vincent Chao \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Hi good afternoon everyone. Just curious if you can maybe elaborate a little bit more on the additional assets sales which you are contemplating, maybe just order of magnitude what kind of size are we talking about and given your comments about suburban markets picking up here over last couple of quarters if there\u2019s any potential that, that would be included?","Marc Holliday","The sales we were referring to at the outset are sales of additional Manhattan assets. They would likely be assets that we consider non-core which I think if you look at the five we sold this year and I think last year we did one court and a couple of others that there is a consistent theme there which if you look at remains in the portfolio, you can kind of pick through things where we stabilize non-core assets, we make good trading candidates versus other kinds of core [fortress] type buildings that we think there\u2019s a whole another round of profit opportunity as we will lease it there in hopefully double-digit mark-to-market environment that\u2019s highly compelling.","So order of magnitude don\u2019t really have a number on it. Let\u2019s say over the next 12 months another few hundred million dollars worth of sales growth at least. So whether any or all of that concludes in the balance of this year, who knows because there is nothing that we\u2019re actively underway on and these sales typically take four to six months. So more likely than not they are deals that would be very end of this year or first quarter of next year.","But that was \u2013 that\u2019s a rough description of the kind of things we\u2019ll be looking at. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re looking at another billion dollars per se but 300 million plus is certainly on the table.","Vincent Chao \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay and on the suburban side, is that perhaps conditions improving to the point where that might more be part of the \u2013 this story?","Marc Holliday","I mean the answer is yes, it\u2019s in that direction. But I think those assets are most ripe when you get the occupancy levels that are probably closer to 88%, 90%. I think that\u2019s where we can probably get our best execution. And right now we\u2019re around 83% and I think we\u2019ll end the year hopefully at 84%. So it\u2019s strengthening in the right direction. There may be individual assets that fall into that category ones we would consider no different than having an asset for sale. But I think as I said on the last call getting closer to a market where we can look to certain of those assets as contributors to equity and liquidity for new deals but maybe not just yet.","Vincent Chao \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ross Nussbaum with UBS. Please proceed.","Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS","Hi good afternoon guys. Marc are you surprised positively to the strength of what\u2019s been going on in the New York Street retail scene particularly in the revenue in the quarter?","Marc Holliday","I think the rents, no, the rents have been consistent, I think the number of participants who are willing to pay kind of extraordinary prices and price per square foot for grade level retail has surprised me. It was over the years the domain of a new and now there is a number of other new entrants to the market that is creating more pricing pressure which is flattering our existing portfolio, makes it harder to add to that. With that said I think we\u2019ve done about five or six deals since December so we are still very active but there is \u2013 the relationship between net rent to price is really no different than we see in the office markets. These deals are traditionally deals that are bought at whatever cap rate it could be 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, cap rates going in but we deploy then to stabilize call it 6% to 7% or 6% to 7.5% range which is not too dissimilar you know from where we are.","I just find that people are making greater leaps of faith in the ability to that market happen quickly and significant buy out monies involved, it is a little more risk in executing our plan but the rewards as you have seen are pound for pound far greater than we are experiencing with office right now. Office rents we are talking about 10% mark to market. These retail assets you are talking about 200% to 300% market to market. So there it\u2019s night and day in terms of opportunity profile and people are paying extraordinary process for that we are taking response hopefully wisely and so far it\u2019s proven to be a major contributor for the firm. We are going to stay active there and we do have a pipeline of retail properties for the balance of this year already identified.","So right now it\u2019s one of the great pieces of our overall program is that retail real estate platform.","Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS","Okay. I appreciate that. Second question is on your structured finance book. There was a footnote there that was trying to figure out which is you reclassified just under $100 million of a then preferred to equity investment you guys did in the first quarter into unconsolidated joint venture. So I am just curious for some color around what prompted that what\u2019s was that?","Matthew Diliberto","So it\u2019s Matt that\u2019s accounting and only accounting. There is an equity kicker feature in that deal which we do often get in preferred equity positions, that is structured in such a way that it falls in to a virtual no man\u2019s land of accounting rules and for that simple reason it\u2019s put into a JV category versus the consolidated and preferred equity book. It doesn\u2019t affect the income stream, it doesn\u2019t affect the income it will get on a go forward basis for the term or anything else, it\u2019s simply an accounting treatment.","Marc Holliday","But it is what we would otherwise characterize as a piece of structure equity that\u2019s right. Structured finance like mezzanine preferred equity with terms and you know remedies and all the rest it just happened to be in the equity books we got.","Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS","Okay. Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of [Brenon Maron with Wells Fargo]. Please proceed.","Unidentified Analyst Thanks, good afternoon. Hey Matt another really strong quarter in terms of bottom line FFO. Did you guys contemplate revisiting the guidance given how strong it\u2019s been in the first half of the year, I know you raised after last quarter and if not what should we sort of think about is some of the things that would bring the run rate down pretty significantly in the back half of the year to kind of get where your current guidance midpoint stands?","Matthew Diliberto","So we certainly look at where we think we are going to close out the year all the time so we did have to close the quarter as well but I think we are comfortable where we sit now, we are trending within the guidance range and then certainly could see ways to get above that. But that said we are always evaluating things we never sit still. There could be asset sales which Marc just touched on a little while ago there may be other opportunities to source capital. The refinancing market is strong and we always evaluate opportunities to accretively refinance in place mortgages or other corporate financing sometimes those involve taking charges.","So that\u2019s potentially on the table for the rest of the year and the sales that we consummated which weren\u2019t necessarily a factor in updating our guidance into the first quarter now play in. So deals like 2 Heralds where we will have effect on earnings as well. So I think as we\u2019ve said today while there could be in and outs the rest of the year we feel comfortable leaving our guidance as is at 590 to 596.","Marc Holliday","Yeah with that said I think we have a feeling where we sit now that the guidance would be at the higher end of the range possibly even little in excess but\u2026","Matthew Diliberto","Somebody else was before for about like volumetric sales. So sales by one way, earnings momentum price the other and we are finding the right balance of the two but for the moment we are just going to leave where it is.","Unidentified Analyst","I understood. Makes sense. As you guys highlighted really great execution on three sales that you announced last night, just when I was kind of doing the back of the envelope map net proceeds of $240 million that seemed I was getting a number that seemed it will be a little bit higher than that based on the gross sales proceeds and that and your interest. Was there any promote fees that were due to any of your partners or anything like that that would cause the net proceeds to be down relative to what I would have thought.","Matthew Diliberto","It\u2019s Matt there is one component that maybe throwing numbers. We don\u2019t have any promotes due to anybody else we don\u2019t have those in any JV so I\u2019ll make that point. There is in place debt that will need to be decreased and that will be our cost and so that comes off the top as well.","Unidentified Analyst Okay, so what was your \u2013 what were magnitude of differential?","Matthew Diliberto","I think it was around 25 million or something like I think I estimated\u2026","Marc Holliday","That\u2019s exactly the amount.","Unidentified Analyst","That\u2019s great. That makes sense. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of [Alexander Gofarb] with Sandler O\u2019Neil.","Unidentified Analyst","Good afternoon. Just some quick questions here. As you guys look at the investment market for doing more stuff. Can you just talk a little if you are seeing anything on the residential side that maybe of interest or maybe that market has just gotten too pricy and second the weather Brooklyn is looking more attractive or if there are some structural things, developmental things that need to go on downtown before you get a lot more activity in that market.","Marc Holliday","Well on residential we are looking a lot of opportunities now. We see a lot of good opportunities and we I would say almost certainly will convert on some between now and year end. So yeah it is a competitive market but it\u2019s been a profitable one for us so far and we expect to kind of proceed at the pace the we\u2019ve been proceeding, and we\u2019ve been guiding people too and I think towards from now to year end that we will have maybe one or two deals to announce there. As to Brooklyn, Matt\u2026","Matthew Diliberto","We had a lot of success at the Williamsburg property where we just signed up a term sheet to make loan on other property in Brooklyn and we are evaluating other opportunities as we learn the different markets. There is explosive growth a lot of rental growth and value growth going out there. So we are certainly actively looking and trying to identify other opportunities out there.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And then the second question for Steve. Down at 180 Maiden, you just give us a sense for where you thought rents would be when you guys originally underwrote the building when you required it and where rents are today where you think you actually signed deals just given the strength in rebound downtown, just curious how much it\u2019s moved on your underwriting?","Steven Durels","Well we underwrote the building in the $44 depending on where you are in the property top to bottom and a lot of the activity \u2013 there has been two sides of the market down there. There has been a lot of big deals going on the west side, there has been a lot of good sized deals in small traffic on the east side but the east side has generally been at the lower price point. The best news of all is the low price product has largely been taken off the market at this point and I think the market is on our side so that\u2019s, we are going to, we will see the lift in our pricing compared to underwrites but I think it\u2019s got \u2013 we got to get some momentum going first. We got one deal up right now that right on our underwrite numbers, we are getting a lot of tour activity in the building.","I would say two-third maybe more of the tenants are midtown, midtown south tenants and the profile of the type of tenants which are creative, marketing, information technology type of tenants which is exactly who we you know anticipated to the building as a result of our redevelopment plan and is exactly what we were shooting for when we underwrote the acquisition. That\u2019s we are seeing confidence that as we are further along with the construction we are going to start to see some good velocity down there.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jordan Saddler with Keybanc Markets. Please proceed.","Jordan Saddler \u2013 Keybanc Markets","Hi. Good morning. Good afternoon, rather sorry. I\u2019m curious thinking back to the retail question a little bit that Ross was asking about. It seems to some extent the number of players have come in to the space and the valuations it\u2019s kind of have changed your thinking somewhat on the underwriting of the space and I am just curious as you think about it, does it change the potential hold period of these assets or are they still \u2013 is there still tremendous value or there is really no change just curious?","Matthew Diliberto","We just I mean we just announced the sale of lot of retail assets. So we sold assets on 34 Street, we sold 747 Madison, we sold Third Avenue which was a retail and we sold 747 Madison. So that should give a pretty clear indication of the fact that we are going to take advantage of what we see is a very aggressive bid for retail out there for sure.","Marc Holliday","Otherwise said we have sold more retail than probably anybody this year. So we are, we like this market to sell into but there are \u2013 we are looking to buy value add in retail and in office and particularly with retail which is less core than office sell for capital gain which these kind of cap rates we think it\u2019s great.","So I mean if your question is does competition change our underwriting, the answer was no. It doesn\u2019t change All that changes the underwriting really is, is cost of capital that may indirectly be linked to what you are talking about and\/or demand for space which is reflect in west. You know so whether there is three people we were just ambitious on these three or four \u2013 less participants as today the only thing with more market participants just makes it harder to find those assets. If they go outside of our underwriting we pass the deal. So it doesn\u2019t change our underwriting. We don\u2019t stretch to make the deal. A good example of that I think was 625 Madison which was largely a fee driven, I am sorry retail-driven exercise if you will which went beyond or well beyond our parameters this year so we passed. I mean that\u2019s the way it is","There are other deals as probably six deals that we bought this year where they felt right within the parameters and we bought them but I\u2019d say that underwriting if you will a way we are modeling the deals sort of without regard to what other people pay other than if that drives the cap rate down low enough we\u2019re going to sell which we have.","Jordan Saddler \u2013 Keybanc Markets","Yeah I mean I was thinking are you maybe a little bit better for sale today than you would have thought at the beginning of the year your investor day outlook where you thought you were maybe a little bit better for buy as a result of just valuations going on roughly?","Marc Holliday","No, I wouldn\u2019t come off the call thinking there are all great opportunities in the retail sector, I think there are \u2013 those five deals we bought I look at each of them as a great opportunity. So my guess is I don\u2019t have the numbers in front of me probably exceeded our December goal already here we are in July, right I mean those are \u2013 what was our math, or do you have that Andy. We set out some retail acquisition target I believe and my guess is we\u2019ve exceeded that, $500 million between resi and retail so yes I think we have exceeded that entry I guess, likely yes and there\u2019s more pipeline. So it\u2019s when you have an abundance of low price capital in certain sub-markets, extremely strong rents that\u2019s a great market. That\u2019s a great opportunity set so we\u2019re having participants but if it folds outside the balance of targeted returns then we pass.","But we still found ways to make our spots. A lot of those deals SL OP unit, components, and again that\u2019s a differentiating factor which I\u2019m not sure everybody, I hope everybody on the call gets credit to which is the SL Green OP Unit currency has been utilized to a very high degree as something that\u2019s very attractive and you unique for sellers of retail and office product and residential product.","Jordan Saddler \u2013 Keybanc Markets","And then lastly, any color you can offer on 5th Avenue retail assemblies?","Marc Holliday","No change in status there yet.","Jordan Saddler \u2013 Keybanc Markets","Okay do we know when that\u2019s or how long that will, the redevelopment will take place over or is it just open ended at this point?","Marc Holliday","It\u2019s open end I mean it\u2019s in process.","Jordan Saddler \u2013 Keybanc Markets","Okay alright thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman with Citi. Please proceed.","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup","Yeah good afternoon. Just thinking about now the development and the redevelopment pool, page 35 of 3.8 million square feet now that you\u2019ve rolled 180 and [inaudible] 53rd in there, almost 3 billion gross of real estate, how should we think about I guess additional funding that would come as you redevelop those projects, number one. Number two, the NOI effectively perhaps dipping before it gets any better. It\u2019s obviously much bigger part of the company, these assets at this point, so maybe talk about certain goals that you have or the benchmark that we\u2019ve to think about for it?","Matthew Diliberto","Well let me answer the first part with respect to capital some of these projects that have been moved in may have significant value comprising the three point whatever billion of assets that you identified or identified on the page, but with respect to the capital going into those deals there they are not that significant by our standards.","The redevelopment at 280 Park is largely finished. Although that probably is still in redevelopment place we\u2019ll come out at some point in not too distant future. 180 Maiden is underway but the redevelopment there is order of magnitude maybe $60 million plus or minus of which we\u2019re 50%. So it\u2019s we have enough liquidity in flow for that kind of project. That\u2019s not a significant kind of capital planning project and the same is sort of true of [inaudible] 53rd.","So I think when you talking about development properties where we have \u2013 you have to have significant and well thought out funding plans it\u2019s 1 Vanderbill. I mean I mean that\u2019s it. The rest are I would I would almost manage out of cash flow you know I am saying for the bulk of other projects but 1 Vanderbill is the kind of project that we think long and hard about and as we get closer to construction date and that would after we get full approvals because we currently embarking on the new build process so you got first things first we get approvals in 2015 and then embark by then we will have a capital plan. We will be able to kind of walk you through that but at this point there is no capital, no significant capital for 2014 on that project.","So that\u2019s not a current issue. No, it is something we are we are putting a lot of effort behind and next year we will be putting a lot of effort behind.","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup","Alright. And then just","Marc Holliday","Michael just to clarify the $3 billion you are looking at I think that\u2019s a gross value we own 50% of the major development there. So for our balance sheet it\u2019s not $3 million it\u2019s significantly less than that.","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup","Yeah. And just thinking about the 3.5% cash combined same store NOI in the quarter. What is the associated occupancy, same store occupancy that ties to that 3.5 and you know what would it be without sort of 3 Columbus, 100 Church and 180 Broadway which obviously boosted the overall pool? I\u2019m just trying to distinguish between the two.","Marc Holliday","The occupancy that ties to that pool Michael is 949 which is the same store occupancy we reported inclusive of the signed, as yet to be commenced leases. The pool is consistent what we guided to in December at the Investor Conference and the projection of 3% to 4% cash NOI growth is based on that pool. Clearly 3 Columbus as it\u2019s getting further leased up is contributing significantly to that. It started last year. It\u2019s building this year. What it is without those three properties I just don\u2019t have the numbers that precisely.","So, you know the other properties not just other three properties are obviously contributing we got occupancy pick-ups in the Manhattan portfolio last year, we\u2019re growing that occupancy again by an expectation of 150 basis points. So that alone will drive organic growth. I just don\u2019t have at in my fingertips would it be without three specific properties that you mentioned here.","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup","The 94 is just a consolidated not the total so, well can follow-up offline, fine.","Marc Holliday","949 is inclusive of JVs.","Matthew Diliberto","So 949 is combined.","Marc Holliday","Is combined, right.","Matthew Diliberto","Want to make that clear before we hop off this. If that\u2019s not consolidated that is combined.","Marc Holliday","That is absolutely, right.","Matthew Diliberto","Combined same store?","Marc Holliday","Correct.","Matthew Diliberto","Not consolidated.","Marc Holliday","Correct.","Matthew Diliberto","So, I think that\u2019s the most accurate number that we have but we can \u2013","Marc Holliday","Yeah. And that\u2019s what we guide towards.","Matthew Diliberto","Certainly we can take it offline. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with ISI Group. Please proceed.","Steve Sakwa \u2013 ISI Group","Thanks. Just as it relates to street retail, are you guys looking outside of Manhattan I mean to the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queen\u2019s make any sense just wanted your thoughts on that.","Marc Holliday","Yeah, we did our Williamsburg residential project started out we just bought the retail counter there and a had lot of success, leased up to HSBC and Walgreen so, we down a couple of other sites in the Burrows and are looking at additional sites in high traffic areas for sure.","Steve Sakwa \u2013 ISI Group","Just curious how kind of returns and pricing maybe compare in competition?","Marc Holliday","Competition is certainly less, returns are higher although as you get to the very high traffic areas there is increase in competition as people get sort of chased on Manhattan.","Steve Sakwa \u2013 ISI Group","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Knott of Green Street Advisors. Please proceed.","Michael Knott \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Hey, guys I agree with you optimistic take on Midtown but just curious if you comment on the signed leasing volume and seemed a little low I am just curious did that surprise you in any way or was there something that maybe fell out or just curious your thoughts on that. And if there is any impact to any of your full year goals?","Marc Holliday","No, I mentioned earlier that we are still on $2 million feet, it didn\u2019t surprise us but for maybe one or two deals that will get done early Q3 and late Q2.","Michael Knott \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Okay.

Our existing portfolio is doing great. We opened leasing at 1080 Amsterdam which is a big redevelopment.

I'll now turn the call over to Marc Holliday. Please go ahead, Marc.","Marc Holliday","Okay. Thank you to everyone for joining us for SL Green's Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. Before we open the line to questions, I wanted to briefly note some of the important things that have occurred since our Investor Day in December and update our outlook for 2018. First, as context for today's discussion, let's go back to our Investor Day to set the scene. In December, we presented strong 2017 company operating performance underscored by having met the majority of our stretch goals, and we presented an optimistic outlook for 2018. We talked about the strong underlying fundamentals of the New York City economy, demand for office space exceeding new commercial development pipeline and SL Green's asset value compared to stock price driving our strategy to continue and even increase the share buyback program we've put in place last year.","Everything that has happened in the ensuing 7 weeks has only reinforced our outlook on the market and the company moving into 2018. This week, the city of New York released its preliminary end-of-year jobs numbers for 2017, and the news continues to be quite good. The private sector added 70,000 total new jobs in 2017, with office-using jobs up by 25,000. Job growth exceeded expectations from this time last year with strong acceleration in the fourth quarter and notable growth in the FIRE sector, which accounted for half of those new office-using jobs. We expect similar positive news when the year-end tourism numbers are tallied and released, confirming that New York City is still a magnet for domestic and foreign visitors. ","The bottom line is that New York City's economy, the bedrock of our business, continues to thrive. And as I noted at our Investor Day, the high level of office-using job growth will continue to provide sufficient demand for new space that outstrips the new construction supply coming online. This is especially true as we've seen the densification of office space begin to plateau and efficiencies reach their natural limits, evidenced by the number of tenants now looking for expansion space and planning for growth.","For SL Green, there are also a number of positive indicators and opportunities that have emerged over the past 7 weeks that are still too early to quantify but that lead us to be even more optimistic about what lies ahead in 2018. Asset pricing is holding up for well-located office properties. There is an enormous amount of institutional capital looking for deals in Manhattan. Also, there is not a lot of product in the market right now for 100% asset acquisitions, creating somewhat of a scarcity value for good investment opportunities. ","Most deals that you see in the market right now are for partial, passive, LP, minority interest capital. We've done some of those deals, and you'll see more getting done in 2018. But for investors who want full building control, full building capitalization, there really are not that many good opportunities in the market. Now we expect more to come, but we expect it to be balanced with the amount of debt and equity capital that is in the market for those kinds of transactions. ","So while overall transaction volumes may continue at 2017 levels, supply being down and demand for product is high, I expect prices to remain stable throughout the year. And I think even the most recent deals that have been announced, 1700 Broadway, the deal at One Liberty, it's all further evidence of a very balanced market with a lot of demand being met by good asset pricing. We will, of course, continue to take advantage of this market dynamic by selling mature assets and joint venturing value-add assets in order to generate proceeds for reinvestment and leverage neutral stock buyback. ","We are not fearful of the recent modest increase in the 10-year treasury. The vast majority of our long-duration liabilities is fixed at attractive rates, and the recent rise in the treasury is generally indicative of improving economic conditions. With vacancy rates below 10% and unemployment in New York City below 4%, continued economic improvement in New York City should result in 2018 being a better year than 2017. ","As stated in December, we've been buying back our stock with funding sources playing out as projected, notably the closing of 600 Lex and the pending second-stage closing of 1515 Broadway. Our leasing pipeline is now approaching 1.2 million square feet, which is already up from December's pipeline. We're fielding numerous inbound inquiries for JV partners and asset sales and are being very selective on what to monetize in the portfolio to fund our 2018 business plan. That plan looked attractive in December and looks even better in light of current market conditions. ","Notwithstanding our solid quarterly performance and positive outlook, there are, of course, external factors that influence our share price. As recently reported, the entire REIT sector has gotten off to a slow start this year in trading, and our share price has not been immune to that. The main driver seems to have little to do with underlying REIT performance and more to do with the view that other industries stand to benefit greatly from the federal tax changes and capital has started to flow aggressively in that direction. The irony is that the factors that are driving capital to the other business sectors will serve to greatly enhance the bottom lines of those companies, which are largely our tenant base in New York City, which bodes extremely well for our portfolio. ","So we'll obviously field questions about the earnings release we put out yesterday. But before we do that, Matt DiLiberto has a bit of an update on guidance.","Matthew DiLiberto","Yes. Thanks, Marc. Last night, we reported FFO for the fourth quarter and the full year 2017 right on top of our expectations that we laid out in December. That said, there were a couple of items in those results that we didn't include in our initial expectations that were highlighted in the press release. On the expense side, all the awards for our 2014 outperformace plan were forfeited. That has resulted in us taking a $4.1 million charge in the fourth quarter for the unamortized accounting expense related to the plan, which expired completely valueless to the recipients. That amount's included in G&A. The charge was offset by a $3.2 million real estate tax refund that we received at our property up in Rye Brook, following a successful appeal. Kudos to all those who were involved in that process. That amount is included in other income. ","Otherwise, the quarter was pretty clean. No real unusual items. And of course, we had the customary accounting cleanups that happen at the end of every year, like you saw in the transaction cost line. With regard to 2018, we've increased our FFO guidance range by $0.05 per share to $6.70 to $6.80 with a midpoint of $6.75. This increase is primarily the result of the $4.1 million charge we took in the fourth quarter related to the 2014 OPP awards that were forfeited. Our initial 2018 guidance had assumed that we would take that charge between January and August of 2018, which was the final vesting period for the awards.","But in addition, as we look out over the balance of the year, we're definitely seeing opportunities to generate further incremental earnings that could put us above our midpoint and at the upper end of our new guidance range. Obviously, it's still very early in the year so we need to see those things play out a bit. But to be here in January increasing guidance and to already be looking at further positives in our sector-leading FFO per share numbers is certainly a nice place to be. ","With that, I guess we can open it up for questions.","Marc Holliday","Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.","John Kim","I just wanted to follow up on some of your comments, Marc, on your opening commentary on -- especially regarding tax reform and the impact it's had in Manhattan leasing. It seems like many companies have already announced plans to increase hiring but not necessarily in New York, and maybe you saw it as a bit of a turnoff for some. But I was wondering if you could just elaborate on what discussions are like right now.","Marc Holliday","Yes. I don't know that, that's accurate that those plans don't include New York City. I think, Steve Durels, you could probably address, in general terms, maybe sectors or specific tenants, I mean I'm not sure, that are out there with expansion, either the deals we've done within the portfolio or deals that are pending, not by name, where they contain expansion elements. But I think we've continued to see a very positive and forward position amongst most of the industry groups within our sector that had, over the past 10 or 15 years, gone through some level of densification and tried to take advantage of best practices for creating efficiencies. But having cycled through 10 or almost 15 years of that, we see most of those tenants, as I said earlier, reaching those natural limits. And the combination of bottom line profitability and not much further opportunity to densify is leading towards current-day expansion or much more planning for expansion in leases. Whatever the effects of tax reform will be, that, we probably won't see for maybe another 12 months or so. I think what we're seeing now is just the benefit of corporate profitability in a very strong New York City economy that we've had over the past several years. Steve?","Steven Durels","To answer that, of the pipeline of almost 1.2 million, inside that number was almost 400,000 square feet of new tenant leases being negotiated. And I know specifically that at least 1\/4 of that square footage is being driven by tenants with expansion needs. I can't speak to whether or not the expansion and the hiring of new employees is currently being driven by tax reform, but I can tell you it certainly reinforced the overall business climate and enthusiasm that our tenants have about the confidence of their business. And that's what's leading to new hires and the leasing velocity that we're seeing.","John Kim","Okay. And my second question is on the rising interest rate environment. How do you feel about increasing your DPE portfolio both from an interest rate hedging and an opportunity perspective?","Marc Holliday","I think our guidance for the year is roughly flat on balances, which entails a lot of origination because we have a lot of payoff scheduled. We're still seeing good opportunities in the DPE market. And I would say a liquid financing market benefits us and our ability to generate above-average returns. I just think, right now, rather than increasing balances, we're seeing the stock buyback program as a better place to deploy our capital.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman with Citi.","Michael Bilerman","I was wondering -- maybe, Steve, you can just give us an update on One Vanderbilt. Seven weeks ago, at Investor Day, you talked about exchanging paperwork, I think it was on 4 or 6 floors. I'm just curious sort of where things stand today both in terms of those leases that you were negotiating but other incremental demand that may have come in.","Marc Holliday","Well, Steve will address sort of incremental demand, if you will, and give you a sense for how things are going. And they're going -- they were going well 7 weeks ago, and I think they're still going well to date. But we'll give you that 7-week update. But as it relates to the leasing that Andrew had put up on the screen, I think they were several deals in several floors that we had shown a high degree of confidence of making throughout the year. We have signed one of those leases, and that is in the quarter-to-date statistics, which I don't think I went through on the call. But we've signed about 190,000 or 200,000 square feet to date in multiple leases, which includes a deal over at One Vanderbilt. We'll be able to share some details of that with everyone very, very shortly, imminently, but not on the call. Beyond that, we've had other good leasing volume throughout the first part of this year. And if you want to add what's incremental to whatever Andrew was -- what we've talked about with...","Steven Durels","Yes. We're actively trading proposals back and forth with 4 tenants right now. Sizes vary. They're all for multiple floor type tenancies. The tour activity, the request for proposals, the sort of accelerated advancements of dialogue with prospective tenants is more feverish today than it was 6 months ago and, certainly, more than it was a year ago. So we're very active with tenants. And all of the economics that we're trading back and forth with people are well within our underwriting expectations.","Michael Bilerman","Great. Marc, just as a second question, in your opening comments, you've made mention of things that would make you even more optimistic relative to Investor Day, and I wasn't sure what sort of things you are referring to, whether that was leasing that was done, acquisitions that you are targeting, dispositions that you were doing, financing. I just didn't know what categories we should be mindful of that are making you...","Marc Holliday","Well, I would put probably high on the list -- I mean I can think of a few examples. But I think the tax bill is something that was formulated and passed after our meeting, and I think the expectation is certainly in the near term, the foreseeable near term, that, that could have a very stimulative effect on the financial community here in New York City but also just the general business community. And you're starting to hear about the reports of hiring. And we're starting to -- we're speaking with our tenants about their plans, and it just -- there will be money to be spent. And how it gets spent, where it gets spent, when it gets spent, we'll see. But it looks like that, that is certainly a positive development for our business tenant base and something that I think is not lost on investors.","Michael Bilerman","So it was more sort of the market rather than something specific that you were working on or getting close to?","Marc Holliday","Well, I'm not sure. I mean, the leasing pipeline is significant and has grown, so I put that down as a significant factor. We're buying back our stock at prices that were even lower than projected. And while we don't like to see the REIT sector get off to the start that it's gotten off to, just in a pure mathematical sense, that's been -- that translates into more accretion -- earnings and value accretion for the company. The inbound increase that I referenced in my opening comments about just sort of -- which is a gauge of investor demand, worldwide and domestic investor demand, is quite high. And I think you want to go into a year of seeing plentiful debt capital, equity capital, keeping values high, leasing pipeline strong, a tax bill which the business community has translated into potential for job growth. These are all things taken together that I think bode quite well for '18 and probably on the margins, better than where we stood 7 weeks ago.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with KeyBanc.","Craig Mailman","Marc, in your opening commentary, I thought your comments about the transaction market were helpful. I'm just curious, as you kind of look across Midtown, are you seeing any significant differences in neighborhoods from a value or demand perspective?","Marc Holliday","Well, maybe be a little more specific? I mean, Midtown is already a specific, defined generally as Third Avenue on over the Seventh or Eighth, and -- but the statistics probably do include leasing over on the West Side Yards. So the Midtown -- I think demand for Midtown assets and Downtown -- One Liberty was a pretty -- was a very robust price if you measure price by price per foot. I think that showed strong support for Downtown on that transaction. I think that, certainly, the 1700 Broadway on the West Side, very strong deal, our deal for Worldwide Plaza, our sale of 1515 Broadway, also Times Square. 600 Lex, so coming all the way over to the East side, was a sale that we felt was very good for this company. So I don't think it's limited or targeted in any way by neighborhood per se. I think it's pretty broad-based. Certainly, throughout Midtown, Midtown South continues to be highly attractive, just not a lot of product for sale because it's only a 60 million square foot market to begin with. And Downtown, where the trades have generally been at lower price points, there's been a couple of good deals down there, too. So I'd say broad-based.","Craig Mailman","Great. That's helpful. Secondly, can you just give us an update maybe on how you guys are seeing concessions this year and if you've had any early conversations with tenants about maybe kind of the burden they want to take on now with the tax changes versus what landlord build-out would be?","Steven Durels","Over the last two years, we've all seen concessions go up, particularly for new tenants' leases. But as we ended 2017 and as we started '18, our experience and my sense personally is that TIs have stabilized as far concessions go, still fairly rich relative to the rents but have stabilized. Face rents have increased over the past 12 months, and I think there's even been a little bit of a pullback on some of the free rent demand. So hopefully, we're at that moment where the concession increases are over, and we're in a place where they've plateaued.","Craig Mailman","I guess I was getting more at the improvement side of things. I misspoke with concessions. Just from a build-out and what tenants are going to finance now with the changes versus what landlords typically give, I just was curious if there's any shift in what they'd want to finance versus you guys...","Steven Durels","You know what, I don't have a good answer to that because I think every company has a different set of priorities as to how much they want to finance. And are they willing to pay a higher rent and have the landlord finance it? Do they manage more towards a lower occupancy cost and, therefore, they're putting their own capital? I don't think there's a clear, single answer to that question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alex Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander Goldfarb","Two questions. First, Andrew, just going back to the debt and preferred equity book. Can you just talk a little bit about your guys' ability to maintain the spread? As short-term rates rise, do you anticipate being able to maintain spreads, so the absolute rate that you're average charging folks will rise? Or do you think we'll see compression on the spread that you guys earn?","Andrew Mathias","I think we've seen gradual but steady spread compression over the last 18, 24 months in the market. Again, with our program, a lot -- we're originating whole loans and then selling into the senior loan market at those tighter spreads. So we've been able to maintain our spread. I don't -- we don't project being able to generate higher yields on our book based on rising indexes like LIBOR and the 10-year. We're sort of looking to hold those steady in the earnings guidance we've given thus far, and we haven't really found an ability to drive higher all-in rates based on rising rates to date mostly because of that spread compression in the market.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. And then the second question is on the buyback program. I mean, it's awesome to see you guys buying back in the quantity that you have and at the NAV discount. But it looks like you have about $500 million left, and on the Investor Day, disposition, you have about $500 million or $600 million of additional planned. So once you exhaust the current program, is it fair to assume that you guys will reload it and that, therefore, we can see disposition volume rise? Or is that not a good assumption?","Marc Holliday","I don't know that you can assume that. I think the plan that we have in place now takes us through roughly most of the way through the first half of the year. Whether that's May, June, July, I don't know, but somewhere in that time frame, dependent on certain things happening prerequisite. So it's not -- it's just not scientific, but that's -- we feel very good like we're on track for that. And then we'll take stock of where we are at that point. I mean I think that with any decision to continue that program, the factors that exist now would have to exist then or better. And I guess, if that were true, then it will get a hard look, that's for sure. But four, five months is a long time in this market.","A lot of things can change, hopefully for the better. Stock prices can rebound, and we can't just sit here today and, with any level of certainty, predict what we would do then. But we like the factors as they lay out right now. We think that the deleveraging that we've gone through, along with the shrinking of the balance sheet and stock buybacks done very accretively and the sales that we've done, which enabled those first two things, we've done very smartly. So all in all, very good track, and we'll just take stock again. If not on the next conference call, certainly by midsummer's call, we'll have a much better feel and sense for that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with UBS.","Nicholas Yulico","Marc, just going back to some of your comments earlier about 2018 should be better than 2017 and the tax plan helping office tenants. Does that mean you expect improved rent growth or better net absorption this year for the overall market? Because your stock price appears to reflect some worries that leasing fundamentals in New York are set to get worse and not better, so I'd love to hear your thoughts.","Marc Holliday","Yes. I mean, I don't know. I hear that, and everyone tries to tag what it is that's causing the stock price to be what it's been. Maybe it's leasing concerns, maybe it's some of the things I mentioned earlier about more attractive business sectors. I think we've actually outperformed year-to-date. That's only been 25 days. But -- so I don't know that it can be tagged to a New York City leasing market concern. ","I think the sector right now certainly seems to be out of favor. And we are caught up in that as are many of our peers, and we certainly hope that changes. But the leasing market to me, it's a very -- it's a deep market. There's a lot of data points, and I don't look to the stock market as a predictor of how that market is. I look to job growth. I look to tenant demand. I look to the pipeline that we have and the terms that we're seeing. Our portfolio is 95.5% leased roughly, and that's very high. We don't have big blocks of space around the portfolio of existing space to lease. I think we have a pocket of space over at 220. We have a pocket of space over at 45 Lex and a little bit more to go with Tower 46. I mean, that's like it. So the portfolio is very tight. We're trying to obviously retain those tenants in a way where we're still driving mark to market and keeping concessions at a reasonable level. ","And I think the factors that I set out earlier, to specifically address your question, do I think it will cause rising rates? I don't know that you're going to see rates rise, but I think, to what Steve said earlier, you're going to see concession packages hopefully plateau or maybe even shrink towards the end of the year if demand stays healthy. We are still competing against new competition generally. So as the inventory grows, landlords are out there competing for tenants. That growth is pretty much in balance and has been, as evidenced by the fact that the vacancy rate is still around 9%, 9.5%, and it's been that way for the last couple of years. So there is an equilibrium that has been met. But with improvement in '18, that equilibrium could shift a little bit more in favor of landlords and maybe those concession packages will plateau or begin to come back in our direction. Steve?","Steven Durels","So let me just add to that because the sense of the -- that there's some level of weakness in the leasing market, I think is betrayed by the facts. People -- we came off 2016 with new leases of over 30 million square feet, which is 16% of leasing velocity over the prior year. Midtown by itself was 18 million square feet of new leasing, which was 9% ahead of leasing velocity over the 5-year average. And the fourth quarter was the best quarter since the second quarter of 2015. So you -- in the light of that and then what we see in our pipeline, we have more -- a bigger pipeline today than we did in January of 2017, and we have a wide diversity of sizes and types of tenants in that pipeline. So I'm feeling very good and I think the rest of us are feeling very good about where we stand right now.","Nicholas Yulico","That's helpful. Just a follow-up. I mean, can you dig in a little bit to the higher-end price point in the market and whether that's where there is more aggressive concession packages being offered by other landlords? Or are there any signs of face asking rents getting reduced at the high end of the market?","Marc Holliday","Hold on, Nick. We're getting a ruling on the two questions.","Matthew DiLiberto","That was 2.5 or 3 questions.","Marc Holliday","Okay. Well, let's...","Steven Durels","The high end of the market like One Vanderbilt?","Nicholas Yulico","Yes, that's right. Yes.","Steven Durels","Yes. Well, I think Marc mentioned that One Vanderbilt has got an announcement imminent. So the high end of the market is very healthy. There was tremendous number of $100-plus rents signed last year. And I think what's most important is that in that $100 market, the size of the average tenants have increased dramatically. The number of buildings that are getting $100 rents and the size of leases being signed at $100 rents is growing, and that is a very good signal about that part of the marketplace. As a matter of fact, the average $100 rent last year was 25,000 square foot leases.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","James Feldman","Can you guys talk about your Emerge212 platform and just kind of your general take on co-working and what you think it means for the market, both in the coming year and longer term?","Marc Holliday","Sure. Emerge has three locations right now at 3 Columbus, 125 Park and 1185 Sixth. 1185 Sixth is a relatively new facility, so we're in lease-up phase on that facility. The other two facilities are stabilized. We've seen a very healthy demand in that sector. I would say we appeal to a more corporate fractional office user, and that's why we have a lot of tenants that graduate into our portfolio as longer-term space tenants from Emerge. We don't appeal to like a tech, very informal sort of open-benching type environment. So the business has been healthy and, I would say, is trending with profit margins pretty stable to where they've been historically. We don't forecast any explosive growth with the co-working trends as they're evolving.","James Feldman","Okay. I mean, do you expect to convert more space into that platform?","Marc Holliday","We're always evaluating additional spaces. The spaces that we have are profitable and the space works well for the business, but we don't have anything budgeted this year because we're still on lease-up on 1185.","James Feldman","Okay. And then you guys mentioned in the press release that you expect to -- at 2 Herald Square, you expect a transaction later this year. Can you talk more about that, the foreclosure?","Matthew DiLiberto","So we're in the foreclosure process, which is a time line that we don't necessarily control and...","Marc Holliday","We can't really comment.","Matthew DiLiberto","That's all we can say on it, yes.","James Feldman","Okay. Do I get one more question or that's it?","Marc Holliday","We're a foreclosing lender, and that's it.","James Feldman","Okay. Then for my second question, can you just talk about your plans at 1185 Sixth? I see it's now under construction.","Steven Durels","Yes. So you're talking specifically on the leasing front. So we're in a redevelopment program there that entails a new lobby, elevator cabs, new entrance to the building. That's in anticipation of roll that comes to us of about 170,000 square feet in August of '18 and another 170,000 square feet at the end of 2020. The good news on that story is that we have a number of leases out right now, sizable leases ranging between 50,000 and 100,000 square feet, that will start to knock off some of that early roll. So before it ever goes dark, we're already actively negotiating leases and term sheets for pre-letting a big chunk of the space.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Michael Lewis with SunTrust.","Michael Lewis","You started to address this question in your answer to a previous question, but one of the things investors ask me often is, what type of space is mostly impacted by new supply in Manhattan? Is it high price point because that's in direct competition with Hudson Yards? Is it lower-quality space because now that there finally is some new space, tenants start to move up the quality spectrum? Are there certain areas of the city that are more at risk? So rather than me continue to struggle to answer the question, I thought I'd pose it to the experts.","Marc Holliday","So the question is, within our portfolio, which of our space competes most directly against new construction space?","Michael Lewis","New York hasn't had a lot of brand-new supply like this at once. So when there is new supply like this in Manhattan, what space is most at risk from the competition?","Marc Holliday","Yes. Okay. So again, the amount of space that is going to be delivered annually over the next five years, I don't have the numbers in front of me, but I thought it was net of about 2.5 million square feet or so and more than what we're accustomed to because we're accustomed to like 0 on a 400 million square foot inventory. And without all the subsidies, new construction was very hard to get done except in isolated instances. So the Hudson Yards opened up an ability to bring on, I think, ultimately 20 million feet but that's over a very long period of time, 2 million to 3 million square feet a year against what, I think, Steve, you said earlier, last year's total was 28 million square feet of leasing.","Steven Durels","30 million.","Marc Holliday","30 million square feet of leasing. So I know it gets a lot of headlines, and we'll answer the question for sure, but also recognize we signed about 250 leases a year, one every business day. The vast majority of those are not competing against the new construction projects. I would say out of the 250 leases in any given year, maybe 5 or 10 at most might be looking at new construction as an alternative, whereas, generally, the competition is other built space in the submarket the tenant wants to be in. So that's a -- we're talking about a very small fraction. So I would say, generally, new construction is going to compete with new construction. Our existing portfolio generally is competing with these Midtown, but there are exceptions. I guess 1185 Sixth, we have 1 or 2 tenants that are going to -- that are sort of West and will be -- 1 tenant that will be going further West. But you're talking about a couple out of hundreds. So it's not something we encounter on a daily, weekly, monthly basis. We're generally competing against other landlords within our submarket.","Michael Lewis","That's helpful. My second question, I just wanted to ask about this Navillus bankruptcy. I don't know if I'm saying that right. But from everything I read, it sounds like they're working as if nothing's happening. But is there potential that maybe that could cause some delays in the time line at One Vanderbilt?","Marc Holliday","No, we have that, I think, completely ringfenced. I mean, with Liberty now standing behind Navillus, I think they're one of the strongest contractors out there. So what we were able to negotiate and I think has been presented to the bankruptcy court is an appropriate set of protections for the project with their surety standing behind them. And work has continued uninterrupted. And most importantly, I think there's an alignment that both Navillus, the surety and even the creditors want to see those union jobs continue to be in place through the balance of the project. And we've had -- there's been no disruption nor do we expect it. And if there would be, we have contingency plans.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Rob Simone with Evercore ISI.","Robert Simone","I have a follow-up on the earlier question on buyback. Let's assume just hypothetically that you guys -- in your judgment, conditions are right for additional buybacks once the existing authorization is fully expended, and you thought it made sense to sell a couple -- sell or JV a couple of additional assets. What's like in your mind -- or could you discuss, in your mind, the theoretical limit to doing that? Like how far would you take that asset disposition program vis-\u00e0-vis like just your overall portfolio size?","Marc Holliday","Yes. I mean, that's really -- it's a board-level matter when it comes to these buyback programs. We have not played out a scenario of -- that kind of what-if scenario so I just can't answer it. I understand the question. I just -- I can't answer it because I don't know and we haven't projected for that eventuality. I mean, when we approve the buyback programs, they're in a certain amount of share, certain amount of dollars, and everything is generally tied to a plan of a funding. So we look at it in terms of funding plan, buyback plan, and we take it very incrementally but in large incremental steps.","First one was $1 billion. Second one was $0.5 billion. So I think when we will next discuss, it will be a discussion with respect to the next increment without necessarily taking that future trip all the way to what could it possibly be. If everything stays the same as today because -- as we all know, things don't stay the same. Everything changes. Markets change. Stock price change. Funding sources change. So I think these plans -- or strategies are best planned for in increments of 6 to 12 months, where you have relatively good visibility. Even then, it's not perfect, but let's just call it relatively good visibility. And that's -- these programs are generally executed within that kind of time frame. But beyond that, we'll just sort of take it as it comes. And as I said earlier, when we have more on that, you guys will certainly be the first to know.","Robert Simone","Marc, that's really -- the color is really helpful. And then, Steve, I just have one quick follow-up on One Vanderbilt. You mentioned that your discussions are kind of following within your underwriting. Would you guys still kind of stick to your prior comments that '18 is really the year where you'd like to see some meaningful progress on leasing? Or has there been any kind of like slippage on timing into '19?","Steven Durels","Yes. We think we'll be on plan with our projection. We're off to a good start with a nice sized lease that you'll hear about shortly. And as we sit in January, we've got a pipeline of transactions that we're chasing. So if those come to fruition, then we feel that we'll hit our targets for the year.","Operator","Our next one comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley.","Vikram Malhotra","Just had a question on sort of expected mark-to-market cadence over the year and into '19. I know you've said sort of 6% to 9% for Manhattan. If we look at sort of the breakout, it seems like you have a nice mark to market in the first quarter but then it sort of really decelerates. Just wondering -- obviously, there are different levers in there, but just wondering if there's any quarter where we, at least theoretically, could see flat to maybe negative mark to market over the next, say, 12, 18 months?","Marc Holliday","Well, we've only forecasted out through year-end, I would only look out 4 more quarters. I can't speak to 5 or 6 or more than that. And I would caution that trying to -- the leasing may sound mechanical. The leasing -- and we may even not give enough credit at -- due credit at times to the leasing group and make it mechanical, but the reality is the leasing is tough. And it can trip by a week, a day, a month, and it goes from what we thought would be in March is April and then trips quarters and everything changes. I really would urge everyone to look at it annually and not read too much into any quarter's results, whether it's volume, whether it's mark to market. I feel confident within -- over the next 11.5 months or 11 months, we'll be in that 6% to 9% range because that's the guidance we've given. When you start breaking it down to quarters, I feel like it's rife for misses that are -- misses without a distinction. With that said, Matt, I assume we are expecting some of the early pipeline to be higher than the 6% to 9% range; and the back half of the year, lower than 6% to 9% range.","Matthew DiLiberto","Yes, that's right.","Marc Holliday","I can't speak to whether it goes negative in any quarter. We're not projecting that. It could. And if it does, it doesn't mean the 6% to 9% is any less credible. It's just things have a way of working out timing-wise. But I guess it would be fair to say we've got some bigger leases rolling, bigger expected to be transacted that have lesser mark to market in the back half of the year.","Vikram Malhotra","Got it. And then just on the street retail environment, maybe just give us some updated thoughts on where are we in the correction process and if you can give us an update on 719. I think it sounded like you were imminently going to announce the lease there at the Investor Day. So any color would be helpful.","Marc Holliday","Sure. 719 is still in process. The deal's been a challenge. We acknowledge it was more of a challenge than we expected. And I think we're still in sort of a discovery phase in terms of the market block by block. So we're still definitely showing a lot of tenant space. There's still good activity. There are very few vacancies that we have, but I would say we need some more price discovery in the market in terms of taking rents and values to really assess where we stand at this point.","Vikram Malhotra","So just to clarify, just timing-wise on 719, is it tough to say right now? Or could it be first half or second? Any color?","Marc Holliday","It's tough to say right now.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank.","Vincent Chao","Marc, I just want to go back to something you said pretty early in your comments just in regards to the transaction market maybe having a flattish volumes here in 2018 but still seeing good demand for the quality assets and a lack of supply keeping prices relatively strong. Just curious what your thoughts are and why the supply would be constrained if the market conditions are pretty good. Just curious why volumes would be flat.","Marc Holliday","Well, you've heard me talk about in the past how this market every year gets incrementally more and more securitized, more product in the hands of a concentrated group of landlords. Top 15 is what I traditionally referred to, and I think the top 15 in New York own about half the inventory thereabouts. And that number has been growing. And owners like us and others are just far more judicious in terms of when we feel an asset has -- especially a very valuable, well-located asset, has met its true sort of level of maturity, where it's time to monetize. And very often, even with deals that we have put through a cycle of redevelopment leasing, we still see upside often, as certainly was the case with a deal like 1515 Broadway and others. So in those cases, we go out and bring in a JV partner for maybe, in the case of One Vanderbilt, 27% of the deal; in the case of 1515, 49% of the deal -- or 43% of the deal, sorry.","And a lot of the top landlords also do the same type of strategy. So what you have are much more of the product is kind of bespoke transactions. They're not just marketed bid deals. They're longer-term negotiations with domestic and foreign capital partners, where chemistry and terms are much more important or as important as price, and you're creating a partnership that will last years, 5, 10, 15 years or more. So those deals for the bigger assets especially take away from the supply of what would otherwise be available for 100% sale on a bid basis. So when I look at that pipeline, I'd say half of the pipeline we see right now are kind of these 50% interest kind of deals, and they're very interesting. We did one on Worldwide Plaza. It was a very good deal. Us -- RXR and NYRT did a deal just like that on Worldwide, and we did one on -- as I said, on 1515. And Brookfield did one on One Liberty and on and on. I'm not going to belabor all of them.","They're out there. But there'll be a lot more of those. And what those kinds of deals do is they shrink the supply of just outright sales. And you have a lot of capital out there. For every one JV partner, there's maybe 100 other investors who want to be a JV partner or a buyer. And they have their own goals and objectives to acquire product in the best market. New York is still considered right among the top of those markets. And it's very hard to buy in New York, especially, I think, in today's environment, where a lot of assets are only partially for sale.","Vincent Chao","Okay. And second question, sorry if I missed it earlier, we've been talking about the leasing pipeline quite a bit on the call, but did you guys share the stats in terms of what the size of the pipeline is today and then the breakdown between new and renewal? And then maybe within renewal, how much of that is 2018 expiration versus beyond 2018?","Steven Durels","Well, maybe a little more granular that I've got, but I'll share this with you. Of the 1,200,000 square feet, we've got over 500,000 square feet of leases that are in negotiation. There's almost 650,000 square feet of term sheets that we think have a high probability of being converted over to leases. The general tenant makeup of the tenants that are -- the leases out for negotiation -- I'm sorry, of the total pipeline, there's over 500,000 square feet that are financial-related firms. There's about 190,000 square feet of TAMI-type tenants. And then the balance of the tenant profiles are everything from engineering to automotive to general business services, so a very wide group of types of tenants. Of the leases that are -- the 500,000 square feet of leases that are in negotiation as opposed to term sheets, 400,000 square feet of that are new tenants coming into the portfolio. So hopefully, that helps.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Guinee with Stifel.","John Guinee","SL Green is trading just stunningly inexpensive on a per pound basis, which leaves me to believe that there's a lot of OpEx or tax increases recently. Is that going to -- is that accurate, one? And is that going to abate anytime soon?","Marc Holliday","Well, in terms of OpEx increases, there's been -- other than real estate taxes, it's been quite contained. I think our -- Ed and his whole operations team managing a 28 million square foot portfolio gets the most efficiency we can out of this portfolio. And I think our increase year-over-year is generally around 2% for everything, including insurance. But for real estate taxes, which, even our -- the best of our teams and outside counsel were subject to the vagaries of a very outdated and really quite unfair system, where commercial properties and owners like us are bearing the lion's share of the -- of a heavily increasing tax burden that far outstrips any notion of kind of rate of inflation or appropriate rate of increase. If we're 2% on OpEx, we might be anywhere from 6% to 8% on real estate taxes.","And over a period of years, it really is something that warrants a lot of scrutiny by the current administration, which I know has taken it up as something that they will look at during the second term of this administration. So I would say, generally, we are excellent at containing those costs. And that certainly gives rise in part to why we've been able to create such extraordinary value in the portfolio, which, as you point out, John, is wildly disconnected from the stock price.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jed Reagan with Green Street Advisors.","Joseph Reagan","A question for Steve. Steve, you mentioned that face rents have increased over the past 12 months in Manhattan. Just curious if you can talk about the order of magnitude increases you've seen and maybe which submarkets have shown more strength than others.","Steven Durels","Well, the overall Manhattan rents went up modestly. They were up -- I think most of the reports would say they were up in the -- around 3% year-over-year. Concessions went up. So net effect is we're sort of flat over the year. And I think that we're seeing better than -- better execution on many of our transactions than where we budgeted deals. So I think we're just kind of on a trend line to see some additional modest rent appreciation as we go into 2018 as well.","Joseph Reagan","Any sense of kind of which submarkets are doing better than others?","Steven Durels","Well, a lot of the demand in the Midtown market, and Midtown was a very active market in Manhattan in 2017. Grand Central was particularly active in the fourth quarter. Sixth Avenue Rock Center was the single most active market in the fourth quarter. But for the entire year, Grand Central was extremely active. And I think you've seen good rent appreciation on the commodity, kind of value part of the market. But then at the very high end of the market on new construction, as evidenced by sort of the later-stage leasing being done over Hudson Yards, you've seen huge rent acceleration, right? The most recent deals that were done over in Hudson Yards, some of those buildings get to the end of their lease-up program where rents are in the $120, $130 price point. And I'm quite certain that those numbers well exceed the developer's underwritten number.","Joseph Reagan","Great. That's helpful. And then just one other quick one. It looks like your third-largest tenant, Ralph Lauren, has an expiration next year at 625 Madison. Any visibility at this point into what their plans are? And is there a roll-up opportunity at that space?","Steven Durels","Not a lot of visibility from what they've told us. They've really been focused on other leases that were expiring in their portfolio, some in Manhattan, many of it -- much of it in New Jersey. We're -- we've had some preliminary conversations with them. Obviously, our goal is to keep them. It's a very rent-attractive opportunity for them to save rent by staying. So we're -- we hope to be in front of them with a very aggressive proposal shortly.","Operator","And our final question comes from the line of Jon Petersen with Jefferies.","Jonathan Petersen","Just one for me. So the leasing volumes this quarter fell a little short of your 2017 guidance. You guys mentioned it in the press release and said it was because some leases slipped to 2018. So I was curious for some more details on that. You keep talking about a large and pending lease, I think, at One Vanderbilt. Is that one of the ones that slipped? And also, just kind of a follow-up. Because some of the stuff shifted over into 2018, does that mean your leasing guidance in 2018 is more like 1.7 million square feet instead of the 1.6 million you laid out at your Investor Day?","Marc Holliday","Yes. I would say that the -- some of the leasing that occurred in the first part of January was on account of what we expected to have at the end of December. So I guess we could hold Steve responsible for that 2 weeks, and you'll have to -- there'll be a reckoning for that later on but.","Steven Durels","This is where the unappreciated part of lease is.","Marc Holliday","But I guess, certainly, it was not part -- you would say that the guidance for the year is probably up 100 because it would include that which slipped, yes. ","Okay. And operator, I think that's what we have time for. So thank you very much for all the questions and for dialing in today. And we look forward to speaking to you on the next round.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I will now turn the call over to your host for today, Ms. Heidi Gillette, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed, ma'am.","Heidi Gillette","Thank you, everybody, for joining us and welcome to SL Green Realty Corp.'s First Quarter 2013 Earnings Results Conference Call. This conference call is being recorded.","At this time, the company would like to remind listeners that during the call, management may make forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ from the forward-looking statements that management may make today.","Additional information regarding the factors that could cause such differences appear in the MD&A section of the company's Form 10-K and other reports filed by the company with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Also during today's conference call, the company may discuss non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC Regulation G.","The GAAP financial measure, most directly comparable to each non-GAAP financial measure discussed and the reconciliation of the differences between each non-GAAP financial measure and the comparable GAAP financial measure can be found on the company's website at www.slgreen.com, by selecting the press release regarding the company's first quarter 2013 earnings call.","Before turning the call over to Marc Holliday, Chief Executive Officer of SL Green Realty Corp., I ask that those of you participating in the Q&A portion of the call, please limit your questions to 2 per person. Thank you.","I will now turn it over to Marc Holliday. Please go ahead, Marc.","Marc Holliday","Hello, and thanks for joining our call this afternoon. The positive economic conditions in New York City provided the backdrop for a very solid first quarter of 2013. First, and foremost, we leased nearly 600,000 square feet of space in Q1 with almost half of that amount represented by new leases. This momentum carried through to April where we have already leased an additional 164,000 square feet in just the first 3 weeks of the second quarter.","Moreover, we have a strong pipeline of deals, evidenced by over 1 million square feet of leases that are either out for signature or under negotiation categories that, we believe, represent high probability categories of consummating sometime during the year 2013. About 0.5 million square feet is represented by new leases. So you can see that relative to last year, in particular, there's a lot of activity and a lot of success we're having at renewing tenants but also filling vacant space that we acquired in the growth portfolio.","While mark-to-market on the office leases in the first quarter was just slightly positive, I do want to stress that I think you'll see more significant mark-to-market gains throughout the year as we have already experienced good mark-to-market in leases signed in quarter-to-date, in second quarter, and our pipeline looks very strong as well. So we are maintaining our full year office mark-to-market objective of 3% to 8%, which was something that we had highlighted back in December and notwithstanding 1 quarter down and 3 to go, we still think that, that will represent an accurate range of where we'll ultimately land. And that, I think, gives you some insight into the kind of leasing that's in front of us, not only in terms of volume, but in terms of economics.","It was also notable that the concessions were down significantly in the first quarter, consistent with prior lows we've had in other quarters but certainly down from our average. And this is attributable, in some respect, to being very prudent on renewal leases and getting best deals possible. But even on new leases, you'll see that we're cutting more in the way of net effective deals. And so you don't always see that big pop in headline rent but we're also doing it very efficiently, trying to be smart about how we spend our capital to buy new deals.","We're seeing very good demand in various sectors of the market, all but the largest financial firms, there's a lot of activity and we're seeing great activity in professional and business services, media, advertising, tech, health care and education. I would say all of those sectors, almost equally, are net contributors to absorption in this market.","I know that many of the analysts are focused in on the potential space shutting that may occur in the future at some of the largest commercial and investment banks. But I think that would be a mistake to let that overshadow the very vibrant business and leasing environment in the midsize space market where we see much demand and competition for space.","Examples of locations where we are experiencing a pickup or continuation in demand include the 125 Park, 3 Columbus Circle, Graybar, 810 Seventh, Tower 45, 919 Third and 304 Park Avenue South. And this morning, many of you have seen that we and Vornado announced 100,000 square feet of leasing at 280 Park Avenue, which represented renewal and expansion space for those 2 tenants and we have very good activity on the balance of the building, notwithstanding the full completion of the redevelopment is still a year away with completion of the lobby set for sometime around Thanksgiving.","Our retail leasing also remains strong with deals announced this morning with CBS at 3 Columbus Circle and that lease with CBS is the anchor retail tenant that we had talked about landing as an important goal and objective for this company in 2013, so we're happy to have CBS join our roster of retail companies at 3 Columbus and having that objective completed so early the year, as well as retail leases that we did with Urban Outfitters and TD Bank at 180 Broadway bringing that building to full occupancy, 100% occupancy, for a tower that we developed from ground up.","This leasing activity can be directly linked to the robust job creation in New York City. New York added 78,000 jobs in 2012 and that followed an increase of 90,000 jobs in 2011. The primary sources of growth, I mentioned before, but I'll sort of reiterate here: professional services, technology, health care and education, not in terms of square footage, as I mentioned earlier, but in terms of job creation. But those are the sectors where we see the biggest contributors.","Overall, employment was up 13,000 jobs in the first 3 months of 2013 and this increase was achieved, notwithstanding the drag created by a reduction of 5,000 financial services jobs in March, which shows that these growing sectors can more than counter, counter by a wide margin, the job losses that we're seeing at the margins in the financial service sector are being far exceeded by job growth in these other industries. And we expect that trend to continue throughout the year and that -- our rule of thumb is typically anywhere between 40% to 50% for private-sector job growth, it translates into office-using job growth. So we think this bodes very well for stabilizing or even possibly, an increase in the overall occupancy rates in overall Manhattan market.","So with that short introduction, I would like to open up for questions and answers.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line, from Jamie Feldman of Bank of America.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Following up on what you're seeing in terms of demand, can you talk about any change in sentiment among tenants given that downtown is -- the developments are starting to kind of get near completion, the transit center getting close. And then the coach lease on the West side and then Time Warner's space, the Time Warner Center. Just kind of like what changed in the last quarter, given what seems to be we're getting closer to some new supply?","Marc Holliday","Well, I want to make sure we understand the question exactly. The  sentiment we're seeing from tenants is, and I would say this is since December, and we stated this in December and in meetings we've had since that, we think there is a confidence factor and a profitability factor in most of the industries I mentioned earlier, even financial services is actually quite strong. It's not just at the -- not at the  very top levels. And that sentiment, I think, has gotten stronger and there's a feeling now that before, there was a lot of consolidation. There might have been a little bit of contraction or there might have been sort of stable growth. Almost all the leases we're seeing now our factoring in future growth plans, again, as they typically do. So I don't -- that doesn't relate in any way, shape, or form to the new development that you were referring to in downtown and Hudson Yards. But that's just generally a shift in sentiment we've seen and a little bit more urgency in getting deals done in the first 3.5 months of the year, which are not typically very robust months, for at least as we've seen these cycles traditionally. As it relates to tenant sentiment, specifically being altered by downtown World Trade Center, completion at Hudson Yards. Steve, why don't you address that.","Steven M. Durels","I don't think that those events are necessarily altering tenant's sentiment, per se. I think there is a general confidence that tenants have as a result of a lot of the hurdles that were passed. I think that we -- the second half of last year, you saw velocity pickup. And we said to everybody that in December and right in through January, as contrasted to the January of 2012, that we started 2013 carrying the momentum forward. And I think a lot of that was because tenants were -- had a growing level of confidence whether what was holding them back was the election or the uncertainty on the economy or the uncertainty of where the euro was headed or the uncertainty of regulatory change. There were a lot of reasons for people to delay and pause and make short-term decisions and I think we're past that. I think there is a growing level of confidence. We were saying it at the beginning of the years, there was a lot of broker feedback right in January that contrasted that, but I think most brokers would tell you that as we sit here in April, everybody uniformly is saying that there's increased velocity, increased confidence and more bullishness as far as where velocity is headed.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great, that's very helpful on the demand side. I guess the second part of my question was, really, have you seen any change in the competitive environment or where tenants are willing to look? And how should we think about how your portfolio's positioned to compete with some of this new supply given that you are seeing a pickup in demand and a more positive outlook from tenants?","Marc Holliday","Yes, I would just -- I'll let Steve answer. I just want to sort of coming back to that question a bit. We signed -- how many leases in the first quarter? 55 leases. Most of those 55 tenants are not shopping downtown in Hudson Yards. I think, that there's too much in the press about tenants like Group M [ph] and Time Warner and other big tenants that are making potentially big, strategic moves from one location to the next for which those developments maybe applicable, and front and center. But for the 55 leases we signed in this quarter, I'm going to hazard to say somewhere between none or less than 10%, Steve, viewed the new developments as viable, competitive spaces relative to the deals they made with us. I just think it just gets distorted out there. We compete against the buildings in our submarkets almost exclusively for tenants. Typically, there'll be 2 or 3 buildings within Third Ave, Lex, Grand Central Plaza, Sixth Ave. It's not that every one of these tenants, which may be averaging in size, 50,000 feet plus or minus, are shopping a Midtown location to Hudson Yards, or downtown. It just doesn't -- I don't -- maybe other landlords experience that. But we don't experience that. So there is new inventory that will be coming online over the next 5 to 8 years, some of it nearer term, some of it not until '18 to '20 -- 2018 to 2020. And that space will certainly be looked at by some of the major users, I would say, 0.5 million square feet and up and that will be competition. And all of the factors will go into weighing that in terms of product, sponsorship, location and price. And I think Midtown will do very well in terms of retaining much of its tenant base. But there will be some that will venture into the new developments. But with that said, I just want -- the 580,000 feet we signed, the 1 million plus square feet in pipeline plus the April year-to-date, most of that we're competing at a very localized basis, not against new development. Steve, you want to...","Steven M. Durels","Yes, and just to reiterate that, that the new construction for the deals that we're negotiating and that are in our pipeline is not applicable to those tenants. Notwithstanding that, having new construction as part of the overall Manhattan inventory is a good thing in order to keep our market healthy in the long run. But as far as being able, for us to compete and keep our portfolio full, it really doesn't enter into it. Second part of your question, maybe aside from the new construction, is that what are we seeing just generally downtown. And we are seeing some Midtown tenants and Midtown South tenants kick the tires downtown. But not necessarily new construction. We've seen guys come through 180 Maiden Lane who are Midtown and Midtown South type tenants. And they're there because it's still the value play, it's a lot of real estate for the dollar and in that building's particular case, we've got a lot of amenities to offer. So I think it all sort of feeds into that. The general theme of there's a lot of -- a lot more velocity, a lot more tenants, a lot more larger tenants and a lot of tenants doing long-term deals than there was a year ago.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Toti of Cantor Fitzgerald.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","We've been talking to some of our local brokers recently and they mentioned a phenomena is kind of resurfacing again and this is the potential for condo conversions, resi conversions of various towers around the city. Sort of a repeat of what we saw in the mid-2000s. Obviously, you're a little bit involved in that. Are -- do you think this is something that you're seeing interest in your portfolio in some of your assets? Are you seeing it being a rising phenomena potentially? And ultimately, do you think this could impact cap rates on assets that have been relatively stable recently?","Andrew W. Mathias","Well, it's Andrew, I think it's definitely a phenomenon throughout the city where there's a lot of repurposing of office space into either a hotel or residential space. Probably, the foremost example of that is the Sony Building, which the current business plan is likely to go with a combination of retail, hotel and residential in that asset. So, but there are many others like the Sony Building where -- which are being marketed as conversion candidates. And from our perspective, that's a big positive in the office market as we see supply coming offline for projects that are slated for conversion.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","One of the comments is that right now, it's only very high end in terms of the residential repurposing. Would you concur with that? Or maybe suggest that it could spread to sort of more middle price points?","Andrew W. Mathias","I think downtown have a lot of potential candidates for the middle price point type conversion. There's 1 asset, a large asset downtown in particular, that's rumored to be trading that would be for a residential conversion. I think there's a couple of others that are possibilities. But in Midtown, you typically see people underwriting very high-end condominiums just because that's what the market is sort of demanding.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then my last question, given that your increased involvement in residential in recent years, do you think there are any opportunities in your portfolio, anything you may have especially coupled with your increasing development interest as well?","Andrew W. Mathias","Well, I think the most prominent is One Madison where we have 450,000 square feet of undeveloped air rights there and the lease with Credit Suisse that rolls in 2020. We did explore potential development there prior to 2008 and it's very feasible and very desirable. And that's certainly one that could get revisited in the future.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rob Stevenson from Macquarie.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Can you talk a little bit about the strength of the structured finance pipeline today? And what of the sort of current $1.4 billion in change are you expecting to get repaid through year end?","Andrew W. Mathias","Look, the pipeline is very robust right now. We continue to get much more than our fair share of transactions in the market and I think Sony was a great example of that. And we have several other transactions in various stages of application behind the Sony deal. So we're still finding it to be a market where our skill set and expertise in structuring and syndicating positions can earn us above-average returns and it's an area where we're focusing a lot of time and capital. So there's certainly a good amount of our book that is shorter term and floating rate. We're watching it carefully to see where we are likely to get repayments and trying to line up our originations so that we maintain a balance at or around its current levels.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","And the new stuff that you're looking at is still in that sort of 10%-ish range? Or are you starting to see yields coming in?","Andrew W. Mathias","What's our average?","Marc Holliday","Average [indiscernible] is just over 11%.","Andrew W. Mathias","I would say in the 9% to 10% range, depending on how long term the paper is. But it's definitely a market that's adjusted down somewhat given where interest rates are.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then are you guys seeing any improvement in the Suburban office portfolio demand and metrics out there?","Andrew W. Mathias","Yes. I was a little surprised at some of the commentary I saw on the Suburban portfolio last night and this morning, and maybe that's just because we've got more of the realtime data than maybe comes across in the stats, which represents a little bit more of what was commenced. For instance, there was a lot of discussion about a falling occupancy rate which related to 3 tenants in particular that had -- we had done deals with last year, successfully renewed them but they all represented contractions. And I am looking at my notes here. Fuji was one, I know, and Heineken and Skadden. So those -- that should have caught anyone by surprise because those deals were done and announced last year, they just commenced into our occupancy, I guess, as of year end, right? So -- but I think the bigger picture or the bigger story there is that we've actually had, and ironically, given to this context, we had a very good first quarter. It was a very strong start to the year for Suburban leasing with 42 deals signed totaling 310,000 square feet, I think 230,000 square feet is probably through the  first quarter in the supplement and then there's been, I guess, if I do the math, about 80,000 square feet or so that has signed since then. So that is actually a pickup from what we typically see in the suburbs and that emboldens us just a bit. I mean we need to see that for 3, 4, 5 quarters to really call it a trend. But you've got to start somewhere. And there's 11 leases out in Westchester and Stamford right now totaling 110,000 square feet and we have a pipeline of active proposals beyond that of about another 200,000 square feet. So you lay that over a backdrop that we only have 164,000 square feet expiring in 2013 and 200,000 square feet expiring in 2014 and it would cause us to go long right here and say that we expect occupancy to be up off of these levels by year end given those dynamics. So, again, a little too early to look at it as a trend or to get terribly excited about it because it is still a very fragile market. I mean we -- our occupancy is in the low 80s but that's still 4% to 5% ahead of the market. So we're outperforming the market, the market still has a lot of vacancy, but I think one of the bright spot relates to what was brought up earlier in the call, repurposing, where there is older office stock in the Suburbs that is being repurchased for biotech, educational and medical uses and there's approximately 750,000 square feet in Westchester County alone, most of which in White Plains and Elmsford, that is being transformed by Memorial Sloan-Kettering, Fordham and a variety of other biotech firms. So hopefully, that can also, in its own way, create a little bit of a mini stabilizing dynamic that's akin to the condominium conversions we had spoken of earlier in Manhattan.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman from Citi.","Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","It's Josh Attie with Michael. The average duration of the leases you executed in the quarter was about 5.5 years, which I think is lower than what you've done historically. And I know there were a couple of large deals with 3- and 5-year terms like Eisner and Viacom, but can you talk about the dynamics of some of these leases and also others that may have brought the average down?","Steven M. Durels","Yes. It's just -- it's sort of an anomaly because it was driven by a couple of the large deals, Eisner in particular. We did a short-term extension. The trigger on that deal was in connection with a full floor of the expansion space they were taking. So in order to extend the term out on their existing space and marry it together, was the reason for the short term on that deal, and that was so much square footage that it moved the needle. Additionally you had WPP, which is the headquarters office for Y&R and their holding company of other advertising agencies. Because it's not an income-producing division, their home office mandates that the maximum term they can do for renewal is a 5-year deal. They've been in the building for 15 years. So there's no reason to think that they wouldn't have gone longer except for the home office restriction and that's not a new piece of news as to how they operate. So it's really a couple of deals that pushed it. If you contrast that against the deals that we're working on right now, where Marc mentioned that we have leases under negotiation, not term sheets, but actual lease agreements out in negotiation covering 1 million square feet. The top 9 deals covering 800,000 square feet of that 1 million square feet has an average term of over 13 years. So I don't think -- the fact that we saw that anomaly in the first quarter is really -- is indicative to a market trend or any tenant sentiment, it just happens to be unique to that bucket of deals and if we close the deals that we're working on right now then it'll be a radically different stat in the next quarter.","Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","That's helpful. And if I could follow up with one other question. Can you tell us what the underlying average coupon is on the loan book investments? I know the 11% in the supplemental is being inflated by some other income on a variety of different loans that was specific to the first quarter.","Marc Holliday","Coupon average -- we can come back to you with that answer.","Andrew W. Mathias","Josh, you're looking for a number excluding fees and things or are you looking for a straight -- like the rate on all of the positions?","Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes, exactly.","Andrew W. Mathias","Yes, we'll have to come back to you on that one.","Marc Holliday","Yes, I mean, we can give you that but I wouldn't say that upfront fees and rate are often looked at interchangeably by floating rate lenders. So if you strip out the fees, you'll get to a coupon. But it'll be underrepresented by maybe upwards of 25 basis points for the fee income. It could even be 50 basis points below what the real rate of return is because of the fee. Sometimes, there's entry and exit fees. It could be one in one out, 2 in one out, it could be extension fees. So we'll get you that number. But I would certainly -- there's really no difference between fees and rate in floating rate limit.","Andrew W. Mathias","And on that point, fees are recognized over the term of the loan so as we're looking at yield and recurring yield it's important to include the fees because regardless of whether we receive the fees upfront as an origination fee or at the end as an exit fee, we are amortizing those in over the life of the loan.","Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Right. No, I was just there -- there seems like there was a handful of loans with 16% and 17% yields that had very large one-time fees and I was just trying to, if you strip some of those larger items out, what the underlying rate is on the loan book?","Marc Holliday","Those are often times that we originate the whole loan and then sell pieces down and we retain a disproportionate share of the origination fees so that's why you get a large upfront fees. We'll take a look, I mean, I would think it's -- it largely is what it is. I mean, if the yield...","Andrew W. Mathias","There's some bigger deals that have some larger yields on them for specific reasons, 5 Times than 550 being 2. But yet otherwise, they're going to be...","Marc Holliday","No, when you say -- I just want to -- when you say there are bigger deals with bigger yields for specific -- those are just called more profitable deals. I mean, there's no anomaly there that was -- those were just, those were sharp deals and we had very high yield on certainly on 550. 5 Times, I can't speak to because maybe that was one where we have taken a reserve where we capture a reserve, so that should be carved out. But I would say the book you're looking at which is yielding 11% but for maybe 5 Times is the true replicable ongoing annual rate of return. The only one I could think of which would had an \"unusual or nonrecurring gain\" would've be 5 Times. And so, to I've that out but it still going to be somewhere between 10 and 11, I would think.","Andrew W. Mathias","That's right.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa from the ISI Group.","Stephen Sakwa","As you're kind of working through the 2013 leases, Steve, and you're starting to look out to next year, how do you think about some of the expirations like CS, HarperCollins, the AIG lease. Can you kind of give us any thoughts on redevelopment or how you're thinking about re-tenanting some of that space?","Steven M. Durels","Well, the 2 big ones or 2 of the big ones that you just mention, AIG and HarperCollins, so obviously, we're not expecting to renew them. We bought the buildings with full knowledge that they would not to be staying in the property. So those buildings are undergoing or redevelopment in the various stages right now. 10 East 53rd Street, we're finalizing the development plans and are deep into the construction documents at this point. That's going to be a small space building because of the size of the floor plates. So that'll lease-up more towards the end of the construction project, which in the majority, that work won't happen until Harper is out and they're not out until July of next year. AIG, which vacates middle of next year as well, there we're already seeing some expressions of interest. We've got one proposal on the table, we're expecting another RFP in the next week or so. We've got our development concept pretty well nailed down. And work will get underway and get well advanced this year and try to get as much of it done before AIG leaves. And I think, that, as contrasted to 10 East 53rd Street, is more likely to have 1 or 2 anchor tenants in the 150,000 to 200,000 square foot range and in the balance of the space will get leased up in smaller blocks.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And then secondly, I guess, Marc, can you maybe just talk about monetization of some assets, you've obviously have not been afraid to kind of buy stuff, fix it up, sell it and I'm just curious as you think about 1515 Broadway  and maybe some other assets in the portfolio and the liquid debt markets today and how you're thinking about asset sales?","Marc Holliday","Well, I think that we are putting a great degree of the focus in-house right now on trying to consummate one or more monetizations through year end. And I think we will achieve that, that is one of our stated goals for the year. I think it would may have been as much as $500 million or so of aggregate disposition. So it's selling well, selling at a very strong prize because you really -- we don't want to take just a sort of run-of-the-mill price, but I think we are looking really on these assets that are irreplaceable assets and irreplaceable locations. We really don't have any low hanging fruit anymore. Anything we sell is of an A Class institutional quality. We want to make sure that we're getting paid appropriately in this market and the demand seems to be there now, particularly after early December, I think, Andrew sort of identified the gridlock back in December and then right after that in the months that ensued, there's been about 3 or 4 sizable trades that have opened the door, we think, for us to accomplish our goals. So we will be delivering some product to the market. I don't think we're in a position, here on this call, to specifically identify which ones. I think that will become apparent over the next few months as deals get into the market. But it's definitely a focus of ours and we did something right at year end with 521 Fifth, which was a partial monetization. I think sold about 50% of that deal and that was very good execution for us. It was also a good execution for our partner because they bought into a very well-positioned Grand Central asset. So there'll be opportunities to recap, there'll be opportunities to do outright sale and what we're always looking about is case -- in situations like that, is not simply whether the building is leased or not leased, but what the internal growth metrics look like on kind of a compounded annual growth basis in NOI and how much capital these buildings require to get there. So we're looking at sub market, NOI growth and capital consumption, we'll target a few buildings and then hopefully, look to get couple of sales done this year.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And I guess would you be willing to go well above that $500 million if pricing kind of remains as strong or if not gets stronger?","Marc Holliday","Sure. Absolutely, yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line from Brendan Maiorana of Wells Fargo.","Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just on the other side of the disposition question, I guess, is the acquisition outlook for fee interest. And I think in your December presentation, I think you guys mentioned, maybe it was $700 million or $800 million of acquisitions that you were likely to do given that pricing's moved a bit early in the year, do you still kind of feel confident in that? Or would it be more likely to have more dispositions than acquisitions?","Andrew W. Mathias","No, I think a lot of our long-lead-time type transactions, we still have a healthy pipeline of those deals and they take a lot of time to mature. But we're working actively on bunch of different situations and I still think we feel comfortable with that guidance.","Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. I had 2, for Matt. Just the TI spend on Viacom. It looked like there's probably none of that in the quarter. Do you still expect that to happen during the year at $53 million?","Matthew DiLiberto","Yes, I mean, when we went long the expected Viacom spend in December, we've said we -- it's kind of out of our control, so we have put a number of between $50 million or $55 million. At this point, there is still no plan from them as to how to spend that this year. So we're still holding out in a manner of speaking, that money for them to spend this year in our guidance. But with it being out of our control, it's kind of unclear.","Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly, as we would think about expansion of net investments, if that were to happen during the year, should we assume that a portion of that would get funded via ATM issuance?","Matthew DiLiberto","Yes, so you're asking hypothetically if we grow the investment book, are we going to fund some equity [indiscernible]?","Marc Holliday","Well, I think that's...","Matthew DiLiberto","That's part of the asset sale program. We've been talking about, I think.","Marc Holliday","Right. Completely dependent on stock price.","Andrew W. Mathias","Yes. Completely [indiscernible]. And another source of a capital.","Marc Holliday","I think we're going to -- we would fund new investments with asset sales or stock issuance whether it's the ATM or otherwise. And we're sort of indifferent between the 2 executions, it's just depending on where asset prices are relative to stock price and underlying NAV. I said earlier in the year, and I would reiterate, I don't think our price is currently reflective of underlying NAV and we're very in touch and in tune to it. And the asset pricing right now is as strong as it's been, certainly since the downturn. And there are things at play which may create more demand from foreign investors, which could have a uplifting effect, further uplifting effect on prices, cap rates, which we had been sort of conservatively estimating at 5% for the past year, 1.5 years, are in reality, probably well below that for the best assets and the ones that are trading, are in fact, trading. So I don't -- you guys do the math on a regular basis. So when you do, I don't think that is what we currently see in our stock price. So I think that when we get out in time, we'll see what things look like then, we'll see what kind of -- if we achieve the kind of cap rates we would hope to achieve for our dispositions and just properly fund growth with the cheapest cost of capital we have available at that time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Coming back to the mezz portfolio, the opportunities, Andrew, I think you said were robust. Are the opportunities more of the origination's nature, similar to a 550 now?","Marc Holliday","Yes, I think it's a mix. We're not buying much in the secondary market, we're mostly originating our own paper these days. Some of that is -- were originating subordinate paper and then some of it were originating the whole capital stock as we did in Sony and syndicating off the big [ph] pieces.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","So, it's just a mix, its not necessarily more...","Marc Holliday","No.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. Could you walk us through sort of the economics on the junior mezz piece that you retained at 17.3%. I mean, I assume, there's a coupon rate on that and the rest of it, is the juice associated with having sold off the rest of the economic? What's the coupon rate on that piece?","Marc Holliday","Does that -- coupon rates are on the whole loan, right? There are no individual coupons or...","Andrew W. Mathias","The yield that ran 17% is essentially the rate, the effective rate on our piece so that's not on the entire position. There is enhancement through various fees as a result of our position having higher stack. But that will be taken over time. In fact, that 17% isn't even reflective of the full fee stream that we are entitled to. We will be recognizing a little bit more beginning the second quarter.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. But there's not a like a coupon rate or a strip rate on the piece -- on that piece of paper that you've retained and the rest is the fees? Or the [indiscernible] ?","Marc Holliday","Yes, I mean, we essentially originated the whole capital stock at LIBOR plus 5.60% and then sold a senior -- a mortgage position, we sold a senior mezzanine position, and we sold up a pari-passu junior mezzanine position and what was left after we sold all those pieces at varying rates was the 17% that you see, plus our share of origination fees.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. Just lastly, clarification maybe for Matt, just on the -- on Page 18, your joint venture statement balance sheet. There's a debt investment in there. I'm just curious of the nature of that and how that ends up on the joint venture side?","Andrew W. Mathias","Occasionally, I think this is maybe the only the second time we've done it. We will do a debt investment in the form of a joint venture. So literally set up as any other JV would be for a real estate property and for accounting purposes, that can't be included in our debt and preferred equity portfolio, it rolls down to the unconsolidated JV line item and then goes into the JV balance sheet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ross Nussbaum from UBS.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Can you talk a little bit about your acquisition efforts overall in terms of characterizing it such that are you spending a majority of your time looking at structured finance deals, as well as retail apartments versus sort of pure fee simple 5 cap office deals?","Marc Holliday","Well, I would say almost exclusively the time is spent looking at acquisitions. What happens is, of the acquisitions we don't pursue, we then turn them into -- attempt to turn them into structured finance opportunities. And that's why for us, this duality works so well. But it's everything, not everything, but generally, the business starts as evaluating acquisition opportunity, Sony, no different in that regard, nor some of these other deals we talked about today. And we pursue what we want to pursue and hopefully we prevail. And when we don't, and we like the business plan sponsorship or there's an opportunity, then we'll switch gears. And our debt folks will attempt to originate products. So I would say the orientation is always an equity orientation at the outset that can transform into or lending platform except for refinancing. So occasionally, we'll just get people on refinancings that will look to recap and the only opportunity is a debt opportunity so obviously, those would fall outside of what I just described. But that would be the minority of the situations.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And can you characterize how your underwriting on the structured finance deals exist today versus sort of where it was, let's say, back at the end of the last cycle. How different is your underwriting with respect to where you look at coverages and loan-to-values? And the returns you're getting in respect to that?","Marc Holliday","I think the senior loan underwriting is still enormously conservative versus where it was at the end of the last cycle. So that -- and then each of the tranche is subordinate to the senior loan, therefore, is significantly less levered. Whereas senior loans used to be at 80%, 85%, even 90% loan to cost, now you're seeing, still seeing senior loan top out in the -- between 50% and call it, 65% loan to cost depending on the building and the cash flow profile. So you still have -- the mezzanine positions are still significantly less levered today than they were at the end of the last cycle.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Knott from Green Street Advisors.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Marc or Steve, just curious can you comment on the 96% year end occupancy goal? I think last call, you labeled it, maybe, a little bit of a stretch and it sounds like there's a lot of new leasing that's coming but just curious, how you feel about that and since the  occupancy was flat sequentially?","Steven M. Durels","I think we're still optimistic that we're going to hit our number. We're ahead of budget in the first quarter based upon the leases that we've signed to date. I think we've got better velocity than we were anticipating at this moment in time when we originally set our budget. So I think the only question will be how the year unfolds and the deals that we signed, is it occupancy, or is it really based upon the amount of square footage that's been leased. But for whatever reason the tenant demand that comes in, their start date trails into the following year. So -- but I think the effect of our ability to close enough leases to lock down the buildings are going to get us to the number that we want to be at.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So whether it's 9 months from now or whether it's maybe 12 months from now, you still feel pretty good about gaining almost 200 basis points in occupancy.","Steven M. Durels","Exactly, you nailed it.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","And then, can you talk about the price point orientation in terms of leasing. It sounds like maybe there's been a little bit of a shift where it's not just the value-oriented tenants that are signing deals? Is the recovery you're seeing a little more broad-based than going higher up the food chain, if you will, to the higher end building as well?","Steven M. Durels","I guess that's true only because we've been the beneficiary of a couple of deals. Certainly, 280 Park Avenue, those deals that we just -- 2 deals that we just signed for 99,000 square feet, those were high price point deals that the 10-year average rent on that square footage was over $98 a square foot. And that's in the base of the building. We've seen a little bit better activity at 600 Lexington Avenue where we recently went to lease on 2 floors and we got the green light to do an early renewal on the floor and we're expecting another tenant to give us a green light for a new deal for another full floor in the next week or so. So that's picked up a little bit. But I'm a little hesitant to say that that's anything other than I don't know if that's a broad statement that I'd say about the confidence as the high price point guides back in the market. I still think the lion's share of the deals are on the value side of the demand.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of John Guinee from Stiefel.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","John Guinee here. Just to sort of come to closure on this whole -- half the calls have been on the structured finance book. Perhaps, it would be a good idea if you considered, instead of just giving 1 line item, $52.7 million, bifurcated that out into cash, accruals, fees and gains, and I think you you'd solve about 90% of the problems in understanding what's going on there. That's not a question, obviously, just a thought. My question is, refresh our memories as to what's going on at 885 Third Avenue, selling the ground lease position and also, what's the status on the West Coast office portfolio?","Marc Holliday","On the 885 Third Avenue, that is a position we've been testing the market on and we've seen very good interest from people in the market and we continue to have discussions with various groups. I think the interest has confirmed our suspicion that the value of the position is sort of well in excess of where the street is carrying its NAV. And just not -- we're not sure yet whether the interest is going to reach a level where we're sellers or not -- we have to sort of complete the process to see. But the response from the market has been very strong. Wait, on the...","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","[indiscernible] office, when -- can you guys get out of that anytime soon? Is that earning any income for your 27% interest right now?","Marc Holliday","This is the West Coast deal?","Andrew W. Mathias","Yes.","Marc Holliday","Well, we'll going to let David Schonbraun, who is here with us, who specifically sort of oversees that portfolio with Blackstone, address that.","David Schonbraun","Sure. I think we transitioned management a couple of months ago to Blackstone and we had very good leasing philosophy. So I think we're comfortable with the progress and kind of with new management, we're expecting kind of the occupancy upticks in the portfolio and I think were going to try to monetize assets over the period, some on the next year then just depending on where that market is and depending on just cap rates, work with Blackstone to kind of monetize as efficiently as possible. But we're definitely going to sell some assets in the next 6 to 12 months.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","But is that -- David, is that generating any income to you at all? Should we look at it as part of the NOI or should we just look at it as being close to book value in order to value it appropriately?","David Schonbraun","I think our share of NOI rent is up $4 million or so.","Marc Holliday","[indiscernible] .","Marc Holliday","But it's primarily a residual. Right, would you say? I mean, this is -- this portfolio, I think, is at 70%, 80% leased.","David Schonbraun","It's a little less than 80% occupied. So I think -- right now, it's a residual but obviously as they lease it up and there's significant amount of vacancy, we expect that to increase significantly.","Marc Holliday","But the early read is the price talk on the few assets that have been exposed to some market participants is our underwriting is on or ahead of schedule.","David Schonbraun","Correct.","Marc Holliday","So, we'll -- I think we'll have to more to report on that in -- by year end. That was -- that had 3-year business plan, we just closed it a few months ago. So hopefully, by year-end, we will have more to talk about on that. But it is -- it's certainly not intended to be a hold investment. So, in answer to your question, John, I think, yes, we're looking to liquefy. But -- and optimize because the portfolio is actually doing reasonably well.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Let me just ask that a little -- great feedback, thank you. Just to clarify, is it generating any earnings that show off on your income statement or not? Or should we -- or should it be looked at on a book value basis because it's not generating any income?","Matthew DiLiberto","John, it's Matt. So, it generated just over $4 million our share of NOI in the quarter, net of interest. It had free cash flow of $2 million. So to answer your question of whether it hit the income statement, it was $2 million of contribution to our earnings in the quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Schaffer from Sandler O'Neill.","Andrew Schaffer","One question. It's in regards to 2 buildings that you just bought in Williamsburg. I was wondering if you're considering to do some counter deals to sell them off or just solely to rent them?","Matthew DiLiberto","There is a townhouse component of that project, which we intend to sell off as condos because they don't set it very well for family rentals. The balance of the project will be rented out as multifamily. So sales office is open, we're getting great response and the first residents are moving to the building shortly.","Operator","And your final question is a follow-up from the line of Michael Bilerman from Citi group.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I completely second John's motion on the disclosure. But I do have a question. Matt, just in terms of the guidance, the $4.90 to $5, given the loan book, I think in those numbers is $1.50 of FFO with  $1.3 billion investment at a 10% yield, you're at a north of a $1.4 billion at 11% yield, of $1.70 of earnings. I guess how should we think about guidance for the year?","Andrew W. Mathias","At this point, we did have a lot of discussion about guidance [indiscernible]. At this point, we are keeping guidance unchanged at $4.90 to $5. Based on the performance in the first quarter, you would see a trend towards higher end of that but we do have some other things kicking around, not the least of which is the sale of 885. So we are leaving it unchanged for right now.","Marc Holliday","Yes. I'll add to that, Matt. Part of our guidance assumes additional investment. I think that's -- I want to make sure that comes across that we don't we run a static book. We don't assume that whatever we start the year with, we end the year with and we just increased with the market. There are -- that's not our profile, there are other companies that serve that niche. But in our guidance, we look at our liquidity and capacity at the beginning of the year. We set certain goals for ourselves and investments and in structured book, and they are somewhat interchangeable. So we may end up with a slightly higher structured book, maybe a smaller amount of equity investment. So again, there's a lot of interchangeability. But a portion of that $4.90 to $5 was on a presumed return on a fairly sizable amount of new investments because that's what we are accustomed to accept in the times of the market cycle where we say we're on the sidelines, which wasn't this December. So the fact that we're executing on that plan and we may be a little over allocated momentarily in one versus another instance, I wouldn't -- we don't revise guidance quarterly. We revise it when we see need a need to revise it. At the moment, we're comfortable with $4.90 to $5, if we see a need to revise it, we will. But we've been, I think pretty good in the past about our guidance projections and good about adjusting when we see need to. But at the moment, we haven't adjusted it.","Okay. Well, I just want to thank everyone for calling in today. I hope everybody likes this somewhat different format with abbreviated formal remarks and leaving more time for Q&A because the calls were running 1.5 hour, 1 hour and 45 minutes, and we think that was too long for some. And we know you have a full plate with other companies. So we thank you for your hour of attention, and we look forward to speaking to you next quarter.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference.

We're pleased that all of you have joined us on this gorgeous day in New York City and we're even happier that we were able to put out yet another quarter of strong operating results and market-leading capital transactions. Our second quarter results continue a trend in 2016 of surprising to the upside in leasing velocity and rental achievement. We executed another 620,000 square feet of Manhattan office leases highlighted by the recently announced expansion of Bloomberg in 919 Third Avenue and the renewal and expansion of New York Life at Graybar Building.

And that is on about 1.5 million square feet of leasing during six months. I think it speaks for itself as an extraordinary accomplishment. Velocity continues even into the month of July with another 84,000 square feet of leasing in office in Manhattan and just the past three weeks at an 18% mark-to-market inclusive of the recent Omnicom renewal at 220 East 42nd Street. In terms of forecasting these leasing trends for the remainder of the year, I would not that the best indicator of what those results are likely to trend towards would be our current leasing pipeline. That current pipeline stands today at about 1.6 million square feet, the vast majority of which is comprised of leases pending or leases out for signature and notably the mark to market on all of this pipeline deals exceeds 20%.","So, fortunately for shareholders and unfortunately for Steve Durels and his leasing team, we must and are increasing our full-year guidance for completed Manhattan office leases to 2.6 million square feet for the full year and mark to market on those leases which are replacement leases to 22% mark to market. So, numbers that in each case are fairly significantly ahead of where we were in December. That sound you just heard was Steve hitting the floor. You can pick yourself up, Steve. Let's just put the best face on it and go forward, okay? And this manner we provide additional motivation and encouragement to our leasing and operations team to execute at the highest level of consistence with this Firm's culture of hard work and outperformance.","These leasing results in our projection of second half performance is driven by continual demand for high-quality, well located, reasonably priced office space which descriptively, is the sweet spot of our entire portfolio. Midtown space continues to be in high demand as the vacancy rate decreased 10 basis points to 9.2% and sublease space in midtown stands at only 2.9 million square feet, near historical lows over the past eight or nine years for its sublease space -- very important barometer. We haven't talked about that on the last few conference calls, but we're talking about sublease space midtown that is about 1.1% of total inventory.","So very, very low. Job creation in the financial security sector is roughly flat for the year, I think contrary to market perspective that there has been some substantial contraction in this sector, it is actually I think only down about 1,000 jobs year to date which on that job basis is essentially zero. But interestingly the fire sector, finance, insurance, real estate, is accounting for much of the first half leasing activity in midtown and elsewhere. Healthcare is also making a reasonably good showing, but I would say Financial Services had an above average showing in the first half of the year. That activity, whether it is the fire sector, healthcare or otherwise, is driven by jobs and job creation. Unfortunately the June New York City job numbers are not out yet, they are going to be out imminently. We would have hoped to have had them for the call but we don't. But if it is any indicator the national numbers that came out from Bureau of Labor Statistics for June were quite strong relative to May and earlier.","And we're hopeful that the New York City numbers will follow in form the national numbers. In part it is almost self-fulfilling because the end of the Verizon strike in and of itself will probably put back on the roles of the city I think 3,000 plus jobs in June. So we're just hoping that -- and more growth on top of that. But we will see shortly. So that is a quick snapshot of the leasing picture. I'm sure you guys will have questions as we go forward. But I also want to make sure we touch upon the investment side of the portfolio. We did complete some important divestitures during the quarter including the Citigroup headquarters building sale, 33 Beekman sale and sales of a suburban property in Greenwich. ","The proceeds of the significant capital transactions went to pay down debt and invest in certain new opportunities including a 20% stake in a recently completed residential product on the west side known as Sky and additional investment in the debt and preferred equity portfolio. On the topic of DPE, we're still on track reaffirm our December guidance that for year end balances we'll be just shy of $2 billion, about $1.95 billion of balance and contribution for the year should be on the order of about $200 million of gross revenues from that book of business. We have sizable identified pipeline of deals that we expect to close during the second half of the year carrying retained spreads of approximately 9.9% for that pipeline book of business which is higher than first half's achievement. But when blended will certainly exceed the 8.5% that was used in our earnings guidance back in December and then our earnings revision at the first quarter.","So that is a very I would say positive story and a good market for us to be conducting our business with on the lending side as well as on the equity owned real estate side. We have been market leaders in the provision of subordinate debt capital for large and small New York City commercial projects for years and years. We established that position by being the most active lender in that market I guess for nearly 20 years. So there is a reputation and franchise and knowledge of the business which I think you will see has been paying off over the years and will be a shining example through the balance of this year.","With excellent visibility at this point into our remaining 2016 production and performance, given there is only 5.5 months to go, our focus will naturally turn to 2017 and beyond. In order to meet our stated objective of delivering market-leading recurring earnings growth and sector leading total return to shareholder growth we have positioned our investment portfolio to generate substantial increases in NOI through leasing up the remainder of the growth portfolio and taking advantage of the embedded rental mark to market in our stabilized office and retail portfolios. These engines of growth should enable us to continue to deliver sector leading increases in FFO over the next three to five years and this is before accounting for the earnings contributions from 1 Vanderbilt.","Speaking of 1 Vanderbilt, we're on track with this iconic development project with the site now almost 100% cleared of the four older buildings that formally occupied the site. Heavy equipment has rolled in to complete the removal of the last two floors and in three weeks we will have a clean site ready to be excavated and foundations poured. Extraordinary amount of credit goes to our construction and operations team for undertaking over the past year what we believe to be the largest surgical demolition of commercial buildings in decades and it was done on time, on budget and in a safe manner and New York City is better for it.","There is barely a day that goes by where I don't get a comment from somebody who sees how that site is now being transformed in a way to upgrade the appreciation you have of these great landmark properties that surround the site like Grand Central and Chrysler and Lincoln and others. By allowing what will replace those buildings, the new building having setbacks to the property line and a tapered form to let and maximum light and air -- enormous benefit to the city, to the skyline and to this Company by adding this extraordinary building to our portfolio.","Our financing arrangements for that $1.5 billion construction loan are on track as we've signed a final term sheet with a consortium of five lenders and we will look to have the loan fully committed and closed by the end of the third quarter. You also saw we took advantage of interest rates by entering into a $300 million swap, a seven-year term swap. And what is interesting to note is that in the past two Decembers Andrew Mathias quick write up on the screen, another engine of earnings growth which I think doesn't get the proper amount of due which is not top-line revenue growth but bottom-line debt service savings.","And we showed that there was an extraordinary amount of mark-to-market savings that we could achieve over the next three to five years in our debt to book by having rates just basically stay roughly where they were when we went through that analysis in December. In fact, rates have fallen since then, so I would imagine the opportunity for us at this moment exceeds the $30 million or $40 million per year annually that we have forecasted at that point. And these swaps are just one point of evidence of how we can take advantage of that because the rate we locked in for seven years is actually lower than the floating rate we had forecasted for the year. Recall we always model LIBOR curve plus 50 basis points. And Matt, what was it 1.13%?","Matt DiLiberto","1.14%.","Marc Holiday","1.14% we locked in for seven years is actually below that floating rate amount and now locked in for seven years. So clearly we're going to be intensely focused on these kinds of opportunities with the rest of our debt portfolio to take advantage of rates, lock in these sort of historical lows where we can and where it is prudent to do so. And wind up hopefully creating a fourth measure of earnings growth on the debt service expense savings side.","So, I feel like we're firing on all cylinders, I said that last quarter. I feel like the cylinders are still properly functioning. I feel very good about our positioning in the market for the present and for the future. Our same-store portfolio is 97.4% leased, our leverage levels are the lowest in the Company's history and getting better. Our liquidity exceeds $1.5 billion.","We expect to have little or no line of credit balance outstanding by year end based on projections for balance of year. We have substantial store houses of growth embedded in the portfolio which I mentioned. And we're on track to develop the greatest building in New York City. So with that I would like to open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of David Toti with BB&T. Your line is open.","David Toti","Just want to touch on the sort of tenant mindset from your perspective. You have got a bunch of big leases expiring in the next year or two and the market has been a little bit jittery. Have you noticed any change in attitude in renewal conversations or new tenant conversations in the last quarter or two?","Marc Holiday","Steve will address the tenant mindset and\/or mood. But I would want to go back to the supplemental while Steve is answering. I think we have very little in the way of not even large expirations, very little in the way of expirations in the next -- for the balance of this year and next year. So, something we have done and we have done with like a single minded focus is to do a lot of not just current leasing but forward leasing. The only way we could lease 2.6 million square feet this year when we only had like 1 or 1.2 million square feet rolling is by putting to bed what could be either exposure opportunity in 2016, 2017, 2018. So we will look back. Just I want to make sure we're clear. We have very little in the way of rollover exposure for the balance of this year and next year. But with that said, Steve, what is the thought?","Steve Durels","I think that the feedback we're getting from tenants today is no different than what we were getting a year ago. The general mood from the tenants that we speak to is they feel good about their businesses, they think they are in a healthy position. I think it depends on the type of industry you are talking about as to how bullish they are. But most people are still in the mindset of expanding their businesses, making capital commitments as far as restacking or rebuilding and changing how they like to use their space and I don't think that is ever going to go away for the next several years to come because it is a bit of a cultural thing.","And tenants -- we have continued to see tenants that in 2017\/2018 expirations, a willingness to engage in early renewals. And as Marc touched on, a lot of the sort of outperformance on the leasing velocity within our portfolio is a combination of filling vacancy but also tenants' willingness to step up and do early renewals. And in the 1.6 million square feet that is in our pipeline there are some very meaty deals inside that pipeline which we hope to have success on before the end of the year.","David Toti","And if I could just follow up with a quick follow up. I know we have asked -- Marc, we have asked you this before about the presence of we work in the New York City market now occupying close to 3 million square feet by some estimates and recently demonstrating some weakness in revenues or in profits. Does that concern you at all as that member gets larger and larger in the market? And I'm thinking back to the late 1990s when we saw a number of sort of WeWork-like tenants kind of disappeared during periods of economic weakness. Does that present incremental risk in the market in your mind?","Marc Holiday","Yes. I don't know that it is accurate to compare WeWork to the other tenants you mentioned -- I forget what period you mentioned, but I guess maybe 2000 or whatever. What was that?","Matt DiLiberto","Late 1990s.","Marc Holiday","Late 1990s, 2000.","David Toti","Yes, I'm old enough to remember that far back at this point.","Marc Holiday","Yes and we were there too. So it is a different company with a different model, a very successful model and a model that is attracting an enormous amount of financial support. So to me the difference between companies -- not just for actual office companies or full service communities like WeWork that do their business, but really any Company to write there any period downturn is simply -- well not simply -- but is in large part capacity and liquidity.","So I think that if any of these companies are capitalized properly and WeWork looks to be like they are, then these downturns in New York tend to be short-lived. Downturn doesn't mean things like go to zero. Downturns in York may just be marginal rent reductions of 10%, 15%, 20%. I think that the model we have seen them execute in this market is sort of best of class and I think that is generally perceived to be such when you look at the landlords that are doing business looking to WeWork is sort of in many cases a prime tenant.","So it doesn't give us concerned, 3 million square feet for any tenant on a 400 million square foot inventory; I don't want to be too dismissive but it is not like 3 million square feet in a 100 million square foot market. This market is four times that size. And therefore we don't -- it is not something that keeps us up at night.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","John Kim","So the Brexit vote happened, that was a surprise to many. Has your business changed at all on the leasing or the investment side since the vote?","Marc Holiday","As a result of Brexit has it changed on the leasing or investment? Not that I have seen.","Steve Durels","No, I haven't seen it on the leasing side and I haven't gotten any kind of feedback either from the brokerage community or tenants that -- maybe a year or two from now we will see something but there is nothing in today's conversation.","Andrew Mathias","I would say on the investment side we haven't seen any change. There is some expectation that New York will draw even more capital interest as London is less attractive for foreign investment. It's still too early to tell on that front. We're monitoring the deals that are in the market now and certainly values are holding up or even taking another step forward. But it is too early to sort of tie that to Brexit or not.","John Kim","Okay and my second question is on your leasing pipeline. I was wondering if 1 Vanderbilt was a component of that and if so how much?","Steve Durels","No, in that 1.6 million nothing is directly connected to 1 Vanderbilt, nor would we expect it to be. We're 4 plus years out before we're delivering the building. And although we're actively presenting the building, we're early to the game. And we have got a stretch goal for the Company to do some leasing this year of about 200,000 square feet. But like in every year, we have a list of goals and then we have stretch goals because we push ourselves to outperform and we're working hard at it, but nothing to announce yet.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Vincent Chao","Just wondering on the leasing activity that you have done for the quarter here, you guys have posted some very good results here in the first half. The pipeline actually I think is a little bit bigger than what you talked about last quarter. But that seems a little bit at odds with some of the market reports that we see. I'm just curious if you had any thoughts on why you are performing so much more than the overall market.","Marc Holiday","Well, I would ask you the question why should we only perform at the market? I mean we're better at this [Technical Difficulty]. I hope that doesn't sound boastful but--.","Andrew Mathias","97 plus occupied in a market that is 91% occupied.","Marc Holiday","Yes so I mean, I think it sort of speaks for itself. We like to think of ourselves as having among the best platforms in New York City in executing these kind of deals. So there is a wide disparity of buildings and ownership groups that comprise the 400 million square feet of inventory in the city. I hope we're, if not the best, among the best, but I like to think we're the best. And as a result we I think have an unusual scale and footprint in the city, almost 30 million square feet of real estate.","So, we're able kind of leverage position to maximize our relationships with tenants, partners, lenders and vendors to keep this portfolio 97.5% leased. Maximize our rents. Keep our TIs, leasing concessions low. I don't think anybody mentioned that, but I think it is worthy of mentioning. I think we were about $26 a foot or $30 a foot, thereabout, for the quarter. So quite efficient I think in terms of how we executed the business. And that is our calling card.","Steve Durels","Let me just add to it. I think the market is better than those reports are actually indicating as well. A lot of the market reports that get printed are lag reality. And we're in a better market than statistically that is being reported as evidenced by some of the deals that we're working on that we think are going to close in the third quarter as evidenced by some of the deals that closed at the very end of the second quarter. So we're ahead of the market, we're doing well, but I think the market is better than what's actually in those reports.","Vincent Chao","And then just maybe going back to the Brexit question just in a different angle. I'm being I guess it is still very early days in terms of what is going on and what the impacts might look like. But I guess does this pique your interest at all in looking at London again?","Marc Holiday","I think it sort of reinforces our strategy which is questioned from time to time, of wanting to be sort of the sharpshooter in one market. I think we attempted to not just -- it wasn't it by accident we chose to do $25 billion of business in one market, it was designed to be done in what we thought was the market that had the best liquidity, stability, transparency, depth of market participants, Fortune 500 tenants. London I think exhibits many of those trades, but I think New York is a better market going in. ","And I don't think there is any more desire on our part to diversify into that market or other markets which we would almost deem as like adverse diversification. So there is plenty for us to do in this city both in office, retail, multi, debt and preferred equity. We have got actually quite a full plate. And while there may be some good opportunities in London that emerge, my guess is that will be taken advantage of by people who have or groups that have significant footprints in that market.","So, I wouldn't think so, but not something we have looked at all that closely at the moment. Shareholders start asking us to take a look at it, maybe we will become more focused, but it is not a topic.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lewis with SunTrust. Your line is open.","Michael Lewis","So, whether it is the reports from the brokers or Street FFO estimates, you topped expectations in the second quarter. And I'm just curious about your guidance for the full year. Are you expecting -- I guess I could back up. Was this better than your expectations for 2Q? And then do you expect any kind of slow down the rest of the year?","Matt DiLiberto","So the quarter was on expectations maybe slightly better, it was a really solid quarter, solid first six months of the year. We obviously always want to be accurate in our guidance, conservative and prudent. And as we look out over the balance of the year and where we reset guidance only three months ago which was pretty unusual only three months into the year to adjust. Feel-good with the range, you have to keep an eye on a couple things that we have out there, not the least of which is the potential impact of the Aeropostale situation at 1515 Broadway which has not yet resolved itself, that may have an impact. And so at this point we felt it was prudent to keep the FFO guidance for the moment unchanged.","Michael Lewis","Okay. And then my follow-up, I'm not sure how much you could say on this, but on 1 Vanderbilt, the decision to JV or not sell a JV interest and then kind of the timing of that, how do you think about the risk\/reward of mitigating some of the lease up risk? Maybe you JV early, maybe you wait and try to get a better pricing as it is closer to stabilization? Or is it still too early to talk about that?","Marc Holiday","Well, what we said in December and reiterated on the last call and I guess I will say again now, just as a refresher, all focus right now is on closing out that loan, as I think it should be. I think the first order of business and an important part of the overall capitalization of this project is to get a properly structured priced $1.5 billion construction loan facility closed which we've been working intensely hard on for several months now. And it looks like we're nearing the conclusion point and hope to have that closed in the next 60 to 75 days.","So I think along the way we have begun to have conversations with equity investors, I would say all of which have gone exceedingly well in terms of receptivity of these various institutional players who have the capacity to fund a deal like this and have the desire to be a part of development projects which are kind of best building, best market, best location. With that said there are certain signals from our shareholders and analysts about trying to expedite, do it rapidly. We're not on that approach. It is a bad approach, we don't want to -- I think. I mean it is just there's no exact right or wrong, but we think that for a project like this we should see the whole market and there is going to be a lot of different opportunities out there, different structures, different amounts, different kind of the yield enhancements available to this Company.","We're working very closely with Heinz in this regard. I would say by the end of this year we will have covered -- I don't know, maybe 40 of the top domestic and foreign investors in the world for a project like this. And then we will try and zero in and grind it down to the right partner for a project like this. You don't want the wrong partner. You want to make sure this is the absolute right partner, shares a long term vision, has the capacity to fund side-by-side all the way through the project. And has a real deep love and affection for this project. I'm confident we will get there as I was confident we would find the -- pull together the debt financing. It is not -- this is not like an urgent track, it is not on a fast track. It is on what I would call kind of a responsible track for a project like this.","Remember there is very little money spend right now, I keep reinforcing the fact that most of the money spend begins middle of 2017 when you start going vertical in the project. We have kind of fully -- the site is unencumbered, we have no partners, we will be funding whatever remains in demo and excavation just out of cash flow between now and year end. And then we get to do some initial loan draws where our expectation is we will be able to do initial loan draws on the loan facility to basically prime the pump for 2017.","So we have time, we think the market is coming our way because as rates drop and you have things like Brexit which take a fairly attractive and competitive market and maybe puts it on the sidelines for a year or two, I think we will be the beneficiary of seeing, at least temporarily if not permanently, some excess investment dollars searching for projects like 1 Vanderbilt. And I think it is our job to take advantage of that. So, we're proceeding apace and we will definitely keep you apprised. But I have said I didn't expect much in the way of announceable events on the JV side in 2016, I would probably reiterate that at this point.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neil. Your line is open.","Alexander Goldfarb","Marc, maybe just following up on 1 Vande. On the closing of the loan what is left to be done? And then in the loan are there pre-leasing hurdles or do they -- do the lenders have a say on who the JV partner is?","Marc Holiday","You know what, out of respect for the lenders they were kind enough to let us give you guys a glimpse to the fact that -- how far along we were and the fact that we selected the lenders and we signed the term sheet. We're not at this point at liberty to get into any terms of the deal nor would we until it is closed. So hopefully on the next call which I guess is October, we will be able to share with you at that point the answer to that question, we will make note of that and put it in the prepared remarks, Matt, please.","And other questions I'm sure you will have at that point. I would say suffice it to say we look at it as a very good piece of financing that is in all respects equal or -- well, really consistent with our business plan in all respects, not just in pricing but in things as it relates to funding and etc. So we're going to just get that done and then hopefully on the next call we will be able to share with you some details.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay, but Marc, can you just at least say are the still things that you -- like documents that you still have to go over with the lenders? Or is it just a matter of lawyers going over the loan document before it is signed in 60 days?","Marc Holiday","I'm not sure. We're documenting the deal, so I mean that is the whole 60, 75 and we're at the point of a term sheet. And now the term sheet has -- not you document and close. So that is where we're. It is not like documents are in escrow. But it is [indiscernible] fairly customary.","Alexander Goldfarb","And then the second question is there was the article in the Post this morning on 650 Fifth and the court stopping the seizure or at least on part of the building. How does this impact you guys?","Marc Holiday","We do not see any impact to our leasehold position there which was fully approved at the time we signed the lease by the party who is now contesting the government's claim.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay, so you guys still have 100% control with your JV partner on the retail part?","Marc Holiday","Correct.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Manny Korchman with Citi. Your line is open.","Manny Korchman","Maybe if we just think about the investment environment in New York City overall. Have you seen buyer pools or buyer appetites change to date? I know, Marc, you talked about Brexit potentially driving more money towards New York. But have you seen any of the opposite given sort of the turbulence in the stock markets?","Andrew Mathias","I think it is still a little bit too early to tell. I mean we're seeing values hold up to take a step forward even in certain cases. But it is too early to tell whether those buyers are sort of forum shopping and would have otherwise been investing in London but are now investing in New York or if it is just the natural flows of capital we have been talking about consistently which are really -- continue to drive values in New York. So just not sure if it is situational or if it is more just the overall trend we have been tracking.","Manny Korchman","And then if you think about just rents at 1 Vanderbilt, I know it is early, I know you are not under the gun to get leasing done today. If you think about rents went you first announced the project you first thought about the project to where they are now to where they will be when you sign, what has the trajectory of those been?","Marc Holiday","Well, we put rents up in December and our whole approach was to price the building in 2021 at rents that are consistent with what the best buildings are getting in the city today. So we viewed that very conservatively because our pro formas are based on I guess what you would say no growth in those rents over five or six years off of today's best rents. Even though this building will as a physical -- as physical space and infrastructure, sustainability and views and ceiling heights and column free nature will be far in excess of most of those buildings considered their best buildings. We just kind of priced it based off of today's rents and those rents are going to go up and down over the next five, six years.","We mentioned earlier the bulk of the leasing we expect to occur I guess probably 2018 and beyond. So the real question is, what is the market then? We feel very good about the project's positioning and the rent positioning of the project where we sit today, not just where we sat in December. And we might be conservative, we might not be, but I don't think we're aggressive and the returns are such that even if the rents are 3% to 5% off, the deal returns for a development site of this quality are still far, far in excess of baseline returns.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Jamie Feldman","Can you talk more about the D&PE pipeline? It looks like you are trending kind of in-line with your guidance midway through the year. We haven't seen a slowdown in transaction activity this year. Just maybe help us understand what is in the pipeline and what gives you guys comfort you will hit your numbers?","Marc Holiday","I'm trying to think how we can -- we certainly are not going to advertise for our competitors the deals where in pipe. What kind of information could we give you other than the volume of that pipeline?","Jamie Feldman","Well, I guess just thinking through maybe how the balance could end up in the third quarter and fourth quarter. I think you are trending down the first two quarters of the year from the fourth quarter run rate.","Marc Holiday","It's very hard, what if something closes like a day after the third quarter ends? It is very hard to predict sort of daily closings. It is easier over a six-month period. If you are saying, hey, what is going to close in September because not much will be this summer I would expect. How much would you expect sort of--?","Matt DiLiberto","I think the balances should be I think up for the next quarter. I don't think they will be down; they are likely to be up and possibly up meaningfully in the next quarter.","Jamie Feldman","I guess another way to ask it is like just thinking about where you were at the Investor Day and the pipeline you had then. Is it pretty much the same pipeline or has the market changed and you are finding different opportunities?","Marc Holiday","The pipeline stage is like weekly, monthly. There are deals on the sheet none of which existed in December of 2015. Financing deals are not like real -- real estate deals can take anywhere -- they can take one, two, three years to ferment. Transactional activity financings are typically -- have a three to four month shelf life kind of thing. So none of this was an pipe in December, this is all brand-new product. That which we projected to close in first half we closed already. You saw we sold a lot of product because if we don't syndicate then we're going to be far in excess of our balances at year end.","So we may originate over the second half of the year well over $1 billion. But the real issue is not what are we going to close, it is what are we going to retain. We control that, Jamie. So that is how we could be highly confident of hitting our goals. When we have a pipeline that might be $1 billion to $1.5 billion and we're only looking to originate and retain maybe $600 million, $700 million, $800 million between now and then at most.","So we control the brake and accelerator on our decision, how much and when to syndicate. We could syndicate less. But I think the issue we will have is not your issue of, hey, are we going to be able to originate the business? It is going to be, syndicating ferociously to keep the balance within and below the $2 billion mark, that I would say is more of a challenge.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. And then what about the quality of the deals? Are you saying you have to get more aggressive here given fewer transactions in the market?","Marc Holiday","Less aggressive. The competition is less right now. When the competition is less you have got your pick of the deals.","Andrew Mathias","As we outlined last quarter, the syndicated bank market has backed up this year so they are not as aggressive. CMBS took a pause, it is coming back -- the market is coming back now strong, but that gave us an opportunity to lock up some very attractive originations with great risk return profile for us we feel.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. And then can you give an update on Aeropostale, just where things stand today?","Andrew Mathias","They filed bankruptcy, we're in bankruptcy court obviously making claims for the rent we're owed and we're marketing the space.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore. Your line is open.","Steve Sakwa","Marc, could you just comment a little bit more about the leveraging? I know at one point you had a number of assets on the market for sale. So just trying to think through as you grow the loan book, but also want to try and take leverage down. Just kind of help us think through sources and uses over the back half of the year, please.","Marc Holiday","The sales at least as part of what we talked about in December have been completed. So with the completion of Citigroup and 33 and West Putnam.","Andrew Mathias","Lipstick closed earlier.","Marc Holiday","And Lipstick -- and there were other closings earlier in the year, the three that just closed in this quarter. So that now is -- brings us on a pro forma basis to about 7.5 times debt to EBITDA by year end. And that forecast of 7.5 for yearend already had incorporated in it the growing of the portfolio by $150 million from 1.8 last year to 1.950 this year. So that $150 million of incremental growth was part of the forecast that gets us to the 7.5. So it is all still on plan. By the way, $150 million here doesn't move the needle like a 10th of a basis point. But it is in there just to answer your question directly, it is accounted for. And so, where it looks like as we sit now we're right where we hope to be at year end.","Steve Sakwa","Okay and then I guess for Matt, just to be clear on the guidance. I mean I know you are not changing numbers, but if we take your six-month figures and we back off some of the one times in the quarter including the promote, you are kind of around $1.70 run rate. A, I just want to make sure that that kind of jives with your number. And that I guess if you were to kind of look at the six-month numbers and begin to back off some of the one time and take the $1.70 as a run rate you are kind of in that $7 range. Does that math kind of make sense?","Matt DiLiberto","Yes, the $7 is squarely the midpoint of our normalized guidance, the second quarter had big one timers in it, it also had 2.5 months of Citi because we didn't close that deal until June 10. There are a couple of things we had 1515 Broadway's percentage rent for $3 million and it is a low expense quarter as every second quarter is, but it is better than we expected. So you run all that through and you get to a run rate that gets you to that $7 midpoint and [Technical Difficulty].","Steve Sakwa","Okay, so you would say that the $1.69 is kind of a clean run rate as we kind of move into the back half of the year?","Matt DiLiberto","Again, adjusting for you add $0.16 of Citi contribution into one -- I will call it [Technical Difficulty] that's obviously gone away for the third and fourth quarters.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of John Guinee with Stifel. Your line is open.","John Guinee","Just a quick clean-up question, then a leasing question. It looks like you had booked a $206 million gain on 388, 390, but then your gain on sale of real estate and discontinued ops is about $197 million. Is there a gap there for any reason or is there some complexities I just don't understand?","Matt DiLiberto","I wouldn't say there are complexities that you don't understand. But obviously there are other items beside just that one gain that we have to run through that line item, so it just comes through adjustments.","John Guinee","And any losses on any sales recently or not?","Matt DiLiberto","The 500 West Putnam sale is noted in the depreciable real estate reserves, that is that number -- I think it is around $10 million.","John Guinee","And then I guess for Steve just a little nuance on the world of leasing. You are quoting sort of a full-year 22% cash mark to market -- maybe this is Matt's question. What does the math look like if you did a GAAP mark to market for the year? And then what does the mark to market look like on a net rent basis versus a gross rent basis? Do you guys have any sense for those kind of escalations?","Matt DiLiberto","Well okay, I want to make sure -- that was like four questions so I've got to ? we're all busily writing here. The first one is GAAP, right?","John Guinee","Yes.","Matt DiLiberto","The question is if 22% is cash do we know what GAAP is. So I guess we always, we can maybe formulate that, I don't think we have it, John. We always look at the best representative of spot market -- spot market increase is the current cash rent versus the immediately preceding escalated cash rent. That to us is the increase. Now if you then take it over time which is I guess the GAAP, if we did a 10 year deal and it had an average of 2% a year increases plus a midyear bump -- a midterm bump every five years. Then that is going to be I think wildly in excess of the 22% because you are going to be comparing sort of the -- average to the spot rent. And it is going to be -- we could calc it, but it will be definitionally higher than the 22%.","Steve Durels","It would be a misleading number for people I think because as Andrew was saying, the mark to market compares starting rent to the ending rent. And if you did it against GAAP you would be--.","Andrew Mathias","On both sides. The ending rent would be lower because you would be --.","Marc Holiday","It would be like a -- so look, we will play around with it for a couple of leases and see what the results look like. But then I would just want to think through the implication of that metric once we have it. The second thing -- the difference between gross and net.","Matt DiLiberto","I think it was net effect. You were talking about net effect net of concessions or gross and net?","John Guinee","Well, just if you -- the quick math is let's say you have a $75 rent and a $25 OpEx and that is $50 net. Or $75 rent goes up by 22% while your OpEx stays constant, your cash rent, your net rent is going up much more than 22% unless of course you have got a big OpEx increase factored in. And I'm just trying to sense if you guys do that math or not.","Marc Holiday","Yes, that is right because it is 22% gross to gross which would be higher if you went net to net. I think that is right. Yes, I think that is right. But I guess what we're looking at is within our NOI at any given point in time you have the net, so the question is how much contribution are you getting to the NOI. Which you already -- remember NOI has already taken out the expenses. So the contribution is the differential in gross rent. So if the NOI of the building is $10 million and we sign a new lease and the gross rent goes from $75 to $80 we have got $5 a foot more is going to drop to that bottom line to the NOI because expenses don't go up when you sign a lease. Your point is that increase on a net basis is probably more than 22%. I think that is right. So we can take a look at that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with UBS. Your line is open.","Nick Yulico","Just going back to the new 22% mark-to-market guidance for this year. Is that because -- which is higher than your prior guidance. Is that because of getting better rents on a lot of space or is it because of one or two big leases moving into the pipeline this year affecting those numbers.","Steve Durels","It is not driven by -- it is all over the board as far as one particular deal up and down. But if you -- if we shared with you the pipeline, the vast majority of the deals that we're working on all have positive mark to market. And then it is a question of just some having more than others. It is not disproportionately dependent upon a single deal.","Marc Holiday","I think it is -- well in some cases the opposite. I'm thinking of Bloomberg. Bloomberg was only a 14% deal, so the quarter would have been almost 150 basis points higher. But the tendency, Nick, is for the larger leases, the outlier leases may not get quite as much mark to market. Your point is, hey, the bigger leases have that biggest mark to market and drive the deals. That is not usually our experience in this market, it is the opposite. By number of deals, the number of deals we have big, big mark to market. But then you get some larger deals where you don't always have the exact same price as ours. And you may have to take a lower amount. But whether it is 16% or it is 28% or 22%, I mean these are big numbers you are talking about.","Matt DiLiberto","In terms of guidance, as Steve starts the year he doesn't know which 17, 18, 19 leases he is going to pull forward into the year and renew early call it. So I think we have had -- we have probably renewed some leases that were big mark to markets early.","Steve Durels","Yes.","Matt DiLiberto","Which is driving that guidance.","Steve Durels","And I think that speaks to the health of the market right now because we're not in a defensive position. We're in a point of view where tenants are coming to us and are doing -- willing to do early renewals and they are paying for it. I think that is where obviously we want to be and the market is on our side right now.","Nick Yulico","Yes. No, that is helpful. I guess the follow up then has to go -- goes to the idea of the kind of overall market, whether you think given that the vacancy rate in the overall market hasn't come down much, business uncertainties may be a little bit higher.","Marc, you talked about earlier this year worried about kind of the job growth slowing and maybe some of that impact would be in the back half of the year. Is New York City still a market where you could see some positive rent growth? Not that you necessarily need it, but is -- or is things going to sort of flatten out from here you think?","Marc Holiday","Well, I have to look at our own portfolio and our own facts. We have got 1.6 million in pipe with a 20% mark to market. So I couldn't sit here and say I think rents are going down because of that evidence, you know what I'm saying? I mean we could look out into the future and sort of speculate as to what the longer term trends might look like, but we're busily at work trying to close out that 1.6 million fairly substantial rental increases.","So I guess I would have to answer that question by saying it looks like we're going to get those increases. The other way of saying that is I wouldn't raise the guidance 22% if I didn't feel pretty good about that. So I did see earlier at the outset that it has surprised us to the upside. I didn't expect the second half of the year to be quite as good as it looks like it is panning out to be. In response to someone's earlier question, maybe we're outperforming the market. So you could have a situation where both things are true -- and that is okay for us which is maybe the market is slowing a bit and rental growth is slowing a bit. But if our portfolio is still full speed ahead then I don't want to like question it, I want to go with that and do more of that and keep going and differentiate ourselves from the market. That is what you look for I think in top companies in any industry is that kind of differentiation. We're not bigger than the market but we can certainly do better than the market. And I think we have and will. ","So I think both could be true. But we see a very good environment over the next six months to conduct our business and finish out our year and hit these sort of sector leading numbers. Then towards the end of the year we're going to give you our view of 2017 which I think it is a little too early because I would like to see a few more months of jobs numbers before I even go there. Let's see June, July, August and the balance of the year and see where those job numbers go. Because if the private sector job numbers and [indiscernible] job numbers are up and still not up as much of last year and years prior but in the range of 50,000 new jobs plus. And 15,000 plus are office using jobs, then we're still in a good market. But I want to see that data.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with KeyBanc Capital Market. Your line is open.","Craig Mailman","Just wanted to go back to some earlier comments on the leasing side. Steve, I know you said that tenants in general are kind of in an expansionary mode. I'm just curious, are you seeing the pendulum swing back at all on tenants trying to get more efficient with space?","Steve Durels","Are they getting more efficient? I think every tenant continues to try to maximize efficiency. You have heard me say in the years pass, I don't think that is a trend that ever goes away. It is just a function of what people are willing to do through a combination of technology and ultimately allocations of square footage per person.","But yes, everybody once to either use their space differently and that can be sort of like just cultural. And others as do they want to use it differently and that goes to how much space per employee. So, but I don't think we're seeing anything different today than we saw last year or 18 months ago or even 2.5 years ago.","Craig Mailman","Okay, so no one's -- so you're?","Steve Durels","Is it coming back the other way? Are you saying are they coming back--","Craig Mailman","Yes, are people kind of loosening up trying to get more efficient?","Steve Durels","I get you. So we have heard sound bites of that, yes. But I can't say that there is -- anybody has found the absolute perfect solution for themselves. There have been a number of examples where tenants have gone out and tried to be overly aggressive as to the small amount of allocation of square footage per person and then had to come back and adjust it because it was operationally too taxing on their employees. But I think those are exceptions to the rule.","Craig Mailman","Okay and are you seeing -- I'm just curious about what tenants are doing on the contraction side at this point in the cycle if anything.","Marc Holiday","Nothing of note. I mean we if we saw contraction in this market, A, we would tell you, B, we would have a different tone on this call. There is no sublease space, that is the first sign of contraction. Shadow vacant space doesn't really exist. All the big financial firms that might have had to sublet space in the past, Craig, they all own their buildings now. Goldman owns their own building --.","Andrew Mathias","Citi owns their own building.","Marc Holiday","Citi owns their own building. Those buildings are not going to be for the most part multi-tenanted. JPMorgan owns their own building at 270. I don't think they are subletting the building. I don't think they are going to like shed space and take in and go multi-tenant at 270 Park. So it is a different market today. And it is good, it is more balanced, more diverse, a lot of these big financials own their own facilities for safety and security and control reasons which is probably smart. That puts less in -- more tenants competing for less inventory because that space is not on the market -- on the direct or sublet market. So, where I hear the nature of the questions, we're just not seeing it right now which is why we're upping our guidance on different levels. If we saw that we would probably hold tighter or decrease.","Craig Mailman","And just separately, there is not a lot of talk about joint venturing 1 Vanderbilt.","Marc Holiday","Craig, we like to hold these for like an hour out of respect because I know people start to drop off after an hour. We have got six people in the queue. Can you just sort of come back around with that question?","Craig Mailman","Sure, no problem.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Blaine Heck","Matt, on same-store NOI, sorry if I missed this, but last year you guys had the termination fee associated with 919 Third. Did that have any effect on same-store NOI growth this quarter? Were there any other kind of one-time items? And what would the normalized result be if you adjusted for any of that?","Matt DiLiberto","It didn't have any effect on same-store cash NOI, the termination fee we received last year at 919 is paid out over time, so it is included in GAAP NOI but not in cash NOI. So if you are looking at pure cash termination fees we received second quarter of last year would be about $2.2 million as against about $1.4 million we received in the second quarter of this year. So it did affect GAAP NOI but not cash NOI.","Blaine Heck","And then can you guys talk a little bit about the Omnicon extension you guys recently signed? I think that reduces their expiration in 2017 to close to 225,000 to 250,000 square feet. So what is the plan for the rest of that space? I think there had been some talk about selling a condo interest in the 300,000 square feet that they had expiring when we talked about it last quarter. So is there any update on what is going on there?","Steve Durels","So, the Omnicon story is a great story on many fronts. When their lease was originally scheduled to expire we had zero expectation that they would be renewing any portion of the space because they have got a big portfolio in town and they were making other plans. But we have a free good relationship with them and their business needs changed, they came back around the horn, did a big deal with us at the beginning of the year.","Thought they were put to bed and then this most recent renewal is a function of them growing their body count and wanting to do business with one of their preferred vendors. So, we picked up another 64,000 square feet. We have got a large lease that we're -- a large transaction that we're working on for a big chunk of what is remaining, but it is premature to announce.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Vikram Malhotra","Just looking at all the leasing that you have done last year and especially the first half has been really strong. If you were to look out past 2016 into 2017 and obviously you won't provide guidance, but I'm assuming all this bodes really well for same-store cash NOI going into next year. If there was a very high-level objective or even a trajectory you could provide us with, that would be really helpful.","Matt DiLiberto","It is Matt. Certainly it sets us up nicely because of the benefit the leasing that we do this year generally flows through 12 months later. You are right, we're not going to give any guidance at this point. We'll touch on that in December. But it is certainly putting us on a good trajectory. Bear in mind, of course, that we had very strong growth last year of like 4.5% and we're going to be north of 6% this year. So we're growing off a big base but Steve is setting us up nicely.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Jed Reagan with Green Street Advisors. Your line is open.","Jed Reagan","I know you said on prior calls that riskier lower quality assets in New York might be repriced downward this year. Have you seen that actually coming to fruition? And if so, maybe what kind of magnitude of impact are you seeing on a percentage basis?","Andrew Mathias","Yes, I think it sort of depends on the building, the situation. I mean there is a building now on Ninth Avenue trading which I think would have fit in that category and it happens to be drawing a very strong bid so I think that building is sort of un-impacted or not really dimensional in terms of value. And then there is other side street really inferior assets that because of the change in financing costs have maybe backed up 3% to 5%, nothing major.","Operator","Thank you and I would not like to turn the call back to Mr. Holiday for closing remarks.","Marc Holiday","Thank you very much. Sorry we ran a little late on the call, but I guess there was a lot to cover. And hopefully we addressed all the key items for the quarter and the market. And we look forward to speaking with you folks after the summer. Have a great summer and we will speak again in October. Thanks.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does concludes the program and you may all disconnect.

This conference call is being recorded.","At this time, the company would like to remind listeners that during the call, management may make forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ from the forward-looking statements that management may make today. Additional information regarding the factors that could cause such differences to appear in the MDA section of the company\u2019s Form 10-K and other reports filed by the company with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Also during today\u2019s conference call, the company may discuss non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC Regulation G. The GAAP financial measures are most directly comparable to each non-GAAP financial measure discussed and the reconciliation of the differences between each non-GAAP financial measure and the comparable GAAP financial measure can be found on the company\u2019s website at www.slgreen.com, by selecting the press release regarding the company\u2019s third quarter 2018 earnings.","Before turning the call over to Marc Holliday, Chief Executive Officer of SL Green Realty Corp., I ask that those of you participating in the Q&A portion of the call please limit your questions to two per person. Thank you.","I will now turn the call over to Marc Holliday. Please go ahead, Marc.","Marc Holliday","Thank you everyone for joining us on our third quarter earnings call. We will discuss some of the highlights and accomplishments of the quarter as well as take as many questions as we can afterwards. But first, I want to put the quarter\u2019s results into the context of the big picture. The engine behind our current strategic plan is the extraordinary value creation we have been able to generate in this current cycle, which really began after the \u201808-09 recession. As many of you know, we have been hard at work since 2016, finding ways to optimize and harvest the extraordinary gains in our portfolio as evidenced by over $8 billion of total gross transaction values, dispositions and recapitalizations, which resulted in well over $2 billion of cash inflows to the company since 2016. We have been very thoughtful and deliberate in redeploying these proceeds in ways we believe best benefit the company and our shareholders.","Notably, we brought our aggregate and relative debt levels down considerably in this current cycle and we are also projecting to have record net cash balances on hand by year end. In addition and as you know, we have been moving along the path of being among the most aggressive REITs in the country in terms of share buybacks having bought back over 8 million shares and OP units year-to-date with the expectation and intent that we will round out our $2 billion share buyback program in the coming months. This continues to be an area of investment that we identified by far as the most attractive opportunity in our investment horizon right now and that opportunity has only increased with the recent sector performance resulting in FFO multiples for the company that I can only describe now is shockingly low.","As we have reduced our leverage, shed non-core investments improved our asset quality and leased our portfolio, we have not withstanding seen our FFO multiple decreased to as low as 13 times, implying well in excess of a 6% capitalization rate on our prime New York City office portfolio and given the extraordinary quality of that portfolio and substantial discount in net asset value, we conclude that there is a dislocation that continues and warrants a continuation of our share buyback program. We have also kept our eye on the ball and make sure to take advantage of a number of limited strategic new investments in 2018 as and when we saw them arise. Most notably, 2 Herald Park and 245 Park are just two of the examples where we are able to put new money to work in ways that we feel will be highly accretive to the company and we do have a pipeline of additional opportunities that we hope to be able to expand on further at our December investor conference.","As it relates to the positioning of the company for the future, we have ongoing and future development projects that we will be devoting our time and resources to in order to continue to maintain our standing as one of the leading real estate growth companies in terms of same-store NOI and FFO per share growth, metrics, which we again lead the office sector in 2018 and areas we will continue to try to demonstrate leadership in going forward. The development pipeline, which we will present in December in much more detail, will provide the new seeds of growth in 2020 and beyond as these projects begin to come to fruition irrespective of same-store rental levels between now and then, because these are all inventory right now out of any same-store metric that we follow, all of which will just be aggregate incremental NOI growth as these projects complete.","Fortunately, market conditions in New York City continue to be fairly strong such that we have been able to execute our program consistent with guidance we gave back in the beginning of the year. Taking a look first at leasing activity, our volume for the quarter was obviously quite strong. And as we sit here today, we are 3,000 square feet shy of our 1.6 million square feet leasing goal for 2018. So, maybe Durels wants to get out ahead of this and signup a small lease before this call is over. What do you think, Steve?","Steven Durels","Very possible.","Marc Holliday","Okay. I think it\u2019s in the bank. Something can happen. So of course, everything we do in the fourth quarter is a bonus and more good news is that we expect to have a fairly strong fourth quarter of leasing, which should bring us 2 million or above 2 million square feet of leasing for the year. We want to remind everyone that when looking at statistics like mark-to-market with same-store mark-to-market NOI and the like, they are highly dependent on the leases rolling in any given quarter, and right now, we are rolling off a lot of leases that were signed in or around the 2007 peak. They have escalated pretty substantially over that 10-year period, so the fact that we have positive growth off of that I think is quite extraordinary. Notwithstanding, we may feel a little shy, we may fall a little shy of our ambitious goal at the beginning of the year of 6% to 9%, same-store NOI growth \u2013 I am sorry, same-store mark-to-market on leasing and we will track that closely. It will be dependent on a few leases that we will either make hopefully by December or it may trip into January, but there is certainly a possibility that will be at the low end or just under the 6% to 9% range of the original guidance.","You might recall that we had hoped to see stabilizing of concessions and affirming of rents in the second half of the year. And I think we got it pretty much right. There has been clearly stabilization in TIs and concessions that we see in the portfolio now. We think the rental market is very stable and demand is quite good. So all-in-all, I would call it a healthy leasing market, which is I think reflective of a very good New York economy, and I will have more to say about that momentarily. And good news furthermore is that we have a \u2013 these results have been occurring while new product from the West Side and downtown has been coming on line. So we have shown an ability to absorb this new inventory, keep the vacancy rate roughly in check and maintain stability in these key leasing metrics, which we do think will only get better as the available inventory is weaned out.","Another big part of our big story is the success we are having with our development at the One Vanderbilt. Construction continues on a pace ahead of schedule and under budget and still has now reached our 39th floor of construction well ahead of our original goal for the year reflecting really a lot of hard work by thousands of construction workers that are on that site day in, day out. We had a worker appreciation day last week attended by all and you could see the passion in their lives and how proud they were not only to be working on a project of this magnitude and this importance, but also how proud they were that it\u2019s been the job, it\u2019s been going like a well-oiled machine. That\u2019s really a great job by the team. And if you haven\u2019t been to the site recently, I would encourage you to do so as the beautiful terracotta curtain wall and 10 foot glass panels are now installed up to around 8th floor and is really truly a spectacular addition to the cityscape of this Midtown.","Tenant demand for the project continues to accelerate on the heels of signing a lease with Carlyle for approximately 100,000 feet in the middle part of the building. And the fourth quarter pipeline of deals I mentioned earlier certainly had some more activity included within it that will hopefully bring us well ahead of our goals for One Vanderbilt come year end. The project continues to reinforce the basic themes which drove our decision to pursue what initially which included a dramatic addition to the Grand Central submarket leading the way for other new development projects like JPMorgan\u2019s announcement of their 2.5 million square foot new headquarter project, providing over $200 million of funding for critically important public realm and transportation improvements and the delivery of state-of-the-art new construction right in the Heart of Midtown to provide tenants with the best of class choice, New York\u2019s greatest transportation hub which will soon see 100,000 additional riders a day from the completion of Long Island Railroad East Side Access.","We will continue to monitor the New York City economic indicators and reveal directionally our thoughts for the market environment in the coming \u2013 for the coming year at our December investor meeting. The job numbers right now are a bit scattered and hard to get a precise read on. The non-seasonally adjusted numbers are quite strong and almost on par with last year\u2019s non-seasonally adjusted. However, the seasonally adjusted numbers diverge from that fairly significantly albeit also positive numbers bringing to question whether there will be a significant revision sometime after the year that brings those two closer together. In either case Wall Street profits were nearly $14 billion for the first half of the year and are on track to eclipse the city\u2019s projection of $20.5 billion for the full year. And furthermore the big five banks that have already reported their third quarter earnings showed a 6% year-over-year increase through September \u201818 proving that the banks are benefiting more than I think you expected from the overall absolute rate increase in the lending environment and keeping those earnings still on an upward trajectory.","Tax withholdings are showing indications that 2018 will be another strong year of compensation levels in the city and retail sales which were tracked by the state show that retail sales tax is up around 7% for the year that includes bricks and mortar and online sales for which the state collects taxes. So we have this extraordinary New York City economy that\u2019s operating right now at a 4.1% record low unemployment rate and it keeps moving along while population growth year-over-year has been somewhat muted but you have people rejoining the workforce that had been on the sideline that\u2019s what\u2019s contributing right now to that job growth and it\u2019s like with our leasing portfolio as you get towards full occupancy there are not as many jobs that can be created and filled. And as you get towards \u2013 I am sorry get to it fully actually, there is not as many tenants that are available to sanction of as many spaces, I think you will see a little bit of the same thing in the jobs picture. You have sequentially lower job growth, but it\u2019s still indicative. I think a very strong economy which is almost full employment.","So with that, I would like to stop there and open it for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Craig Mailman with KeyBanc. Your line is now open.","Craig Mailman","Hey guys, good afternoon. Just curious, Marc, you kind of mentioned that you have a pipeline of opportunities here that you\u2019re going to explore at the investor day, but just ahead of that, you guys have been active on the buyback, you sold a lot of assets. Just curious from here on out, how you're kind of weighing those buybacks, the potential kind of pipeline of assets to sell, and thinking about other financing options such as JVs on some of your larger assets to kind of unlock the sources for some of these as you\u2019re going to be talking about at the investor day?","Marc Holliday","Well, okay, I mean, I guess, instinctual, I want to say, let\u2019s wait for investor day, we\u2019re going to go through in detail, but I\u2019ll give you a sort of a framework within how we think about it. Assets we can sell, recap or otherwise monetize tax efficiently lends itself towards the buyback program because we got to retain old proceeds or most of the proceeds and that's a right for reinvesting in our stock, which we think is the best single investment opportunity. Then there were transactions we have slated that may be somewhat less tax efficient and in those instances, we\u2019ll typically reinvest those proceeds in other new opportunities whether it be acquisitions or new development. And by doing that, we\u2019re able to shelter the gain, we\u2019ve been doing that for 20 years, so that's not a program or a strategy that should sound new to anybody on this call, because that really prior to the buybacks had been our stock-in-trade was buying, adding value, monetizing, reinvesting the gains into higher growth opportunities and moving on. So those two investment opportunities I think are somewhat parametered by whether we\u2019re generating tax for your taxable gain on execution, that's one element of it. Then there are other elements that will guide ourselves towards looking at strategic investments that may have return attributes that are as strong on a risk-adjusted basis as the stock itself and where we do that you'll see us be active as we always have been. We try to maintain never an on or off approach. In every market we\u2019re selling, we\u2019re buying, we\u2019re investing in our stock at this moment, and that \u2013 we\u2019re not looking to call the market, what we\u2019re looking to do is simply buy low and sell high and reap the benefits of our arbitrage of that in a tax efficient way be it in our stock or in new investments.","Jordan Sadler","Hey, it\u2019s Jordan Sadler with a follow-up. Just on tenant demand in the wake of the new tax regime for Marc or Steve. This year we saw pretty big headlines from AllianceBernstein\u2019s plans to move to Nashville, seemingly a one-off. But maybe can you speak to trends you're seeing if any in terms of tenant migration plans either into or out of Manhattan as a result of sort of the tax burden on employees?","Steven Durels","No, I think there\u2019s been the rare occasion where you see that that\u2019s maybe an influence, but it's hard to draw any kind of conclusion that, that taxes are having a negative impact on the leasing environment given the fact that mid-term leasing is 6% ahead of last year and is going to have its best leasing here in the last 12 years. So, in the face of that, velocity is extremely strong, we\u2019re seeing it within our portfolio and where we have the majority of our portfolio surrounding Grand Central Terminal, it\u2019s one of the best submarkets from a leasing velocity perspective. So, I think it\u2019s all \u2013 all cylinders are firing straight-ahead.","Jordan Sadler","Okay. Thank you.","Marc Holliday","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Manny Korchman with Citi. Your line is now open.","Manny Korchman","Hey, guys. Can you give us your updated views on the co-working space especially following the recent announcement that largely based on with WeWork?","Andrew Mathias","Sure, Manny. I think our view is still consistent, which is \u2013 it\u2019s a thriving part of the market, we generally view it as a positive. WeWork is an enormous consumer of space in the market and that\u2019s certainly helped keep things tight in the market and it\u2019s going to be a portion of our portfolio we anticipate as it has been for the last 20 years, whether it\u2019s with an HQ or Regis, New York office suites or other tenants, an Emerge212, which is our own co-working business or one of the more recent guys like a WeWork or a Knotel.","Manny Korchman","And Steve, any updates on the lease with Polo?","Steven Durels","No nothing to report at this point in time.","Manny Korchman","Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","John Kim","Thank you. A question on your DPE, one of your objectives of the year was to keep the DPE balance flat, but I was wondering if there was an update on this just given your balance sheet has shrunk considerably over last year and looks like it may continue to do so?","Matthew DiLiberto","John, it\u2019s Matt. Our guidance was actually to have the balance be lower by about $100 million year-over-year and we are on a trajectory for that while meeting our target of $200 million of income from that portfolio. So from second quarter, the third quarter went down as we anticipated. I expect there to be modest amount of more diminishing over the course of the fourth quarter.","John Kim","And can you just discuss your appetite to take that down further and potentially get some more earnings dilution because of that?","Marc Holliday","Well, I don\u2019t know \u2013 I don\u2019t think we look at it as appetite for earnings dilution. So I have to think about how to answer that question. If the question is in our 2019 plan where do we see us pegging that and might it be lower, I think you have to wait till December for that and we are going to leave that into the context of all the other planned activity we have for 2019, not really in isolation and we will have guidance for you then. But clearly, I don\u2019t want to say our targets are constraint, but our self-imposed cap, if you will, with something to the effective 10% of total asset value of the company, we are certainly below that. So within the range of whether we are 6%, 7%, 8%, I don\u2019t think there is a magic number that the answer is we have a portfolio stands today about $1.9 billion or so?","Matthew DiLiberto","Little over $2 billion.","Marc Holliday","About $2 billion\u2026","Matthew DiLiberto","Completely scalable.","Marc Holliday","We have \u2013 we believe a net asset value that certainly which would put that at well under 10% even on the enterprise value. So, it\u2019s really going to be something we will look at and look at the opportunity set and decide whether to size down further or maintain.","John Kim","Thanks for the color.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb of Sandler O\u2019Neill. Your line is now open.","Alexander Goldfarb","Hey, good afternoon there. Just two questions. First, in one of your recent investor decks, you guys commented on doing another $300 million of capital for One Vanderbilt to reduce your equity. With this we bring in an additional joint venture partner, expanding the current JV partner, just what are your sort of thought as you are looking at that project, especially as it leases up presumably you are getting more inbound calls of interests?","Matthew DiLiberto","Yes. Specifically, we talked about a refinancing which we are undertaking as we speak for the in-place construction financing. We have \u2013 obviously, the project has gone very well, exceeded lot of our expectations along the way. And so we are looking for up to $300 million that could come in the form of financing that could come in the form of additional equity, but the refinancing we are undertaking right now would result in additional proceeds, longer term, lower rate and less recourse as we anticipated.","Marc Holliday","Yes, I would add to that, that refinancing was unintended and is a good news aspect of just how well this project is going and evidence of the project success that we are in front of the group of banks for the refinancing \u2013 interim refinancing, unplanned and it will be highly accretive to the deal and the joint venture and really just is an affirmation, I would say if we can get that done.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. And then the second question is just in some of the local press, Marc, there has been talk about city council bringing up commercial rent control and I know it\u2019s come up in the past, just out of curious in today\u2019s environment, what your view is, if you think this is real especially if you think about Midtown rezoning where the city is trying to encourage redevelopment, this would seem to be the opposite?","Marc Holliday","Well. Look this is something, there is many bills that come to Council and some get passed and many don\u2019t. We will see where this shakes out. There has been some form of this hanging around out there for decades. And I honestly think that they are on the wrong issue. Retailers today as you know are having problems unless they are very well capitalized and very well situated, but a lot of these are smaller, less creditworthy what will be called a small business or mom-and-pop businesses are having a hard time, but it\u2019s not the rent. And I think that will be the debate on the floor, it\u2019s all the other things that don\u2019t seem to be in that bill which a lot of these small businesses are coming out and talking about now such as the increasing minimum wage which is a great goal for the city, but it has with it the intended impacts of raising operating costs is real estate taxes. I mean the real estate rents are down almost in all submarkets of retail anywhere between 10% on the low and a 35% on the high end. But all the while real estate taxes keep increasing and keep increasing annually very, very high compounded annual rates. And the regulation, the things these retailers have to do to open up businesses maintain their businesses and stay compliant. When you put that altogether it doesn\u2019t seem to be the rent to us, we have adjusted our rents in ways that have met the market and have been almost immediately reactive to the system. Now, in real estate nothing is immediate, it\u2019s not a nanosecond, it\u2019s not a day. But over the course of the past 12 months to 18 months, we as long as other leading landlords, retail landlords have re-priced their portfolios generally to meet the market and it\u2019s been sizably down and quick as demand has dropped. And yet even with that, a lot of vacancy remains, projections between 20%, 25% in some submarkets. Now rent is only a piece of it and the rent is corrected quickly, it\u2019s probably the only parameter I have mentioned that went down and went down significantly. Everything else more regulation, higher wages and high real estate taxes they are going to have to figure out a way to solve that issue I think in order to make meaningful progress on this point. And I think the rent for economically motivated people will take care of itself. I would like to see possibly inserted into the bill some kind of incentives for landlords to give breaks to tenants, we do it with affordable housing, why not do it with small business retailers.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. Thank you, Marc.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jamie Feldman with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Jamie Feldman","Great. Thank you. I wanted to talk about rents for a minute, so it sounds like you think you are trending below your original target of 6% to 9% growth, can you just talk about what\u2019s different than maybe at the beginning of the year that you are on this trajectory?","Steven Durels","Well, it\u2019s not that the rents have moved lower than our expectation, it\u2019s just really that when we focus only on mark-to-market and compare the rents that we are signing against the rents that are burning off from those select leases where the space is being filled with 12 months sort of less of downtime, it gives a distorted view of the rent landscape. If you look at our mark-to-market which we posted 1%, if we spun out the two leases \u2013 of all the leases that we signed, there were only two leases that really had a negative mark-to-market that watered down the overall performance, if you pull those out we wouldn\u2019t have posted the 6% positive mark to market. So I see rents that are still going up modestly. As we have said all along we projected at the beginning of year, but we are seeing rental appreciation, but when we focus on the mark to market, it\u2019s just I think it gives a distorted view of rents.","Jamie Feldman","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then I guess for Andrew, just some thoughts on the investment sales market, cap rates and asset values, and then it looks like you took a $0.01 impairment on a debt investment that was repaid. Can you talk about what\u2019s happened there?","Andrew Mathias","Sure. Investment sales, there\u2019s going to be a lot of price discovery because there are lot of assets on the market now. So, I think fourth quarter we should see quite a few assets clear and get a much better sense, but our \u2013 we still see a lot of demand from foreign and domestic investors. Obviously, we\u2019re getting \u2013 we announced the sale of a development site on 72nd Street, and an asset that came back to us through the debt portfolio on Third Avenue, being able to quickly sell those assets and redeploy that capital is an indicator, that not just core income, income producing real estate, but also development-oriented real estate, there is still quite a liquid market for us. So \u2013 and I\u2019ll let Matt comment on the impairment.","Matthew DiLiberto","Yes, I mean, that\u2019s more of an allocation than anything else that we have a multifaceted transaction, the Upper East Side Assemblage sale, 1231, that has multiple aspects to it. It\u2019s a matter of basis allocation and we\u2019ve taken an impairment on the partner loan inside of that deal.","Jamie Feldman","Okay, thank you.","Matthew DiLiberto","Just one other point, operator, I want to make to Jamie in answering the first question that he asked to Steve. Steve referenced couple of deals that were done in the quarter that brought our mark-to-market for the quarter down to 1%. I think Jamie was asking about our guidance of 6% to 9% for the year. Another factor is, we had in our initial expectations a rather large early renewal couple of 100,000 plus square feet that may or may not make and may not \u2013 may or may not be this year. We expected that to be this year in which case we would be squarely within our guidance range. If that does not make this year, I would expect us to be below our 6 \u2013 the low-end of the guidance range of 6% to 9%, and that deal could make next year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Guinee with Stifel. Your line is now open.","John Guinee","Great. As you know cost of capital is everything in this business and there's a lot of very inexpensive JV equity out there, which is obviously available to you guys. Big picture, what you think is the spread now between cost of JV equity on an asset by asset basis and issuing stock, or said another way, where would your share price need to be that you would find common equity of more attractive cost of capital than JV equity? And then the second question is, any update on 245 Park, and if you talked about it earlier in the call I apologize, I was late to the party?","Marc Holliday","Okay. We didn\u2019t in any detail, so we\u2019ll come back to 245. But John, let me just \u2013 let\u2019s just hit that first question again. The question is that what stock price would \u2013 would issuing common be better than joint venture. Is that something, yes \u2013 ","John Guinee","Yes.","Marc Holliday","Yes. Well, one, I\u2019d say we\u2019re so far away from that, you probably aren\u2019t tracking that number very closely right now, because it would have to be \u2013 my view is generally at or near NAV, I mean, that\u2019s sort of the \u2013 let\u2019s call it \u2013 that\u2019s the mathematical answer would be you generally don't want to issue discounted securities below value, it\u2019s like selling $1 for $0.98 or $0.9765. Now, selling $1 for like $0.70, $0.75 is even more objectionable. But really when we have issued in the past, used the ATM quite aggressively as you might recall, leading up to mid-2015 or so, generally we like to think we're right at or around NAV, it could be off $1 or $2, 1% or 2%, but issuing at 10%, 15%, 20% discounts, not very attractive. On the flipside joint ventures, you\u2019re typically doing those right at the market. People who come in and invest in a billion-dollar building expect to pay $1 billion, not $900 million, not $800 million, not $700 million. They expect to pay the market and you could almost say it's a premium offering because in addition to bringing a JV partner in at the value you then get fees and promotes, which we\u2019ve talked about and broken down analyzed in the past that could increase the yield on our retained interest between 3% to 500% depending on that fee and promote package. So I think that\u2019s how we analyze it, but again, since we are so far away from that, we haven\u2019t been running those numbers recently. I am sorry 245 we made an initial, what we call Phase 1 investment. We are working towards a Phase 2 that contemplates more direct equity investment with control that is still uncompleted at this time and we will just have to wait and see what the further update is as of December investor, but for the moment, we have our investment, money is working, we are having \u2013 we are deeply embedded within the asset with our partner on that deal and I guess more to come in the next 30 to 45 days.","John Guinee","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Derek Johnston","Good afternoon. Any further commentary regarding how leasing or the leasing pipeline is trending versus plan at One Vanderbilt? And secondly, are there any issues tied to the Carlyle lease in light of today\u2019s news?","Steven Durels","I will address the first one, which is that we have got a good pipeline of deal flow at One Vanderbilt. We are trading paper with four, five tenants. We are in advanced discussions with two in particular and we expect to have something positive to report before the end of the year.","Marc Holliday","So I guess you had asked a question about Carlyle and their efforts to assign the lease to SLG Funding, which is our $2 billion finance subsidiary. I think as the paper state, landlord in that case has rejected the assignment Carlyle believes in properly, so it\u2019s brought a lawsuit. SL Green is not a party to that lawsuit and that lawsuit in no way affects the One Vanderbilt lease, which stands apart and alone. So I can\u2019t really comment any further on that other than to say it\u2019s unfortunate.","Derek Johnston","Got it. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Steve Sakwa","Thanks. Good afternoon. Marc, I guess I wanted to come back to your comment about the tax efficient asset sales that allow you to do buybacks and the less efficient ones which sort of maybe force you to do kind of 1031 deals. Can you just give us a sense for what within the portfolio would be characterized as tax efficient asset sales in kind of just gross dollar terms? And I guess to complete the remaining buyback authorization, how much more do you need to sell to do that on a leverage neutral basis?","Marc Holliday","Well, Steve, we have gone through this in I think some fair amount of detail. We have assets where I will give you structured finance, I mean, it\u2019s tax efficient. We have got $2 billion of assets that are marked at par and as we reduce balances there, there is no gain typically unless we have some kind of exit fee or something like that. And that\u2019s a potential source. We have other asset sales that either don\u2019t have as much tax gain or we are able to structure around through creative JVs or whatever it is. So, we have assets and I mean you have seen us do almost $2 billion of it. So, we clearly have been able to generate a significant amount of tax-free proceeds for using stock buybacks. We have more we can do going forward. So, the question will simply be when we meet again in December and then discuss it as a board whether and to what extent we want to keep going based on market conditions, price and capital availability versus the opportunity set, which is still meaningful out there. I mean, we do have a pipeline of deals that are very high yielding, you see the kinds of returns we print on these deals both levered and un-levered \u2013 they are very high, double-digit yields and we hope to be able to continue to balance our core investment strategy as we have done in more limited amounts of late with share buyback program. Steve, what was the second part of your question?","Steve Sakwa","Well, it was just I guess in terms of as you talk about trying to be leverage neutral, you sold \u2013 you put out the press release recently on the asset sales, which was several $300 million to $400 million, you have about $350 million to $400 million left. I know you didn\u2019t do a lot of buybacks in the third quarter, waiting for more sales to unfold, which you just announced. So I guess how much more do you sort of like feel like you need to do just to complete the current buyback program, I guess was sort of the question?","Marc Holliday","Yes. I mean, we are almost fully funded on the full $500 million. We have a couple more sales that are in the process primarily in the suburban portfolio which we have said we are slowly winnowing down that would round out the program and do it on the leverage-neutral basis that was executed the first $1.7 billion on, $1.650 billion.","Steve Sakwa","Okay. And I guess just second question maybe for Steve, you have historically talked about kind of the size of the leasing pipeline, I am curious where it is today and did you get the 3,000 square foot lease signed in the last 25 minutes?","Steven Durels","It\u2019s funny you said that. I just got an e-mail that said we signed a 20,000 square foot deal that\u2019s waiting for me to count, so I want to get upstairs. So it was 945,000 square feet of pipeline. So, now we are actually 925,000 square feet. And it\u2019s down from last quarter, because we did a lot of leasing this quarter, but we have got very good deal flow and we have got a lot of leases that are in very advanced stages of negotiation out of that pipeline.","Steve Sakwa","And can you characterize just kind of types of tenants, new tenants as if kind of pulling forward renewals or how would you characterize that?","Steven Durels","Yes, sure. In the pipeline, it\u2019s finance, real estate, legal non-profit education is the large part of it of the leases that we signed, it was dominated by finance and legal between the two of those industries that was 60% of it, but it\u2019s good broad-based group of tenants.","Marc Holliday","Thanks, Steve. I think we have time for one more. Is it \u2013 one more question?","Operator","Yes, sir. We do have a question from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. And as a reminder, please limit yourself to two questions. Thank you.","Nick Yulico","Okay, thanks. I just wanted to make sure that the 2 Herald JV sale, is that still set to close in the fourth quarter and do you have a number for just overall sales proceeds you expect in the fourth quarter?","Matthew DiLiberto","The answer is yes, we expect it to close in the fourth quarter and that\u2019s going to be coupled with a financing. I mean, I have a roundabout number from 3 Columbus and from 2 Herald, you are talking several hundred million dollars of proceeds.","Nick Yulico","Okay, thanks. And then just lastly going back to 245 Park, I mean, it sounds like there are some redevelopment plans that have started to float around the leasing market for that building. I mean, is that what is first need to be sorted out before you have \u2013 you consider making an additional investment?","Marc Holliday","I don\u2019t really \u2013 I think, it\u2019s not \u2013 until we have a conclusion to where we stand on the Phase 2, I wouldn\u2019t want to start talking about redevelopment plans or strategies for the bill. I think it would be inappropriate. So I mean, I would just say at this point \u2013 and not even at this point, I mean, you have heard from the day H&A first bought the asset way back, we think it\u2019s a spectacular asset, great location, great building now directly across the street from JPMorgan New World headquarters, catty-cornered 280 Park, which has been very successful redevelopment and only getting better through developments like One Vanderbilt, 425 Park and others to come as a result of East Midtown rezoning. So it\u2019s a good piece of real estate, we like it very much. We have been, we are in the \u2013 we were part of the original acquisition financing. We made an additional substantial investment about a 3, 3.5 months ago and we are in dialog with H&A to recast that investment into something that will have longer term work permits. That\u2019s really all I can say for now.","Nick Yulico","Okay, appreciate it. Thanks, Marc.","Operator","Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer session. So I would like to turn it back for closing remarks.","Marc Holliday","Okay, thank you. See you. The investor conference is December 3.","Matthew DiLiberto","Yes, just a reminder December 3, door is open at 8:30. It\u2019s at Jazz at Lincoln Center, same venue we have been at for the last couple of years. Program will begin at 9:00. So please get there ahead of that. We expect it to be roughly a 3-hour presentation. Then there will be an optional property tour. For details on how to register, please look at our press release or go on to our website.","Marc Holliday","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may all disconnect. Have a wonderful day."],"19658":["SL Green Realty Corp.

Actual results may differ from the forward-looking statements that management may make today. Additional information regarding the factors that could cause such differences appear in the MD&A section of the Company's Form 10-K and other reports filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Also, during today's conference call, the Company may discuss non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC Regulation G.

I ask that those of you participating in the Q&A portion of the call, please limit yourself to two questions per person. Thank you.","I will now turn the call over to Marc Holliday. Please go ahead, Marc.","Marc Holliday","Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate you joining us. And we love to speak with you today about our earnings release yesterday, which brought to a close 2019, which turned out to be an exceptionally good year for the Company.","We\u2019re certainly proud of the results, we\u2019ve achieved throughout the year, on your behalf including highlights such as the generation of $7 per share of FFO, representing a year-over-year increase of nearly 6%.","The leasing of 2.5 million square feet of space in our Manhattan office portfolio which activity carried a 38% mark-to-market on replacement leases and brought the same-store portfolio to 96.2% occupancy.","We also achieved the near complete liquidation of the suburban portfolio, a high level of performance in the debt and preferred equity portfolio, and the total return to shareholders in excess of 20%, reflecting the success of our innovative and strategic business plan centered around disposing of assets at compelling prices and redeploying those proceeds into share repurchases.","Just last month, we held our Annual Investor Conference, which was well attended and we thank all of you for that. We took a new approach in our conference presentation and focused almost exclusively on the work we\u2019ve been doing these past years to position the Company to benefit from a spectacular set of new developments.","The eight projects that we detailed will contribute an enormous amount of earnings growth to SL Green, estimated to be nearly $300 million of incremental NOI creation when combined with expected increases in the retained portfolio.","The success of these development projects and the positive impact they will have on our city will cement SL Green's position not only as the leading owner operator of commercial properties, but also is one of the premier developers in New York. The SL Green team is completely energized to take on the challenges of the New Year, and is already hard at work to fulfill the mission we laid out.","Our mandate for 2020 is quite clear. Meaningfully progress our construction and leasing efforts at our development projects, maintain virtual full occupancy in the retained portfolio, actively sell mature in non-core properties, aggressively invest in ourselves by repurchasing stock at a significant discount to underlying value and continue investing in our properties to support SL Green's sector-leading sustainability initiatives.","We feel confident in our ability to execute on that program, in part because we believe we have the exact right team to do it. And in part because we believe the New York market will stay strong throughout the year, benefiting from low interest rates, record job growth, positive economic sentiment and white-hot capital markets.","As an example last year, private equity fund-raising in the U.S. hit record territory with firms raising north of $300 billion. As levered that $750 billion of total PE buying power with more to be raised in 2020 and Real Estate will certainly be a beneficiary with significant portion of those investment monies.","So in recognition of our recent presentation at our Investor Conference, where we went through in detail our business plan and New York City market dynamics, we\u2019re going to go right to questions on the call, as we\u2019ve done in past earnings calls that follow immediately our Investor Conference.","So with that, operator, we\u2019d like to open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Manny Korchman from Citi. Your line is now open.","Manny Korchman","Hey, good afternoon. Marc, just given the recent rise in share price, does it change your perspective or the pace on buyback you've presented at the Investor Day?","Marc Holliday","Just - does it change buyback plan from investors is that - I didn\u2019t hear the final words.","Manny Korchman","Sure. Yeah. That works.","Marc Holliday","Yeah. No, I mean, we say there\u2019s a change, it got slightly more expensive. So that's you know, a reality. The prices fluctuated throughout the program. We bought it at prices in the 90s on down to in the 80s maybe even high 70s, I'm not sure. But I think our average price at the moment is somewhere around 95 in change. We think - anything within that range where we've been buying, we continue to be a buyer as much or more today as a year or two ago, because we believe there is more value in the platform today, than a year or two ago, in part because rates have continued to lower, we see cap rates stabilizing, maybe even compressing a bit for higher quality assets.","And we get closer to the realization date of these development projects that I mentioned earlier, all of which brings more value to that portfolio. So it does cost us a little more. Some of that is incorporated into our projections that we put out for - in guidance that we put out for 2020, but it doesn't - the pricing levels we're at now, we're still an affirmative buyer. And I think you\u2019ve seen that in what was disclosed as buying activity in the recent press release, at least through the date that it was of the quarter.","Manny Korchman","And then if we think about acquisitions that you're potentially looking at in the market, those can to be concentrated on the west side similar to the last couple you've done?","Andrew Mathias","I think we\u2019re going to be opportunistic in terms of acquisitions and I think we\u2019ll go where we see the best risk adjusted returns. I mean, it\u2019s going to purely depend on deal flow and I think anywhere in the 5 boroughs is game, if we can find the right returns.","Manny Korchman","Okay. Thanks Andrew.","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lewis from SunTrust. Your line is now open.","Michael Lewis","Great. Thank you. It looks like several of the fourth quarter lease expirations turns into month-to-month or hold over tenants about 423,000 square feet, $35 million of annual cash rent. Was that expected or maybe you could provide some color on that\u2026","Matthew DiLiberto","$35 million. Part of that Mike, yeah, it\u2019s Matt. Part of that is, you know, Polo actually leaves in January, I think. So that\u2019s the bulk of that. And beyond that every quarter there is a little bit of carryover month-to-month as guys get their things sorted out. But that big number was Polo in January. Their natural expiration was end of December.","Michael Lewis","Okay. That makes sense. Thanks. And then I just wanted to ask about the rent spread during the quarter. I think it was 50%, even better than the 38% for the year overall. Was there anything there that stood out in that high rent spread?","Marc Holliday","There is two deals that drive a lot of that, the Amazon deal on the Westside is a 222% mark to market, and 280,000 square feet of their deal and the BMW early renewal is 91% over at 555 West 57.","Michael Lewis","Okay, perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman from Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Jamie Feldman","Great. Thank you. Maybe a question for Steve, just on the leasing front. Could you talk about just kind of the cities leasing pipeline today and maybe compared to this time last year, we've seen a lot of big leases get done over the last six months or so. But how do things stand today and as it relates to interest in like One Madison and some of your pending move-outs that we know about over the next couple of years?","Andrew Mathias","Well, I can speak to our pipeline, I'm not certain I can speak to the cities pipeline. We\u2019ve got a pipeline of three quarters of 1 million square feet, which I think is a pretty full pipeline, given the amount of deals that were closed 1.25 million [ph] in the quarter in the fourth quarter of last year.","So notwithstanding all that, you know, great leasing velocity and signed deals, there\u2019s still a pretty full pipeline across the Board in our portfolio with a wide range of sizes. The largest of which in that pipe is probably about 150,000 square feet. One Vanderbilt continues to see extremely strong activity. We have a couple of leases out that we're working on. We have a number of proposals that we\u2019re also exchanging back and forth.","We\u2019re starting to get to a point where certain tenants are getting bumped from deals because they're competing for the same floors. And so we feel very good about our pace at that building.","One Madison little early to the game. We\u2019re still 3.5 years out from delivery. We are responding to three or four different RFPs that have been submitted to us, we expect some others to come through the door. But I wouldn\u2019t read too much into that. I think it's early days there.","Like what we saw at One Vanderbilt, if you recall, when we started to lease up there, there was a long period of just educating the marketplace about what the product is all about. And then when we got into that kind of 2, 2.5 year away from delivery, that\u2019s when things heated up, because that\u2019s the natural timeline for tenants to make their decisions.","Jamie Feldman","Great. Thanks. And then just thinking about some of the known move-outs over the next couple of years, Debevoise [ph] Cravath, NHL. Any early read on - or maybe just talk through how you\u2019re approaching those spaces and what we should expect to see?","Marc Holliday","Well, we\u2019re actively in the market with both of them. Cravath is still way out there, that's 2025. So it's - there is no tenant that is really I think at this moment in time making that far head decision for product that's currently occupied.","Debevoise is little closer to us. We\u2019re probably doing a modest capital program in the building to attend some of the public areas. I\u2019ll remind you that on both of those buildings it\u2019s the top of the house, is the best part of the building. So we\u2019ve got very \u2013 they both are very strong buildings.","So I think we\u2019re well positioned to be able to bring those products to market and particularly with Third Avenue, I expect it will \u2013 we\u2019ll be leasing that at higher rents that are in place today.","Jamie Feldman","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb from Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.","Alexander Goldfarb","Hey. Good afternoon, over there. Sir two questions. First, just big picture recently, you know, there is the politicians who are proposing, extending the mortgage recording tax to mezz and another forms to subordinate finance for real estate. Maybe if you could just give your view on this? I'm assuming it would be borne by the borrower, but still it just adds cost and friction to the system. So maybe you can just give your view on what do you think happens and what you may be hearing from your folks that you may speak to in Albany?","Marc Holliday","Yeah. It\u2019s Marc. What you\u2019re referring to I believe is the - is a bill that was just recently introduced in the Senate and the Assembly by two of the more Junior Senators. Assembly people, it\u2019s been introduced, it\u2019s not a part of any budget at this time. It's not on any committee agenda. So it\u2019s far, far from something that I think has any traction.","We've looked at the bill as drafted and frankly, we think it's flawed in a number of ways. So on the one hand, we think it's flawed. On another hand, we think it's written in a way as to be so broad as it would apply not only to real estate, but maybe to commercial loans much beyond, which I can\u2019t imagine there is going to be support for that type of disruption of the lending markets in New York City, right now, which is really helping to drive this economy. And while it might have been narrowly construed, we don't read it that way.","So on the one hand, I think it's early, on other hand, we don't think it's going to get traction. On the third hand, it's not even clear how it would be enforced, because it would appear to be, not really enforceable as a UCC loan or enforceable as a mortgage loan, it sort of creates a third category of - I don't even know what. So, I think we'll monitor it, I'm sure there will be significant opposition to it from the business community and we'll just see where it goes.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. And then, Steve, as you talk to some of the bigger, especially on the tech side, are you seeing that when they look at Manhattan for space, are they trying to sort of create like a campus where if they have to be in multiple locations, they want to have buildings that are within a few blocks of each other, or is your sense that as these bigger tech users come to the city, they\u2019re just happy to take space wherever they can get it.","So if it means splitting it between Downtown and Midtown or in different sub-markets, they're buying? Or is it like, I mean, I'm just thinking about Facebook where it seems like they aggregated pretty tight to one another up on the west side?","Andrew Mathias","Well, I think it's interesting. If you roll the tape back a couple of years ago, the tech tenants that were in the city by and large migrated to older buildings. Buildings with a lot of character, smaller floor plates. They were hampered with lots of columns, small windows, low ceilings, that kind of thing. But it was in the Midtown South market where they wanted sort of the quality of life.","And as that industry has gotten bigger in the city and the size of the tenants have expanded, and the sophistication of those tenants has grown their need for quality real estate has led them to better quality buildings that can support the occupancy, which means bigger ceilings, bigger windows, less columns, better infrastructure, where they can support greater density of occupancy.","So that's driving them to new construction. It puts us in the catbird seat with the redevelopment of One Madison, because it's large floor plates in the part of town that they want to be. And I think that's the real change, that you've seen in that sector of the marketplace, where it was not just about which part of town, they want to be in. Now they're finding themselves needing to be in certain types of buildings.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Derek Johnston from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Derek Johnston","Good afternoon, everybody. DPE balances dropped to $1.61 billion this quarter. Is this the new base to grow from? And have DPE balances bottomed out? Or well we see a bit more shrinkage here?","Andrew Mathias","It's Andrew. I think you'll see those balances rebound quite a bit by the end of the first quarter or mid-second quarter. We've already added about $100 million of assets, so far in the first quarter and that $1.6 billion should be a low point. I think our guidance was to end the year a bit higher than that.","Derek Johnston","Okay. Great. And given the dispositions this quarter, how do you plan to reuse the proceeds and what will the split be?","Marc Holliday","Well, by dispositions we thought...","Matthew DiLiberto","We actually - it's Matt. We didn't - we didn't dispose a lot in the fourth quarter. In the first quarter, we expect to close 220 and that will fund the combination of share buybacks and debt repayment, so that we maintain leverage neutrality.","Derek Johnston","Excellent. Thanks guys.","Matthew DiLiberto","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico from Scotiabank. Your line is now open.","Nick Yulico","I was hoping you could just talk a little bit more about how the conversation is going at 625 Madison, where you mentioned you have a ground lease reset, you're dealing with. Any updates there?","Marc Holliday","Well no updates and on past calls we\u2019ve gotten that question and it\u2019s going to be increasingly tricky, because it's \u2013 there\u2019ll be a fair market value reset. I think, it's in '21 or second half of '21. So it's still ways off - but the determination will be in '21. So we get to work on it in '21, the effective date is '22. And it's still a way off, but to the extent it becomes subject of any kind of dispute or procedure or anything. We're going to probably not say a whole lot about this other than from our standpoint it's a pretty straight down the middle F&B reset, we've dealt with them before and myriad of other lease - space leases and ground leases.","And we think we have a fairly good handle on where it should come out. And on that basis, we feel confident that we'll be in a position to have the rent reset, execute a modest building repositioning program and re-let the Polo space at the right time.","In the interim, we are actively pursuing interim leases on a short term basis and getting some traction there to create some ancillary revenue, that actually wasn't really included in our 2020 guidance. But notwithstanding that, we're hopeful that, that will be some upside in 2020.","Nick Yulico","Okay, it's helpful. And then maybe a question for Andrew or anyone. In terms of all the tech leasing that has happened last year, there's more in the pipeline, has that yet translated into any change in buyer sentiment in the market or in terms of more assets, larger assets come into market in New York City because of some of this confidence in the tech leasing in the market?","Andrew Mathias","Yeah, I think the short answer is yes. I mean, I think there is an understanding there\u2019s going to be enormous amount of hiring to fill a lot of this space that's being committed for 2023, let's call it, 2022, 2023, 2024 delivery. And that obviously has a multiplier effect. So generally investors, other than public shareholders are extremely positive on New York City and its prospects.","And we showed that analytically at the Investor conference and we continue to hear it more and more in our travels as people are very bullish on New York, and they love the occupancy to statistics, and they love sort of the makeup of the growth in the market.","Nick Yulico","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Aaron Wolf from Stifel. Your line is now open.","John Guinee","Great. I think, this is John Guinee here. You have another lease - ground lease coming up, it's not for 20 odd years, Avenue of the Americas, but you've got some big tenants, in that building, 1 million square feet. When do you start having discussions with the ground lessor? And when do you start being reluctant to put money into the building knowing that you've got this down the road?","David Schonbraun","Hey, John, it's David Schonbraun. I think any lease like that where it's so far out, I think it's a little too premature. I think as you get a lot closer to the exploration and you have to make leasing decisions, where you don't have enough time to maybe get a lease and kind of give extension options, that's when those conversations more ripen. Right now it's just too early and there is too much term on it. So it really doesn't make sense to do it at this time.","Andrew Mathias","We did - we just completed a pretty significant repositioning and capital campaign at that building in advance of the vacancy that you're seeing now. So we did a lobby renovation, some systems work and sort of improve the curb appeal of the building quite a bit. So we invested that capital in contemplation of getting long-term leases that will sort of lead-up to that, that revaluation. But beyond that, we'll see.","Matthew DiLiberto","We're trading paper with some of that near - the nearest term lease expiration. We're already trading paper with prospective tenants.","John Guinee","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Craig Mailman","Hey, guys. Just curious, Greenberg signed another lease at 420 [ph] Does that affect at all kind of the lease at One Vande in the space needs, could they transfer that or vice versa?","David Schonbraun","No, no. That was always part of their game plan from day one, was to have a split operation where part of their people would be over at the Graybar building. The amount of space they took at Graybar was a larger amount of space than they originally contemplated. So that was good news.","And a number of the tenants at One Vanderbilt have elected to split their operation, putting some of their support people in surrounding buildings and we've been a beneficiary of that as well.","Craig Mailman","Okay. That's helpful. And then just to go back to the slides you guys had at the Investor Day on the bridge and the CapEx, associated with the NOI coming online. Just two questions, a follow-up questions to that.","One, kind of what's the threshold on probability for a tenant staying versus going for some of the bigger kind of tenants you guys have here that have expirations in the next couple of years that we already know about? And then how much capital if any is in there for complying with the first phase of the carbon emissions in 2024?","Matthew DiLiberto","It's Matt. So your first question was what's our probability of retaining tenants. I mean, generally, our historical average is 60% to 70%, retention rate. And for the leases that we know are the tenants that we know are leaving or known vacancies we put in assumptions there. I mean, it's, I can't get into specifics as to how we do but obviously we take those into consideration.","Carbon emissions, we've said and shown, we are compliant through the known compliance period. So there is an incremental capital that is needed there, and we feel our portfolio is well ahead as evidenced by our scores of the New York City requirements and the other portfolios in the city.","We always have things in there ahead of regulatory requirements and safe to assume there's some in there in that capital plan as well. But as for what happens beyond '24, those rules are not out yet, and so we don't have a large number or any specific number in there for that.","Marc Holliday","Yeah, from for what we know through 2030, the cost is de minimis. So I mean, for the next 10 years we - based on what we do know, we know it's to be de minimis. If you're asking 2030 and beyond, those standards will be set. And then we'll have a better sense of things.","But as I said there'll be revised and modified from what came out. And there is committees and task force that have been set up to do that. So it is being actively attended to even though it's very early. But the '24 hurdles, I think, we did a whole segment on that in December showing that, we were almost entirely compliant today for '24.","Craig Mailman","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Green from Evercore. Your line is now open.","Jason Green","Just a question on the Suburban sale. Are you able to provide a cap rate on that sale? And also, generally, how deep the buyer pool was?","Matthew DiLiberto","Cap rate, we're not in a position to give the buyer pool. I would say, it's a light buyer pool in the suburbs, much lighter than in the city. That's part of the time that it's taken us to divest that portfolio. We still have the two assets remaining, as you know, in Stamford, Connecticut. And we were very pleased to be able to come to a resolution on those assets in White Plains.","Jason Green","And I guess just a follow-up just what the activity level is in the remaining Suburban assets?","Matthew DiLiberto","For lease or sale?","Jason Green","For sale.","Matthew DiLiberto","I think one of them was going through a rent revaluation process on a ground lease, which is now complete. It resulted in no increase in ground rent, and that asset is now, in our view, ready for sale, given the rent is set and that uncertainty is taken away. And the other asset is Landmark Square in Stamford, where we continue to manage and lease and collect significant income.","But I'd say, for this - at this moment, we're sort of taking a pause on the marketing process there, completing some leasing and other activity at the building, and then, ultimately, look to reintroduce that building for sale.","Andrew Mathias","And Jason, just to be clear, we did not include the sale of Landmark Square in our business plan for 2020.","Jason Green","Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Vikram Malhotra","Thanks for taking the question. Just with the news that WeWork sort of slowed down and potentially maybe giving back some space, can you just sort of update us broadly on your thoughts on sort of how this may evolve from a demand perspective, but more specifically on 609 Fifth where WeWork did find leads. Like where are we in that process? Are they - are they already cash paying? Or is that yet to commence?","Marc Holliday","Well, on 609 specifically, I think WeWork commenced its rent payments, I want to say April?","Andrew Mathias","Yeah.","Marc Holliday","Yeah. So, they're close to, but not quite at their rent commencement period. They just gave us an updated construction schedule. So they seem to be going full bore ahead at this moment to complete their base building work and installation. How long that will take them? I'm not quite sure. But based on the scope of the work I say at least till the end of this year. But in all respects, there is nothing notable to note on 609 or the WeWork lease there, other than they are in the process of doing their work.","As it relates to the market generally, the co-working companies have definitely - they down their demand in New York in the fourth quarter pretty sizably, but that certainly didn't seem to have an effect that we saw in the fourth quarter.","Andrew Mathias","I don't know, giving back space, I haven't seen...","Marc Holliday","I'm not referring to giving back, the question...","Andrew Mathias","No, the question was - he referred to giving back...","Marc Holliday","No, no...","Andrew Mathias","They have contractual obligations. We haven't heard of them walking away from any contractual obligations, so I'm not sure.","Matthew DiLiberto","So just to add to that, we've had a number of discussions with them. And what they have consistently said to us is that, the focus of their business plan is on their core cities, New York City - New York, London and the like, being - they're hyper-focused on. And they realized that their outer-borough cities, that's where you may hear about them pulling back from. But New York City, they expect to continue to be expanding as the years to come and certainly not retracting on any of their current commitments.","Marc Holliday","Yeah, I know a lot of the focus is on WeWork, but Nutella is out there also, as someone who is going through a lot of the same things that we hear about and see and have experienced where they seem to be pulling back from deals, not giving up space, if that was the question, but certainly downsizing their demand greatly and laying off employees. So I think you're going to see it within that sector.","But the market both in terms of what we achieved in the fourth quarter and the pipeline we have in front of us doesn't seem to be meaningfully affected by that pullback because the tenants that might otherwise have gone into those facilities just seem to be back to coming to landlords direct.","And so maybe that's even - either way, whether it's derivatively through a co-worker or direct, the leasing space, as I always said, is a good thing for us and we support - we support any company that's leasing space, whether it's directly or as part of a co-working community aggregator, if you will.","But the important thing is the job growth is there, the underlying demand is there, so space will get leased directly or through one of the co-working companies.","Vikram Malhotra","Okay, that's helpful. Just last - just to clarify on the income NOI from - cash NOI from the retail properties. Any - anything from any of the leases recently signed, whether it's PUMA or anything, in terms of like a bump up in the cash NOI. And can you give us an update on the McDonald space?","Matthew DiLiberto","As it relates to PUMA, they started - we started income recognition late last year, when they open, they opened in August, September time frame, they and Vince. So you'll have a full year effect this year versus just a partial year last year, but that's the most material on the retail side.","Marc Holliday","The McDonald's space is demoed and prepped, looks beautiful and is formally on the market as of about 30 days ago. So, we'll look forward to activity this year, again, that space leased up. But McDonald's are still paying rent on that space for several more years, as you know.","Vikram Malhotra","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I'm showing no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Marc Holliday for closing remarks.","Marc Holliday","Okay. Well thank you all for somewhat abbreviated call, but we appreciate the questions and look forward to a very ambitious and productive year in 2020 and look forward to speaking to you again in three months.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

At this time the company would like to remind listeners that during the call, management may make forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ from the forward-looking statements that management may make today.

Thank you. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Marc Holliday. Please go ahead Marc.","Marc Holliday","Okay, thank you and good afternoon everyone. I think you\u2019ll all be fairly pleased with our abbreviated format for today\u2019s call which follows our extremely fulsome investor presentation last month. I think that December\u2019s presentation was by far the strongest and most comprehensive one yet and I think that that was affirmed by the extremely positive feedback we got from shareholders and analysts since that date and has reflected not in substantially in the stock price since that time as well.","So we are still very much on track with a lot of the goal and objectives we put out there about six or seven weeks ago. I think the market is forming up in a way which will still enable us to be right on track with our fairly aggressive goals that we set for ourselves and so I\u2019ll just take this opportunity now to highlight a few items occurring since that time before opening it up for Q&A.","Last night, and pretty notably we achieved a significant milestone in the One Vanderbilt entitlement process. After lengthy negotiations in numerous meetings with Manhattan Borough President Gail Brewer and her staff the Borough President has recommended approval of the project inclusive of certain improvements we have agreed to make. There continues to be strong community support from groups like the coalition for a Better Grand Central and the straphangers campaign, both of which greatly helped us achieve this important milestone along with many other groups for which we are thankful for their support.","At the investor conference in December Rob Schiffer explained in some detail that the euro process contains 40 steps the first being the local community board followed by the Manhattan Borough President recommendation yesterday, then onto city planning commission and finally city council.","Next week we will be presenting the project to the city planning commission the third stop at a hearing where we hope to receive significant support from all of the key stake holders, unions, coalitions and civic groups.","The Borough President\u2019s approval gives us great momentum as we enter into the final stages of this process and we remain confident that we will achieve our goal of the special permit for One Vanderbilt this coming May which is consistent with the timeline we set out for everybody in December.","So, turning now towards leasing, we obviously went through a fairly exhaustive amount of information on the portfolio in the market in December and that supported I think our contention that when we would be taking a fairly sizeable step forward this year and into next year over the next 12 to 18 months and I will say right now the market environment is such that it\u2019s forming up in a way that these are meeting or exceeding our expectations. Just since December 8th we\u2019ve signed about 230,000 square feet of leases and 18 different transactions that\u2019s in the Manhattan portfolio and as you saw for the quarter, fourth quarter we were up about 13% or slightly more than that mark-to-market and nearly 15% mark-to-market for the entire year 2014.","So I would say that that\u2019s still the primary engine on the operating side, the core earning side of what we are looking to and as I go through the pipeline with Steve Durels, I see that \u2013we\u2019ve got on top of that another 1.1 million in the pipeline as we sit here today, that\u2019s as of 28th, which is about 70 somewhat thousand square feet out for signature, half a million square feet of leasing in negotiation and then another half a million square feet that are pipeline deals in their term sheet negotiation.","So again, anytime that pipeline exceeds or approaches a million square feet, I would call that fairly robust for the kinds of targets we had for the year which, Matt, if my memory serves me right we are about 1.8 million square feet for the year. And that\u2019s something that I think we still feel very good about given the demand that we see out there and the winnowing supply as the absorption in this market continues to accelerate.","We had a pleasant surprise at the end of the year which I don\u2019t think has been fully \u2013 had not been really communicated in a formal way to the market yet as it relates to the Suburban leasing activity. Since December 8, the investor meeting there was a 185,000 square feet of leasing, since then 122,000 square feet of that representing new leases, total of 19 transactions and true to form, the suburban group signed eight of those deals on December 31, right into New Years eve.","Eight different transactions, 60,000 feet [ph] which were encompassed in that 185,000 feet which made for quite a \u2013 it put quite exclamation point on the end of the year for in improving suburban market outlook as we see it, and I think you saw some of the metrics relating to mark-to-market and occupancy also trended up in the fourth quarter. So that was good news.","I think the leasing is also punctuated by two of the recent announcement this morning. The Swarovski deal at 10 East 53rd I think its affirmation of the excellent job, the construction and design team and leasing team have done in reposition and redeveloping that asset in a way to capture these type of high quality profile tenants. Swarovski is our first new office tenant, new office tenant lease post redevelopment and that\u2019s on top of the Equinox deal we announced previously for major fitness center down in that building. So we still are very, very bullish on the prospects for 10 East 53rd this year.","And on top of that you heard, many of you heard Brett Herschenfeld talk about significant mark-to-market in the retail portfolio back in December and I think one great example of how we\u2019ve now monetized just a small piece, but a significant piece of that mark-to-market was with their announce diesel deal of 625, Madison with many more deals in the pipeline to come from the retail leasing side.","So that was very strong. And the debt and preferred equity front, our balances remain roughly the same through year end. I think that people saw a slight dip in the average yield reported on fourth quarter activity about 8.3%, that\u2019s actually fairly consistent with our guidance of around 8.5% and it\u2019s still leads a portfolio that\u2019s averaging 10.5% on a $1.4 billion, so I wouldn\u2019t get too overly focus on the quarterly ups and downs. We have some quarters that exceed to 10%, this quarter was 8.3%.","I would look to the average on the $1.4 billion, 10.5% I think that the best depiction of the earnings power of that portfolio for 2015. And by way of example just already into this year we\u2019ve originated about $111 million of new debt and preferred equity investments which had a yield of just slightly under 10% in the high nine, so again that pipeline is still \u2013 we think extremely strong.","We have fairly lofty origination goals of adding an incremental $250 million to our net balances by the end of 2015 and that\u2019s an increment that\u2019s on top of whatever the expected pay offs and redemptions are this year. So that could approximate activity certainly in excess of $600 million of gross originations.","And looking at a pipeline in front of me now, which is about a dozen deals or so that would make a significant dent in that total and its only January. So I think that\u2019s reflective of a market that\u2019s got a very high amount of transaction activity and as a result of that transaction activity it drives financing opportunities and debt and preferred equity investments for people like us.","Lastly, Andrew Mathias talked about unlocking opportunity in the liability side of the balance sheet and talked about all the opportunities we\u2019ve saw to take higher rate debt and either unsecured certain assets or term it out using lower more efficient and cheaper forms of secured and\/or corporate bond financing is available in today\u2019s market.","And I think one example of where we\u2019ve now monetized or illuminated that since the Investor Meeting in on 3 Columbus where we\u2019ve signed a commitment with the lender for $350 million financing at a interest rate of about 3.6% which is locked for ten years, which is a very \u2013 we think a very good piece of financing in terms of both repatriation of our substantial equity investment into that deal for a long term lock-in of rates that are very advantageous level and there is more of that to come as you remember when you extrapolate that to the whole portfolio, we should you the kinds of interest savings number that could be achieved on a full mark-to-market at today\u2019s rates, and today\u2019s rates are lower than what we projected back in December 8 due to the rise \u2013 recent rise in treasury prices. So all-in-all I think good news to report. It was a very good quarter and as important the prospects for 2015 look to be very much in line with how we hope to execute. ","And with that, I would turn it over for questions and answers.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from James Feldman of Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","James Feldman","Great. Thank you. I guess just starting out for Steve Durels or anyone in general at the investor day you had commented you'd see a premium in 2015 for big blocks of space. Can you give your latest thoughts on what's happening in the big block market today in terms of the lease-to-demand pipeline? And then, also your thoughts on competitive big blocks that will be in the market this year? ","Steven Durels","Sure. There\u2019s a great step which I think support that which is fact that the number of the scarcity of big block availabilities in Midtown. There\u2019s only five spaces available in Midtown that are 250,000 square feet or greater compared to ten units from year ago. So from a supply side certainly it\u2019s drying up fast.","The number of large leases that were signed last year sort of give you trend line was dramatically larger. There were 58 leases signed last year for 100,000 square feet or more compared to 43 leases from the prior year, but more telling was the fact that there were 33 relocations rather than just renewal deals compared to only 17 large leases to prior year and those large block deals were 7.5 million square feet compared to 3.4 square feet. So clearly from the demand side and offset by the lack of supply makes us very bullish as to why this is going to premium on the big block.","James Feldman","Okay. And then secondly, on the suburban market, can you just talk more about who is signing leases out there and what kind of assets they\u2019re looking for? Are they rail? Are they transit served or not, just little more color on why there was a pick up in the fourth quarter?","Isaac Zion","Sure. This is Isaac. You are clearly seeing more activity in the transit-oriented buildings in White Plains and Stamford. And in terms of tenant types it\u2019s really across the board. You\u2019ve got legal financial services, tech, healthcare; we signed probably three or four leases north of 50,000 square feet. So there are also larger tenants coming back into the market as well and that\u2019s striving both occupancy and mark-to-market both of which have been really, really positive.","James Feldman","That\u2019s giving sense.","Isaac Zion","So for example we signed up Legal Aid for close to 30,000 square feet. Cummings & Lockwood, which is a law firm, for 55,000 feet, Sony for 53,000 feet. So it\u2019s across \u2013 it\u2019s really across the board. And this is the first time in the last two to three years that we\u2019ve seen positive direction from different tenant types not just healthcare, not just education, so it\u2019s across the entire gamut.","James Feldman","And are these tenants coming out of the city, or they are local tenants that are expanding?","Isaac Zion","The vast, vast majority are local tenants. They are either moving, they are expanding, both the positive thing here is we have seen them actually getting bigger. So if it was a 20,000 square foot tenant moving from building X to one of ours, they are now taking 22,000, 23, 000 so that\u2019s actually really positive sign.","Marc Holliday","Just as a note on our portfolio performance versus the market, our performance is trending towards around 84% which is better than the market. I mean, we are \u2013 I think group, the Reckson group in White Plains and Stamford are doing an excellent job of outperforming the market. So I think what Isaac is telling to you are the types of tenants we\u2019re attracting and we\u2019re wining and we\u2019re doing it on economic terms that are accretive which I think is not necessarily illustrative of the market as a whole which is improving but I don\u2019t think improving is rapidly as our portfolio.","James Feldman","Got it. All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross Nussbaum of UBS. Your line is open.","Ross Nussbaum","Hey, guys. Good afternoon. We saw some market reports that you guys might have made some leasing progress at 280 Park Ave. Can you talk a little bit about where that project stands currently?","Marc Holliday","Sure. As we said right now we are \u2013 the only reason we didn\u2019t put a press release out covering because there\u2019s a large deal that we signed in early January with Fiduciary ","Trust for 126,000 square feet was generally reported in the local papers. So that was deal that we\u2019ve been working on for quite a while. There was for 3.5 base floors of the building at rents that were well within our underwrite numbers, leases with 302,000 square feet of remaining office space left in the building which is about 24% of the office space.","We have leases out on another 110,000 square feet of that availability. And then we have another close to 80,000 square feet of term sheets that we\u2019re very hopeful we\u2019ll get converted into leases within the next couple of weeks. So we\u2019ve basically completed I\u2019d say 95% of the capital program and as soon as we unveil the lobby and if you been through the building and seen the second half of the lobby that recently opened. It really opened up the floodgates as far as tenant demand.","And where we were very optimistic and bullish on the project early last year, now it sort of high five because everybody is coming through one right after another and we\u2019re going to -- we close everything that we\u2019re working on. We\u2019ll be down to the only one base floor left in the building and beyond that, a smattering of partial spaces up in the tower.","So we\u2019ll be \u2013 we should have the building stabilized this year without too much fear. And rents were on rise and as we saw all last it all financial service, nothing but financial services.","Ross Nussbaum","Great. Appreciate that. Second question either Andrew or Marc, General Growth did announce the Crown building deal on Fifth and 57th. So I guess it's a two-part question. One is, are you guys looking at \u2013 have an opportunity of putting some mezz on that deal?","And then number two, I'm guessing you took a hard look at it, if General Growth can hit their 6% stabilized yield target in three years, I'm curious. That doesn't seem like an unreasonable number relative to where our cap rates are in Manhattan. What was it about that deal that you guys didn't see?","Marc Holliday","I\u2019ll let Andrew take that one.","Andrew Mathias","We are \u2013 I\u2019m going to not comment on the acquisition. I\u2019ll just say, we obviously underwrote the deal carefully. We knew the sellers and we didn\u2019t see that type of earning potential on our plan for the asset. And the mezzanine \u2013 we\u2019re \u2013 I honestly don\u2019t know what GGP is doing in terms of that capital stock there. So it\u2019s not an opportunity that\u2019s crossed our desk. We would certainly look at if it did. But he has generally -- the deals he bought thus far in Manhattan is generally used lower leverage and used some master leases and other structures to get its debt cost very low. So, I don\u2019t if he\u2019ll do the same on Crown or not.","Ross Nussbaum","Thank you. Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Guinee of Stifel. Your line is open.","John Guinee","John Guinee, I'm just curious because you've never brought this up before, but One Vanderbilt, I guess you've got about 700,000 or 800,000 square feet in place, up-zoned to about 1.6 million square feet. Can you provide, I guess just on a square foot basis, what you think your land basis is going to be including your building costs, all of your fees, infrastructure cost, demo cost and so people can get a sense for whether your land basis is $200 a foot or $2,000 a buildable foot? And then what you think your total development cost is going to be on One Vanderbilt?","Marc Holliday","John, I think what we said in the December, we went through the building program fairly extensively in the design and the entitlement process. We are completely focused on those elements right now and getting through what\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s been a long road of assemblage acquisition, possession and now entitlements over time.","At the conclusion of that effort when it\u2019s done and we know what we have and we know the total cost in and what we\u2019re \u2013 total envelope of the building and the exact program. I think we\u2019ll go into that in much greater detail, but that\u2019s kind of a \u2013 that\u2019s a later in the year kind of event for us. I know we\u2019ve been saying that for some time now but it\u2019s still is the case because there\u2019s a lot of different moving pieces.","You saw even yesterday we had to make some modifications to the property that we think were good improvements and certainly good for public benefit and public realm improvement, but until everything sort of \u2013 until we have everything isolate and identified, it would be premature to going through numbers. But you can certainly look back and see what our acquisition cost are for the assemblage and that\u2019s the bulk of cost but then obviously there\u2019s all the public realm improvements, we\u2019ve been pretty specific on $210 million of cost associated with public realm improvement. And then obviously a lot of predevelopment possession cost on top of that which like I said when it\u2019s all settled we\u2019ll be able to give it better picture of.","John Guinee","Just intellectual curiosity, when you are taking down 800,000 square feet brick by brick, have you got any preliminary demo costs on that yet?","Andrew Mathias","Yes.","John Guinee","Okay.","Andrew Mathias","In line with, I mean, we do a lot of demolition in the city. This isn\u2019t the first and I would say it\u2019s certainly not the most material of items on the budget and consistent with \u2013 the kind of demolition cost we experience throughout the city. We do annually enormous volumes of demolition of space and occasionally structures.","John Guinee","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Bilerman of Citi. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey, guys, [indiscernible] Michael. Just wonder if you can comment on any changes you\u2019re seeing to the investment landscape in Manhattan and maybe if you could focus on any changing trends you\u2019re seeing from foreign buyers?","Andrew Mathias","I think we went through specifically at Investor Day that the trends emerging in terms of a lot of Chinese capital coming into the market. Canadian capital continuing to play a dominate role. I\u2019d say since Investor Day we\u2019ve seen Japanese capital with Mitsui Fudosan making a large investment in to Hudson Yards with related. So there\u2019s a lot of Japanese capital circulating around \u2013 there is just continued demand from all different points on the globe and in all different property types that are driving the market.","I think you\u2019re seeing that at a trophy level and you\u2019re also seeing it a very deep level of demand for properties like 315 Park Avenue South which traded within the last quarter. And other sort of side-street and less high profile glass and steel building, which are trading at record levels throughout the city.","Unidentified Analyst","Have you seen any impacts from just drop in crude prices more recently or has that really not trickle down to the buyer pool yet?","Andrew Mathias","Hasn\u2019t trickle down to the buyer pool quite yet. I read about it as having more direct impact on condo buyers, individuals but not on the commercial land at all.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brendan Maiorana of Well Fargo. Your line is open.","Brendan Maiorana","Thanks. Good afternoon. The retail disclosure that you guys provided it\u2019s helpful, I think you talked about that at the Investor Day when you gave the outlook on the significant amount of rent growth. I think there was $165 million of rent growth over the next several years. If we look stabilized retail asset either kind of retail at the base of an office building or standalone retail, how do you think the valuation of those cap rate basis stabilized retail would compare to stabilize office in the city?","Marc Holliday","Yes. I think it\u2019s similar, I mean, I think stabilized retail is getting slightly more aggressive bids than stabilized office. So stabilized office is sort of 4 caps stabilized retail would be 3.5, 3, 3.25 cap on prime areas. But it\u2019s hard to generalize because every property has its own market issue or opportunities that play a role in cap rates.","Brendan Maiorana","Okay, understood. That's helpful. And then just maybe second one for Steve Durels. So you gave very helpful color on 280 Park. You did the Swarovski deal at 10 East 53rd, and I think you are targeting stabilization or leasing of that asset more in 2016 than 2015. But can you give us a sense of how the pipeline shapes up at 10 East 53rd?","Steve Durels","Yes. Remember we sign the Swarovski deal for two floors that was right on the tail of signing the two floor lease with Equinox. We have another lease out right now that we just went to documents with yesterday. The capital program is pretty well advanced. If you went over there today you\u2019d see probably 80% of the lobby work is complete, still a construction zone but when you walk in there you clearly get a sense of the scale of what\u2019s happening at the ground floor and how impactful that\u2019s going to be that to reposition this building. The windows have all been replace. The fa\u00e7ade has been recolored. A lot of infrastructure works been done.","And we\u2019ve got very strong tour activity from a mix of type of tenants. I\u2019d say for two-third of the space on the floors that are the 9,000 footers, its primarily financial services and international companies. And then ground stairs on the few floors that are little bit larger 16,000 foot floors those are more general service businesses.","We\u2019ve got four or five proposals out there we\u2019re trading with tenant. Most of them for the top third of the building and rents in that part of the building are anywhere from 95 to 115 a foot as far as the term sheet numbers that we\u2019re going back in forth with [indiscernible] so we\u2019re feeling like we\u2019re right on plan for that.","Brendan Maiorana","Okay. Great. And just Steve, quickly, at the base of the building, the rent differential between that sort of 100 to 110 at the top?","Steve Durels","So, it\u2019s a tale of two cities in that building. The bottom nine floors, two of which have already is lease, so it\u2019s only some floors left of space to worry about. Our 16,000 feet there, they don\u2019t have the big open views of Central Park we have upstairs. But that still sort of low 70s rents, which are right in line with underwriting and put it in a very good place far as been competitive in the market.","Brendan Maiorana","Great. Thanks for the time.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Goldfarb of Sandler O\u2019Neill. Your line is open.","Alex Goldfarb","Yes. Good afternoon, thanks. Two questions here. One, Marc, on the One Vanderbilt approvals from last night, I think you said the Manhattan Borough President, she approved it. What about Dan Garodnick [indiscernible] his name, but Dan the local district councilmember, is he also signed off on it now?","Marc Holliday","Yes. The city \u2013 the project comes before city council as I guess what we will call the last stop or the fourth prong of what I describe earlier. So Dan Garodnick is the local councilman who is been sort of intimately involved and knowledgeable with the project. I mean the entire city council will act on this. And so, Dan and rest of council are extremely important in terms of obtaining final approval. But that comes later on in April and May.","Alex Goldfarb","Okay. So the Borough President, she signed off on it. Now the next political hurdle is going to the Council as a whole. But presumably Dan is on board if the Borough\u2026","Marc Holliday","The Borough President gave his recommend, gave her recommendation yesterday last night. And that goes now before the City Planning Commission, because there\u2019s a lot of \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of technical features to this project that have to go first before the City Administration Planning. And then with hopefully with their support and informative vote it then goes to the city council for final vote.","Alex Goldfarb","Okay, cool. Second question \u2013 and Matt, again, thank you for the enhanced retail disclosure. Just curious, the vacancy when you look in the columns, obviously you show the current in-place rent versus what you think the mark to market would be. And then there's the vacancy where obviously there's nothing in place, but there's the market rent of that vacant space. And all of that vacant space is materially higher than what you had in place as far as what the mark to market is on the in-place. So is this stuff that you \u2013 is this vacancy that you've acquired, or this is stuff that you're holding vacant off market waiting to obviously hit those numbers?","Matthew Diliberto","No. this is more vacancy that we\u2019ve acquired recently if you think particularly about what we\u2019ve acquired in 2014. We acquired a lot of things with that were either vacant or were anticipated to be vacant so we could re-tenant them. So those are more recent vantage than the occupied space.","Alex Goldfarb","Okay. And just for sense markup can you sort of what the old rents that used to be on this spaces were?","Matthew Diliberto","It did vary by property, but it\u2019s measured not in percentages, it\u2019s measured in multiples.","Alex Goldfarb","Okay. That\u2019s cool. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jed Reagan of Green Street Advisors.","Your line is open.","Jed Reagan","Hi, guys. Its look like on the concession side, tenant improvement dollars came in a little bit last quarter but free rents on the higher side. Just wondering if you can talk broadly about trends you\u2019re seeing with concessions and when you expect those might start to improve in a meaningful way?","Marc Holliday","The number in any one quarter are so widely driven by whether or not we\u2019re doing large deals or small deals and how many of the deals we\u2019re doing are renewals is oppose to new transactions on space that\u2019s completely raw and needs a full concession package. So I don\u2019t know that you can glean a lot from the number from one quarter to the next. I\u2019ll tell you that broadly speaking there\u2019s seem to be greater willingness on tenants to absorb rent increases as oppose to reduction of concessions, concessions are slowly coming down a little bit, certainly by comparison two years ago they\u2019re down materially.","But I think construction cost for tenants are going up not only because commodity prices are up and labors up, but also because how much tenants have to spend as they densify their office. Their build-out, their needs are greater, more infrastructure, more furniture, more telecom. Everything that just goes into putting a lot of people in same piece of space, and therefore that explains why the tenants are willing to pay more rent but resistant to really knocking down the concession. So I think it\u2019s going to be a slower reduction in concessions over the year where we\u2019ll see alternatively a bigger pop in rents as the years go forward.","Jed Reagan","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then with the U.S. dollars strengthening recent, I just curious if you\u2019re seeing any evidence of impact in your retail portfolio just in terms of fall off in tourist traffic or weaker sales, and does that strong dollar change your growth strategy for Manhattan Street or New York Street retail at all?","Steve Durels","No, I mean to the contrary we\u2019re busy on the leasing in the retail portfolio as evidence by the diesel lease and haven\u2019t seen any \u2013 seen any reported changes or certainly haven\u2019t felt throughout the portfolio.","Jed Reagan","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And actually any color you can offer on the diesel lease in terms of economics?","Steve Durels","It was an 83 increase from the prior rent which was a Baccarat space in a very strong deal and there\u2019s lot of demand on Madison.","Jed Reagan","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ian Wiseman of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Ian Wiseman","Thank you. Just a quick follow-up on the diesel deal, what was a motivating factor behind their move, I think they\u2019ve only been in that location for five years?","Marc Holliday","You are referring to the Fifth Avenue location","Ian Wiseman","Yes. Assuming they are leaving there?","Marc Holliday","Somebody paid them a fortune to leave.","Ian Wiseman","Let me ask you this question. What would be the rent differential between space in that for space on the Fifth Avenue location today versus what you\u2019re getting?","Marc Holliday","Probably 50%.","Ian Wiseman","50% higher. Okay.","Marc Holliday","No. Double, so the rent on Fifth Avenue was more than twice the rent on Madison.","Ian Wiseman","Got you. And moment they\u2019re lease up, it wasn\u2019t. How much term did they have left?","Marc Holliday","I think that that was sub lease I think they had through 18, but I\u2019m not positive.","Ian Wiseman","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Burke of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Brad Burke","Hi. Thank you. Good afternoon. I had a follow-up to Manny\u2019s question on investment trends, I wanted to know as you have been talking to source as a capital over the past month, do you have a sense of how their allocations are trending this year versus what they were allocating last year?","Marc Holliday","Allocations to\u2026","Brad Burke","Allocations to new investments in New York office specifically.","Marc Holliday","So allocations specifically Manhattan office.","Brad Burke","Right.","Marc Holliday","I don\u2019t know if we had that data, that\u2019s hard to sell with the relative allocation is \u2013 I would say that anyone who is investing domestically and in the commercial sectors here one, I mean Manhattan is generally at the top of the list in terms of desire to allocate. It\u2019s hard to say what percentage either of the whole portfolio or vis-a-vis other markets.","But I think the \u2013 I can\u2019t say the desire is increased, I think it\u2019s always there as their primary goal we get calls daily. And that\u2019s not an exaggeration or embellishment, I mean everyday multiple, multiple calls from foreign domestic institutional, non-institutional people who either want to buy a joint venture.","So it\u2019s hard to put that into a percentage allocation. It\u2019s just a \u2013 it\u2019s a very, very deep demand I think for every asset we have it\u2019s really a matter of price. I mean if demand is almost always there it\u2019s a question of terms and price, which is I think you see what\u2019s driving this market and driving these values to in many cases new peak levels over the prior peak in \u201906 and \u201907. But I think if you don\u2019t have any sense specifically of percentage outlook.","Unidentified Company Speaker","No I don\u2019t, but I think what you are saying, maybe it\u2019s still very strong, it\u2019s not maybe a little bit higher because you are seeing some foreign investors looking at different product type, not just the trophy, glass and steel they are looking at more of your B building, side street product type like, Joeva [ph] which is a Japanese group buying 449 and 24, and 28 west 25 and 40 west 25. I think historically you wouldn\u2019t have seen that, so clearly appetite is strong because those are the assets that are available.","Brad Burke","Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe moving out of the city to the suburbs. Obviously you've had some leasing momentum there, and I know you wanted to sell more in the suburbs. Can you give us a sense of what you're seeing in cap rate momentum? And do you also have a sense whether there are buyers that are getting sticker shock in the city and are looking to allocate more to suburban property?","Marc Holliday","There still haven\u2019t been enough trades to see exactly where our cap rates are actually going. And every building they are so unique in terms of tripling their leases, all the buildings are 50% leased but we have seen some transactions in Connecticut and in Northern Jersey that are basically been people who have owned lands or building some Brooklyn, Queens the city and they are 10 30 [ph] running out of those assets into the old same Connecticut and Westchester. So we are seeing that as a little bit of a trend.","Unidentified Company Speaker","I think the sequence is generally the market first and I think we\u2019re seeing market improvement, then the financing, the finance ability of these assets and we are seeing decent bids out there from lenders and securitized and non-securitized lenders, willing to lend at attractive rates up in some of these metro markets outside of New York city proper. And I think the last piece of that is then the investor demand driving cap rates to compress which I would think that\u2019s probably will be happening this year.","Yes just based on the first two province being in place, can\u2019t say that we can give you evidence or specifics to that effect, but you always don\u2019t want to be looking in the rear view mirror, so if you want to go out on the [Indiscernible] make a bit of forecast, I would say you will start to see those cap rates compress this year.","Brad Burke","Okay. That\u2019s interesting, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jordan Saddler, Keybanc Markets. Your line is open","Jordan Saddler","Thank you. Good afternoon. I wanted to follow up a little bit I think tangent ally [ph] to the last question. And I appreciate the update since the investor day in early December. I can't help but notice that interest rates are down a full 50 basis points as you pointed out. So it increases the opportunity on the liability side of the balance sheet as you talked about. But what are you guys thinking on the asset side of the balance sheet given this pretty material shift?","Marc Holliday","So I think that on the asset side, there is really two things. It enhances our strategy of selectively disposing of assets. We did a substantial amount of dispositions in 2014 that was kind of punctuated by the almost $0.5 billion of sales, 180 Maiden lane which just closed, I think this month. So that\u2019s a fairly significant deal right on the heels of 2 Herald which I think also closed there in the fourth quarter of December.","So we will continue to sell into that market. I don\u2019t think the 50 basis points means we\u2019ll sell more or less. I mean we had a plan, we\u2019re on plan maybe it means on the margins we are going to get some higher pricing. I don\u2019t think the 50 basis points of treasury is necessarily basis point or basis point equal to reduction and financing rates because when you get below 3.5% for 10 year money, I think it starts to get a bit sticky in terms of what the absolute rate will be for 10 year, I owe money.","But clearly the financing rates have come in and we\u2019ll take advantage of that on the liability side as Andrew talked about, it should add incrementally to the sales and obviously on our acquisitions we are underwriting lower rates right now, so either higher levered returns or it could drive pricing a bit further. But we tend to model on our underwriting everything is towards stabilized markets, so we are never just taking the spot market cap rate, the spot market financing rate on acquisitions, we are always modeling the curve, we often \u2013 on like where we\u2019ve modeled the curve plus a 50 basis point cushion which I think many of you, some of you may not.","We hold our exit cap rates pretty stable at levels far in excess of where the spot market, the cap rates are today and I think that hurts us a bit on cap rate, but it certainly protects us in the future against any kind of cap rate increase and we keep our absolute level of returns pretty consistent looking to stabilize at 6% or more current cash returns and 8% to 10% levered returns and that probably translates into 6.5% to 8% returns.","So that I think is not varying greatly because of the interest rate decline, but on the margin it certainly is up.","Jordan Saddler","Thanks for the color. And a follow up for Steve on the demand for space from financial services specifically I\u2019m kind of curious, you guys had mentioned that in December and it sounds like its materializing. What\u2019s the nature of it and how deep is it?","Steven Durels","I would say it\u2019s the largest user group in our portfolio as far as prospects right now. Total number of transactions in the pipeline, total square footage, part of that is reflective of the inventory that we currently have available so I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s a barometer, gives you the inside as to the overall market color but based upon the kinds of buildings, the kinds of floors in other price points that we currently have availability 10 East 53rd Street Tower 46 280 Park Avenue being best examples. Based on \u2013 all geared towards financial service industry tenants. Behind that we\u2019ve got some pretty good pipeline with the TAMI industry information services in particular, where we\u2019ve got high hopes that we are going to converse some of that over to some significant transactions.","Jordan Saddler","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from Vance Edelson of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Vance Edelson","Terrific, thanks. I\u2019ll just start with another Suburban question, would you describe your sentiment around the Suburbs is flexible at all not just on cap rates and financing rates, but given all the leasing sign at the end of December and that you are winning in the market with these assets, what\u2019s your appetite for curtailing dispositions or is it less a cyclical decision in more a secular feel for where you want to focus long term?","Steven Durels","Our Suburban portfolio has I think serves an important function in terms of it\u2019s fairly consistent cash flow. I mean, it\u2019s fairly low, it\u2019s a low consumer on the capital end of things as compared to the Manhattan portfolio so that\u2019s certainly a great attraction to the portfolio on why I think it\u2019s always play the key role for us is that it\u2019s a relatively unencumbered portfolio, its maintained occupancy in the low eighties, I think since we acquired it, sort of at a very tough period of time in 2007, 2008. The capital budget for that portfolio is very manageable and the market is picking up, so it\u2019s a contributor to the bottom line.","So we like that portfolio, it was pruned down from a much larger portfolio at the time we originally closed on the western transaction and we kept what we felt were the best properties and the best markets and I think that proved to be true during the downturn and we had the team of about 30 people up there that run this portfolio in White Plains and Stanford that are I think best in class.","And so everything we do there is no wholesale decision to hold, there is no wholesale decision to sell, I think everything is we look at is fairly opportunistic and if we can bring properties to stabilizations and a very strong bid comes back in the market and we have redeployment opportunities then I think you will see us execute on that program as we have in the past, but I don\u2019t see current conditions driving that significantly in one direction or the other, I think we are just going to continue with\u2026","Vance Edelson","Okay that's helpful. Then back on the tenant strength by vertical, so it's pretty widespread in the suburbs, and you also mentioned 280 Park being all financial services so to speak. And financial services representing the biggest user group now. If you had to compare the traditional verticals to TAMI though, can you just give us a feel -- do the traditional still pale in comparison to tech and so forth when it comes to growth and your feel for future growth, or is it really becoming a more balanced market?","Steven Durels","Well I think I think we\u2019ve been saying for the past couple of years quite frankly that the good news is that Manhattan is not as dependent upon financial services is what everybody felt years ago, because of one, the emergence of TAMI as being a big driver in the market place. So now it\u2019s TAMI legal and financial services and then followed by general business services. So you\u2019ve got really four big groups providing diversification as far as tenant demand goes.","On the financial service side, I think it\u2019s mostly the same as what we\u2019ve seen for the past year, year and a half which is the profile of that group has been asset management, hedge funds, private equity the commercial banking. You haven\u2019t yet seen the really big banks and the investment banks active in the market, although I think there is a couple of requirements kicking around today that weren\u2019t there a year, year and a half ago.","And part of that\u2019s driven on the investment banking requirements either by consolidations or lease expirations that are coming up. And one of the brokers that I speak to and now I think generally have a shared view which is that the banks are hopefully past understanding the regulations, they are new world environment, they are short on space nobody is sitting on a lot of excess inventory and they are sort of primed [ph] to start to come back into the market as they figure out how they can grow their businesses. So we think that\u2019s going to be a big tribute in the period to come.","Vance Edelson","Okay. That\u2019s good color. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. I\u2019m not showing any further questions in queue. I would like to turn the call back over to management for any further remarks.","Marc Holliday","Nothing further. We brought it in under an hour, so we thank all of you for listening in and look forward to the next time.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference.

My name is Keith and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded for replay purposes. And with that, I'd now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Ms. Heidi Gillette. Please go ahead.","Heidi Gillette","Thank you everybody for joining today. At this time, the company would like to remind listeners that during the call, management may make forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ from forward-looking statements that management may make today. Additional information regarding the factors that could cause such differences appear in the MD&A section of the company's Form 10-K and other reports filed by the company with the SEC.","Also during today's conference call, the company may discuss non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC Regulation G. The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to each non-GAAP financial measure discussed and the reconciliation of the differences between each non-GAAP financial measure and the comparable GAAP financial measure can be found on the company's website at www.slgreen.com, by selecting the press release regarding the company's third quarter earnings.","Before turning the call over to Marc Holliday, Chief Executive Officer of SL Green Realty Corp., I ask that those of you participating in the Q&A portion of the call, please limit your questions to 2 per person. Thank you. Please go ahead, Marc.","Marc Holliday","Okay, good afternoon, and thank you, everyone, for calling in today. After releasing earnings last night, I retired for the evening, with our performance -- with myself being fairly pleased with our performance and that we had good results for the quarter highlighted by substantial leasing, demonstrated gains and harvesting, certain debt and equity investments, new investments in an array of value-add opportunities, additional originations and structured financial portfolio and continuing affirmative steps taken to strengthen the balance sheet.","I woke up only to read a number of analyst reports stating that they perceived we had a different kind of quarter and we would certainly like to use the next hour or so to review our results and discuss the many achievements of the quarter, which I believe are indicative of a market in which we are still able to take advantage of opportunities and create significant value through the investment and repositioning and leasing of real property and also through continued gains in our core same-store portfolio.","First I would like to specifically address the leasing results for our Manhattan portfolio in the third quarter and then convey some additional thoughts on the broader marketplace. Based on our internal budgeted projections and by historical standards, the 471,000 square feet of leases signed in the third quarter is, in our opinion, a very robust amount of leasing given that the quarter encompasses July and August, which are typically our slowest leasing months of the year. That's nearly 2 million square feet of leasing on an annualized basis, versus our original projections for the year of 1.5 million square feet of leasing. And further, such activity was dominated by new leasing filling existing vacancy.","These leases were signed at starting cash rents, which were higher than previously occupied expiring rents and does not reflect the effect of the contractual base rent increases that we will be entitled to throughout the terms of the leases. This leasing volume was higher than I anticipated for the third quarter and I've been very pleased with the level of activity in our portfolio since Labor Day. Any notion that the third quarter leasing results underperformed our expectations would be inaccurate. Evidence of this success is our same-store NOI increase for the quarter of approximately 5%, which is consistent with the increases experienced in the first 2 quarters and puts us on the high end of the same-store increases in the office sector.","As important, and in my opinion, as impressive as these statistics are, especially in light of the neutral leasing market, I would continue to point you to our pipeline leasing statistics as a very good indicator of where the portfolio is heading over the next 3 to 6 months. In the 25 days since the end of the third quarter, we've signed over 123,000 square feet of leases in 18 different transactions and we have another 53 leases in advanced negotiation covering some 435,000 square feet, much of this we will obviously hope to conclude in the fourth quarter.","Most tellingly, there is another 745,000 square feet of term sheets in negotiation that we believe have a high probability of being converted to lease, much of which would occur in the first few quarters of 2013. In total, we have 1.2 million square feet of pipeline in the third quarter, which is actually greater than the 1.16 million square feet of pipeline we had at the end of the second quarter. You can see why I think our leasing results are reflective or slightly better than the general market conditions in New York where increasing office-using jobs are absorbing the supply on the market from several of the newly constructed buildings.","A number of job statistics bode very well for New York City in 2013 and over the long term. Specifically, there are 73,000 more jobs today than there were at the prior peak in this market in 2007, of which approximately 43,000 such jobs are office-using jobs. While new job growth in New York has been steady through much of 2011 and 2012, we do see a slight deceleration in new office-using jobs, which rang in at only 6,000 in the plus column for the fourth quarter. However, while decelerating, the fact that New York has added 43,000 office-using jobs this year bucks the conventional notion that New York is losing jobs. This is simply not the case. Rather, I believe, what you're seeing is job growth, which is essentially keeping pace with new inventory, which has kept a lid on rents.","Job growth has also been mitigated or absorbed by the efficiencies that many of today's tenants are looking for when rebuilding their spaces. So between new construction and forced efficiencies, I think that's why you've seen a fairly steady vacancy rate in the 9.5% range. However, the good news is that, at this current moment, there's about 1.1 million square feet of leases pending at 11x, 250 West 55th Street and the Coach building, such that much of this inventory will be reduced, if and when those transactions are finalized. Thus allowing for 2013 job growth to directly impact the existing commercial inventory.","The vacancy in Manhattan, as I mentioned earlier, is about 9.6%, which is relative equilibrium, that's less than 2 percentage points of sublet space and the balance being directly offered. And we remain optimistic about the prospects for our portfolio over the next 6 months given our substantial leasing pipeline, given the job growth in New York City and given the reducing supply of new construction that was put in place over the last few years.","We will be well positioned, I believe, in the balance of this year and next year, to take advantage of these market dynamics as we have a very modest amount of lease expirations scheduled to expire to the balance of this year, about 290,000 square feet and throughout 2013 only less than 1.1 million square feet set to expire. These amounts having been substantially reduced and chipped away at all year through our aggressive early leasing program to reduce these amounts to very, very small amounts relative to our overall portfolio.","With the core portfolio stabilized and delivering modest but market-leading same-store NOI growth, the focus has been on leasing up the more recently acquired assets where we have been having enormous success and are tracking well ahead of original underwriting in terms of timing and economics. Notably this morning, we announced the signing of several additional lease transactions: 131,000 square-foot lease to The City of New York at 100 Church Street, bringing that building up to 97% occupancy, a long, long way from the 40% occupancy when we acquired the building just a couple of years ago; And additional leasing at 125 Park Avenue where we are backfilling the planned vacancy we acquired and now how that building's occupancy in excess of 80%. We will continue to focus 3 Columbus, where we also announced a substantial upsizing in the Young & Rubicam lease, bringing that building's office occupancy to an excess of 73%.","So at this point, I'm going to turn the call over to Andrew, who will now discuss the capital and property market dynamics we see in this current environment and the activities we've undertaken and we've executed to take advantage of these substantial opportunities that present themselves to us.","That will be followed by Jim, who will give a strategic overview and framework for our balance sheet activities, and then Matt will drill into some of the specific highlights of the third quarter results. Thank you.","Andrew W. Mathias","Thanks, Marc, good afternoon, everybody. The third quarter continued 2012's furious pace of activity, both in the Manhattan market and within SL Green's portfolio. This activity has accelerated of late given market tightening in the debt markets, which I'll get into further. Midtown saw many transactions go to contract at aggressive pricing metrics, demonstrating strong, continued investor demand from Manhattan real estate. 450 Lexington, 350 Madison, 285 Madison, 575 Lexington, 1411 Broadway and 386 Park Avenue South, were just some of the properties changing hands outside of SL Green's universe, with Worldwide Plaza and 75 Rockefeller Center reportedly closing in on contracts in the very short term as well.","And the pipeline for year end is robust, with 11 Madison, the Sony building and several other high-profile assets, we expect to come to market this fall and winter. This transaction activity was helped by significant tightening in the CMBS market, which really started in July and continues to this week, where we expect several additional transactions, bellwether-type transactions to price. This tightening has caused other providers of debt capital, like insurance companies and commercial banks to tighten their rates as well, as they have to compete with lower CMBS costs. 3-handle rates seem to be the new norm in the market in tenure reasonably levered fixed rate deals, down 100 basis points or even more from rates just earlier this year.","The other notable trend to watch in the debt markets is the return of the single asset securitization market, another very positive development for Manhattan assets. We expect to see several very large Manhattan assets avail themselves of this market as it re-gels and redevelops and the initial indications are that spreads in single asset securitizations will be competitive to pretty much on top of spreads and pool deals, which bodes very well for both Manhattan assets and Manhattan values.","Within our portfolio, we announced the off-market purchase of 635, 641 Sixth Avenue. This exciting redevelopment project has Steve Durels brushing up on his tech talk and also talking big rents with almost 100,000 square feet of vacant office space in the tightest submarket in the country available for 2014 delivery. Plus, 200 square feet of prime retail frontage on Sixth Avenue, a meaningful amount of that retail, is vacant and available to these.","Once again, our acquisition and legal team showed their ability to creatively structure a deal to meet all of the seller's objectives swiftly and discreetly as of this off-market deal did not reach the press, until we put it in the press. Kudos to the teams and particularly our Co-CIO, Isaac Zion, on this one.","Today, we also announced our contract to sell a 49% joint venture interest in 521 Fifth Avenue to new partners for our portfolio, the international investors at Jones Lang LaSalle and Quantum. These partners share our vision for this property and the extraordinary long-term value we believe we can continue -- we believe we can continue creating here. The transaction was struck at a gross property value of $315 million or about $650 a foot, which is about a 4.5% cap rate on in place NOI.","Elsewhere in the portfolio, we acquired a second site downtown at 33 Beekman near Pace University, where we will construct a second world-class facility for Pace on a 30-year commitment from them. This comes as we're on track to TCO our project in 180 Broadway in short order, on-time and on budget, a real coup by our construction team. That project went so well and Pace was so pleased with the project -- the progress that we made there and the finished product, they were willing to commit to another building, which we'd expect to bring online in late 2015 for them.","We've also stayed active on the structure finance front, funding a major refinancing of an asset on the far west side of Manhattan and directly originating several other acquisition loans. The pipeline for a structure finance book looks very robust going into the fourth quarter, as our market leadership in that business continues and the transaction volume that I discussed earlier continues to build. Thus far, we don't see much of a drop in our returns for that business even with the senior debt tightening I described earlier.","And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Jim Mead to go through the balance sheet.","James E. Mead","Thank you, Andrew. Good afternoon, everyone. We've also had a very strong quarter with regard to our balance sheet. Starting with liquidity. We ended the quarter with $200 million outstanding on our $1.5 billion line of credit. And $115 million in unrestricted cash on hand, providing well in excess of our targeted $1 billion in liquidity. The line of credit balance increased from $80 million last quarter, primarily because we purchased 635, 641 Sixth Avenue unencumbered by debt. This is consistent with our broader rating strategy to increase the company's number of unencumbered assets. This purchases adds 2 assets to that unencumbered base. You will recall that we purchased 304 Park Avenue South unencumbered and we have plans to unencumber additional assets as we move into year end.","To give some sense of the proportion of our liquidity today, our available liquidity covers all of our debt maturities for the next 2 years by 1.3x. Turning to a couple of credit metrics. Our debt-to-EBITDA at the end of the quarter was below 8x and our fixed charge coverage was 1.9x, both strong metrics. And as I've mentioned in prior calls, we expect improvements in our NOI and our corresponding credit metrics as our recent property investments lease-up and mature. I think it's notable then in the last few months, much of the leasing that we accomplished is highly strategic in nature and that it relates to achieving this additional NOI growth, which we said in the past will grow to almost $100 million annually in the next few years.","Yesterday and today, we announced, for example, the completion of the lease up at 100 Church, which is now at 97%. The additional leasing at 3 Columbus -- that takes us -- takes the office occupancy into the mid-70s and the leasing at 125 Park, which is now into the mid-80s percent lease up. And we refinanced expensive preferred stock this quarter with a new issuance, taking advantage of the current window of low interest rates. We raised about $230 million in 6.5% perpetual preferred stock and redeemed $200 million in total of 7 7\/8% and 7 5\/8% preferred. These activities will have a small but beneficial impact to our future earnings and fixed charge coverage.","The bank markets are also very liquid today, so we're looking at the current environment as an opportunity to potentially recast and improve our line of credit once again. More to come on this in the upcoming weeks. One final comment. You saw in the earnings release we closed on a $175 million loan with JPMorgan to finance debt positions. The nature of our lending business has evolved with the market cycle, and we're finding that best way to increase the probability of our involvement in a deal and the way that best maximizes our retained yield is to commit to the entire debt stack and once we control the debt to subsequently syndicate, an A note either in whole or in pieces.","A great example of what I'm describing was a loan we made to finance the old New York Times building. We committed to an entire $166 million loan to Blackstone and subsequently brought in a conventional bank lender to take a $116 million senior piece. This enabled us to get an almost 12% return on the $50 million piece that we retained. We didn't have this new loan facility in place at the time but if we had, it would've provided nonrecourse liquidity to bridge the A note portion without burdening the broader balance sheet of the company.","It's also important to note that this type of loan has not been common since the last downturn and the willingness of JPMorgan to provide this debt is a strong testament to the high quality of our existing loan portfolio and of the loans that we are originating today.","Now I'll turn the call over to Matt to review the numbers in the quarter.","Matt DiLiberto","Thanks, Jim. As I try to do every quarter, rather than just giving a simple rundown of all of our operating results, I'd like to focus on a handful of items that give rise to variances against prior periods or may require some additional explanation. Focusing first on our property operations, as Marc highlighted, combined same-store cash NOI growth was very strong at 4.7% for the third quarter and 5.4% for the full 9 months, trending well ahead of the expectations we set out at the beginning of the year of 3% to 4% and some of the best growth of the industry. Our occupancy remained strong, leasing is being executed at a healthy pace and new rents are consistent with what we projected. Those searching for any negatives in our cash NOI growth this quarter, particularly on a sequential quarter basis, may look to the reported increase in operating expenses. However I would hesitate to call this increase unexpected because it was consistent with both our internal projections and historical trends.","In the first 6 months of the year, we enjoyed a significant savings and operating expenses due primarily to the temperate winter and spring we had here in New York City. It would be nice to carry that through the whole year, but the summer months did not follow suit. As such, utility expenses were higher by $6.8 million over the prior quarter in the same-store portfolio, primarily in electric and steam costs.","Keep in mind that an expense increase from second to third quarter is very common as a result of seasonality. Yes, a significant portion of increased expenses can be passed through to our tenants. We have put in place very attractive utility contracts to mitigate our costs, but that doesn't totally insulate us from expense fluctuations.","One other item to note when comparing our third quarter same-store operating results to the prior quarter, is a percentage rent payment that we received in the second quarter from the Minskoff Theater at 1515 Broadway. This year that payment totaled about $2.5 million and was included in our second quarter rental revenues. This payment is always received in the second quarter of each year and is not replicated or accrued in any other quarter.","Turning from same-store results to the consolidated income statement. The increase in rental revenues and operating expenses likely appears more pronounced on a sequential quarter basis than most were expecting. This is due in large part to the consolidation of our interest in the West Coast office portfolio, that some people still refer to it as the Ardner-Cobby [ph]  portfolio, for the months of August and September. During which time we owned approximately 2\/3 of the equity in the venture and controlled its activities.","Consolidating this portfolio for 2 months increased our consolidated rental revenues by around $14 million and consolidated operating expenses, including real estate taxes, by around $9 million. With the consummation of the Blackstone transaction, we are no longer the majority owner and Blackstone operates the portfolio on behalf of the venture so our remaining 28% interest in that portfolio will be accounted for as an off balance sheet JV on a go-forward basis.","Investment income was free from any unusual items this quarter and reflects a reasonable run rate going forward on the debt and preferred equity portfolio before any additional investment activity. More notably though, the $1.1 billion portfolio, which is yielding an average of 9.6% is now comprised entirely of investments collateralized by New York City real estate and none of them are on non-accrual status. Recall that last quarter we recognized $4.7 million related to the accelerated recognition of unamortized discount on our mortgage investment in London, when as moved from the debt portfolio to real estate held-for-sale. As an update, we remain optimistic that the sale of that asset by the receiver will close before the end of the year, ultimately resulting in an IRR north of 20% on our investment.","In other income, we recognized lease termination fees of approximately $2.1 million in the quarter, about $1.1 million higher than the second quarter, but $600,000 less than what we achieved in the third quarter of last year, when termination income included our share of an $8.7 million termination payment at our property in Jericho, Long Island. Also included in other income for the third quarter of 2012 was an acquisition fee of approximately $1.3 million related to the Pace development site at 33 Beekman and real estate tax refunds of just over $1 million, representing our share of refunds related to legacy Reckson properties in the Suburban portfolio.","Income from our unconsolidated JV portfolio in the quarter was positively affected by our share of the discounted payoff of the mortgage at the Meadows of approximately $10.7 million. However, the effect of this gain on the bottom line was largely offset by a significant one-time expense item. This expense totaling over $10 million and appearing further down the income statement relates to the write-off of initial issuance costs and discounts pursuant to the redemption of all $100 million of our 7 7\/8% Series D preferred shares and another $100 million of our 7 5\/8% Series C preferred shares in August.","Because of the timing of this redemption, our preferred stock dividends were also $500,000 higher in the third quarter than what they will be on a recurring basis. Interest expense was up sequentially, due primarily to the full quarter effect of the $230 million mortgage financing at 100 Church Street, which contributed $2.3 million of additional interest expense in the quarter. In addition, consolidated interest expense was impacted by the on-balance sheet treatment of the West Coast office portfolio for August and September, which added around $5 million to our reported interest expense. These increases are partially offset by the continued sparing use of our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility.","Looking ahead to the remainder of the year, with only a couple of months remaining, and after giving consideration to the effect of the transactions we announced this morning, we feel very comfortable leaving our previously provided guidance levels unchanged and I look forward to speaking to all of you about our expectations for 2013 in December at our Investor Conference.","With that I'll turn the call back over to Marc.","Marc Holliday","Yes, well, before we take questions, Heidi is going to give a little bit of information as to some of our shareholder activities upcoming over the next 5 or 6 weeks.","Heidi Gillette","Hello, again. As noted in the earnings report last evening, SL Green will be hosting its Annual Institutional Investor Conference on Monday, December 3 in New York City. Details of the event will be available next week. If you wish to preregister, or to verify that you are on the invite list, please email slg2012@slgreen.com. Of note, we will be hosting a property tour before the luncheon and presentation this year, likely starting the tour around 10 a.m. so for those of you arriving from out of town Monday morning, please plan accordingly.","Additionally, given the timing of the NAREIT Conference this year and its close proximity to our Investor Conference, Jim Mead, Matt DiLiberto and Steven Durels will be representing the company at NAREIT, while the rest of the executive team will remain in New York City, focused on the Investor Conference.","With that, I will turn it over to the operator for Q&A. Operator, please go ahead.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question is from the line of David Toti with Cantor Fitzgerald.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","A couple of quick questions, and it's been a while since I think I've talked to you about the Suburban portfolio. There's definitely some leasing spread improvement in the quarter. But can you maybe talk a little bit about your long-term strategy for those assets? It's a radically different kind of performance stat from your core Midtown portfolio and I'm just wondering how you're thinking about that group of assets today.","Marc Holliday","Well, I think, we haven't talk about it directly with each other, but we've certainly been asked a question about what our intentions are for this portfolio of assets and I think the -- we've been fairly consistent in saying that it's a portfolio that we manage at the moment for stability and very aggressive leasing that we try to execute there this quarter. We signed 160,000 square feet of leases, 31 deals, the markdown to mark was only 1.5. So about as close to flat as we've been in some time, which I think means we're getting very close to having right-sized this portfolio in terms of a rental status and our occupancy is in excess of 81%, which bodes very well to the Westchester market, which is 23% vacant and the Connecticut market, which is mostly Class A in Stamford, which is also about 23%, 24% vacancy. So we've got markets that are very challenging Suburban markets. Within those markets are our team is doing a wonderful job keeping the buildings relatively very well-leased and keeping that income flow in place. It's a largely unencumbered portfolio so we have no financial risk, per se on -- no direct secured financial risk on that portfolio and the portfolio has been very stable. There is a point at which -- I mean it's hard for us to predict when we expect those markets will get healthier and I think the leading indicator of that health is going to be when the housing markets in a lot of those Upper Westchester and Fairfield Connecticut markets start to get more robust, more active. And when that happens, there's a lot of ancillary business activity that we think will start to benefit these markets and when that happens, I think you'll see the debt markets return, when the debt markets return, you'll see liquidity return. So at this point, what we've said generally, and the reason why we're over 90% invested in Manhattan, 90% of our assets, 90% of our revenues, 90% of our resources -- it's probably over 92%, maybe, is focused in Manhattan, specifically is because of liquidity, it\u2019s all about liquidity. Liquidity drives new businesses. It drives refinancing opportunities, sales, JVs, et cetera. There's not a lot of liquidity right now in these markets and without liquidity, we're in a very active and aggressive asset management phase and we have a best of class team up in Westchester based in White Plains executing upon them.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","That's helpful. And then if I can just position one follow-up question. Relative to some of the big transactions that you mentioned earlier in the call, it was our understanding that some of those were going to be delayed into next year. It sounds like, and obviously you're much closer to these, it sounds like some of them will happen before the end of the year. Do you suspect that there's any kind of change in pricing around those assets relative to conditions in the market today given delays in decision-making? Any change in the mix of sort of asset value versus forward rent underwriting? Any kind of additional color you can provide relative to those transactions? And I know some of them are a little bit hairy by relative standards.","Andrew W. Mathias","Yes. The challenge is every building has its own set of below market leases, above market leases, vacant space or fully occupied. So it's very hard. Sellers have expectations going into these processes and for the most part, what we've seen is patient sellers in New York. So people are not afraid not to transact if they don't get their prices. And the market is giving them prices that are compelling enough for them to trade at. So in the case of 285 Madison, an asset which YNR is vacating to move into 3 Columbus and we had some preferential rights to buy that building, we gave them sort of our valuation of the building and they said, \"Thanks, but no thanks. We're going to test the market.\" And we're able to achieve, significantly -- significantly higher price than we had valued that particular building at by going into the market with getting almost $575 a square foot for a vacant older, office building in Midtown. So it's really -- there's strength in the market, there's strength in a lot of these deals. And we saw a lot of assets that go to contract that I listed out in the third quarter and we do expect some of the big ones I mentioned to be in contract by year end.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your next question is from the line of Josh Attie with Citi.","Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Can you talk about the composition of the leasing pipeline? How much of it is new versus renewal? And how much is there in the way of growth or expansion from tenants versus taking share from other buildings?","Steven M. Durels","Well, I don't know if I ever broken down that granular as far as specific numbers, but I'll tell you that generally speaking on the pipeline, we've got several large transactions that have significant -- or driven by significant growth. We're seeing, I would say, probably in that 700,000 square feet there's probably 1\/3 of it is renewal and then there's a big chunk of it, which is filling vacancy.","Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And if I could just follow up one. One of the leases in the quarter, it looks like there was a very large roll down at 100 Park Avenue. Can you just talk about what that was and why the roll down was so large?","Steven M. Durels","The Rothchild deal, which was 2,700 square feet.","Unknown Executive","How large are you showing on your sheets?","Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I saw 23,000 square feet going to $54 from $85. And it seemed to be a big driver of the roll down on what commenced.","Marc Holliday","Just hold on one second.","Unknown Executive","That's a -- just to clarify, you're coming off the leasing schedule with the total leasing at 100 Park of 23,000 feet, not all of that is mark-to-market. So to Steve's point, the mark-to-market component of the leasing at 100 Park was around 2,700 square feet.","Unknown Executive","So otherwise said the other 21,000 feet was replacing vacancy, which is not mark-to-market. So the only mark-to-market negative, if you will, which was, I guess, substantial, I'm trying to see -- it was a substantial roll down was this -- Rothchild, no it was a new and it was replacing the old for 2,700 square feet. So you have like an optic, it is a significant roll down, but it's on inconsequential amount of space is actually absorption over a space that had been static or vacant.","Steven M. Durels","Which underlies on a larger point, if you look at the mark-to-market particularly on commenced, that is only 100,000 square feet. So it's very difficult to extrapolate that out to the entire portfolio.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Just on the Cabby [ph]  portfolio, what are your long term thoughts there? You guys are back in the black, no pun intended. So are you guys planning to hold this for several years? Or is your thought that we may see an exit sometime in the near term?","Marc Holliday","Well, I think what our thoughts are, we were happy to recapitalize that transaction. That's probably still our thought today because that was a 5-year investment that saw the very, very highs, the very lows then the very uncertainty of how everything was going to resolve itself and then a little bit of a victory dance, if you will, at the end because we were able to pull so many different pieces together: subordinate equity, priming mezzanine debt, mortgage extension, new venture capital, et cetera, et cetera. So I think at this point, the portfolio itself is on very stable footing. It's stable because the debt, the mortgage debt, to which I refer, has been extended for upwards of 3 years. And with our new partner, Blackstone, they have brought to the table some capital for deleveraging, such that the only mortgage indebtedness on the property right now is about $700 -- actually it's about $675 million and then total with mezzanine indebtedness is below $750 million, about $746 million. So it's got -- the debt was right-sized, there are reserves established for leasing that are substantial and should be able to take the properties from what was an under-managed situation of around 76%, 77% and not under managed necessarily as a statement about competency but more as a statement about an improper capitalization. Now we think that occupancies can be taken up to well into the 80s, possibly 90% or 92% or so with the reserves that have been put in place. So I think our business plan, if you will, is to allow Blackstone and their EOP subsidiary or manager, if you will, to execute a very aggressive leasing program since we have such low basis in the deal. I think the last dollar of debt tops out at around $167 a foot. So -- and the rest behind that is equity. So that certainly means that we can be aggressive on leasing and we should be able to hit, I would think, our leasing velocity and economic -- our leasing velocity and economic targets. There is going to be a real focus on paring down some of the assets early to amortized the debt even further, but it's way too early for me to give you an estimate on how much or when. But there will be a focus on paring that portfolio down through sales, because the market -- in many of these submarkets has picked up considerably and now we have the flexibility with the restructured debt to start selling assets. So you will see asset sales, I would say, almost certainly in the first year of the venture. And then the rest is to -- the rest of the plan will be to optimize assets and then decide on the best strategy once it's stabilized. It could be exit, sale, recap, JV, partner. Who knows? I mean, it's just too early. But it's that -- it's a transitional portfolio that we're looking to optimize and stabilize and then looking to monetize, if you will.","David Schonbraun","Blackstone is very enthusiastic about this -- at this basis. And obviously, their return requirements are significant as an opportunity fund and they feel highly confident in their ability to achieve those returns with this investment. So we're pretty content to ride along with them for the time being, I would say.","Marc Holliday","Sitting here with David Schonbraun who is sort of the architect of this transaction is running me through the myriad of numbers associated with this deal and he's fairly optimistic that we're going to be able to recapture our investment basis in this deal and hopefully significant profits above.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And just the second question is, why do you think mezz and structured finance deals have held the way they have? If you think about senior yields have come down a lot, even core funds and opportunity funds, their return thresholds have come down. Why do you think -- I mean it's great for you guys and other people who are in the mezz business, but given all the competition, why do you think mezz and the structured finance yields have been able to hang in there?","James E. Mead","I don't think there's as much competition in the mezz arena as there is in the senior debt arena and we have seen enormous new competition in the senior debt arena, which has contributed to the spread tightening from different pockets of guys that I went through CMBS, commercial banks, insurance companies. You don't have that broad variety playing in subordinate debt, and you still have banks and other institutions coming up against risk-weighted capital ratings for subordinate paper, which are crushing and which make it impossible for them to hold this type of paper. So we've not seen as much competition. There's been spread tightening in certain deals that we've seen. But we're still finding more than our fair share at the type of conservative underwriting that we've been originating over the last 18 months or so.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Jamie Feldman with Bank of America.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","There's been a lot of talk this earnings season about new and efficient buildings and efficient floor plates, and I think, Marc, in your opening comments, you've mentioned that as well. Can you talk a little bit about your appetite from the redevelopment side for some of the older buildings in town? And then also from a leasing perspective, I mean, some of your older buildings, what's the appetite from tenants for those or how are you positioning those?","Marc Holliday","Well, I'm not, when you say older buildings, I mean, any building that's not being tapped out is an older building, it's 400 million square feet of existing inventory in Manhattan, most of which dates back to 25 years ago or older. So I just can't -- I mean, it's 400 million feet of space. The characterization of the demand for these buildings that, I guess, not sure what the question is exactly, but were constructed anywhere from most recently, the mid- to late-80s when there was lot of buildings completed to the 70s, wherein a lot of inventory is 50s, 60s, and then there's a small subset of the portfolio which is pre-war. Those buildings are being met a very high demand as evidenced by our leasing velocity and occupancy rates and I think success in driving same-store NOI. It's the value part of the market. I would say that the market, for the most part today, is driven by small to mid-sized tenants looking for affordable rents, and that's why we've done 3.4 million square feet of leasing. This year, we've been delivering to the part of the market. The newer buildings, let's not miss the main message. They're leasing now where they weren't for the past couple of years for one reason only. The owners of those buildings, traditionally, are dropping their rents substantially in order to meet demand because they were unable, in 2010 and 2011, to fill up those buildings. In some cases, 2007, '08, '09, but let's say, 2007 to 2011, they were unable to fill those buildings at the originally pro forma-ed rents or anything near that because I think, what we've always said, it's about location. It's not so much about the vintage of the building, people want to pay to be near the primary modes of public transportation, near the infill locations, which have -- which attract employees today with diversity of services and restaurants and nightlife, as well as convenience, and that's where our portfolio sits and that's why it leases well and we've been able to increase our rents over the past few years while the preponderance of newer buildings have generally been in the newer pioneering or fringe locations where there was a hope or an objective of getting rents to fill those buildings in the -- you pick the number, 80s, 90s, 100s, low 100s and that just didn't transpire. So I think what you've seen this year is a realization that to compete against, I think what you're calling older buildings, what I would call well-located buildings in the infill locations, that the rents had to drop precipitously in those buildings and now, at a level where they're starting to get traction, which is good. It's good for the city, good for those businesses, good for the real estate market to clear some of the idle inventory. And I think there's been about 400,000 or 500,000 square feet signed this year with another 1.1 million square feet pending. So I think my point I was trying to make earlier is eventually, those buildings will fill up and when they do fill up, or at least get closer to full occupancy, then the job growth that the city is experiencing will be imposed almost directly on the existing inventory instead of now sort of arbitraged in the opportunities between existing inventory and new construction.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. But I guess you had also mentioned, like the Coach Building, I assume you're talking about Coach new development.","Marc Holliday","I'm talking, about new construction. It is a whole -- I mean, I can through the list, but I would say it's -- there's many more buildings being built than Coach right now. I don't know if -- we can go -- we'll go through the...","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","No, no. I guess what I was asking is, or thinking about asking is that, if you're thinking the Coach Building gets underway, does that open up a whole new part of the city?","Marc Holliday","I'm talking about new construction in the non-infill areas of Midtown. There's probably 7 or 8 buildings that fit within that profile of buildings. Coach is...","James E. Mead","We're talking about the new Coach building, which is on Terra Firma, it doesn't require the platform to be built. So we don't consider it opening up of a new area in Manhattan because it's -- it doesn't necessitate the platform the rest of that development does.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And along the same line, just where do you guys stay now in terms of concessions and tenant demands for buildout?","Steven M. Durels","I don't think it's changed in the third quarter versus where we -- what we experienced in the first half of the year. If you're smaller tenants, meaning, under 10,000 square feet, then we've been doing a lot of pre-build spaces or build-to-suit type of leasing. And if you're a bigger tenant, then generally, it's $65, $70 a foot where the space is raw on a long-term lease and the space requires full buildout. And then there's sort of everything in between. There's a lot of deals that we do, a lot of leasing that gets done where it's a contribution to retrofit space. But I certainly haven't felt that, nor have we experienced concessions increasing over the past quarter. And I don't see that trend changing -- I don't see a change in the trend.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Rob Stevenson with Macquarie.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","You expanded the structured finance portfolio this quarter by about $100 million or so, seems like you guys continue to find good opportunities there but very little debt maturities until 2013. Does the book continue to expand towards $1.5 billion as you find opportunities? You looked to sell down some of these existing positions to keep it at the $1 billion level, plus or minus, how should we be thinking about that over the next 12 to 18 months?","James E. Mead","Well, we've traditionally had a sales-imposed 10% cap -- 10% of total market capitalization, which if put to $1.5 billion is sort of a level in which we're comfortable at and it's really going to be opportunity-driven depending on what we see out there and what yields are available as to whether we're going to take the existing balance up to that $1.5 billion level or not. But we definitely wouldn't see it going beyond that.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then a question for Steve. Can you give us a sort of update on recent activity, et cetera and thoughts on 180 Maiden, Harper Collins, 280 Park?","Steven M. Durels","Sure. Let's start with 280 Park. We are in the early stages of the construction. We spent most of the year doing design developments, but if you've been by the building, you've some of the sheds and protection going up. We've got a marketing for it that's getting tuned up right now. We're exchanging lease proposals for a couple of hundred thousand square feet with tenants, which is encouraging. I don't think we expected to see the level of activity that we have given that it's expensive space and given that we're nowhere near to being unveiling any finished product yet. So we're still feel very bullish about the project. And I can tell you given these design concepts that we're building up, I think it's going to be a spectacular project.","180 Maiden Lane, we're in the early stages of design and development. Everybody is anxious for it to see some renderings as to what we're going to ultimately do with the building. We don't get the space back from AIG until the middle of '14. But even there, where we have not commenced a marketing program, I would say we've had a lot of guys coming through, kicking the tires. And my biggest problem has been not having the space earlier rather than later. We've got proposals out for -- and I think there's sort of a less than 50-50 chance that we'll land any of the guys we we're talking to right now, but we've got several hundred thousand square feet of paper being traded with people. And I think the strategy there is to capitalize on the building's amenities that we're inheriting, meaning that there's a conference center, there's an auditorium, there's a cafeteria, there's a Goldman Sachs former infrastructure that was invested into the building. And the fact that we're going to be the lower price point alternative for glass and steel construction. And I think that's why we've seen people migrating towards us early in the fight.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","And Harper Collins?","Steven M. Durels","Harper is -- they're out looking at the markets, they've made no decisions. They've looked downtown, Midtown, we've talked to them about staying. I think they're a complete unknown at this point in time.  But just to remind you, I guess, is that like 180 Maiden, we bought the building with the expectation that Harper would not stay so that if we're able to retain them, it would be big, big positive news for us. But we're expecting they'll leave. We're in design development there. We got that space below '14, and I think it's still early in the game.","James E. Mead","Yes, 10 East is one of those buildings that we've programmed for a substantial redevelopment, as Steve said, that's in the process of being designed and developed right now. That's a 2013 redevel, and the Harper counties, as I recall, is mid '14. So we're going to be delivering that space in '14, '15 at a much, much higher price point. And therefore, we when we do go into situations like that, we underwrite very high level of attrition if the rent goes up by a substantial margin in response to the redevel. So we'll see what happens.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Brendan Maiorana with Wells Fargo.","Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I was wondering if you guys could give an update on the plan for 100 Church, given that you've got the lease that was out announced today and that asset's fully stabilized or is that at long-term hold or is that something you guys have looked to monetize?","James E. Mead","We put 10-year fixed rate down on the asset in June. So for now, that's in the long-term stable hold portfolio. We're going to be enjoying more than $26 million of NOI there on our basis, which is going to be probably less than $250 million when we're done.","Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Question for Steve, I appreciate the pipeline. It sounds like it's up a little bit from where it was in Q2. It sounds like activity is good. Has there been any slowdown in terms of the pace of deal closing, so that -- or has that been pretty consistent with where it was earlier in the year?","Steven M. Durels","No. I think just the opposite. If you really look at it carefully though, the beginning of the year for us, we were sort of the opposite where the market was, right? The overall market was pretty slow in the first half of the year. We had record leasing and driven by a number of very, very large transactions in the portfolio. Now, as we came into the third quarter, there's this -- I think there's this perception out there that leasing is generally slow, and I think if you really stop and think about it, it's more slow relative to expectation coming off of a very busy year in 2011. But if you look at more of on a historical basis, sort of on a 10-year average, leasing for this year is only off by about 5%. And in fact, third quarter leasing velocity, market wise, is up over the second quarter. So we've got a good pipeline and had a good second -- third quarter. I think we're going to see good going into fourth quarter and first quarter next year.","Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And so the pace is good and the rent economics. Your view is that there's any of the sort of commentary of sluggishness from brokers or just overall market perception that there may have been a slowdown. Leasing economics for you guys and pace of deal closings is still the same as you expected earlier?","Steven M. Durels","My feeling on brokers is that they are generally very good as sort of the thermometer of the moment. But they kind blow with the wind depending on where things head in the future. So no, I'm feeling like we're holding our own. I think the rents are holding. And to have a bigger conversation, you really start -- need to chop the market apart for various submarkets and various price points.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of John Guinee with Stifel, Nicolaus.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","It's getting late guys, so we'll give you a few easy ones, which means short answers. First, 3 Columbus Circle looks like the tenant, Young & Rubicam, bought that at about $670 a square foot. Does that result in any unusual accounting and\/or is there a gain for SL Green based on that transaction? And then the second is, can you discuss the terms of the ground lease reset and what that does for you, both in the short and long term?","Steven M. Durels","Let's hit the first one.","James E. Mead","I'll take the first one, John. So we did close on the sale of the condo in the quarter. Your base assumption is right or your sale price assumption is right. The usual accounting, and of course, it comes with unusual accounting, is that we don't actually get to record a gain in the current period. We work into the deal an option to reassemble the building at some point in the future based on what happens with the leased premises in the building. The space that [indiscernible] our leases. That means, ultimately, a deferral of the gain until that option is resolved in some way, shape or form.","Steven M. Durels","It's worth noting that, that price point was for the weaker part of the buildings. They bought -- their condo portion is in the bottom of the building, so it didn't reflect the premium space at the top of the house, nor the retail.","Unknown Executive","We negotiated hard for that reassembly option, if you will, John. We didn't want them leaving the leased premises and owning just an orphan condo in the building. We wanted the ability to sort of put Humpty back together.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then how about the 673 First,  what does that do in the near term and long term for you?","James E. Mead","Well, it's a 50-year lease extension. So to me, it's like a wholesale resetting of the asset. And it turns a medium-term leasehold into something that's almost fee or fee like. So I think from that perspective, it's a sizable value accretion. The lease has in it, and will continue to have in it, escalation provisions,  so they'll be -- those rents will increase over time. Matt, I don't know if the next increase is in our numbers you had coming, I mean...","Matt DiLiberto","No, there's no adjustment for it yet. So it just closed at the beginning of the month of October. But there will be an adjustment coming as the term with the bumps will require you to straight line the rents back, which will be about $500,000 a month or $6 million a year of incremental straight-line rent expense.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So you're going to go from $3 million to $9 million a year in ground lease?","Matt DiLiberto","That's about right.","James E. Mead","That's $9 million a year, which is going to stay flat for how many years.","Matt DiLiberto","The straight line, that will be the permanent amount.","Marc Holliday","But the cash amount will obviously be lower.","James E. Mead","The $9 million is some accounting straight line, but the cash number...","Matt DiLiberto","The new ground rent is just under $7 million.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Got you, okay. And then the last question is you guys have essentially about $1.1 billion of structured finance average term of about 2.5 years. When you're doing these relatively short-term structured finance deals, are you able to reserve or have 100% of your income covered out of either current cash flow or the reserves? Or are there essentially interest earned that really isn't guaranteed, if you follow me?","Matt DiLiberto","It depends. I mean, it's really deal by deal. In the case of the deal that Jim Mead talked about, the old New York Times building, there -- that's a redevelopment project. So a lot of the interest was reserved at closing, and it's being paid out of the reserve as they lease up that project, invest capital to redevelop it. Whereas, the other deal I've talked about, the restructuring on the far west side, that covers debt service currently so that their interest is being paid currently. So it really depends on the profile of the asset.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Steve Sakwa with ISI Group.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I guess this question is really for Steve Durels. As you kind of look at the deals that you're doing with tenants currently in the deals that are in the hopper, what are you seeing in terms of space usage per person? And I guess, to speak to Marc's point about job growth, to what extent does that job growth is being somewhat offset by less space per person?","Steven M. Durels","Well, I think that was Marc's point entirely, it that some the job growth is offsetting absorption in the market because there's clearly a sort of a generational trend that's here to stay for a while, which is businesses are working to move to more of an open plan layout with many of them adopting the benching concept of their employees working off the equivalent of the trading desk and densifying their occupancy so that they have less square footage per employee. And I think we're seeing that in a lot of different industries. It's not unique to Financial Services. We're seeing it in the other service businesses like accounting, marketing, engineering. We're seeing it in sales organizations. We've even seeing with the city. This is moving towards much more dense operations. So that's driving some of the decisions that are out there. I think it's healthy, overall, for business. There's no doubt about that, that businesses are being more prudent as to how they use the space and they're piling more bodies into it. It also makes it very difficult in the future if they're going to sublease the space. But I think that trend is going to be around for a while.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","It doesn't -- I guess as you guys think about deals, whether you're selling or buying, I mean, to what extent does that force you to potentially change your underwriting criteria as you think about rent growth? I mean, have you altered maybe how you think about the market improving over the next 2, 3, 4 years?","Marc Holliday","Well, think we did that back in December. We projected this year basically flat to what was it, 3% to 5% or 2% to 4%, and we're right in that stroke. So Steve, this is not a trend that's like snuck up on us. This is, I mean, you got to go back to December and listen -- roll back the tape on what we said about our expectations for rent and market velocity this year. We are somewhere between dead on target where we might even be slightly ahead. So it is something that we do take into account, it's something we have taken into account and we moderate that as market conditions change. Sometimes, we see a lot of embedded growth in the market and we put in more robust rental growth and often times, we don't and that has given rise to what I've stated on other calls where we often are 10%, 15% below a marketed process, a project that goes to market for sale because we don't put in a high level of growth into our models and haven't for some time now. And as a result, the vast majority of the activity you've seen us do over the past 2, 2.5 years has been kind of more off market, OP unit, opportunistic stuff, not fully marketed deals because our rental assumptions have been in line with the market. So I don't personally think rents that are up 2% to 4% a year is a bad market. It's a neutral market. We've been talking about market equilibrium and neutral markets, and that's where we've been in since we hit about 9%, 9.5%. And that's where it will continue to be until it absorbs further. So we haven't given any guidance at this moment for next year in terms of where we see absorption. And our rent projections headed in December, we certainly will share that. But this efficiency is not a new phenomenon. I mean, firms have been doing this for years and years. Some are satisfied, some will be highly dissatisfied and will rebuild their space again and may -- and go back. It's not -- when Steve says it's a trend, some of the financial companies who are under pressure to cut expenses, I think, are doing this. The majority of tenants that we lease to are not on a benching and trading desk platform. It's still conventional space -- conventional square foot per employee. So this is just something that is particularly for some of the larger tenants, they're looking to gain efficiencies of 10% to 20% of by squeezing more bodies into less space. It could work for them in the near term when they're under the gun to cut costs. It may be a harbinger of bad things to come when they have any whiff of growth or dissatisfaction because they're not going to have a lot of flexibility like they have in years past, and that could give rise to a very -- a very strong position for landlords on new rents when -- given that they'll be -- have no growth programmed into that space.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And I know you guys have touched on downtown a little bit and had somebody ask about 180. But just in general, given how much vacancy there is either downtown or coming downtown, I guess Steve, are using the landlords down there getting more aggressive on rents and making proposals for Midtown tenants?","Steven M. Durels","Well, I think there are a number of Midtown tenants that are exploring the downtown market because that's where the cheaper rents are. But that was no different than when we took over 100 Church Street and we saw midtown tenants visit that building as well. So midtown is still a pretty healthy market and I think there -- we are expecting to see, quite frankly, to see some of the Midtown South, Technology New Media tenants who would like to be in that market, come visit the downtown market. I think there's a good shot that we'll see some of that activity at 180 Maiden Lane and elsewhere in the downtown market because the natural place for that industry, which there's very little space available, is Midtown South. And the guys who need a bigger footprint are going to have no choice but to go push a little further.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I'll keep it quick. There's been a few transactions, unstable actions at best [ph]  so 521 is helpful. I think you said 4.5% cap in place NOI, which I think in the South, you have about 85.6% occupancy. What would the cap rate be on a fully leased basis? Like what's the investor expecting the stabilized cap to be?","James E. Mead","I think between 5% and 5.5%.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And just a more administrative quick one for Matt. On 521, that one's been in the non-same-store portfolio since 1Q '11. Any reason that hasn't made into the same-store portfolio? Is it sort of the transactions?","Matt DiLiberto","Yes, I would love to put it in same-store portfolio for all of our reporting. Unfortunately, the rules that govern how we report the same-store pool say you need to own it in the same manner for equivalent periods. And so since we've bought out our partner in the beginning part of 2011, it has not been able to be included in the technical definition of our same-store portfolio. That said, we do, when we present our numbers in our press release, adjust for that situation at 521 and also for 1515. So we do present numbers that reflect them in the same-store pool in our press release, the supplemental has to present it differently because we're governed by different rules in the supplemental.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Michael Knott with Green Street Advisors.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Marc or Andrew, I'm just curious if you still plan to be a seller of assets beyond the stake in 521 as you had previously mentioned. And as part of that, just curious why -- maybe this was incorrect reporting, but we thought we had read that you were marketing, or planning to market Tower 45, which seemed curious just given the high vacancy there. So just curious, your thoughts on that.","Andrew W. Mathias","I think the 521 gives us -- getting that deal done at a value and a structure that we're really pleased with gives us a lot of flexibility to either sell additional assets or take our time. Tower 45, we are talking to several people about that asset and sort of entertaining some interest there that came unsolicited and prompted us to go through -- start a little bit broader process. But we're going to be patient sellers. And I still think, as we said on the last call, we think it's a decent point in the cycle to definitely recycle out of some assets, which we achieved through 521 and Tower 45 is one of many of the buildings that have seen unsolicited interest, sort of on an ongoing basis. And we're sort of always evaluating our various options with respect to most of the portfolio.","Marc Holliday","I would only add, if it's not that, it will be another one. I mean, well, the answer is yes, we'll sell more assets. We always do and we will. Probably, not this year because this was likely it for the year. But I'm sure in the next 3 to 6 months, we'll have hopefully something else that we can harvest and have good news about.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just last question for me would be, is it too early to talk at all about some of the future expirations? I think sometimes the press has written about Credit Suisse, Citigroup may be looking at other options when those leases expire and those are obviously quite large. Is there anything that you would sort of say about that today?","Andrew W. Mathias","Fortunately, we got a lot of term left with each of those tenants and I would say, we're in front of these guys. We have great relationships at the very senior level with all of our top tenants, certainly those 2 guys included. So we're in sort of constantly in dialogue with these guys. And as their needs and thoughts evolve, we're in front of them and we'll be -- stand ready to work with them and hopefully meet all their needs as they change.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Ross Nussbaum with UBS.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I'll try to be brief. In the structured finance portfolio, there's about $600 million, give or take, maturing in 2014. How confident are you that you're going to be able to backfill that volume over the next 2 years such that the income coming off of that portfolio isn't lower if we roll the clock ahead 2 years from today?","James E. Mead","Well, it's tough to exactly predict the future. I mean, I would just note, that we had a bunch of repayments last year, Matt, 6 and 6 1\/5 [ph]  and a couple of other very lumpy repayments and worked hard and we're able to rebuild the book up to where it is today. Right now, we're enjoying the position of dominance in this business in Manhattan and we don't foresee that changing. So we'd hope to be able to replace the investments. But we're always -- we're risk adjusted return investors, and if we don't feel like debt is the right place to play at that point, we think equity is a more interesting place to play, we may take their money and redeploy into equity, or we may redeploy them into more debt over -- as those assets pay off. It just really depends on what the investing environment is like at that time.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Is it fair to say that the improvement that you're noting in the CMBS market over the past 6 months works against you a little bit in deploying additional mezz and junior mortgage capital out the door?","James E. Mead","No, because they still -- the improvement has been solely in price. The rates are just falling through the floor. Their underwriting standards have not gotten more aggressive. And Moody's and S&P are still relatively tough in terms of where they're cutting off investment grade. So the competition among the lenders has really just been on price, not been on proceeds.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then really quick. Any comments on the assemblage you have on Vanderbilt next to Grand Central in terms of more clarity on the timing of the development breaking ground there?","Marc Holliday","I would say more to come later on that. Maybe in December, we'll have some more commentary. But at this moment, no change from what we have previously stated, which is in process.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies & Company.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","The question I had was just a follow-up to Ross' question. Just trying to understand the structured finance portfolio a little bit better and just again, you guys are getting some attractive yields on it, if that involves having to go lower in regards to lower tranches of debt to get the same type of yield, and if that's really changing the credit calculations of that portfolio.","Andrew W. Mathias","I mentioned very earlier, we've been very consistent in terms of our underwriting on this portfolio within the last 24 months and it hasn't changed. Were still finding our sweet spot in the 70% to -- 70% to 72% maximum loan to cost-type investing and acquisition deals.","Operator","Your final question is a follow-up from the line of Josh Attie with Citi.","Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes, as a quick follow-up for Michael Bilerman, just sticking with Andrew, can you just talk about the composition of buyers for New York assets and whether that has changed at all over the last 6 months, particularly as it the rates on new financings have come down and has that driven any sort of other buyers and has it changed the composition at all?","Andrew W. Mathias","It's so hard to generalize, Michael, because it's -- and I go through the list of 450 Lexington was RXR, 350 Madison was RFR, it was a buyer we had not seen been active in the Manhattan market for some time and then all of a sudden, bought 2 assets, bought 350 Madison and 285 Madison. 575 Lex was a joint venture of Normandy and New York Life. New York Life was an insurance company we hadn't seen been active on the equity side. They bought 2 assets this year, 575 Lex and 1372 Broadway. 1411 Broadway was Ivanhoe Cambridge. 386 Park Avenue South was Billy Macklowe. I mean it's all over the board in terms of individual investors, domestic money, foreign money, it's always -- and every year, on Investor Day, I show you the slide with all the money flying in from all the different Porsche  [ph] sectors of the world. We're going to have, maybe, a new sector this year in December to be revealed. But it's very difficult to sort of characterize. There hasn't been a rush of buyers for the latest deals in any one sector that you can sort of generalize.","Operator","And that will conclude the Q&A session today, ladies and gentlemen. I'd like to turn it back to Mr. Marc Holliday for some closing remarks.","Marc Holliday","Okay, thank you for the elongated call for those of you that's still on, and we look forward to seeing everybody in December. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's conference. Thank you very much for joining us, and you may now disconnect. Have a great day, everyone."],"19594":["SL Green Realty Corp.

Thank you.","I will now turn the call over to Marc Holliday. Please go ahead, Marc.","Marc Holliday","Okay. Thank you and appreciate everybody calling in this afternoon to review our fourth quarter and full-year 2015 results. Before we jump into it, I just want to mention that Andrew Mathias is going to be joining in by phone from the orthopedist's office with cell phone in hand because he suffered an injury, but wouldn't let that hold him back from the call. And Steve Durels also calling in remotely, but available for Q&A, as I guess the stress and tension of a active year-end and beginning of January took a toll on him physically as well, but wouldn't keep him from the call either.","So we are all here, and just want to express our enthusiasm about the operating performance that we ended 2015 on a relative high note. As I think most of you had an opportunity to see at the Investor Conference in December, we're feeling very good about the fact that our buildings are extremely well leased and generally well leased with below-market rents that are ticking up 15% to 20%, in some cases, in the recent quarters. We have a modest amount of lease expirations in the coming years, and that is matched with a modest amount of debt maturities, both of which were actively managed over the years to make sure that, leading into markets where things are more uncertain, we have good tenure of lease maturities and good tenure of debt maturities.","We are substantially complete with our redevelopment projects at 280 Park, 10 East 53rd Street, small project over at 16 Court Street. The important aspect there being: a, the buildings are all well positioned now like the rest of our portfolio; and b, all that capital is now behind us. And speaking about capital, the remaining capital to fund for the Viacom and Citi leases are now reduced in the aggregate to under $200 million, which will be spread over the next few years. So that number has also been mitigated to a great extent over time.","First, what I'd like to do is hit some of the questions and topics that have been raised in some of the analyst notes that we've seen in the past 24 hours or so, and then open it up to Q&A.","So, I guess, beginning with Manhattan leasing market, office market in particular, we ended the quarter with 416,000 square feet of leasing at mark-to-market rents that were up around 20%. So obviously, a big end to the year; we're very happy with that. I think that was sort of on or ahead of schedule. We slightly exceeded our 2.2 million square feet of velocity for the full year. But you should recall that we did advertise a pretty significant pipeline of leasing activity during the Investor Conference, and obviously now we continue to capitalize on that pipeline not only through December, but also in January. We've announced some leases as of yesterday, some big deals. And a good way to kick off the new year with Omnicom, Music Choice and Nordstrom's, along with some other leasing in January, that brings the total for the first month of the year to about 310,000 square feet of leasing in January. So clearly, that is us executing on that pipeline and now, obviously, we're very focused on continuing to build that pipeline for future quarters.","As a footnote to the Omnicom deal, because we got the question, it does represent a reduction in space at The News Building, but we are actively working on a lease to absorb the remaining space. So I think we feel pretty good about where we are positioned with that space and that asset at this time. Even after that December-January activity, the pipeline still stands today in excess of 1.1 million square feet with more than half of that amount consisting of leases that are either out for signature or are in advanced stages of negotiation.","So that leaves us this year with about 800,000 square feet left to lease on a portfolio of nearly 30 million square feet. That's obviously a very small and manageable amount for us to be handling this year. Therefore, a lot of our attention, a lot of Steve's attention, his team's attention will be focused on the expirations in 2017, where at the moment expiration stands at about 1.7 million square feet. But I do want to add that the pipeline I mentioned earlier consists of about 650,000 square feet of leases that expire in 2017. So, obviously, one month into year, we're already working hard on mitigating and reducing 2017's exposure. In 2018, we go back to a more normalized or below-normalized expiration amount of 1 million square feet. So I think we feel very good about 2016, 2017, and 2018, where we stand in terms of availabilities, pipeline; our portfolio is 97.1% leased over that extraordinary amount of space, which I think is a real achievement and a real testament to this team to be able to keep these buildings at such a high level of performance.","With all of that said, we look at the current market environment and look at how we think it may affect job creation going forward and how that may in turn translate into demand for space. And I would say that those two, which are highly connected, we expect to see a bit of a rollback in job creation for the first time in the past four or five years in New York City, and I'll get into some stats on that and, in turn, that that will have an impact on leasing velocities, which we do expect will begin to slow sometime in the second half of the year. So I think as far as we are concerned, with the guidance we had given about 45 days or 50 days ago at the Investor Conference, we still feel like all of that was somewhere between priced in or forecasted into our goals and objectives for the year. And we still feel very good about where we stand both for leasing velocity for 2016, about 2 million square feet mark-to-market, which we set a very high bar for ourselves on same-store NOI and leasing velocity.","Looking at the portfolio, where we stand almost a month into the year, we feel good and can affirm those levels for sure. But we do see headwinds that we think are fairly -- should be fairly expected for an economy that has been producing greater than 2% job growth for five consecutive years. That far outpaces the numbers nationally. It also far outpaces historical normatives in New York City. And whereas last year, 2015, there was about 87,000 or 88,000 private sector jobs created in New York City, about 30,000 of which were office-using, we would expect that number to still be significant, but probably be more in the order of 50,000 to 60,000 jobs created this year, and hence, 12,000 to 16,000 office-using jobs created in 2016.","So by historical standards, in excess of 1% job growth is still a very good number. But it does reflect a slowing of this unprecedented rate of growth as, I think, businesses sort of catch their breath over a very four, five-year significant expansionary period. But with these numbers, we do think that absorption will stay positive, and that we'll be able to maintain our rent spreads and our occupancy levels.","Looking at the retail leasing market and what we've been able to accomplish there, we're joined today by Brett Herschenfeld, who will field some comments. Brett, as you'll recall, you saw in the Investor Conference, leads our SLG Retail division and will have more to say. But I think that the retail is generally still very positive aspect and positive part of our strategy for 2016. Although as we had said, and probably for 12 months to 18 months now, we do see signs of slowing sales in certain corridors, in certain of these submarkets, most notably some of the luxury branded retailers, maybe on Fifth and Upper Madison, are experiencing sales that would prevent these rents from continuing to rise. Whether or not there'll be any pullback in rent is yet to see. But our embedded retail rents across the board are about 100% below market. That's a number that you should recall from the Investor Conference, 100% below market. So whether the rents stay the same, go up a bit, or even pull back 5% or 10%, I would say to you that there's still significant, significant upside in the retail portfolio. We're still very bullish about the prospects of meeting our growth objectives, which last year was $30 million in the growth portfolio, this year is about $32 million in the growth portfolio. And then I think for the five years thereafter, we projected something in the order of $45 million or so incremental, mostly out of the growth in retail portfolio.","So that, I would say, is still highly achievable whether the rents are at market or there's a slight pullback in that market. We still have very good demand in retail, as you saw with that 40,000 square foot-plus Nordstrom lease we were able to sign at 3 Columbus. I think that's a great mark. You saw we got the Armani deal done back in end of November, beginning of December at rents for Upper Madison \u2013 Upper East Side, Madison that are very, very reflective of today's market rents.","So, I think is kind of a tale of two areas. Some of the product along Broadway is probably losing a little bit of velocity. But on the side streets, where we focused, on Greene Street and Spring Street and elsewhere, we still see very, very good demand from the smaller retailers for those kind of boutique and unique spaces. And I think we'll have more to say about that this year as we continue to lease up assets like 110 Greene Street and...","Unidentified Company Representative","And 102 Greene Street.","Marc Holliday","And 102 Greene Street. So those are real bright spots. I don't think we really have a retail exposure of any note other than 650 Fifth, which we continue to work on, have been to the finish line a couple of times on that, but haven't yet crossed the finish line. So that's one asset we hold in a joint venture out of the myriad of assets we own in retail, where we'll be working hard this year to get it leased. But the rest of it, I would say, is either put to bed or has significant, significant upside given our low bases in those assets and the low rents in place.","Looking at the investment market, 2015, you'll recall Isaac Zion saying that we had record volumes. I don't have the number in front of me, but I want to say it was in excess of $60 billion of commercial transaction activity through the date of IC, and there was more transactions that rounded out the year in December.","And I know our constituency likes to look at just what's up at the moment, not what happened three or six or nine months ago. And in that regard, I would point you in the direction of four sort of interesting transactions, all of which we believe are either \u2013 well, all under contract, for the most part. I don't think any are closed yet, is 1285 Sixth, which is a deal that Scott Rechler is doing, which is I think a very good down-the-middle deal for Scott. It's a 4.4%, 4.5% going-in yield and stabilized yield, so it's about a 4.5% cap going in. It's under $1,000 a foot, $950 a foot for a Sixth Avenue product, and a large transaction \u2013 showing that large transactions of $1.7 billion or more can still get done and capitalized in this market.","787 Seventh, there again, going-in yield of about 4.5%, 4.6%, which is similar to the yield that we were able to achieve on 11 Madison. But here, we look at 787 as having above-market rents. And we think that there'll be pressure in execution to keep those yields at those levels as opposed to an 11 Madison deal which was contractually there with upside and no downside. The per-foot there was $1,150 a foot for that deal on Seventh, and that's $1.950 billion purchase price.","Then we have two other deals, which may not be quite as well known or appreciated by our shareholders, and these are very recent. 850 Third Avenue is a deal that's being done, at least our \u2013 what our reconnaissance tells us at around $875 a foot, a sub 3.5% going-in yield. There'll be real work there to kind of rework that tenancy in order to get up to a 5% or 5.5% or so stabilized year, but that would be sometime out, probably five years or more out in time. And that's a deal that's about $460 million of price.","And lastly, 405 Park is rumored to be under contract at a purchase price of $240 million, but more importantly at a price per foot of $1,450 per foot stabilized basis, we project it'll be closer to $1,600 per foot. That was about a 3% going-in yield. And I would say, this transaction doesn't just flatter 280 Park, it picks it up and puts it on the pedestal.","So the investment market, as evidenced by those four deals I would say, is still alive and well, although like with the leasing market, I'm going to put a caveat here, we do expect a slowdown in the transaction volume. We certainly do not expect the record levels that we saw last year or anything close to it. In part, that's going to be particularly due to what we think will be some softness in the areas of condos and hotels, where we think that this market will probably take a more strict view of pricing with respect to those assets.","However, just to draw a distinction, we do think that well-leased and well-located commercial assets will still be in demand. I would even use the words 'high demand' because they're still few and far between and there's still a lot of equity looking to invest in this market. They're just going to be very particular now about the kinds of assets they want to be in. And for those high-demand assets, I think cap rates will remain exactly where they were, in that 4% to 4.5% range or, even in some cases, 3.5% to 4% to 4.5% range for the best assets. However, further on these commercial assets, there are the transitional types of assets that require significant redevelopment, reposition, and leasing execution. There, we would expect hurdle IRR \u2013 hurdle rates, not cap rates, but IRRs, to increase maybe 50 basis points, 75 basis points, maybe even depending on location 100 basis points in threshold returns for these sort of transitional assets.","So, clearly, I think that the deals I just rolled you through and our view of the market flatters the 11 Madison deal. Even more so, I said in the Investor Conference, I thought it was one of the best deals this company has ever done because it's a high-quality asset with high-quality tenants. The financing was put away long term at 4%, limited downside, and very significant long-term upside. Not only that, but it allowed us to get out of some of these transitional assets where I think that there'll be more market headwinds this year. So our timing, I think, was excellent both on the buy, I think our sells were well-executed. And all in all, I think, it certainly bears out the strategy that we've laid out for everybody.","Look at acquisitions and dispositions now for 2016. I just want to address this issue. I've seen a lot of reports about net acquirers. We tackled the question in the Investor Conference. I want to hit it on here, I'm sure I'll get it again in Q&A. When we put up numbers for those, those are gross numbers, gross numbers, gross means gross of joint ventures. So, $1 billion of acquisition is $1 billion of product, if not $1 billion of wholly-owned product. As you know, we do wholly-owned and we do joint ventures like Tower 46, a joint venture. 10 East 53rd was a joint venture. Those are two of our more recent office asset buys.","So, when you see $1 billion of acquisition and $700 million of disposition or $750 million of disposition, that does not imply $250 million of equity issued nor debt leverage up. It just doesn't. What it implies is that we believe that during this year, we might see one or two interesting opportunities, to exercise on them, maybe. And if we do, we'll do it in a way where they are either funded entirely by sales or with JV equity, period. There should be no ambiguity about that even though we continue to read about expanding the balance sheet or levering up or issuing equity, none of which we did as part of last year's what we called rubric, nor would it be part of this year's business plan. I don't think we've issued equity since the first quarter of last year. So, that's been a concern. I would sort of take that concern off the table in terms of whether or not we're going to be net acquirers or not. I think it's going to be a neutral position. And whether we do the full $1 billion or not, that'll sort of be dependent on the opportunities we see in the market. It's easy to say, well, when the market gets tight, don't do anything. We don't exactly agree with that. We think that you have to moderate your investment approach.","Recall that the Citibank building, 388-399 Greenwich was a deal we closed on, I believe, in December of 2007, okay, and we made a lot of money on that deal, both in terms of current return and capital gain. So, you have to be choosy, you have to be creative, you have to make sure it's well-capitalized. But I think a blanket statement that no deals get done would be inconsistent and not the right thing to say, nor is anyone implying that this is an expansionary market for SL Green. We're going to be very, very discerning on our purchases as we always are at this point in the market. In 2007, I think we did literally two deals, that one and a small other. 2008, nothing. In 2009 or 2010, again, because you can't just sit on your hands, we did 510 Madison Avenue debt deal, which turned out to be one of our most exceptional DPE assets we ever did. We were first, we were early in that sort of cycle of upswing.","So, I think we're doing the right things on the acquisition side, and I think there's the opportunity to make good deals. But if we don't see them out there, then you won't see the acquisitions cross the tape, and we'll be focusing, I guess, instead on simply dispositions. So, on the dispositions front, there's one in particular to take note of that 388-390 Greenwich, which we talked about at the Investor Conference as being, a, highly likely to occur and, b, part of our capital plan. I did see in one or two reports the word, surprise, surprise exercise, by Citi. There can be no surprise. There can only be, what we say in that Investor Conference about, the high likelihood of Citi exercising in December turned into an actual exercise in January. And the reason why we are fans of that deal, a, it allows us to close out a very profitable investment position we took in the asset, but, two, it'll result in a reduction of indebtedness gearing of one full turn.","So, between the $1.45 billion of debt in the $350 million of net equity pay down or there about net equity proceeds, there'll be about one full turn of debt reduction associated with that resolution of asset. Not a surprise because we put that there as kind of a pro forma investment as to how the gearing gets, not only to where our leverage levels were in 2015 at the beginning, which were already reduced, but gets reduced further.","Second, we have other sources of equity that we would look to capitalize on this year, either for reinvestment or further debt reduction, beyond 388-390. And clearly, Eleven Madison, again, no surprises, I said on the call right after we purchased it that it was one particular asset that we might JV \u2013 re-JV after purchase. If we do that, there is no tax impediment to a joint venture. It's set up as a tick. So, it's relatively easy to joint venture that asset and still maintain the tax protection that we structured in the balance of the investment. And it's the kind of investment that has attraction in good markets and bad. There are other assets we are looking at now that we can sell in this market that will still receive a very good reception from foreign and domestic investors that I think you will see us execute on as part of reaching our goal for the year.","But on one hand, while the market orients you to those kind of assets in terms of dispositions, it'll make us choosier and pickier in other assets where there's more execution, and this may not be the right time to opt and resell those assets, in which case, we'll just continue to hold those for the future or execute upon them ourselves.","Lastly, before I open up for Q&A, I know this is an unusually long introduction, we have One Vanderbilt. There were literally questions about whether there's any update in leasing status from what we did 45 days ago. I don't know what to say to that other than reiterate what I said in December which is, this is an asset that tenants will be taking possession of sometime generally in late 2019 and 2020. Therefore, at the end of 2015, beginning 2016, it's far too early for most of these tenants to make that kind of space commitment. Most of the larger tenants today are looking for space commitments at around 2018, early 2019. And One Vanderbilt is not intended to be designed for the million square foot user. It's more in line for the 50,000 to 400,000 square foot user. Those kind of users make their decisions later in the cycle, generally two to three years in advance of possession dates, such that the meat of the leasing for One Vanderbilt will likely be in 2017 and 2018. So, that's where we are in that.","In terms of funding plan for One Vanderbilt, we laid out a funding plan in December. I was asked whether we changed our funding plan. So, the answer is no, we haven't changed the funding plan. It is still our plan to obtain construction financing in the first half of this year and then joint venture financing in the second half of the year. I would imagine 45 days from now I'm going to say the same thing, although obviously we do adapt as the markets adapt.","However, I want to just go a little further not only on the plan, but on the numbers, to give you a sense of how confident we feel in the execution on One Vanderbilt. Given the monies we already have invested in the project, all the monies, through the end of 2015 and the $230 million some odd that we project to expend out of cash flow in 2016, we should need to fund beyond that no further equity into the deal once we obtain construction financing and JV financing.","We have modeled it in a way such that the balance of the project, which is the bulk of the construction, will be funded out of a conventionally-structured construction loan and roughly a 50% JV partner. That would require not only no money invested into the deal after the end of this year, but actually would result in money back to SL Green as kind of profit, if you will, over and above our invested basis. So, that is what we'll call plan A.","The plan B would be a construction financing. We sell other assets and we would have the ability to fund the remaining equity over the ensuing four or five years essentially out of cash flow. There would be no need for equity issuance or lever off the Omni construction loan to fund the equity portion because we generally fund out of this company $200 million to $250 million or more of redevelopment or development capital annually. And that would be an amount sufficient over that period of time to fund the balance of the equity in the event we couldn't or chose not to JV the asset. However, the reception we believe in the market for partners for this asset is exceptionally strong and therefore we think plan A is far more likely than plan B.","So with that said, it takes more questions on that in the Q&A section, but that is how we see having that One Vanderbilt project funded in a way that puts no liquidity pressure on the company whatsoever.","So with that, I'd like to open up for Q&A. [Operator Instructions]","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from David Toti with BB&T Capital Markets.","David Toti","Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Just a couple of questions. Marc, it's an unusually cautious tone from you relative to the tone that we heard in December. What are some of the indicators that are giving you a bit more pause at this point in the year?","Marc Holliday","Well, I mean, in terms of a cautious tone I would say it's more market-driven. If you look at the last 45, 50 days in the market, there's obviously concern I'd say \u2013 I think predominantly about potential bank exposure to the energy sector and what that might mean in terms of earnings visibility and whether or not that will result in some kind of people contraction.","So, I think the investor sentiment in general has degraded substantially over the past call it 50 days or so, even though the property metrics, if you will, have not. There's still \u2013 we see very good access to debt financing. So we think better projects will be refinanced in this market. There's a lot of equity capital out there, still looking for investment, and the tenant demand for the first month of the year was good. And the pipeline remains.","However, I would say for, well, I'll say out of favor, more secondary, tertiary assets, either asset classes or transitional assets, I think as the financing becomes tougher to obtain for those kinds of projects, you're going to see those kind of projects back up a bit. But I don't think that's going to affect our portfolio in almost all respects.","David Toti","Okay. And then if I could just ask a follow-up. If we extrapolate that view of the market in the coming year to the transaction markets, does this speak to relatively stable cap rates and property values in your mind in the Metro New York City market and particularly for your asset type?","Marc Holliday","Again, I think you really got to parse asset type, which is what I tried to do in those opening remarks. I think that for the well-located, high-quality assets, the answer is absolutely in the 2% treasury environment, the kinds of returns that can be made on these core assets are still going to be, we think, very attractive to real estate investors, and demand will remain high for those assets. There are other assets, because real estate is a broad term in New York City, there are other asset classes and\/or other asset profiles which I think will, you'll see cap rates and\/or certainly IRRs increase \u2013 maybe IRR thresholds increase 50 to 100 basis points for hotels, condos and I'd say commercial assets with a lot of execution to redevelopment. But I think this is where quality gets parsed. I don't think it affects our portfolio because our portfolio, by and large, retail and commercial is extremely high quality. And I think we'll be a net beneficiary of that market.","David Toti","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ross Nussbaum with UBS.","Nick Yulico","Thanks. This is actually Nick Yulico here with Ross. Can you just go through what's going on with the sale process for assets right now, whether you're still looking to sell 1745 Broadway and what's the status on that?","Marc Holliday","Well, I think that given the notice that we received in January on the sale of 388-390, we're kind of reevaluating all of that as it relates to reevaluating our whole disposition program for the year because that one is so sizeable. With that said, 1745 is in the market. We're negotiating offers on that deal. And I guess we'll have more visibility on that during \u2013 in between now and the next call \u2013 and by the next call with that and other assets that we are in dialog with that we think would be the best asset to sell in this market because, again, there's a lot of demand out there, but the profile of what you sell changes somewhat, because we're always looking to sell not just sell for the sake of selling, but sell at whatever we think is accretive to our NAV, which is monstrously accretive to stock price because the stock price is a fraction of NAV.","Nick Yulico","Okay. And then just, I guess, on overall sales and you're thinking about getting money in or you're debating doing an acquisition or using that money to deleverage. I guess how you're weighing those two options based on your outlook now for the overall economy and the investment market? And then also on the Citi sale, how are you thinking about that? You talked about you could deleverage from that process, but you're also going to be losing NOI. So, how you are thinking about the FFO dilution impact there?","Marc Holliday","I mean, FFO dilution, you're taking a 2018 trip there because the FFO, I mean, that sale is scheduled for the end of 2017, so it's certain it's money in the bank, but it's \u2013 I mean, there's a lot of growth in this portfolio. I mean, I hope that came across in December the amount of embedded growth we have in the office portfolio, the growth portfolio, the retail portfolio. So, we're only now talking about 2016. I assume and hope we'll have additional growth in 2017 and 2018 such that whatever the diminution is from 388 as a result of paying down the mortgage and proceeds to pay down the line is sort of just a factor of our overall plan as we continue to increase NOI in all other assets and keep overall growth trajectory going forward. So, I don't think any 2018 dilution from Citi is factoring into our decision today to use all those proceeds for debt reduction which I mentioned earlier to you would be about one full turn of gearing of reduction. What was part B to the question? I didn't...","Nick Yulico","It was just, as you're thinking about \u2013 if you have a bunch of assets potentially earmarked for sale this year, how do you think about that money as it comes in, weighing deleveraging the balance sheet today versus buying an acquisition?","Marc Holliday","Well, the same way we always will. We want to \u2013 we've set goals for deleveraging. So, the way we presented that plan is we'll continue to pay down debt with asset sales where we can most efficiently, meaning there's no major tax impediment in doing so. Sometimes we have significant capital gains that you can't simply do without having to pay out, I guess, a stock dividend, which is an option and something we would look at, but something we haven't done in the past. And then, when we get to levels we feel are the right gearing levels at the end of the cycle, then we're looking for very opportunistic investments. So, the thresholds rise. You're looking for very opportunistic investments which we always generally are.","And they're few and far between. I know people like to think in shopping markets. That means there will be a plethora of deals. It's just this market is so solid right now generally and you saw it a lot in 2008, 2009. Over half the inventory is owned by 12 or 15 of the best capitalized players in the Citi, so you just don't get these sort of highly distressed situations. So my point is if you see one or two this year or next year, it doesn't matter, if you see one or two really solid deals, then you act on them because they just don't come along that often. But I guess the default assumption is that most of the money raised through capital-raising activities is going to reduce the line of credit, which was there, is our source of liquidity to grow the portfolio and take advantage of the market over the past four or five years.","Nick Yulico","All right. Thanks, Marc.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank.","Vincent Chao","Yeah. Good afternoon. Marc, just going back to the kind of the change in tone here for December to today, I mean, it is quite a bit more bearish, but I thought I heard you say that you're not really moving away from the outlook that you projected back in December. I'm just curious why that is given the much more subdued tone out there and expectations of a slowdown in the back half.","Marc Holliday","Well, you'd have to look at each of the metrics. But, I guess, because we still think we're going to be able to achieve the metrics, I mean, it's \u2013 the mark-to-market on leasing I think we've pegged around 13% to 16%, and we still feel we're going to end up there. So, I guess, the question would be, why would I \u2013 you can't really alter that if you still think that's where you're going to end up. I mean, looking at the mark-to-market, we have $1.1 billion in pipeline, it's very significant, probably in excess of that.","And looking at same-store NOI, which we put out there, is a very healthy number. I think it was around 6%. We feel good about the 6%. So I think you are \u2013 I wouldn't take these comments about the market generally and sort of the \u2013 where I think there'll be differentiation in the market with our portfolio and product on the right side of that differentiation as any indicator or reason that we would be modifying or coming off of the achievements \u2013 the financial performance we think we'll be able to achieve this year. So, I guess, we're not modifying. We still feel confident in where we sit.","Vincent Chao","Okay. Is it fair to say, though, that your outlook for the market has deteriorated since then? So, I mean, the conditions under which you made that outlook was somewhat different from a market perspective?","Marc Holliday","I would say \u2013 I think the market has deteriorated, and I think that we see a differentiation in this market. And because of that, we see opportunity both in the DPE program maybe down the road one or two asset buys.","I had described the $1 billion of acquisition, which was an aspirational goal at the time, as one or two opportunistic investments. So I don't think that's changed. I mean, that's how we looked at it. I think that the composition of what we may sell will change because I think different assets will sell better in this market. So that may change, but the aggregate volumes we're not revising.","And from a \u2013 most importantly, I think from a portfolio and company performance level, when we're looking at things like expenses, margins, leasing volumes, occupancy, mark-to-market, NOI, we feel very, very strong about that. So, remember, New York City projects 60,000-plus of new job growth. That's a very positive market. I just want to \u2013 it's not a \u2013 I would not use the term bearish market if the city is going to grow by 60,000 private sector jobs. That would, in most markets, be in most time periods for New York City considered very solid and enviable. It's just not at the same level it was last year. Those are stats we've recently come across. And I've always said that we tend to look at the job growth that is kind of a leading indicator. So, with that, I think it is a precursor, if you will, or at least a look into what'll still be positive absorption but potentially a slowing leasing market in the second half.","Vincent Chao","Okay. And just maybe one other question on the investment, Marc, it's obviously the less core assets that you [indiscernible].","Marc Holliday","I think out of fairness, we have a huge queue here.","Vincent Chao","Okay. I'll follow up.","Marc Holliday","I'm going to ask you sort of jump back around and, of course, [indiscernible] we've got a lot of guys in the queue.","Vincent Chao","No problem.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jamie Feldman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jamie Feldman","Thank you. You had a very active quarter on the D&PE book. Can you talk about the spike in volume in the fourth quarter, especially given your more cautious comments about the market? And then also, it looks like your exposure per foot rose meaningfully for the junior mortgages and mezzanine debt. Just how should we think about your appetite for risk and volume in that book if we are heading into weaker times?","David Schonbraun","Look, I said \u2013 it's David Schonbraun. I think I said at Investor Day, sometimes the results are lumpy and in Q3, we had very low originations and Q4, you just saw a normalized kind of origination levels kind of look for the year. So I wouldn't read into Q4 volumes as anything happened other than Q3, we had a bunch of deals that didn't close in Q3 and they slipped into Q4.","So, from a level standpoint, I think we're running exactly where we always have and I think the type of products has been consistent. I think we did a lot of \u2013 for most of the loans we did were a whole lot of originations where some of that we sold off senior pieces, some we held. I think we have tended to stay more senior in the capital stack and take less risk and maintain our yields, which I think has been a stated goal of ours. And I think that's going to be consistent in this year.","So I think we have a pretty healthy pipeline right now. I think yields have held firm, but we've really tried to go consistent with last year and take a little bit less risk while maintaining yields, and not try to outperform on yield to get kind of the 8.5-plus-percent yield while taking the minimum risk to get there.","Jamie Feldman","And then how should we think about your exposure per foot for the junior mortgages and mezz? I mean, it's up meaningfully. Does that mean you think asset values are higher, or it's a mix?","David Schonbraun","I think it just depends on what we originate, so I wouldn't read into it. I don't think it \u2013 it may be because we did a couple of retail deals that drive the values. I think if you look at it as a homogeneous pool, it's a little tough. I think we probably did more retail plays in the fourth quarter, which is a sector, as Marc and Brad said, we love. So I think those have higher per foot, but probably may have less inherent risk, so you may just be seeing that come through.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. And then just thinking about your risk appetite, it sounds like you are more willing to pull back than get more aggressive here?","David Schonbraun","Actually, it's been consistent with how we run the program and consistent with what you saw last year, which is it's all about risk-adjusted return and us finding the right \u2013 what we think is the most mispriced piece in the stack, if that's mortgage, senior mezz, junior mezz, that's where we look to play.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. All right. Thank you. [Operator Instructions]","Operator","Our next question comes from John Guinee with Stifel.","John Guinee","Okay. Hey, thank you. The question, I guess, is you guys have been on the FFO treadmill for a lot of years now, also doing pretty well on the value creation. If you can only go one way, are you going to continue to push FFO, or are you going to focus more on value creation?","Marc Holliday","Well, I mean, John, I think we're always pushing value creation. I mean, FFO, I think, is a by-product of that. But we're in the business of investing capital and making money. We try to do it in a way to have recurring and replicable FFO, and I think we've done that about as good as anyone in the sector with an FFO that will be approaching $7 a share this year, and the lion's share of that coming from stabilized commercial portfolio. So I don't think we invest to create FFO, but obviously we invest to create cash flow and profits and FFO as a result of that.","But I think we're always trying to be very selective about what we buy. I think that's why we have the portfolio we have today, which is I think second bar none in terms of quality and positioning. And we also are probably the most active recyclers of capital so that we're always generally looking first to monetizing gains and reinvesting them to drive value, which in turn drives FFO. So I think we're very connected, if you will.","But the DPE book is always a constant as it relates to the aggregate amount of our real estate portfolio. And those proportions don't really \u2013 haven't changed over the years and don't change much. And if we're going to invest incremental capital this year, it'll be done very selectively, whether it's in commercial assets or the DPE book to make what we think will be outsized returns or \u2013 and then only once we are at the sort of the leverage levels that we have set out as targets.","John Guinee","Great. And then refresh my memory, where are you in terms of total cost for One Vande and cost per square foot? Have you given guidance on that yet?","Marc Holliday","Yes. Give me a second because I have that here. I think it's sort of an interesting stat. So One Vanderbilt depends \u2013 there's book balance, there's cash balance. The asset is carried on our books at a grand total of $133 per gross square foot, and I think that's $227 million. That's the book balance.","In terms of invested capital to-date or I should say through 2015, that number is $433 million, or $250 per square foot, both of which I think I hope you would agree is a very, very attractive basis for us to own that land. It gives us complete flexibility, if you will, with respect to the future because we have a very low basis in it. We don't generate cash flow from it, so there's nothing in our current or future numbers. That's an important point actually. In all the growth numbers we've shown, we've never shown any incremental NOI growth from One Vanderbilt.","So the project will either be capitalized in the way I mentioned earlier, which would require essentially no further out-of-pocket from SLG, or build it out of cash flow, which I don't think we'll ever be in a position of having to make that decision, or you could sit on it for a time without any pressure or effect. Not many developers have development sites with that kind of inherent flexibility with no debt and no joint venture pressure to have to perform or meet, and no earnings they have to support. So it sits on the balance sheet at very low levels. It has an investment balance at very low levels, and it gives us free flexibility, which is why we're very comfortable with it.","John Guinee","And your total development cost, is that $1,500, $1,600, $1,700 a square foot as of today?","Marc Holliday","Well, I don't see \u2013 I think we \u2013 Rob Schiffer is not here at the moment. We put up a development budget at the IC and I want to say it was about $1,000 a foot for construction cost and you can obviously add to it what we have sunk into the deal, which is the numbers I just gave you. And then there's some soft costs and leasing and everything beyond.","John Guinee","Okay. Thank you very much.","Marc Holliday","Yeah. Next?","Operator","Our next question comes from Tony Paolone with JPMorgan.","Anthony Paolone","Thanks. Marc, in an environment where you think leasing may slow in the second half of the year, do you think office rents for the market end up flat, down? Where do they go from here?","Marc Holliday","Well, as long as leasing absorption stays positive, I would say, at a minimum, it should be flat. I would have otherwise said up, except you have incremental supply so that would keep \u2013 you have incremental demand, incremental supply, so that should keep rents I think for at least 2016 at the levels they currently are, which is why we're modeling a mark-to-market consistent to 2015 \u2013 with last year as opposed to something higher.","Anthony Paolone","Okay.","Marc Holliday","Does that make sense or\u2026","Anthony Paolone","Yes. It sounds like \u2013 it sounds flattish, I guess?","Marc Holliday","Well, it sounds \u2013 well, again, it sounds flattish because of the incremental supply, but yes. Because the point is where you would look to declining rents would be when you have significant job loss, which is not at all being forecasted as part of this cycle right now.","Anthony Paolone","Okay.","Marc Holliday","But yes, I would say flat. It could be up, it could be. I mean, if you said it'll be up 3% to 5%, that wouldn't surprise us. That's possible. So it's sort of property-specific. Because we're so leased, we'll have the opportunity to push those marginal rents higher than we normally would because we have very little space available and not a whole lot expiring. And a lot of other landlords are in that same situation. So we will certainly be responsive to the market, but we're also holding our rents and can push those rents.","Anthony Paolone","Okay. And then second question. Both 3 Columbus and 280 Park, I know you have partners on those, but they both seem to be rounding the corner then now. What do you guys want to do with those? Do you keep them? Do you try to sell? What are the plans there?","Marc Holliday","I think both assets are long-term hold. So I don't \u2013 it's not a part of the current thinking on asset dispositions in either of those two events.","Anthony Paolone","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.","John Kim","Good afternoon. Marc, just given where your stock is trading this year as well as your CDF spreads on your debt, are you considering deleveraging further than the 8 times debt to EBITDA that you projected by year-end?","Marc Holliday","Well, I think the projections we put up with Citi had us below 7.6 times. So, I guess, the answer is, yes, because that's what we put up in December was I think 7.5 times or 7.6 times, Matt.","Matthew DiLiberto","7.6 times.","Marc Holliday","So I would say that's still the target. We could go below that as well. But the target is not 8.0 times. It's 7.6 times.","John Kim","Right. 7.6 times is pro forma 2017?","Matthew DiLiberto","2016.","John Kim","But I was wondering if there was any thought of deleveraging quicker than that?","Marc Holliday","Yes. I mean, I think that certainly if we wind up reinvesting or utilizing all the proceeds of our expected sales to retire debt, then it will be quicker than that and further than that, if you will. So the answer is, it's certainly something we would do and could do based on the assets we sell. And again, the only sort of asterisk there is to what degree is the tax implications of what we're selling. Some assets have modest tax implications. Others, we've created such enormous embedded gains that they tend to \u2013 it's more efficient, if you will, to reinvest in a 1031, the way we usually do. Because selling assets and paying down debts works if you're not making any money. But if you're making sizable capital gains, then you got sizable taxes to pay.","John Kim","Okay. And then you commented on the potential increases in IRRs for traditional type of assets, but I was wondering if you had any comments on trophy assets as far as exit cap rates because I think, earlier this year, exit cap rates were being underwritten at 50 basis points higher than going in for trophy type of assets.","Marc Holliday","I think you're going to see no change in trophy cap rates.","John Kim","Even with the job growth slowing?","Marc Holliday","Even with job growth slowing. These are \u2013 I mean, trophy assets to me are the premier assets in the city, which generally are well leased and long-term lease. So, an incremental job growth in 2016 is sort of meaningless for the asset. There are people that just are looking to put core money to work. The interest rates are low. I mean, this is a dead market \u2013 the spreads have gapped out but swaps and treasuries have declined, plus that financing rates are still extremely low relative to those cap rates and IRRs. And because of that, we still see at the moment pretty heavy investor demand. I think the message is that I'll keep repeating, so hopefully people come away, which is that we'll be selective and the best assets I think will still continue to be at kind of these record levels, if you will, or most desired levels throughout the year. Unfortunately, our portfolio falls primarily into that bucket.","John Kim","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Manny Korchman with Citigroup.","Michael Bilerman","It's Mike Bilerman with Manny. Two questions. The first just on One Vanderbilt. And Marc, certainly appreciate your comments that, in option one, using joint venture equity as well as a construction loan, you wouldn't have to put any more capital. And I'm just curious as you are thinking about that project and investing that extra $1.7 billion of capital, at what point do you make the decision to move completely forward? Is it a pre-leasing level, or is it at a date because I do think that there is, even if you use joint venture in a construction loan, still some concern in the marketplace that you are going to move forward with an extraordinarily large development in an uncertain market and one where clearly your more subdued comments today would give people more pause. And so I think just trying to understand when and what sort of environment you would fully move forward with this.","Marc Holliday","Well, the environment into which \u2013 today is really not the environment in which we're leasing into. So you really have to look at what's the environment in 2017 and 2018 when we would expect the bulk of the leasing to be done. So, with regards to a go, no-go, to me, it's about capitalization and risk mitigation. So to the extent you've got long term and low-cost construction financing in place that gets you into the 2020s. So, I mean, this market becomes like an asteroid to the relevant market for this asset, which is five to six years forward and you have your JV equity in place such that we would have no further equity commitment.","So, without a financing risk and without any further equity component that makes it an easier call to move forward than not.","So, I think that the level of leasing will be known in 2017 or 2018, so I would say, at least on a spec basis, that's the date on which we'd be reassessing or assessing the project. But I'm very confident that that project is going to be met with extraordinary demand on both the debt equity and leasing market. The meetings we've done to-date have kind of codified for us, if you will, just how well-received this product is going to be. But again, it's for a much future market so I think the issue is predominantly capital risk mitigation which is really in the form of equity, bringing in a JV partner.","Michael Bilerman","And the second question is just in regards to NYRT. You guys made a comment to the press last week that you're not in negotiations to buy the company. And I wondered if you can just clarify does that mean you're still part of the process where you're not the active lead bidder in the final negotiations, or does that mean you're completely out from acquiring the entity? And how does that then translate ultimately to potentially coming back in as a bidder or potentially financing another bidder from a DPE portfolio?","Marc Holliday","Michael, you're like...","Steven Durels","Clear violation of the [indiscernible].","Marc Holliday","You're like reading \u2013 you're going way too deep into this. I mean, if we make a statement we're not in discussions with a company, I would hope that that's just sort of...","Michael Bilerman","Was it negotiations? So I didn't know how to take negotiations as a word.","Marc Holliday","All right.","Michael Bilerman","And you know...","Marc Holliday","You can use the word discussion. I know what you want to use, but I have nothing further to say on NYRT. We're not at liberty to get into it. You can speak with them. And I think I wouldn't read so much into it.","Michael Bilerman","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander Goldfarb","Hi. Yes, hi. Good afternoon. Two questions here. The first is, over the past several years, we've had a number of market swoons where there's been extended volatility whether it's last August or previously back in 2013. Given large financial firms haven't really been active growers, so it's been either smaller financial or the social media or advertising or other industries. Can you just give a sense of as far as tenant discussions, how right now is different that's made you more subdued versus what happened last August when people panicked over China or in prior sort of market melt downs?","Marc Holliday","Steve Durels, are you [indiscernible]","Steven Durels","Yeah. Let me \u2013 you got to put things in context. Marc was commenting as to where there are headwinds and speculation as to what we may face throughout the year. That's one point. But as we sit here today coming off of a very strong fourth quarter and going into the first quarter, we haven't seen any let up on the leasing. So, we've got a very full pipeline. And we've probably got as better diversification on the types of tenants than we've seen in any time in the past. Of the million \u2013 100,000 square feet of pipeline transactions that are active either in term sheet negotiation or leases out, it runs the gamut of big deals with insurance firm, healthcare, advertising, legal information services and financial. So, a very, very broad spectrum of tenants that we're in active discussions with.","Alexander Goldfarb","So, as far as the leasing slowdown in the second half, that's just a general market observation or, Steve, that's based on your conversations with tenants, you're sensing more of hesitancy by people who normally would be in discussions at this point for second half where they are not in those discussions?","Steven Durels","Hasn't infected yet the conversations at my level. I think we're looking more forward down the line saying, if there's going to be moderating job growth, if there's sentiment out there that will lead people to pause then that's later down in the year. But as we sit here today, the only kind of hesitancy we've seen is on some of the financial service guys as you would expect, whenever we've seen big gyrations in the stock market then all of a sudden you get some of those hedge funds, some of those financial service guys say, you know what, let's just pause for 30 days., 60 days and see where the world shakes out.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. And then, the second question is, on the finance book, what percent of the book are residential or condo conversion opportunities? If it's like an office building where you lent and that person wants to do condo conversion or something that would be like that and then what's the split of rental on the residential on your finance book?","David Schonbraun","The answer is as it sits today, we don't have loans on active condo projects in any loans that we have that are transitional, either work as office buildings or work for us as multifamily. So, we don't tend to make condo loans. The only time we really lend our residential is we think the fallback is multi-family works. So we're not really along condo product as condo products. We're not really along any real construction as it sits today. We have some land loans that I think sponsors want to go to condo but that's our basis works out with a very different business fund.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. So like Sony building type things. How many other Sony-type buildings are there?","David Schonbraun","Sony building as it sits today is an office building.","Marc Holliday","Yeah. That \u2013 so Sony is not \u2013 our loan on Sony does not allow for a change of use. So, I wouldn't put that in residential bucket. That's an office building.","David Schonbraun","It's an occupied office building.","Marc Holliday","It's a collateral as office. So when you talk about a conversion loan, those are loans where you're providing the capital to convert to a change of use and at the end of the loan term the use has been changed. That's not Sony loan and that's \u2013 I'd say that's not most of our loans. We may have, up to 30 somewhat positioned, maybe 1 or 2 or bridge loans with an intent to condo or not, I don't even know.","Isaac Zion","There's a couple. There's very few that are bridged with intent to condo but our loans that allow them to go vertical.","Marc Holliday","Right. I guess the point is they didn't go vertical so there's no exit in terms of like condos sellout exposure. We have none of those.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Lewis with SunTrust.","Michael Lewis","Yeah. When you first laid out your 11 Madison Rubric, there was about $12 million of early debt extinguishment as part of that. You have a bunch of sales in the first quarter. Can we expect to see those charges in the first quarter, and are they in your guidance?","Matthew DiLiberto","Hey, Michael. It's Matt. We actually structured the refinancing such that we don't need to take that charge. So we put it on the original Rubric. It's not in our guidance and we won't be taking such a charge.","Michael Lewis","Okay. And then my second question, I might be wasting it, it's about New York REIT. The stock went up pretty significantly when it was reported that you weren't involved. Michael, just asked you if you might still be involved and you kind of couldn't answer or didn't really answer. Can we just say right here that you're not going to be buying New York REIT in any way, shape or form, or can we not say that?","Marc Holliday","I mean, we're going to pass on commenting on that question.","Michael Lewis","Okay. Understood.","Marc Holliday","I mean for just \u2013 not for \u2013 just we're not in a position to answer that question.","Michael Lewis","It feels like maybe it puts you back where you started before you commented for him.","Marc Holliday","I've got to move on to the next. I'm sorry.","Michael Lewis","All right. Thanks.","Marc Holliday","But I appreciate the question, Michael. Sorry, Michael. Steve Sakwa.","Steven Durels","Operator, move on.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI.","Steve Sakwa","Thanks. Marc, just one question. I guess given the large discount that you stated at your Investor Day you were trading 10 AV, would you entertain doing a much larger asset sale and doing a special dividend something on the order of what EQR did in order to try and help return cash to shareholders and recognize that value?","Marc Holliday","Yeah. I think that's completely on the table if we get to a point where we think that's the best use of funds for sure. Yeah. I mean, I think it made sense. The asset portfolio at \u2013 I think the numbers were a 4.5% cap was about $154 million, 4% cap was $175 million and we're looking at the screen today of sub-100. So, if there's \u2013 I think one thing we've done a good job with in particular in the past couple of months is illumination of asset type. We've generally been able to sell into this market at numbers that are far, far in excess of people's models and everything, but consistent with our NAV, which gives us confidence. It cements our confidence in our NAV. So, I think that the implied trading right now is somewhere around 7% to 8% cap, which I think is somewhat absurd. And therefore, you'd have to look at that \u2013 what you outlined there, Steve, as a strategy is definitely possibility. The alternative is you can do the same thing, pay down some debt, and do a stock div as well, sort of different executions but related.","Steve Sakwa","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sumit Sharma with Morgan Stanley.","Sumit Sharma","Hi. Marc, thanks for taking the question. And thank you for the color on the market. So, assuming that these negotiations on the spaces that are coming due, and this is not SLG space, but to your market commentary in general, assuming that they started happening at least 12 months in advance, is this your cautionary tone more on smaller tenants or are larger users also taking a pause? I mean, I guess do you anticipate TIs and free rents and concessions going up in 2016 because of the softening demand?","Marc Holliday","I will let Steve sort of handle that because I don't think we have it as finely parsed as large tenant\/small tenant. But Steve, do you have a view?","Steven Durels","Yeah. I think it's \u2013 our commentary was in response to an inquiry as to whether rents would go up. The question wasn't whether the rents will remain healthy or not. We have a very strong market. We've had strong velocity in the fourth quarter. Midtown in particular had a very strong leasing quarter in the fourth quarter. Our pipeline and the overall velocity in the market remained strong. So, I think, from our perspective, the question isn't whether or not there's going to be erosion. It's just a matter of how good it's going to be. And if it's not great, it will still be a very solid leasing market for the year.","Sumit Sharma","Got it. Understood. Actually, another follow-up on the investment sales side at this point. Have you seen any sort of receding demand from foreign buyers of sovereign wealth funds?","Marc Holliday","Isaac, do you want to...","Isaac Zion","Hi. This is Isaac. We're still actively meeting with sovereign wealth funds from all over the world, maybe see a little bit of an uptick from folks in the Middle East trying to get some money out. Some of the European funds are also focused on the city. You got to remember, those are much longer-term players. Their view of the market is very long dated. So, we haven't seen any pullback from those players in terms of looking for assets.","Sumit Sharma","Thanks for the color.","Marc Holliday","Thank you. We'll take a couple of questions.","Operator","Our next question comes from Craig Mailman with KeyBanc Capital.","Jordan Sadler","Hey. It's Jordan Sadler here with Craig. Just on the CMBS market dislocation we've seen over the past six months, but in particular over the \u2013 since your IC. Any thoughts ahead of risk retention coming into play later this year and what that portends for either New York City real estate values or for your structured finance business?","Marc Holliday","Andrew, are you \u2013 I hate to [indiscernible]","Andrew Mathias","Yeah. I think the \u2013 everybody is talking about risk retention, for sure. And nobody is \u2013 there's still a lot of uncertainty in terms of how the rules are actually going to play out. I think it'll have less of an impact frankly on large New York City assets and a much more direct impact on financing costs for typical conduit product where today that market have gotten rather efficient, and you don't see a lot of conduit loans in New York City because they're all large loans either single assets or they're sort of dominant pieces of bigger securitizations.","I do think debt dislocation, something we've been highlighting since the fall does create opportunity in our structured finance book and as sizing of senior loans changes due to higher costs and more conservative underwriting or less players in the market, it does generally improve the subordinate debt market and we're either taking less risk or able to charge more for our capital. So, I'd look for it to have more impact in the structured finance book than on New York City assets. But I think there's still a very robust commercial bank market, there is a robust CMBS market for large assets and I don't see risk retention really playing that much into those assets.","Jordan Sadler","Okay. That's fair. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jed Reagan with Green Street Advisors.","Joseph Reagan","Hi, guys. When you talked about leasing velocities slowing this year potentially, you mentioned big banks as one group but that might hit the pause bottom. Are you expecting a slowdown from the TAMI crowd as well and then as you kind of look out into 2017 and 2018, as you sit here today, you mentioned the back half of the year could be tough. I mean, just generally speaking, are you expecting a continued slowdown in the rent velocity environment going into 2017 and 2018?","Steven Durels","Well, I think it's hard to predict whether it's going to be where \u2013 which industry will experience any kind of slowdown. I think the big banks in particular, the investment banks, we haven't seen them grow in the market obviously. We've seen them lease space in the market. And they're in the market right now, but mostly through consolidations or because they're attending to lease explorations.","And being able to, quite frankly, forecast where I think any other industry is going to see any slowdown, I don't think I've got that crystal ball. I can only say that as we sit here today, every one of those industries whether it'd be financial advertising TAMI, the whole the biggest sectors in the market, we've got deal flow from those sectors. But I think only time is going to tell as to who feels the pain and if there's a slowdown at all.","Joseph Reagan","So sort of underpinning your kind of outlook for job growth later this year is kind of more of a broad-based impact?","Steven Durels","Yeah. I think that's a big view on a 400 million square foot market, what it does to the overall leasing market and how are we suited to be able to respond to that. And the reality is we've got very little vacancy. We've got a year of very little lease expirations. So we're well-defended to handle whatever happens in the marketplace and we're forward-looking by really attending to a lot of our 2017 expirations as we sit here today.","Joseph Reagan","Okay. Thanks. And you guys mentioned a tougher underwriting environment for lower quality assets and buildings with execution risk. Couldn't that make the bidding tenant pricing environment for doing a JV deal on One Vanderbilt tougher? And then how much do you think, if you were to compare, say, your suburban assets versus say an opportunistic deal in Manhattan in terms of kind of vulnerability on pricing \u2013 any comments you can make there?","Marc Holliday","I don't \u2013 I'm not sure I understood the second part of the question, Jed. But as it relates to the ability to JV One Vanderbilt, I think it's going to have an excellent reception and I think we'll be successful there. And I think that people are excited by the asset and most of the calls continue to be inbound. I don't know what the suburban asset opportunistic, I didn't follow that.","Joseph Reagan","No. I'm just trying to sort of parse out if you're saying that kind of lower quality, kind of lower opportunistic deals might be under more pressure in terms of underwriting expectations. Which area do you think is more vulnerable, say, a suburban portfolio that you own or a deal with hair on it in Manhattan?","Marc Holliday","Yeah. I mean, so \u2013 I don't know \u2013 there's no deals we own with hair on it. So I mean, I can't \u2013 that's a hard one to answer. I would say that there's generally core and non-core. Non-core is not hairy deals. It's just not of the highest caliber of trophy deals. So there you may see IRRs widen out to 50 basis points, 75 basis points, 100 basis points, I said that earlier. Suburban portfolio I wouldn't extrapolate anything to that because they never participated really in the uptick. I don't think they're going to participate in the down tick. That's a very sort of steady state market. So, I don't think anything we've talked about the data would extrapolate to the suburbs.","Joseph Reagan","So you wouldn't expect a similar widening of IRR expectations on the suburbs?","Marc Holliday","No.","Joseph Reagan","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the question-and-answer portion of today's conference. I'd like to turn the call back over to our host.","Marc Holliday","Okay. Thank you very much. And we will look forward to speaking again after the first quarter is done.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's presentation.

Earnings Conference Call. My name is Lacy and I will be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today, Heidi Gillette. Please proceed.","Heidi Gillette","Good afternoon, everyone. At this time, the company would like to remind listeners that during the call, management may make forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ from the forward-looking statements that management may make today. Additional information regarding the factors that could cause such differences appear in the MD&A section of the company's Form 10-K and other reports filed by the company with the SEC.

Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Marc.","Marc Holliday","Okay. Thank you, good afternoon, and happy you're joining us today. I know that many of you have full calendars so we will keep our remarks brief and give everyone an opportunity to ask several questions with the goal of trying to be done by about 3 before we start to lose some of you folks.","Our results for the second quarter, combined with a series of press releases this week, puts a capstone on a very successful and active first half of the year. There were a number of significant achievements for which we are very proud to have executed during the first half, notwithstanding the current market environment, which can best be described as neutral.","These achievements include the recapitalization of 717 Fifth, major retail leases to Express and Sam Ash, completion of the sales of One Court and 379 West Broadway, the acquisition of 10 East 53rd Street and 304 Park Avenue South and major lease renewals with Viacom, Random House and the City of New York and 770 -- $775 million refinancing over 1515 Broadway.","So there's obviously a lot there in a pretty compressed period of time and these major transactions keep us on plan to meet or exceed our goals for 2012.","However, it is harder to read the tea leaves for the remainder of the year. There are mixed signals in the market that make it difficult for us to assess the level of activity for the remainder of 2012. Leasing momentum, which was very good in 2010 and '11, seems to be modestly decelerating, albeit, there are still a number of deals in the market that are getting done. There is more competition from landlords on newer projects in secondary locations, which is serving to restrain for now any further material growth in nominal or net effective rents, and this will probably remain the case for the balance of the year.","Keep in mind that we are right in the middle of summer, which is traditionally a slow time of year for us and for the leasing market, generally. And we've also heard from a number of our tenants that they are keeping a watchful eye and a cautious approach on the upcoming election, which many see as pivotal towards their future leasing and growth activities.","On the other hand, there are several measurable indicators that give us the confidence there exists pent-up demand that should reappear in the market when the confidence factor is higher, including growth in private sector jobs of nearly 70,000 employees, that's year-to-date, with half of those jobs, or 35,000 jobs, being created in the office-using sector.","Furthermore, Wall Street profits projected by the city to be $10 billion for the year is tracking well ahead of this position with over $10 billion earned in just the first 6 months of the year. So you can see that this more positive jobs and earnings, financial sector earnings data, is somewhat inconsistent with what we're hearing from tenants who seem to be -- have taken a more cautious approach right now. And I think this will remain the case certainly for the next several months until we clear the election.","When you get past some of these macro market measures and you drill down into our portfolio, what's interesting to note is that we have nearly 50 office leases that are either out for signature or in advanced stages of negotiation in excess of 480,000 square feet. Within that segment, I would put a very high probability of completion on those deals. Then on top of that, there is another 35 transactions that we believe will convert into leases, although not quite as high probability of level, and the square footage encompassed by those discussions or advanced discussions is about 680,000 square feet. So I certainly believe we are on track to meet our goals and objectives for 2012 with respect to occupancy levels, mark-to-market and same-store NOI increases.","We are also emboldened about the future prospects given the large incremental revenues, we expect to create by redeveloping, repositioning in leasing the recently acquired value-add properties, which is expected to contribute about $1 per share of FFO whether or not the mark-to-market in rents is slightly higher or lower in where we stand today. While these incremental revenues were projected to phase in between now and 2015, we are already starting to see the positive effects of leasing up these embedded growth properties and expect those results to accelerate into 2013.","I'm also very pleased with how we financed and capitalized these value-add properties over the last couple of years, notwithstanding the substantial upside in that portfolio and the capital we had to expend to take those into inventory. We've also substantially equitized other assets along the way such that we have stockpiled enormous liquidity and we carry a line balance at quarter end of just $80 million, which is the lowest it's been in about 6 years. We have also consummated a series of refinancings that is sequentially reducing our long-term cost of capital, while also lengthening out the duration of our liabilities. And Jim and Matt will go into those items and measures a little bit later.","But at this point, I'd like to turn the mic over to Andrew Mathias, who will provide an overview of the Manhattan property markets.","Andrew W. Mathias","Thanks, Marc. Good afternoon, everyone. The second quarter was another extremely active quarter for us as we worked hard to accomplish many of our key objectives.","In the broader market, deals continue to get done outside of the traditional auction process. Sellers are perfectly content to patiently wait until their expectations are met, as happened in the sale of 575 Lexington, 1372 Broadway, 386 Park Avenue South and 666 Fifth Retail during this quarter. We don't expect much change to this dynamic until the fall, when several large offerings are teed up.","In the meantime, as promised, we closed on our sale of One Court Square in Long Island City, reducing our footprint out of Manhattan and reducing our tenancy with Citigroup in successful fashion. Look for us to roll out an additional property or 2 in the second half, now that 1 quarter is off our plate and market conditions like this, with record lower rates, lack of supply and aggressive buyers generally signaling to us a time to realize embedded gains and harvest assets.","We are changing our stance slightly to be net sellers in the second half of the year as we project out our disposition activity and look at the acquisition activity that we achieved in the initial 6 months of the year.","In our own portfolio, we had a couple of crowning achievement type accomplishments in the retail program that deserve top billing. Our lease with Express in Times Square at 1552 Broadway and our recapitalization of our investment in 717 Fifth Avenue. We closed the Express flagship deal on the heels of gaining city approvals for our ground-breaking development plan for the building and signage at the site. This 15-year lease ensures an extraordinary return on our investment, which we expect to reach north of 10% on an unlevered cash on cost basis, once again, demonstrating our value-add strategy and its superior returns.","High kudos to our entire team with particular mention to Brett Herschenfeld, Bob DeWitt and his construction team and Neil Kessner and his legal team for threading the needle on this execution.","At 717 Fifth, on the heels of our record-breaking lease with Dolce & Gabbana, we were able to recapitalize our interest there, bringing in new long-term debt and selling a portion of our interests, leaving us with a 10% stake, we felt it was more appropriate to the levered nature of the recapitalization. This investment has been a stunning success for the company with IRRs in excess of 30% on our equity over the 5.5 year hold period and the opportunity for significant additional appreciation via our remaining stake in the property.","On the office front, we announced our latest foray into the Midtown South market with our acquisition of 304 Park Avenue South. This strategic asset occupying the corner across 23rd Street from One Madison gives us another offering in the hottest submarket in the country right now for office space.","The Structured Finance business also saw an active quarter, with net originations of $64 million and another large $130 million investment closed subsequent to quarter end. We continue to be the go-to provider for subordinate financing in the Manhattan market and have, thus far, been able to maintain the strict underwriting metrics which were put in place during the recent recession. We expect our balances in this business line to continue to grow modestly as we identify relative value in these investments.","And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim.","James E. Mead","Thanks, Andrew. If I were to characterize our balance sheet activities since the bottom of the cycle, we started defensively as we moved out of the bottom and move quickly into an aggressive mode as we saw and then capitalized on investment opportunities. And I would say that we've moved from this aggressive stance into a more neutral position. Notwithstanding that we're still finding attractive investments, we're focused on harvesting and realizing gains, building liquidity, terming out financings and tending to our longer-term goal to improve our credit metrics and capacity.","Our activities during the quarter are a reflection of this posture. Our line of credit ended the quarter at $80 million in comparison with the $400 million outstanding last quarter and $500 million a year ago. So at the end of the quarter, we had a largely undrawn $1.5 billion credit facility and $230 million of unrestricted corporate cash. At the same time, our consolidated debt to EBITDA is 8.1x and we have a healthy 2x fixed charge coverage. And this is before the $90 million plus or so of EBITDA that will come with the execution of our business plans on properties we've purchased over the past 2 years.","While we continue to invest during the quarter, we purchased 304 Park Avenue South and redeemed $100 million of very expensive preferred stock. We also funded efficiently and opportunistically. The monetization of our profits at 717 Fifth Avenue generated $85 million in cash. The sale of One Court accomplished a number of strategic objectives. In addition to providing $44 million in cash to the company, we mitigated our single tenant risk with Citigroup, shed a $315 million mortgage and reduced our Suburban New York City exposure.","304 Park Avenue South was the fifth deal in the last 2 years where our property seller has valued SL Green OP units as a tax efficient Manhattan currency, used as consideration for our purchase. In this case, we issued $33 million of common OP units to the seller and we purchased the property unencumbered.","We were in the market early in the quarter, raising $79 million of equity through our ATM. Once again, we executed the ATM at a premium to the volume weighted average price and with few fees. Our ATM is off now, but remains a great tool to fund needs related to additional growth.","On the debt financing side, we used the new CMBS market to raise 10-year mortgage money on 100 Church, providing a low-cost of capital and with a term that continues to push out our average maturity, reducing our exposure to future interest rate fluctuations. You'll recall we financed the Viacom building at 1515 Broadway with a $775 million transitional mortgage before we had Viacom's lease extension. Since we now have the BBB+ S&P rated Viacom for 19 years, it's an obvious next place to take a look at our options.","I'd like to make a comment on some of the great achievements we've made in the quality of our leasing programs that have taken every opportunity to lock-in our tenants and secure the durability of our future cash flows. Over the past year, our leasing team moved the company's Manhattan average lease term from 7.25 years a year ago to 8.14 years today by executing high credit quality leases with the likes of Viacom, which has 19 years left, City of New York with 20 years, Healthfirst with 20 years and Random House with 11 years remaining. And in Manhattan, 39% of the company's cash rents come from strong invest-grade tenants. These leasing accomplishments are the most important drivers of improving credit quality since they represent greater stability and certainty of future cash flows. The company's improving leasing complexion as well accrues directly to increased property and company valuation.","Now I'll turn the call over to Matt.","Matt DiLiberto","Thanks, Jim. Overall, our second quarter results were very positive. However, before I highlight some of the more notable components of our reported results, it would take 2 minutes to address 717 Fifth Avenue since its treatment and earnings, while also very positive was a bit unusual.","As Andrew has discussed, we recently executed a hugely significant recapitalization. The property involving, among other things, a mortgage refinancing, new mezz debt and a sell down of SL Green's interests, all of which highlighted the significant value we have created at the property. What may have seemed odd to many people, is not the realization of that value creation but how impactful it was to our reported FFO.","Almost $68 million or $0.73 per share of FFO was recognized in the second quarter as a result of this transaction. These cash proceeds are equivalent to the recognition of significant profit.","Prior to the recap, we had a very nominal basis in the venture. As a result of our low basis, any incremental proceeds we received via the new financing over and above our investment balance was recorded as income. If this were an on balance sheet investment, this profit would have been recognized in the future. However, this venture is off balance sheet, which requires recognition of this profit today. And because this profit did not come via an asset sale, it also is considered FFO. At this point, it's also probably worth noting the change in accounting for our first mortgage position in London. With the maturity date of that position behind us, we have taken control of the property via a receiver and the property is being marketed for sale, which allow our mortgage position to be repaid. Because we control the property, even though we remain a lender, the property is now consolidated onto our books as an asset held-for-sale and is no longer included in the debt and preferred equity portfolio. This treatment resulted in the immediate recognition of $4.7 million of original unamortized purchase price discount in the second quarter based on the fair value of the property which would have otherwise been recognized over time. This amount was included in investment income.","So with the accounting tutorial behind us, let's move on to focus on some of the simpler yet very important financial metrics we reported at quarter. Our second quarter and first half results have been strong and generally in line with our expectations.","On the real estate side, combined same-store cash NOI growth, the most widely recognized measure of our portfolio's performance, remained strong at 5.7% through the first 6 months of the year, driven by a well-occupied portfolio, the burn off of free rent from large volumes and recent leasing and carefully managed operating expenses which have been below our expectations for the first 6 months due in part to a warmer winter and new electric supply contracts.","In the non-same-store portfolio, where most of our transitional or non-stabilized properties reside, we remain focused on tapping the more than $90 million of incremental EBITDA that we expect those properties to contribute over the next 2 to 3 years.","At this point, while the earnings contribution from many of these properties is moderate, our business plans remains largely on track as evidenced by the announcement earlier this week of our Landmark lease deal with Express at 1552 Broadway.","With regard to the debt and preferred equity portfolio, despite a larger competitive set, we continue to see opportunity to put money to work. These new opportunities have increased the average yield on our $1 billion portfolio from 8.4% at the end of 2011 to a robust 10.1% at June 30 and over 97% of this yield is being generated by positions that are collateralized by the New York City commercial properties. It's also worth noting that there were no reserves taken against this portfolio in the second quarter and only $25 million of the portfolio is on nonaccrual status, evidencing the quality of that book of business.","Interest expense saw a modest tick up in the second quarter, however, that increase is entirely attributable to a onetime charge of $2.8 million taken in the quarter related to the write-off of unamortized costs on a previous mortgage at 1515 Broadway which was refinanced in April. G&A remains in line with our expectations and continues to trend lower than 2011.","Turning to guidance. Recall that we increased our 2012 guidance last quarter based on the performance of our Manhattan portfolio and our continued opportunities to invest capital in the debt and preferred equity portfolio. Given that recent increase and the trends we are currently seeing in the market, which Marc and Andrew touched on earlier, were it not for the gain recognized on the recapitalization of 717 Fifth Avenue, we will not be revising our guidance any further at this point. However, given the magnitude of that one timer, another upward revision is clearly warranted. As such, we are increasing our guidance again from $4.50 to $4.60 per share to $5.23 to $5.33 per share to be reflective of the $0.73 gain recognized in the second quarter.","We will note that we have not treated the additional income from the 717 Fifth recapitalization as FAD, and therefore, are not adjusting our previously provided FAD guidance of $2.50 to $2.60 per share. As is has historically been the case, our capital spending in the first half of the year tends to be much lower than in the latter half. So while our FAD run rate to the first 6 months of the year would indicate an outcome better than our guidance range, we do expect to see an increase in capital spending for the back half of the year.","With that, I'll turn it back to Marc.","Marc Holliday","Okay. Thanks, and let's open up the line for questions, operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Tony Paolone with JPMorgan.","Anthony Paolone - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Marc, you'd mentioned some competition coming from secondary locations. Can you just elaborate a little bit further on what those are, is that lower Manhattan or is that other stuff?","Marc Holliday","Well, that's -- I mean, those are any of the newer projects that are not in what I would call Prime Midtown areas. So Prime Midtown we've always defined as basically Third over to Broadway and Seventh and 42nd Street up to 57th Street and converging around the primary commuter transportation hub. So anything that, the further it falls out of that boundary then the further, I would say, it is from being a core Midtown location. So anything of a newer vintage that falls outside of that boundary, I would say.","Anthony Paolone - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I mean, is the space downtown like the World Trade Center -- World Financial Center, some of those bigger items, and you could see that as a bargaining chip for large Midtown tenants but does that act as such for 10,000, 20,000, 30,000, 50,000 square foot tenants?","Marc Holliday","It's predominantly -- when you start talking about that kind of disparity location, you're talking about the larger tenants. Often, it's a stalking horse position, but sometimes we've seen it's not. There have been some moves that have been consummated for bottom line -- management of the bottom line, or in some cases, just these areas are starting to emerge and people are looking out 5, 10 years down the road and saying that those areas are going to be more core on where they want to be. So I would say, with respect to the smaller spaces, it's generally more local subset of properties that we're competing against. But certainly, the larger tenants, 50,000 feet, and 100,000 feet and over, probably 100,000 and over, we will be competing with a larger set. We can generally prevail, but that just is going to holding back for the time being, further growth in rents over and above what we've experienced over the past 2 and 2.5 years. But it's still what I would describe as a relatively healthy and balanced market, as we described at the beginning of the year. And I think we've shown in the first half of the year that it's been exactly that with some positive gains in mark-to-market and leasing up our value-add properties.","Anthony Paolone - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. I just had a quick one on the guidance. You upped it about $0.72, I guess, for 717, but it seemed like you also recognized the few pennies for the mortgage reclassification, was there an offset to that?","Matt DiLiberto","Yes. Tony, it's Matt. So just in the quarter, there was a direct offset to that for that onetime write-off charge we had to take on 1515. So just look at the quarter, there's an offset there. That would have been unamortized this year, I think, we will recognize over time regardless, that happens to be taken in one-lump sum in the quarter because of the reclassification.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of Rob Stevenson with Macquarie.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","While we're on this guidance topic, Jim or Matt, you guys have given same-store cash NOI guidance at the Investor Day of like 3% to 4% for the year, did you up that when you revised guidance in the first quarter or what's the guidance of the same-store NOI today?","Matt DiLiberto","We did not adjust it when we revised upwards our guidance in the first quarter and we're trending ahead for the first half of the year due in primarily to expense loads. But we're not adjusting for the remainder of the year. So we may be at the higher end of that range, but not taking it up from the 3% to 4%.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then the other question is you guys have been in the press recently on the L.A. portfolio on the mezz debt there, what are you guys are thinking in terms of current thoughts in terms of the sort of faith there and whether is that something that would sort of follow through like the London asset?","Marc Holliday","I'm sorry, what was the last part of that question about London?","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Well, you guys basically took control but now you're selling it, is this a situation where you can see the same thing happen there, I mean, or you guys have any interest in owning Class B assets in Southern Cal?","Marc Holliday","Well, Rob, we have a high-batting average in answering all these questions we get with a high level of transparency. This is one we're going to have to refrain from getting into any detail on this particular call about expected outcomes and strategies given the nature of this transaction right now. I think we'll have a lot more to say about it on the next call. So I hate to punt on this one and we will have a lot to say. I would just tell you that we are -- it's an investment where we have a fairly moderate carrying value in this investment. But it's something that we're giving attention to towards a successful resolution for the parties involved. And we'll just have to get into more of that as it plays out and I would say certainly on the next call.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then, excluding the Viacom lease, which obviously dominated the leasing activity during the quarter. What was the new lease spread on the New York City leases on during the quarter?","Matt DiLiberto","Rob, it's Matt. By and large, that is a flat, I mean the Viacom deal drives because of its size. The metric excluding that, we would be right around flat for the quarter.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Ross Nussbaum with UBS.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","A follow-up on the Cavi [ph] portfolio in California. I know you can't speak to it specifically but why doesn't it show up in your supplemental as one of your 10 largest debt and preferred equity investments?","Matt DiLiberto","Simple question here, the simple answer is only a $25 million investments.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So the 59.4 that's reported in the press is not accurate?","Matt DiLiberto","Carrying value is $25 million.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got it, okay. Can you talk a little bit about 3 Columbus Circle maybe as a proxy for what's going on in the market. At least from the supplemental, the leasing percentage hasn't changed in recent quarters. It's a relatively fresh asset, new sponsorship. Why do you think that's not moving ahead more quickly?","Marc Holliday","Well, why the leasing at 3 Columbus not moving quickly?","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Correct.","Marc Holliday","Okay. I'll have Steve Durels will address it. I would -- the only thing I would say Ross, is we're well ahead of plan on 3 Columbus. And I would say it's -- I think it's moving forward nicely. So I want to reconcile those 2 statements, not moving forward, moving forward. Steve, can you sort of elaborate on that?","Steven M. Durels","Yes. Well, I mean, we actually have some leases that are pending, we hope that they'd be close by now. But we have leases out right now on roughly 45,000 square feet. We have term sheets being negotiated for another 50,000 square feet, and we're expecting a proposal in out of this week or early next week for a significant blocks of the remaining space in the building. So remember that when we did the Y&R deal, the sole focus on our leasing activity early on in the development was to land an anchor tenant, and we shied away from any single-floor tenants. So once we closed the Y&R deal at the end of last year, it now turned back to really reintroducing the building for single floor and kind of 2 or 3, 4 type combinations. And that just takes a little bit of time to ramp up through that part of the market. But we're seeing tenants come to the building. We are seeing a pretty wide diverse group of users come to the building as well. So I'm feeling still pretty -- I'm still feeling very positive about the asset.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, great. Last one for me, now that you have Viacom put to bed, are you turning your attention to AIG at 180 Maiden Lane ahead of their 2014 expiration? How do you think about that in terms of an early renewal?","James E. Mead","Our attention is certainly on 180. And, if you recall, our underwriting for the asset is that AIG does not stay in the building. So we're actively exploring the possibilities of both redevelopment of the asset and bringing it to the market for new tenants. And also in discussions playing it out with AIG in terms of their occupancy. So it's still too early to tell there. But it's definitely getting a lot of our focus.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Would it stay as an office asset if AIG left?","James E. Mead","Likely yes, although we're looking at all the possibilities, but we -- when we --our acquisition underwriting is as an office asset.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Bank of America.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Along similar lines, I'm hoping you guys can discuss your largest expirations through the end of next year? And how you're thinking about them in light of your comments about more competition from other landlords?","Marc Holliday","Largest expirations. Well, I mean, we can look and see what those comprised of. We typically don't talk about lease negotiations in progress for, I think, obvious reasons. So is there any one in particular or 2 in particular, Matt, that we can -- next year, I think is a relatively modest expiration year. I mean, this year, I mentioned that there's very little, I think, there is 2 tenants between 25,000 and 50,000 feet that expire for the remainder of the year. The rest are small.","Matt DiLiberto","Next year is 1 million square feet, pretty balanced out...","Marc Holliday","Next year is 1 million square feet in total. So under 5% of the portfolio. And I just -- Steve Durels is there one in particular that's at the top of your head? We don't typically like to advertise who it is. But I think it's safe to say we think we're going to have a very high-success ratio with that 1 million square feet leasing up and retaining as we've had in the past. I think the question is going to be the rental levels, which as we get, as I mentioned in my earlier comments, as we get deeper into the balance of this year, we'll start to formulate our rental projections and assessments for next year. I think for the moment, we are on track for 2012 where we projected to be back in December and with the caveat that I expressed earlier. But I just don't think we're in a position to go through the status of our pending leases, unless you have one, in particular, you have a question on.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","It's more along the lines of just the largest we should be watching and then are there any known move outs, any sizable known move outs in '13?","Marc Holliday","Steve?","Steven M. Durels","The only one that's scheduled to vacate that was known about for a little while is Draft at 919 Third Avenue. Other than that, I'm actually flipping through my list right now, as we speak, there is no other big expirations. And Draft is 150,000 square feet in one of our premier buildings. So, I think, we'll -- there's a good shot we have that space leased before they ever move out at the end of next year. Other than that, no, I'm looking through the list and there's most of it is  '14,  '15 that we're kind of looking at further down the road where we have some bigger role. But '13 is a pretty quiet year. And I think in '13, we're going to spend a lot of time focusing on filling up some of the buildings that we bought recently. Where we bought vacancies, and finishing off the leasing at 100 Church, finishing off the leasing at 125 Park and a couple of the other assets.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then for Andrew, you commented on maybe a pickup in assets coming into the market in the fall. Can you talk a little bit more about what you expect to see and does that include the Blackstone assets?","Andrew W. Mathias","Well, certainly, worldwide, it's teed up and that's out there publicly. We hear rumors of some other sellers that Blackstone is not among them. So I don't expect to see the Blackstone assets come to market in the second half. And I can't comment specifically on the plans. But I think that report was overblown.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, so you think the largest in the fall is worldwide, are there any sizable ones?","Andrew W. Mathias","Nothing else that we can disclose publicly that we are tracking. But yes, there are a couple of other large assets there that are in plan.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Josh Attie with Citi.","Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","The $90 million of incremental FFO that you mentioned, can you remind us what the major components of that are? And how much CapEx might be associated with it over the next few years?","Matt DiLiberto","Josh, it's Matt. So the largest deals that are going to impact that the dollar are -- or 1552. So that's buttoned up a good portion of that. 280 Park is clearly going to be the most material in our list of 11 or 12 assets we have acquired over the last couple of years. Our expectation is to put in $75 million. And 3 Columbus Circle is on track, as Marc alluded to, that we hope to have buttoned up over the next couple of years. That capital is largely funded with the acquisition. So there's not incremental capital out of our pockets to put into that deal. And of the other 11, there's a couple of larger ones although relative to 3 CC, 280 Park, much smaller, 600 Lex comes to mind as one where we have gotten a lot of traction through our prebuilt program and starting to get some good traction there. Everything else after that is fairly modest. So it equates to $90 million to $100 million of incremental EBITDA for $100 million to $200 million of cash out of our packets.","Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And just a question on 717 Fifth, I don't know who wants to grab it. But you talked a little bit about the financing you're able to obtain, especially on the mezz going up to what effectively is almost 100% leverage on the value that was ascribed to you selling down your stake. And then also just talk about how, at least, at the current NOI level, there is -- it's about 0.8 covered before CapEx and any NOI reserve I know there's some vacancy. But just talk a little bit about how you sort of look at leveraging that asset, what does that say about the mezz lenders out there willing to underwrite that sort of leverage with negative cash flow.","Marc Holliday","I think a couple of things. As I alluded to in my comments, I mean, we're a minority partner here and we went down further in stake based on the fact that the recapitalization was done by a leverage as opposed to equity sale, which is on a more traditional way of recapitalizing assets. The mezzanine loan does feature a pay rate that significantly below the accrual rate. So the coverage is meant to be around 1.0 or 1.05 based on the cash flow in place. So the difference between that, the pay rate and the accrual rate sort of accounts for that difference. And there is significant growth both in contractual rent increases and also in some additional lease up potential at the asset. So I think it was an aggressive financing. It was done to sort of achieve primarily Jeff Sutton's objectives as the major partner in the deal. And we still think there is the prospect for additional incremental value appreciation in excess of our sale price on the debt balance, which is why we kept a 10% interest in the deal to sort of ride along with.","Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","What does it say about the mezz pricing being able to -- I guess, would you be lending on those sort of terms and would you take more capital like that for yourself?","Marc Holliday","Yes. I think this is a very unique asset in terms of location, in terms of tenant profile and in terms of just high-profile. So I would say the assets that we are making generally are not as long term. This is a 12-year term mezz. We're not doing much mezz that long term. We're generally doing shorter-term floating rate mezz. And at the shorter-term floating rate market, the underwriting metrics are decidedly more conservative than this. But this is a very long-term leased assets and it's a unique type of that mezz investment, which we we're able to take advantage of.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our next question will come from the line of Evan Smith with Cantor Fitzgerald.","Evan Smith - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","You talked about the 50 leases that are out right now for about 480,000 square feet. Just curious if you could touch on the type of sectors that are within there, if majority of it is tech or financial services type tenants?","Steven M. Durels","It's pretty broad range. I mean, we've got deals pending with insurance firms, some finance businesses, commercial bank hedge fund type part of the group, government, business services, advertising. So it's not being driven by any one group. But a pretty broad range of users.","Evan Smith - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Okay, and then of those leases, did the majority of them look like they would commence in 2012 or most of them will be pushed into 2013?","Steven M. Durels","It's a mixed bag.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Could you maybe give us a little more color on the change in stance related to asset sales. Andrew, you mentioned the second half of this year. What sort of the nature of that shift given sort of the mixed signals you're seeing in the market in terms of tenancy and I'd imagine the same thing in the underwriting side? What are you thinking?","Andrew W. Mathias","There is a real lack of supply out there, which is the deals are getting done off market, away from the auction process, but sellers are achieving extraordinary prices. And I think in that type of environment, it definitely pays to have some price discovery for some of our assets, see what buyers are willing to pay and match that up with where our perspective is in value and explore what's possible in a flattish-type leasing market. If there's buyers that are willing to be more optimistic on the asset front than we are internally that's generally where we've made successful sales in the past.","Marc Holliday","I think Andrew's use of the term price discovery is right on target. There seems to be a growing differential between the public market valuations, which seem to have stagnated a bit and the multiples have somewhere between held tight or maybe even modestly eroded as a sector in the past few months. Whereas the property pricing market in the public sector is marching forward. And as rates have continued to fall, spreads have compressed more, more capital, more debt, more equity, is looking for this kind of product. And this particular market on a risk-adjusted basis other world markets seem to be more in favor now. There's compression, further compression, we see on cap rates, both in our own executions and elsewhere in the market that is just creating a greater divide and I think that's it's something we think you, as shareholders, should be and analysts should be aware of. And we'll look to continue to demonstrate that one because we think that's important data for you. But more importantly, that's what we do. We create value and if we think these assets have reached some level of maturation then we look to harvest or JV and reinvest and that's kind of what we've done all along, it's still what we do, and we think that's in the best approach to balance growth and income. So as those markets continue to do well and as that disparity between stock price and underlining NAV widens, then I think you'll see us equitize more assets.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And would the flavor of those look more like 717 or some of the assets you've identified in the past is kind of being maybe noncore like 100 Church, 220 East 42nd, 711, some of those guys?","Marc Holliday","I'd say --  I think it's both. It's more of the latter. And we're not going to do levered recaps, we're talking about...","Steven M. Durels","I'm looking at 717 simply the joint venture in about levered recap, we might do JVs, we might do outright sales.","Matt DiLiberto","Yes.","Steven M. Durels","When you say 717, I will keep coming back to that. It's an asset we have a 10% interest in now, I wouldn't look at that as a profile holding of Green. That's a small minority interest to capture...","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","No, I just mean that you guys have talked about increasing the exposure to retail and that's obviously a high-quality location and tenancy with lease structure, et cetera, and you're reducing exposure to it. Obviously, tremendous IRR, an opportunity for you guys. But in terms of what the investments, you'll reduce or pare going forward, is it going to be stuff that looks like that or you'd look to sell or would you sort of just test the market on assets that might be a little bit more non core?","Marc Holliday","I guess it will depend on what -- if you know us, you know when we say we're looking to increase exposure of retail, that's not increased exposure of retail at any cost. Let's do it smartly and do it on deals that where we can make significant returns. So if there is a hot bid in the market for retail, we may look to take advantage of those.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","That makes sense. I was just curious what's the additional sales would look like, really, if they'd be more the non-core stuff.","Marc Holliday","We'll evaluate where the best bids are on the market.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. Matt, with the -- there was a depreciable real estate reserve in the quarter. What did that tie back to, the $5.8 million?","Matt DiLiberto","Yes. That is actually -- we have taken a similar reserve late last year. It was tied to the original contract price on One Court Square. As that closing was delayed, we got incremental sales price and that ultimately reversed the original depreciable reserves.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of John Guinee with Stifel.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just a little bit of a clarification, help me understand, if you could. On Page 37 of the supp, you have Viacom at 1.272 million square feet at $61.59 per square foot annualized. And then on Page 40, you go to 1.387 million and it looks like it's about $54.79. Couple of questions would be who's in the rest of the building? Why the increase in the square footage? And what's the actual rental rate of reset?","Marc Holliday","So I'll touch on the disclosure, John. It's -- the size of the lease in the leasing table in the back is accurate for the new lease, and therefore, all the metrics tied to it or the square footage shown on the largest tenants page is their existing square footage because that new lease has a later commencement date. And then I'll let Durels ask -- or answer the remainder of your question.","Steven M. Durels","The balance of the tenants in the office portion of the building are, there is an ad firm, an engineering firm and a law firm. That in combination, I don't know how, maybe 3 or 4 floors in total. And that's the space that Viacom will move into as those leases expire.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So if the rent go on from $61.59 down to $54.79, is that the right way to look at this?","Marc Holliday","I think the right way to look at it is to multiply the 2 together, I mean, that's their rent charge. We've recast it in a certain way, but you can look at -- I mean the rents in the market are a function of loss factor and rental rate. So, I think you have to get the product of those 2 numbers to get their actual rental rate. That's the whole loss factor part of our business.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So is the rent per square foot go up or down on this renewal?","Marc Holliday","It depends on what square footage you -- the square footage grew, it increased the loss factor and we -- and there's a smaller nominal rent. But the rents is, I haven't just done the math...","Matt DiLiberto","In absolute dollars, John, they are paying more rent on the new lease...","Marc Holliday","All right. Yes, the rent went up...","Matt DiLiberto","Than the old lease. On a mark-to-market basis that equates to 2% increase.","Marc Holliday","Correct.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And what happened to the expense stop? Was the expense stop reset or how did that work out?","Steven M. Durels","It's the same. They pay the same proportion of share as they would, irrespective of what the measurement is because that's really just based upon the percentage of the building that they occupy. So whether the building is 2 million square feet, or 1.5 square feet based upon what we measured it to, the percentage of that occupancy doesn't change.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And does the net rent after deducting the new expense stop go up or down?","Marc Holliday","Steve, that was new expense stop, was it not?","Steven M. Durels","Yes, the expense stop is reset.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","From what to what?","Steven M. Durels","Boy, I don't know. Matt -- maybe we've got it, it came to a current base year. I just don't remember whether we used '13 or '15.","Marc Holliday","We can go over this, John.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And then just out of curiosity, who is the lender on the 12-year $290 million mezz on 1717 Fifth -- 717 Fifth, and on a pay accrue basis, is the principal on the 12th year on that loan up around $400 million?","James E. Mead","We're trying to figure out whether we can tell you.","Marc Holliday","Was it in the -- it wasn't in the press release?","James E. Mead","Yes.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","You can tell us, we'll keep it secret.","James E. Mead","You'll keep it secret.","Marc Holliday","I don't think we -- I don't think that we released it publicly...","James E. Mead","I don't think so.","Marc Holliday","So I don't think we can disclose who it is.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And the decision-maker on that asset as you gone down to a minority interest, who's the -- who owns the other 89%?","Marc Holliday","It's majority-owned by Jeff Sutton.","Steven M. Durels","John, I just looked it up. The base year for operating expenses are 2014 and for taxes it's '14 and '15.","Marc Holliday","The answer to that question, we didn't know yet if we could tell you. Reef [ph] is the lender on the mezz.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Alex Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.","Andrew Schaffer","It's actually Andrew Schaffer here. And I just wanted to get your thoughts on the likelihood of the up zoning on Park Avenue and do you think if that goes through given before any material progress has been made on the West side?","Marc Holliday","I'm sorry what was that the second part of the question?","Andrew Schaffer","It's actually, do you think the up zoning on Park Avenue is going through without material progress being made on the West side development?","Marc Holliday","Well, I can't speak to that. I mean, these are, as I understand of their independent initiatives of city planning. This is something that I think stands alone as a major and I think much needed initiative to reinvigorate some development around what is predominantly the most coveted office location in Midtown. So the 21.6 FAR maximum or implied maximum to date or currently is something that by today's world standards is quite small for the city and that's why you're seeing most, not all, but most of the newer -- and 21st century buildings are being built in other emerging markets that allow for heights that are anywhere from 24 to 30 FAR or even above in some cases. So I think this is an updating of a fairly old zoning text. I think it was carefully studied by planning and came out with these recommendations. I think that this goes -- can go forward with or without regards to what transpires in other markets in the city because this market is distinct in being able to support without subsidy, the kinds of rents that are needed today to justify new development. Those rents -- the costs are very high so the rents have to be very high and this is largely the area where those high rents are achieved. So it certainly makes sense in our estimation to put density where rents can -- where tenants can afford it and want to pay and are attracted to those locations. And also to put density around major commuter hubs as opposed to putting density where you have to bring the transportation to the site here. Transportation is largely there in terms of Grand Central and is going to be even further populated once the East side access project is finished and Long Island Railroad begins letting passengers off of Grand Central, there's going to be a significant increase in ridership. So it seems from a planning perspective, from a development perspective, from a good urban perspective, it's the right kind of initiative at the moment. As to the specifics of what's been proposed and whether it's going to pass as it is or get modified, we certainly can't speak to. But we're excited by the proposal as an owner in Grand Central, we think it makes sense from a lot of levels and it will sort of go through its analysis. And over the next 1 year, 1.5 years we presume.","Andrew Schaffer","Okay. And lastly, I was wondering if we can get a better understanding of your kind of thoughts on the Midtown South market and the tenant mix and if you are more likely to shy towards credit tenants versus the start ups while you're looking at new acquisitions in that area?","Marc Holliday","We definitely will turn towards credit tenants. We did so 12 years ago in the Dot.coms boom and we continue to do so today. We think the Midtown South area is tight enough that -- and there are enough high-quality tenants looking into expand and active in that market that we can definitely concentrate on credit tenants and still have a lot of success leasing there.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Brendan Maiorana with Wells Fargo.","Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Question, Marc, I heard your comments earlier in the call about a little more caution with respect to tenant activity. In New York, can you guys have $90 million to $100 million value-add portfolio or $90 million to $100 million of NOI gains potential. How do you sort of think about acquisitions that require a fair amount of lease up or value-add acquisitions today? Would you be comfortable doing that, given where the market dynamics are?","Marc Holliday","Well, we gave this commentary at the beginning of the year that we had acquired a pool of properties that we thought was sufficient to seed our growth for the next couple of years or few years and that was going to take up the bulk of our attention. So since the acquisition of 10 East 53rd Street, which I think was consummated in December or January?","James E. Mead","January.","Marc Holliday","January. So we have not been active acquirers of vacancy. So that's not a -- I don't want you to take that as anything to do with my comments today as opposed to our posture throughout the first 7 months of this year has been to basically focus our efforts in capital on the projects we acquired and create that additional $1 a share that we've spoken about. That doesn't mean we're not looking and at the margins we won't do certain deals. But 304 Park Avenue South was by no means a lease up project. That building is fairly well leased and we think that's just a longer-term play that was transacted on reasonably good terms. But there's no -- my only point to you is I don't think there is any shift on this call in that approach. That's been our posture throughout the year.","Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's very helpful. And then one for Andrew, can you provide any details on the lease at 333, 34th with Sam Ash And I think you guys may have put a $25 million or so into that building over the past couple of years and just maybe the return on cost that you're getting on that space, which is now, I guess, fully leased up?","Marc Holliday","I have to come back to you with those details. I don't have them at my fingertips. We can come back to you with some specifics on that asset.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Michael Knott with Green Street Advisors.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","If the public market is trailing private market values, why is the ATM an attractive source of capital so far this year and in this last quarter?","Marc Holliday","I think what we said is, Michael, that the -- Jim's words were, I think, ATM is off. So, I don't know where you heard that the ATM is an attractive source of capital.","James E. Mead","Michael, we raised ATM money, I think, predominately before even in the last earnings call. I think we were done right about then.","Marc Holliday","I think the stock prices then were well in excess of where they sit today.  We had sold values 4 months ago -- Mike, my comment specifically was in the past few months, the stock price in the multiples are kind of steady or eroded while the property markets have moved ahead. So the result of that comment would be sales on ATM off. I think that's exactly what we've done.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just a way of asking about leasing market trends, it sounds like things have slowed down a little bit but do you think have it slowed down enough to make you more glad that you got Viacom done when you did? Would that negotiation feel different just a few months later or is the market not changed enough to really have affected, say, that lease just hypothetically?","Marc Holliday","No. I don't think that falls into the category of what we are talking about. That was unique building and unique offering for a certain tenant and then I think you could look at it today and say it can go either way. But we're seeing generally for the more commodity like tenants, and tenants in the financial sector, for the most part, they seem to be a little bit more cautious on growth. They seem to be doing more densification, which is healthy for the industry. But it's just, let's put a temporary cap, we think, on near-term future growth. But that may kick back into gear after Labor Day or after the election which was my comment earlier. But we don't see any kind of seismic shift, if you will. I mean, the market is still, like I said earlier, pretty well-balanced and relatively favorable for us to do the large volume leasing we're doing. So I don't think there's been any material shift of anything in the past few months. We've been saying all year that the gains would be somewhat muted and flat and I think it's turned out that way. So to the contrary, I think, some of these deals we're doing now if we held out a few more months, we'd be doing better deals. But with that said, that's just not our approach. Our approach is generally just leave what's in front of us and we catch the increases on the next wave of leasing. So we try not to -- except in very select instances, talking on 2 things like warehousing and things like that.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Mitch Germain with JMP Securities.","Mitchell B. Germain - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","Some thoughts on concessions. Marc or Steve. Have you seen any change over the last couple of [indiscernible]?","Steven M. Durels","From my perspective, not really. I think they've been fairly flat all year long. It really kind of depends on the size of tenants you're talking about. If it's smaller tenants, call it 10,000 square feet or less, you got to deliver the space to build, which is why you've not seen us stop the prebuild program, we've been doing it for a couple of years and we continue to do it. On the bigger deals, it's still in that kind of $65 cash allowance where the space -- one has to be built for a long-term lease. And what we're doing on renewals, or lease-up on build space, then it's -- it depends on the deal, but it's kind of cosmetic money to modest alterations. But I don't think we've seen a real migration as far as the amount of free rent, it's still kind of 10 months of free rent, if the tenants building the space and it's less if the landlords building the space. And the TI as I outlined.","Mitchell B. Germain - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","And in that increased competition that you guys mentioned from competing landlords, is that for all tenant sizes, meaning, is it for the smallest spaces to the larger or is it for any particular set?","Steven M. Durels","Well, I think what Marc was seeing and certainly what I am seeing, is that tenants are going farther afield to satisfy their space requirements. So that may mean that a tenant who is on Fifth Avenue and you would have normally thought that tenant was going to stay within the 2 or 3 block radius of where his current space is, is now opening it up and saying I'm going to Midtown South because I just like the lifestyle or I'll go farther West because I'm chasing a lower rate. You're just -- you've seen a broader geographic search by a lot of tenants and that's what adding a different twist to the competitive landscape.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just 2 questions. First one in regards to just dividend policy going forward, how we should be thinking about that?","James E. Mead","Yes, I think that just to be consistent with what we've said before, we expected that our -- just by virtue of increases in our taxable income in the company, we will need to increase dividends as we move forward. And our expectation would be to do it at a pace which is relatively high, we think, compared to what others in the industry would be doing. So I think you'd see us continuing to retain significant cash. But increasing our dividends by virtue of need as a result of our taxable income.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then secondly, just when I think back to your Investor Day and all your 2012 goals and I'm kind of looking at the half year report right now, it's like you're well ahead on quite a few of the goals. But two, in particular, I would like you guys to talk about just achieving mark-to-market on New York leases that are greater than 5% and Manhattan portfolio occupancy of 95.8%, just kind of given where you are as of 2Q, how you are kind of thinking about potentially meeting at least those 2 particular goals at the back half of the year.","Marc Holliday","Well, I can tell you where we are currently. I can't exactly project where we'll be 4 or 5 months from now. But I would say that currently, I think we're tracking 7 points ahead on mark-to-market. So that would seem to snugly fit within the greater than 5%. And we'll just have to keep --  we've got our work cut out for us for the rest of the year to try and we either achieve that. But as we sit here today, we are certainly not revising that upward or downward. We're comfortable with that particular objective and that was a fairly robust objective, I think, going into somewhat of a choppy market. And as to occupancy, there's a lot of moving parts. I think that we ended the year in something like 95.3% and we have projected about 95.8%, if I recall, right? And I think we'll be somewhere -- that probably bookends where we'll end up. We're going to certainly do our best to try and get right to that 95.8% and I don't see any erosions of where we were. But there's -- as I said earlier, there is like 50 leases that are in advanced stage. And then Steve, how many lease, 35 leases, I think, were [indiscernible] investigation?","Steven M. Durels","Yes, I mean, when you look at the pipeline of proposals that we've got out, as you cull through that and you say, well, if there's 50 or 60 proposals out and you say which ones do you think are really likely to make. There's 35 deals -- 35 proposals covering another 680,000 square feet of it.","Marc Holliday","So our objective will be to get those done by December and I think if we do, we'll hit it and if we have 10% or 20% that lapse into January, you may slightly miss it or maybe exceed it in December and then have it adjusted again in January. So we're in pretty good shape.","Operator","And our next caller will come from the line of George Auerbach with ISI Group.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","It's Steve Sakwa here. Just a question, Marc. I wanted to kind of go back to the, I guess, kind of the Park Avenue and the up zoning and kind of your project actually on Madison. I knows you guys have kind of put that whole assemblage together. Just kind of what are your thoughts for that project and what would it take for you to kind of redevelop that asset today?","Marc Holliday","Well, we're constantly working on it, but we're working on it with an eye towards a very long lead time of delivery. So nothing that I would say is imminent because between the planning stage, demolition and vacate, build, and it's just a very long process. And I think we're moving that along. Our goal was to have a lot more to say about it by the end of the year. And I think we'll have more visibility into how this proposal may or may not affect our desires to accelerate or change our thinking as to size and timing. But I think the zoning proposal or the amended proposal makes sense without regard to the project. I mean that's just -- this zoning is going to affect many, many blocks and properties and sites of which this is one of many. So the bigger issue for us is with 11 million or 12 million feet in this year, most of which will not be redeveloped, is just to see this area be improved and be anchored as a #1 destination for business and that could only serve to benefit all the properties located within that district. But I think it benefits the city. I mean it's just going -- it's going to put the tenants at a place where there is the highest tenant demand and where the public transit infrastructure can handle the most amount of people. So our procedure and our thoughts on the site, timing, et cetera, is somewhat independent of this exercise. But certainly, we'll have the results of the zoning amendment before we take any material step forward. So we will kind of know where we are when it comes time to get to that next phase of the project, which would be a more serious and definite timeline for construction and delivery.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And I assume it's fair that you would want a sort of a large anchor tenant kind of pre-lease to lease maybe half of that building before you'd start?","Marc Holliday","Yes, certainly in this market you would. I mean, changes from market to market. But I'd say in 3 out of 4 market, yes and there's 1 out of 4 markets, no. So as we sit here today, yes, but I want to put an asterisk on that because it really depends on a market towards the middle or end of this decade, not -- today's market is somewhat irrelevant.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Right. And then, just kind of the other question, I know the Suburban kind of Westchester in Connecticut assets are kind of a small piece of the pie, but just sort of what's your thought process on that longer term and you sold the One Court, but do you have kind of a game plan to sort of sell those assets in the kind of near future or is it -- or the market is just too difficult to try and move any of that product today?","Marc Holliday","I think, unfortunately, the market is just too difficult today. There's no -- there's not an active sale or capital market out there. So, I think, our plan for the short and medium term right now is to hold the assets, let's our operations group do what they've been doing, trying to fight for occupancy and do as well as they can in renewing tenants and wait for a better market out there in a broader economic recovery before we evaluate doing it.","All right, thank you, everyone. I think we're going to -- it's gone past 3:15. If anyone is left on the call, we appreciate your dialing in today and we'll speak with you again next quarter. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes your presentation. You may now disconnect.

Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Results Conference Call. This call is being recorded. At this time the company would like to remind listeners that during the call, management may make forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ from the forward-looking statements that management may make today. Additional information regarding the factors that could cause such differences appear in the MD&A section of the company\u2019s Form 10-K and other reports filed by the company with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Also during today\u2019s conference call the company may discuss non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC Regulation G. The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to each non-GAAP financial measure discussed and the reconciliation of the differences between each non-GAAP financial measure and the comparable GAAP financial measure can be found on the company\u2019s website at www.slgreen.com, by selecting the press release regarding the company\u2019s third quarter 2014 earnings.","Before turning the call over to Marc Holliday, Chief Executive Officer of SL Green Realty Corp I ask that those of you participating in the Q&A portion of the call please limit your questions to two per person. Thank you. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Marc Holliday. Please go ahead Marc.","Marc Holliday","Thank you, and welcome to all of you that have dialed in today. It certainly goes without saying that the easiest and most enjoyable investor conference calls follow earnings releases of the type we posted yesterday. On many levels the quarterly and year-to-date results illuminate the underlying strength in the New York City economy and the way in which our active management of portfolio and value-add investment strategy is continuing to pay off for our shareholders.","We are generally on or ahead of plan with respect to our core operating metrics and at the moment market fundamentals appear to be improving on an accelerating basis. Demand for commercial space and resulting office leasing activity in our portfolio and the market at large should really not come as a surprise to those of you who have been dialing in to our calls through the year. We have been emphasizing three major factors contributing to a positive outlook that we\u2019ve maintained on prior calls. First and foremost is the continuation of a robust job creation environment. Important data shows that New York City is on track for the fourth straight year of plus 2% job creation with 85,000 private sector jobs added just year-to-date.","Notably over 25% of such new employment is in office using job sectors like professional and business services, finance and the [TAM-E] sector. This equates to nearly four million square feet of incremental demand and the year is obviously not over. A second major leading indicator foreshadowing our substantial leasing results was the extensive pipeline of deals that we discussed throughout the year on prior calls. Even as our buildings are trending towards full occupancy, we still have 1.1 million square feet of leases in current pipeline of which over 700,000 square feet are either signed or ready in Q4, out for signature or pending in negotiation.","The third significant factor driving space absorption is the relatively limited amount of near term new supply that will be delivered to the market over the next two years. While larger tenants of 500,000 square feet or more are planning for their space needs many years in advance the bulk of the market is made up of tenants below a 150,000 square feet and focusing mainly in the affordable commercial rent part of the rental spectrum and generally making leasing decisions within a much shorter time frame which bodes quite well for falling vacancy rates through 2016.","Above average job creation and limited near term supply should sustain double digit mark-to-market rental uptick on expiring rents and combined with the debt of SL Green\u2019s leasing pipeline will drive growth in net \u2013 operating income now and we think throughout 2015 and on from there. These were just some of the topics we will delve into in much more depth at our investor conference in December but I wanted to highlight these items in particular here today I believe that our announced results are not an indication of a change in direction of Manhattan fundamentals but rather a continuation of a steady and protracted recovery that began approximately four years ago.","With that we wanted to get right into the Q&A but we \u2013 as you noted in our press release last night we did raise guidance. So before turning over for Q&A we want to have Matt go through some of the major items and components underlying that guidance change and before turning it over to Matt I also want to note that this past Monday the planning department certified that the application for 1 Vanderbilt is complete and ready for public review to the ULURP clauses. This is a seven month statutory review process that should conclude in May 2015 and we have full intent and hopes of concluding that ULIP process with the issuance of a special permit to go forward with the 1 Vanderbilt development. So that quite an exciting moment for us after two years of work and design and predevelopment and environmental impact to get to the point of certification. So with that said let me turn it over to Matt.","Matthew Diliberto","Thanks Marc. As Marc said we announced last night we have increased our FFO guidance for 2014 to $6.06 to $6.09 from our previous guidance range of $5.90 to $5.96. We are giving [inaudible] related to the $300 million refinancing of 420 Lexington Avenue. This equates to a new NAREIT defined FFO guidance range of $5.82 to $5.85. The increase in our guidance range is a result of continued strong performance in both the real estate and then preferred equity portfolios through the first nine months of the year and our outlook for the remaining few months.","In Manhattan our leasing volume is on track to meet the 2 million square feet objective we set out for the year, while the mark-to-market that Steve and his team have been able to achieve is well in excess of our original expectation. From an earnings perspective the 280,000 square foot lease renewal of [inaudible] provides a meaningful benefit to 2014, given its significant increase in rent which will be straight line to earnings starting now and the leasing commission that we recognized in the third quarter. The additional revenue from our Manhattan leasing activity is coupled with the operating expense savings we have realized as a result of more moderate temperatures in particular in the third quarter which is traditionally high expense quarter and the continued cost containment measures employed by our operations team.","In the then preferred equity portfolio we saw the balance strength in the third quarter as we received the repayments we projected. However our new investment activity has been brisk and resulting in an average balance that has trended above our initial expectations throughout the course of the year and more significantly the yields we are achieving on new investments remain in excess of the 8.5% that we originally estimated.","Looking to the balance of 2014 we have a pipeline of debt and preferred equity activity that we expect to close in the fourth quarter but we will also be keeping our eye on repayments in particular one large investment which could potentially repay this year. On the corporate side with our second investment grade rating which we obtained from Fitch a couple of weeks ago and an attractive treasury yield we will closely evaluate the opportunity to raise more efficient corporate capital to replace higher cost legacy debt. As you have seen in the first three quarters sometimes these refinancings result in one-time charges.","With that brief summary of our guidance revision I want to remind people that our investor conference is being held on Monday December 8 in New York City. To be added to our email distribution you can email us slg2014@slgreen.com we expect to get invitations out over the next 24 to 48 hours. With that I will turn it back over to Marc.","Marc Holliday","Okay, thanks Matt and operator we\u2019re ready to open up the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","All right, great. (Operator Instructions). Our first question here comes from Jamie Feldman from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","James Feldman \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch","Hey thank you, good afternoon. I just hoping to get some more general color on the leasing market, what did you see this quarter that picked up so much and what are you seeing going forward?","Steven Durels","Hey Jamie its Steve. We really saw a continuation of much of what we have seen from the beginning of the year. Just to remind everybody we ended very strong last year. The market overall last year was a very good year almost close to a record setting as far as velocity goes and that momentum carried through the holiday and certainly didn\u2019t slow down over the weekend. I think the differentiator between what we are seeing today versus a year ago it\u2019s not just the story about the lower end of the market as far as price point goes but it\u2019s a story about big block deals being 100,000 square foot leases or larger, it\u2019s a story about the high end of the market coming back with a greater number of $100 rents being achieved today than we saw in last year and we continue to see good demand across the board from a wide range of businesses, whether it\u2019s financial services, law firms, accounting firms, business services and Jamie the whole advertising media information services sector is not slowing down by any sense of the imagination.","So it feels like we\u2019ve got very strong momentum that is going to carry us through the balance of the year and going into next year very strong.","James Feldman \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch","Okay, and then I guess to follow-up. How much are you guys impacted by the change in oil prices in terms of operating cost especially in some of your older buildings? Will you see a benefit from that?","Matthew Diliberto","On the margins we may see a benefit we do pass through a lot of our expenses so whatever benefit we would see is going to be shared with the tenants as well.","Marc Holliday","I mean clearly the common area charges, it\u2019s really question of where do we see the utility rates headed as a result of the oil drop. And I don\u2019t know if you have an update in yet to make a statement on that. We are in the process of locking in electricity rates for next year and it\u2019s a very good time to do it. So I think in the summer we didn\u2019t lock in as much as we usually did with the hope that prices would retreat a little bit on advice from our consultants which turned out to be fortuitous because oil has gone down and the price of electricity is we feel close to bottomed out, so we are locking in a lot of those contracts.","James Feldman \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch","Okay great, thank you.","Operator","Okay. Our next question comes from John Guinee from Stifel.","John Guinee \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus","Great couple of questions. First, when you guys are looking at your mark-to-market, if it\u2019s say 10% on a gross basis what is it on a net rent basis? And then second what sort of effect to your NOI that you see from the inevitable property tax increases given a variety of things that are happening in Manhattan?","Marc Holliday","Well, let me answer the second question and then we\u2019ll come back to net to the extent we have that number at our fingertips. But the increase over the past probably five or six years I am going to say have been quite substantial. The mill rate has not increase all that much but our assessments have grown significantly and those increases are phased in, I think typically five years or so.","So the property tax increases we are going to see over the next couple of years are really baked in from years prior at the transitional amounts coming to play but in terms of going forward I think that whatever property tax increases might come into play in future years that they may not be as targeted on the commercial sector as they have been in the past because I think commercial has borne well more than their fair share over the years and we\u2019re hopeful and we\u2019re obviously supportive of efforts to try and have a more equitable allocation of those real estate taxes among all property classes not just commercial so that if there are increases going forward that they would not be any more than they have been in the past and our hope is actually that they will be quite \u2013 the increases would be at a much lower rate than in recent past.","So we don\u2019t see that at the moment as an area of risk or unanticipated increase for the company but we\u2019ll keep our eye on it and we actively are involved in trying to make sure that the taxes for our buildings are fairly assessed and reflective of the capital we have to put into it and they can see that do occur from time to time. So I think we\u2019re okay on property taxes for now but we\u2019ll see what \u201815 brings next fiscal year.","As to the net recall that when you are comparing the gross rent on a newly signed lease we\u2019re comparing it to the escalated rent on the previous lease. So those escalated rents do reflect all the expense increase over let\u2019s say a period of a 10 year lease, that reflects 10 years of expense increases. So I think it is a proper comparative to look at new gross rents to old escalated expiring rents and look at that delta as reflective of the true real not nominal but real growth in rents, lease over lease for that particular lease. I can\u2019t necessarily extrapolate for the rest of the portfolio because you just dealing with the sample of leases expiring in any one given quarter but for those leases I think the 17% increase that we posted for this quarter is accurate in terms of where the older leases as escalated for expenses had risen to. Is that okay thank you, John.","John Guinee \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus","Great, perfect. I will get back in the queue. Thanks.","Marc Holliday","Okay, we\u2019ll speak again.","Operator","All right. Our next question comes from [Nick Urico] from UBS.","Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS","Hey its Ross Nussbaum here with Nick. Two questions first is what prompted the decision to sell 180 Maiden Lane versus going through the lease up process and monetizing it after that?","Andrew Mathias","Well it\u2019s Andrew, Ross. The short answer is the offer that we received was in our valuation too attractive to hold on to the property and go through the redevelopment because when we ran our financial analysis on the building the capital that we were going to invest and the rents that we projected receiving when we value the building somebody just frankly offered us more than that value. So we saw an opportunity to take that capital, redeploy it into a higher yielding deal on our valuation and to build Tower 46 on 46 Street and decided to pull the trigger on the sale.","Marc Holliday","Yes we\u2019ve gotten that question Ross couple of times and I think our shareholders want us to think like that. I mean that\u2019s our \u2013 our view is we redevelop a lot of property and it\u2019s sort of easier to just go with the plan, if you will and spend the money and hope you hit the market right but we are in the business of optimization. That\u2019s why we sell at all forget about why 180 and why sell at all, it\u2019s to basically optimize profits, reinvest in higher yielding deals that we see out there and then do it again and again and again.","So we are not really married to any particular deal, 180 Maiden we thought was an excellent property. I think it will lease well and I think the redevelopment plan we came up with is a smart one that will appeal to this market. With that said we saw less chance of rental uptick on the upside coming out of 180 which had we thought a $45 to $50 price point versus Tower 46 which we think has a price point that that is $90 to $100. So higher margins, we think higher opportunity for lift in a rising market but 180 is a good building, it\u2019s a good redevelopment plan and we think the buyers will execute and do well. It\u2019s just doing well unfortunately this market for us is not enough, it\u2019s doing \u2013 I think that was the, as Andrew that said beauty to the trade if you will.","Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS","Okay, I am sure you saw that NYRT is evaluating options. Do you guys have any thoughts on that one?","Marc Holliday","Nothing in particular that we would speak about, just couple of the properties we know well in that portfolio and I would say we get our interest like any other situation would, but nothing more notable then that to discuss.","Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS","Okay, I think Nick has a quick one.","Unidentified Analyst","Yeah, I just want to go back to the 2 million leasing goal you have the year. I think there was a couple of hundred thousand budgeted for 180 Maiden. So if you are saying that you still going to feel good about hitting the 2 million leading goal and on reality are you surpassing your goal for the year now?","Marc Holliday","Well, is that question to Steven Durels or the rest of us?","Steven Durels","Let me answer it, just let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves.","Marc Holliday","Let\u2019s take a vote who says we don\u2019t move the bar on 2 million feet. The show of hands around Nick is unanimous that we keep the bar 2 million feet notwithstanding the reduction of the couple of hundred thousand feet of 180 Maiden.","Steven Durels","Just like affirm it\u2019s a quarter of that.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Just and Steve you mind just providing a little update of 280 Park and Harbor [Column]. Thanks.","Steven Durels","Sure, so, 280 park we just closed a couple of small to medium size deals over at the building, one of them was a 30,000 square foot lease for part of the 14th floor with a starting rent of $120 a foot. The capital project is at this point I would say 90 plus percent complete. We are about ready to open up the mid-portion of the lobby which is \u2013 we haven\u2019t been over the building recently is really dramatic space, I think it\u2019s coming up better than any of the [inaudible] that we have shared with people. And we have a large lease that\u2019s in negotiation for about 125,000 square feet. So I think we are going to end the year very strong on that building at rents that are at or above underwrite.","At 10 East 53rd Street the redevelopment work is flying. It\u2019s really going fast. All the windows have been replaced. The building\u2019s fa\u00e7ade has been recolored, the lobby is on track to be completed close to the end to the year, maybe early next year. The tour activity has been very strong. We have got leases out on our four floors which puts us four floors ahead of expectations. I really don\u2019t think we\u2019d do any leasing into early next year because of the size of the tenants and the rents are on top of our budgeted numbers. So we are feeling like we are in a really good spot with that building. We got a tremendous feedback from the brokerage community.","Marc Holliday","In deference to those winning patiently in the queue we are going to have to go for a ruling on whether two people from the same firm aggregate to four questions. We will come back with that ruling shortly. But thank you and next question, operator.","Operator","All right. Our next question comes from Vincent Chao from Deutsche Bank.","Vincent Chao \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Hey, yeah, good afternoon. Just wondered if there is any additional color you can share with about the announcement from this morning about the Brooklyn site?","Marc Holliday","Sure, we purchased in partnership with Kushner organization and entrepreneurial Brooklyn operator called the LIVWRK which incidentally there was some confusion is not the same as We Work. This is a business that buys and renovates buildings in Brooklyn and it\u2019s a not fractional office provider. So there is no fractional office plan at the site as of now just to clarify any confusion. It is a prime site in Gowanus, which is an area we have heard from a lot of retailers we speak to, is sort of very target market for them.","So we have an enormous amount of bulk. It is a very large site and the existing zoning, we have a very interesting as of right plan and a potential upside plan if we do decide to take the site through we can a rezone. So we are going through those discussions internally now and sort of deciding what ultimately how much bulk we want to put on the site but the development there will be retail-oriented primarily and then there are interesting commercial and residential opportunities combined with community uses for the building depending on how much bulk we put on the site.","Vincent Chao \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Got you. And just on the [inaudible] side of things I mean do you have a general sense of the size of the development in terms of dollar value?","Marc Holliday","It\u2019s 280,000 square feet as of now, so you will be looking at a $150 million to $200 million development as of now.","Vincent Chao \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay, thanks. And just one question on the ULURP process you mentioned the seven months process at 1 Vanderbilt, is it just sort of radio science for now until then or is there other benchmarks we should be looking for between now and May?","Marc Holliday","Well, this is the seven month is the beginning of public process. So this project will be reviewed by the community boards, department planning, planning commission and ultimately the city council as well as other stake holders like [inaudible] I think you will see a lot of discussion and the discussion has been extremely positive to-date from all different constituencies, [inaudible], the labor unions, community and city administration, so I think you will see a lot of discussion and but it will be basically presenting more formally that which has already been presented.","Operator","All right, great. And just as a reminder folks please limit your questions to two per person. And our next question does come from Steve Sakwa from ISI Group.","Steve Sakwa \u2013 ISI Group","Hi, it\u2019s just one person, I\u2019ll just ask my two questions.","Marc Holliday","Hi.","Steve Sakwa \u2013 ISI Group","I guess for Steven Durels, could you maybe just comment a little bit about sub-market performance, kind of you are seeing the greatest demand in terms of the portfolio? Where are you seeing the best pricing power, is it kind of the Midtown South, is it Grand Central, is it the 6th Avenue Corridor or just as you kind of look around the portfolio where are you seeing the best rents?","Steven Durels","Well, a couple of things you know the Midtown South Corridor is still on fire, lots of demand but still too small to really satisfy the overall market demand. I think the rent stay higher there because more over stock of building are going through repositionings. But I am not certain there as time goes by that market is going to continue to escalate with rental growth beyond where the market kind of top outright now maybe go a little bit but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s \u2013 we are not going to go from reposition building being at $80 a foot to the average being $100 rents. I think there is a lot of Midtown rent growth that\u2019s going on right now.","We have seen good demand in the Grand Central sub markets, there was a lot of commentary at the end of last year that Grand Central was particularly slow, and there was a lot of inventory that hit the market last year on Sixth Avenue and we said at the Investor Conference a year ago that our feeling was that both those sub-markets would come back strong this year, in fact they have. Sixth Avenue has sort of returned to its historical norm as far availability and there has been a lot of deals in the Grand Central area. The renewal that we did just a couple of weeks ago extend the Schulte release for 300,000 square feet I think is a very good testimonial to the fact that tenants still want to be on the East side, they still want to be in Midtown and they are willing to pay rents that are commensurate with some of the best buildings that are out there.","So I think as an opportunity and an expectation as to where there will be more proportionate increase in rents I think it\u2019s going to be the Midtown and the East side of Midtown in particular over the next 12 to 24 months.","Steve Sakwa \u2013 ISI Group","Okay, and then I guess Marc just in terms of kind of looking for opportunities I know the market is highly competitive as you kind of look over the next year, do you think the best opportunities will be in residential, retail or office? I mean are you focusing on any particular area or do you feel there are more opportunities in one versus the other?","Marc Holliday","Well, I would say two things first, I would think going forward we\u2019ll have to look and feel very much of what we\u2019ve done this year, which was quite voluminous, we think in many cases quite opportunistic but also quite varied, high ticket retail, down to middle retail, couple of big three big office deals and a little bit of resi, but some resi in pipeline as well. So I don\u2019t know that you\u2019re going to see any heavy emphasis on one versus the other. I\u2019ll have to say generally our experience has been and probably continues to be that pound for pound if you can buy the right retail projects at, not a reasonable cost because there is like nothing reasonable but at a cost where you can make your returns with a potential to make outside returns by working the tenancy more aggressively than your pro forma that\u2019s where the largest mark-to-markets are.","So while office is great, office rents have been up for us about 15% mark-to-market over expiring leases. Retail rents you can generally measure as a 100% of more mark-to-market, when they expire for the kinds of deals with low embedded rents that we\u2019re finding. So those are probably on average the highest return deals that we\u2019re buying today but that doesn\u2019t mean the other sectors that we\u2019re focusing on aren\u2019t also high returns in themselves with debt and preferred equity being a good example of that, the portfolio originations for the quarter were in excess of 10% return on core product in New York City and that is something that we continue to have fairly high volumes originations, such that the balances at the end of the December are likely to going up above where our current balances were at the end of the third quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brendan Maiorana from Wells Fargo.","Brendan Maiorana \u2013 Well Fargo","Thanks good afternoon. There certainly been a very \u2013 even the bids for assets in the city, particularly office have accelerated through the this year, lots of foreign capital and even seems like maybe JV deals are priced as aggressively or even maybe more so in some cases then simple outlet sales which seems like a sort of fits right in the wheel house of what [inaudible] does well. So how do you guys think about maybe monetizing some additional assets, do you feel like maybe look to do more given the strong bids for prices?","Marc Holliday","In terms of fee versus leasehold?","Brendan Maiorana \u2013 Well Fargo","No just overall answer it just in terms of thinking about where \u2013 how prices have accelerated this year, do you think about monetizing more to harvest some of the gains that you have within the portfolio and then maybe realize some of the embedded growth in the stock price relative to NAV?","Marc Holliday","I think we\u2019ve had a very active year on the sales front and I think you\u2019ll see that continue in the fourth quarter. It is definitely our intention to monetize some of the value we\u2019ve created in some of our longer-term holds and a couple of our shorter term holds. You\u2019ve seen us putting some very large gains thus far this year on our sales. We still have the sale of 2 Herald closing in the fourth quarter and we intend to keep selling. We\u2019re just limited in terms of taxable gains and our goal which has been to retain as much capital as possible.","Steven Durels","Yeah there are different philosophies out there about what you should be selling into this kind of market. Our stated philosophy has been this way for many, many years has been in this kind of market the cap rates for non-core and core compress to where they\u2019re almost on top of each other. So our view is that\u2019s a bit of an arbitrage, in bad markets they gap out and cores maybe a 100 basis points or more inside of non-core but in a tight market they are on top of each other. So we like to buy core in bad markets and sell non-core in good markets.","And I think that for us we prefer to retain those core holdings, in some cases do joint ventures, to kind of optimize or maximize our equity but where we see core holdings that have still a significant amount of NOI upside whether it\u2019s mark-to-market or re-development potential we want to keep as much of that for the REIT as possible and we\u2019ll continue to hold those assets which we think have the highest ongoing earnings velocity but non-core profit has generally bought redeveloped leased and sold to act as our currency for future growth and that\u2019s nothing new that I\u2019m saying there.","That\u2019s been our ammo I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll see any different in this market. So we will accelerate sales. Those sales will typically be of non-core assets, maybe some joint venturing of some of the higher quality core assets but we\u2019ll have to sort of see how that plays out because we\u2019re looking for cap rate differentiation to justify those moves. But right now there\u2019s not as much quality differentiation we see from that.","Brendan Maiorana \u2013 Well Fargo","Okay that\u2019s great, helpful. And then just can you guys give some color on the Gem Tower in terms of timing of when you think you can stabilize the asset and then return outlook or yield outlook?","Marc Holliday","Well, I think we\u2019re pretty embolden right now by the fact that we haven\u2019t even closed on the building and we already have two offers there on space. We\u2019re expecting a third offer. The types of tenants that we\u2019re showing the building to are exactly in line with what we expected, which are financial services and law firm tenants. So I think we\u2019re expecting to do more leasing sooner than what we underwrote. We had a pretty sizable amount of downtime in our underwrite, given the fact that the building needs to be repositioned and really re-introduced to the market because it\u2019s a bit of an unknown product to the brokerage community but I think we\u2019ll probably have more on that hopefully by Investor Day to give an update as to progress made.","Unidentified Corporate Participant","Hi, this is [Isaac]. Once that leasing is done I think the anticipated stabilized yields are in the low 6% range in our total return basis. We\u2019re targeting IRR\u2019s on this deal probably in the 12% to 15% range so that\u2019s those are the expectations on this particular asset.","Brendan Maiorana \u2013 Well Fargo","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Bilerman from Citi.","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup","Great good afternoon. Steve a question for you just on the Schulte lease with the tenant having expiration 2021. I got to assume that they were out in the market place and I\u2019m just curious if you can share a little bit how aggressive sort of Westside and downtown developers are in terms of targeting tenants, in terms of what sort of incentives they are offering and the improvement packages and then conversely and keeping the tenant and signing the extensions starting 2021 can you share a little bit about how the 73.50 will compare to what the fully escalated rent is in 2021 because I think the 73.50 charge then and $60 is in the stock is the current cash rent. So just trying to understand how you thought about economics and de-risking out the future?","Steven Durels","Their rent will escalate a great deal between now and what would the expiration would have otherwise been because there are fewer pass-through on buildings operating expenses real estate taxes. So maybe it escalates another five or six bucks above the escalated rent today. As how the deal unfolded it\u2019s pretty interesting. It started with a conversation of hey one of our clients happens to be one of the partners on Hudson Yards and they really want us to move over there and we\u2019re like, great let\u2019s sit down and talk about renewal. And they went back and forth.","They looked at the market, they kicked the tires, they understood exactly the kind of deal they can make on the far West side and the partnership overwhelmingly voted to stay on the East side, and that ultimately what drove their decision and the economics were basically looking at where we saw the value of a big block of space which has a slightly different values versus smaller spaces in the overall market because the big blocks are tightening out and for a 3,000 square foot tenant we saw that as sort of high $50s maybe $60 rents today and then put on a growth factor over the next several years. We netted up some of the concessions and ended at a starting rent of 73.50 a foot with $50 in TI and no free rent and we think that\u2019s a very fair number. Obviously tenants endorsed that but I think as if you stack that rent up against the deals that are being signed around town particularly some of them on the far west side or downtown and some of the newer product for delivery in 2020 or 2021 that 992 is a very good building and the rents reflect that value.","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup","That\u2019s helpful. And then I don\u2019t know if Andrew or Marc can talk a little bit about 605 West 42nd in terms of the total construction cost and sort of the capital structure I think there is about a $540 million senior construction loan U.S. 50 and mez, I wasn\u2019t sure if there was other sources of capital outside of just pure equity and how much equity is being contributed into the project?","Unidentified Corporate Participant","Sure this is David. This was a project that the Moinian Group\u2019s owned for a long time. So when we invested they already had a couple of hundred million of equity in the deal. The construction loan is $539 million. About a 100 we took out existing land loan, there is about $430 million of hard and soft cost that are needed to complete the project. We invested an additional $50 million in the deal really to cover any overrun in those GMP on the deal. So likely our money will only even be needed for the project, goes for more security.","I think we got into the project well past foundation when they were already a couple of stories vertical. So they are probably going to top it off in the next maybe 12 or so months, so it \u2013 we\u2019re kind of well through the construction project we started and all of the equity was already invested.","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup","And your 20% option cost you what in terms of further capital if you exercise it?","Matthew Diliberto","Well we can\u2019t give you specific number at this point other than to say we\u2019ve negotiated for a kind of a present day number that escalates pursuant to a formula based on additional contributed capital and cost to a number where in the future we will have a look at kind of the final capitalization of the deal and the market at that time, and the leasing projects at that time and decide whether or not to exercise that option.","Sitting here today I would assume that option gets exercised because we think it\u2019s a great deal Joe has been a very good partner for us, it\u2019s a very good project it\u2019s an ability for us to get a bigger footprint in midtown multifamily. With that said we really won\u2019t cross that bridge for some time. So there is really no decisions to make at the moment.","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup","Thank you.","Operator","Okay our next question comes from [Jed Regan from Green Street Advisors].","Unidentified Analyst","Hi guys. So you got the good pricing on 180 Maiden, in fact you were able to kind of shift your redevelopment focus there to another project. Just wondering if that good execution kind of makes you reconsider the game plan for a project like 10 East 53rd and that sort of put a quick flip on the table for that asset?","Marc Holliday","No, I think it\u2019s a bit of an apples and orange comparison. The profile tenants that was going to 180, the rents that the market would support, the amount of capital had to be invested are two different animals. 10 East is a very high project quite essential boot seek building going to high priced tenants who are in a sub market where there is limited supply. So it\u2019s a different repositioning exercise with an entirely different kind of redevelopment plan. And if we could find three more 10 East 53rd Street I think we would be all over it\u2019s a great, great opportunity.","Andrew Mathias","It\u2019s Andrew Joe I would just add [Inaudible] flip offers for 10 East 53rd which we have rejected. Again we see the returns on that project significantly exceeding the offers we received.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay that makes sense. And also you guys and some of your competitors getting more interested in the outer boroughs and just wondering if you could see a Brooklyn or Queens becoming a material portion of your portfolio overtime or you think it\u2019s going to continue to be just kind of smaller one-offs at this point?","Marc Holliday","Well I think with $28 million feet Manhattan, I don\u2019t know that was much of anything we could do that will become a material portion of the portfolio overtime but I guess the question of whether we are going to expand our footprint in other markets, outer boroughs Brooklyn in particularly Andrew could address that.","Andrew Mathias","Yes I mean look we\u2019ve had terrific success with our residential project in Williamsburg and our office building at 16 Court. So based on those successes we are definitely actively looking in those markets for additional opportunities. The scale of the deal size is obviously significantly smaller than Manhattan. So both by dollar volume and by square footage as Marc points out I don\u2019t think we are never going to get a critical mass say the structure finance program in Manhattan but we are definitely actively in those markets looking for additional opportunities.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, thanks guys.","Marc Holliday","We have one, two, three, four more, five more. So we\u2019ll take five more questions it looks like and try and end at around 3 O\u2019clock because I know a lot of people on the call have a lot other calls they got to jump on to. So we try and finish up in the next 10-15 minutes with these next five calls.","Operator","Okay. And our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb from Sandler O\u2019Neill.","Alexander Goldfarb \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill","Great, thank you. Two questions. The first question is, on 1 Vanderbilt, can you just comment on the $210 million of infrastructure that\u2019s being discussed that you guys would fund can you discuss how this impacts the yield? Just because obviously you guys don\u2019t get the tax incentives that the far West Side gets, so just curious how this affects the yield.","Matthew Diliberto","No that\u2019s something we haven\u2019t discussed yet and probably won\u2019t be getting to that level of detail until after we know we have the approvals at the end of this ULURP process because it will be premature without the approvals, we don\u2019t go forward with deal. So I think step one is obtaining the approval, step two is we will talk about capitalization of project and then three will be far enough along we will have greater visibility into the rents and the projected rents that we will be able to pass along some return data. But I can tell you that the scope of the MTA project is something we\u2019ve been working on for quite some time and the cost have been included in the overall budget.","So it\u2019s not something that adding to or taking away from our development returns it\u2019s part of the project it\u2019s known and it is there is a lot of complexity to the project a lot of cost and as you know there is no subsidy. So we have to do this completely right but I would say to-date we feel like we have a great design it\u2019s the right kind of transit oriented development sitting right next Grand Central station right at its doorstep essentially. So we are very happy with the project we\u2019re going to take it incrementally in terms of the kinds of questions you were asking.","Alexander Goldfarb \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill","Okay. And then the second question is, on the Gowanus deal, between the three partners, you guys obviously bring a lot of experience and financial. Kushner has a lot of real estate experience obviously. The LIVWRK guys, they\u2019ve done the Domino Sugar site and the Mercedes so they understand that challenges of it. Can you just help us understand how the three of you guys are going to work together? Is there one driving partner or is it all three working together, or each entity has a specific focus and capital contribution?","Marc Holliday","I think it\u2019s going to be a collaborative between the three I mean I think we are the dominant equity player given relative scale but in terms of day to day Rob Schiffer spearheads it from the SL Green side. And he is working closely with Jared and Asher on the development plan and you know we are going to approach it collaboratively.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tayo Okusanya from Jeffries.","Tayo Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies & Company","Yes, good afternoon. Just some news hitting the rides recently about JP Morgan considering moving to Manhattan West in the next few years. Just wondering you know if you can kind of give us any color on that and what that could potentially mean for kind of classic Central Midtown if that happens?","Marc Holliday","Well I don\u2019t think we have any color then we could share with you on the JP Morgan\u2019s intentions or they are not attendants of our about us or what ultimately happens there I mean Tayo every every significant tenant of size over the past three-four years has checked the tires on Midtown and Manhattan West, Downtown we went through that with 5 common city group as you may recall and you know time and time again I think it\u2019s been shown that if you have the right building in the right location retained tenants we have done that very successfully so I don\u2019t know what JPMorgan\u2019s intentions are going to be or not going to you know what we have been what we have heard that is that if they were to pull out and relocate that\u2019s something where the vacancy impact of that would not be felt until early to middle of 2020 it\u2019s possible is 2025.","Tayo Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies & Company","Okay.","Marc Holliday","For the full impact of their vacancy. So you are talking very long-term. I mean I am really focused on four million square feet or more of net absorption over the next two to three years or so maybe we will [inaudible] 12 million square feet of demand over the next two to three years that hopefully is going to focused right in our real house and will always be you know sort of watching decisions and preferences about where they want to be but you have to assume by necessity if New York City is creating a 100,000 private sector jobs a year the city\u2019s inventory will have to grow. We don\u2019t want to lose tenants.","So the question is going to be over the next five or ten years where can that growth can occur and then clearly each Midtown which is being considered to come back on the board to put to allow for more development in and around Grand Central as well as having options on the west side makes a lot of sense and we will see how that plays out. But I think you should assume any big tenant of a couple of square million feet or more going to looking at very option in the city and sometimes outside the city.","Tayo Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies & Company","That\u2019s very helpful color. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jordan Saddler from Keybanc Markets.","Jordan Saddler \u2013 Keybanc Markets","Thanks. I just wanted to bring it back to office fundamentals at Manhattan real quick. Marc I mean you characterized this is recovery that has been taking place over the last four years and I can relate to that, I guess but the 15 plus percent mark-to-market year-to-date feels significantly better than kind of what we were led to believe might happen last December. So it feels kind of like it\u2019s surprise to the upside and I am just I am curious on thoughts in terms of how things are shaping up as we look forward or things just continuing to get better in our rent headed significant higher?","Marc Holliday","No, I think our contention has been since the end of last year, yes. There was \u2013 we saw one cycle of growth from 2010 to 2012 and then we kind of saw the second cycle \u2013 of and that was almost getting back to even let\u2019s say you are getting close to even and then there is this second cycle of growth which I think you saw at the beginning of this year and we think will take rent to new heights you know next year and I don\u2019t think there has an normally given that this growth has been steady for the last years, but you are seeing the mark-to-market now, because for the first several years you were kind of recouping losses and filling vacancy, remember office vacancy got as high 13%-14% now it\u2019s down around 10%.","So a part of that growth was filling space and couldn\u2019t really drive rent but when you start to get to rent 10% and clearly at 9% at the low then you will see that reflected in rent which are appropriate. I mean there has been expenses increase there has been cost of construction increase there has been valuation increase. So I mean the fact that rents are finally catching up if you will in my mind is really nothing more than that, a catch-up to get back to normalized and I think you will see that this year and next and because we have some low embedded rents in our portfolio that is going equate to mark-to-market but on the demand side I don\u2019t think we have seen a large year-to-year variation. You are just seeing the effect of inventory getting to a point where the next effective rents can start to be like\u2026","Jordan Saddler \u2013 Keybanc Markets","And as we look forward into next year you think we\u2019ll cross the threshold back toward sort of more of the landlord dominant market sort of sub 9% vacancy?","Marc Holliday","I don\u2019t know about sub 9% but that will be a big move but I would say it\u2019s sub 10% and that will be a healthy \u2013 I mean we are not looking for extraordinary rental moves. People are underwriting that because remember we lend to a lot of these folks and we see there is a lot of people have some pretty lofty growth projections in their numbers, we try to be a little bit more restrained that. I think it\u2019s best overall for the city to have stead growth I suppose to spiking growth and that\u2019s what we have experience to-date. Hopefully that steady growth continues into \u201815, that is what we see, for the reasons some which I had communicated earlier and we are on track with that but if that changes I think we are the leading indicators to see when that change occurs and if so communicate that to shareholders. But at the moment 2015 is shaping up to be what we think is one of the better years.","Jordan Saddler \u2013 Keybanc Markets","As a quick follow-up does the structure finance book is that exclusively focused on New York still these days or would you look to the outer boroughs or otherwise to sort of maintain the origination at these yields?","Marc Holliday","And we do consider that as part of the New York, for the record.","Jordan Saddler \u2013 Keybanc Markets","[inaudible] this in New York.","Marc Holliday","We are sympathetic to all boroughs but I would say if the [inaudible] is billion well, no I think we own a very small retail piece of property in queens you know that will worth a couple of million bucks but so I would say the building outstanding the vast majority is Manhattan. Yeah we probably have some positions, yeah a couple of positions spoken.","Jordan Saddler \u2013 Keybanc Markets","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Great. Our next question comes from Brad Burke from Goldman Sachs.","Brad Burke \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Hey guys, just one question follow-up on structured finance. The investments that you made or yielding over 10% which is you noted better than the 8.5% you guided this to and this is not an environment where we are seeing the interest rates compress, we are seeing credit spreads compress so I am just hoping you give us some color how you are still able to get these really strong yields and whether we should expect it to stay near these levels on the new originations you are making going forward?","Marc Holliday","I think the quarter was a skewed a little bit because the 605 was 42nd Street investment is an extraordinary yield and yield that was really reflective of us assembling that entire capital stack for the borrower. We continue to take advantage of tightening debt markets on the senior side to level up our yields on the subordinate paper and that\u2019s how we have been able to beat our estimates and our expectations a bit but overall the market has tightened and continues to tighten and we still think average of 8.5 going forward is reasonable in the right expectation.","Brad Burke \u2013 Goldman Sachs","I appreciate it, thank you.","Marc Holliday","Thanks. Okay, we have time for one last question operator.","Operator","Right. Our next question comes from Vance Edelson from Morgan Stanley.","Vance Edelson \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Terrific, thanks I\u2019m under the wire, could you just follow just following-up on the earlier question strength by sub-market could you give us some feel for the variability around the pricing on the 42 office leases signed at Manhattan, the 17% overall mark-to-market on replacement where they notably lower markets in some sub-markets maybe south of 10% being offset by even greater strength, maybe north of 20% or 25% in other or is it generally a tighter range than that throughout Manhattan.","Marc Holliday","It\u2019s because the mark-to-market is really compared against the rents of the prior leases, escalated rents, I don\u2019t think we can really comment as to whether it\u2019s driven by sub market per se, just happens to be what you are dealing with for the last lease coming off. It\u2019s not particularly good as an indicator of the strength of any of the overall sub markets.","I can tell you that my sense is where we have the greatest rent appreciation and no surprises where the rents have been beaten down the farthest, so Grand Central we\u2019ve seen the rents are really good indicator of that, is the Graybar Building. Graybar Building has now got availability of 1% for this building. This building has got 300 tenants, with tenants that are leasing from 300 square feet to 300,000 square feet and the rents that we are citing today are the deals that are in the pipeline, I would say almost typically are $58, $59 starting rents as compared to a year and a half, two years ago, where they would have been $38 to $40 dollars. So as a percentage increase Grand Central beaten down, Graybar being a good barometer and there are some hard [inaudible] to where we have seen, we have experienced rent appreciation.","Vance Edelson \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. And then just one last one on the structured finance. Could you comment on the level of new debt and preferred equity investments brought on board, just a little bit lower this quarter than the past two anything driving that or is just naturally lump and do you think it could pick up going forward?","Marc Holliday","I think it\u2019s naturally lumpy and I think we\u2019re probably ahead of where we projected to be at the end of last year. It\u2019s just the nature of other people closing those deals kind of makes is lumpy. We have a robust pipeline and we are adaptable.","Vance Edelson \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Great thanks.","Operator","All right, that\u2019s all the time we have.","Marc Holliday","Thank you everyone and I guess we will \u2013 we look forward to seeing hopefully all of you in little over a month\u2019s time at the investor conference. Thank you.","Operator","Great, that concludes today\u2019s conference, you can disconnect and have a great day."],"19657":["SL Green Realty Corp (NYSE:SLG) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 17, 2019  2:00 PM ET","Company Participants","Marc Holliday - Chairman and CEO","Andrew Mathias - President","Matthew DiLiberto - CFO","Steven Durels - EVP and Director, Leasing and Real Property","Conference Call Participants","Emmanuel Korchman - Citi","Michael Lewis - SunTrust","Piljung Kim - BMO Capital Markets","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill","Derek Johnston - Deutsche Bank","Stephen Sakwa - Evercore ISI","Blaine Heck - Wells Fargo","James Feldman - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Nicholas Yulico - Scotiabank","Vikram Malhotra - Morgan Stanley","Anthony Paolone - JPMorgan","Operator","Thank you everybody for joining us, and welcome to SL Green Realty Corp.'s Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Results Conference Call.

I will now turn the call over to Marc Holliday. Please go ahead, Marc.","Marc Holliday","Okay. Thank you. Good afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining our call today. The third quarter ended up being very much in line with our expectations and puts us on a very good glide path to meet many of our full-year goals and objectives. We've made great headway on a number of strategic fronts, and we believe as the company continues to shrink, simplify, develop, and lease that shareholders will benefit from these actions that are focusing all of our resources on creating significant value within the remaining portfolio.","It appears based on stock performance that this value creation is neither appreciated nor understood by the public markets, but time and time again, through sale of non-core and mature assets, we are realizing prices and profits that routinely and dramatically outpace the values implied by our stock price.","The recent sale of The News Building at 220 East 42nd Street for $815 million is another such example of this, having generated substantial gains over an 18-year hold period. In fact, the unlevered IRR was 11% compounded over that period of time, a true champion of investments.","This sale comes on top of the $9.1 billion gross asset value of other product we have sold just since 2016, which has generated $3.4 billion of net proceeds to the company and we have no intention of stopping there. We are already at work on lining up additional sales of assets that don't meet our long-term plan and we will provide more detail on these planned dispositions at our upcoming December Investor Meeting.","These assets will largely be in the $500 million and under range to take advantage of the still active and healthy market for leverage-able Midtown assets that can be acquired for an equity check size of $250 million or less.","We will also expand our joint venture investments in premier portfolio assets that we intend to hold or develop, like the initiative we just launched to identify capital partner for our exciting new development project at One Madison Avenue and more on that.","One Madison is now 100% complete on design development drawings and we expect to have a complete biddable package of CDs by April and be in full-blown redevelopment by sometime middle of 2020.","Tenant response to this early stage project has been impressive, and we are quite confident that we're building the right product in the right market at a rental price point that appeals to a wide variety of users.","On the leasing front, we are well ahead of schedule on leasing volume and projected mark-to-market, which is closing our FFO to the trending toward the high side of our estimated range, notwithstanding aggressive dispositions and intended reductions in debt and preferred equity portfolio, both dilutive activities as offset in part by debt reduction and stock buyback. With another 71,000 square feet of Manhattan office space leased so far by us in our portfolio in October, we now stand at 1.25 million square feet leased for 2019.","Now, add another 260,000 square feet of leases that are out for signature with signings expected imminently, plus an additional 1.4 million square feet of leasing pipeline on top of that and you have the makings of what we hope will be a very big year-end for this company.","We expect to add nearly 100 basis points of occupancy between now and year-end, bringing us to our original goal for the year and at 22% mark-to-market on our Manhattan leases, which is where we are currently, we are far ahead of our goal and expect to improve on that by year-end.","A particular note, the current pipeline of leases that stands at about 1.65 million square feet is the highest we've ever experienced with no single lease in the pipeline exceeding 335,000 square feet, which is a testament to the broad underlying strength of demand from tenants across all sectors. And that completely excludes all ongoing discussions we are having at One Madison.","None of that is in that stated pipeline. So leasing activity Manhattan-wide is robust and it's within that environment that we have been achieving our successes this year and the market as a whole is trending towards last year's record-setting totals fueled by the 10th consecutive year of private sector and office using job growth in New York City.","Job growth is being driven, of course, by technology and healthcare, with lesser gains, but gains nonetheless in finance and business services. There has been nearly 23 million square feet of leasing through Q3 and expectations are for the full year total to again eclipse 30 million square feet in Manhattan.","Large block in high rent demand has been concentrated around new construction projects and One Vanderbilt has been a big beneficiary of this trend. This transformational project at crossroads of Midtown is now 61% leased after the recent signing of an additional 4 floor to the Carlyle Group, representing Carlyle's second expansion of their -- since their original lease, bringing their total presence in the building to approximately 165,000 square feet or thereabouts.","Of course, there continues to be a number of ongoing and advanced negotiations for additional space, and we feel comfortable that we're on track to meet our goal for the year and more importantly vastly exceed our original underwriting for this project that we first unveiled in 2015.","We topped out the steel at One Vanderbilt at 1,401 feet on September 18th, just almost one month ago, and we broadcast the images of local 40 ironworkers standing on top of the building's 157-foot spire in celebration of this amazing, amazing accomplishment. The ribbon-cutting is still scheduled for August 4, 2020, a full three months ahead of our original schedule.","So, with that, in the words of Andrew Mathias, reports of New York's demise are greatly exaggerated, and we -- if you want to hear more and we hope you do, please join us at our investor conference on December 9th where we'll unveil our view of 2020 and provide an update on our very, we think, thoughtful and executable strategic plan.","With that, I'd like to open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","And our first question is from Manny Korchman from Citi. Your line is now open.","Emmanuel Korchman","Hey guys, good afternoon. Marc, you mentioned the -- the sweet spot for deals being sort of that $250 million equity check, deals under $500 million. Are you seeing any other sort of changes in the market other than the size and has the buyer pooled at all change in either those assets or larger ones?","Marc Holliday","Let's -- I'll start-off; Andrew will give you some thoughts and commentary about the market. The market has become I think more domestic in nature, so -- and the amount of fundraising going on in the real estate sector right now with private funds is extraordinary and we see no dearth of capital for many of the different classes or food groups or projects we can offer.","I think development seems to be the most interesting for a lot of people. But also, in order or priority value plus, a value, a core plus and core, different buyers reach one, but a very high proportion of domestic investors flushed with capital, but all -- I don't want to say constrained, but all looking for check sizes that probably top out at about $250 million.","Above that, there are still buyers, it just -- it's thinner probably than it was a year or two ago. And I think in large part that's just directly attributable to the absence of the Chinese buyer who is not really participating in the market at this time, although other groups are filling in that void and the market still continues to be firm and aided by declining interest rates. So, these are additional thoughts on depth of market.","Andrew Mathias","Yes, I would agree. I think the debt markets are very, very aggressive right now and there's a lot of foreign capital coming into the market via the debt as opposed to via the equity. They seem to be more comfortable playing in that seat these days. But that's fueling transactions like 711 Fifth Avenue where that equity check, even though that's a large deal size, is still only going to be around $250 million level with a very high level of financing. ","Emmanuel Korchman","Got it. Thanks. And then in terms of your comments on the tech companies being obviously the leading demand source of the city right now, how does that play into your portfolio and is that reason you're looking more on the left side?","Marc Holliday","Yes, I just want to -- I didn't say it was a leading source. It's where a lot of the growth is coming from. By far, the market is still dominated by financial services. Tech is taking a -- is growing off of a very small base. So, every addition to tech is very meaningful. But the 30 million square feet that's referenced, the majority of that demand or -- 23 million current, 30 million projected for full year is certainly not tech. I think the basic business services, finance, healthcare, certainly, technology, media, all form part of it. But I just want to be careful, it's not the majority of that leasing is not technology. Steve?","Steven Durels","Well, I mean the big news is that technology is a growing percentage of the tenant demand. Financial services, to Marc's point, have been the leader of what's leased -- of the industries that have leased space, particularly in Midtown year-to-date, followed by TAMI broadly. I think within TAMI and tech specifically, what's really changed, and you've heard us say this in the past, is in this current cycle, it's the story of the large, well-established profitable mainline tech companies. So, it's not the start-up, young companies without a bottom-line.","And we think it's an industry that's going. It's going to continue to grow, and our portfolio has some well-suited buildings to be receivers for that industry: One Madison Avenue, in particular, 460 West 34th Street, our newest acquisition on 50th Street, all are ideal buildings for that kind of profile tenant.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Lewis from SunTrust. Your line is now open.","Michael Lewis","Great. Thank you. Just based on your in-place leases and what you think the current asking rents are, it looks like you're looking at some rent roll downs in 4Q and then in next year as well. I was just wondering if that's kind of a broad-based thing or is there are a few large roll downs that maybe you can point us to?","Matthew DiLiberto","It's Matt, Mike. I think there's a mix in there. You're probably going to have scheduling, includes all storage, retail, office, everything in there, I'd say there's nothing -- no one driver in there, and we've pretty steadily beat the numbers that we put out there as evidenced by the mark-to-market we've achieved to date and what we see for the balance of this year and into next.","So, there's nothing -- when you're rolling off of older vintage leases that have escalation for 10 years, your benchmark is a high number. But we are by and large still seeing positive mark-to-market in the portfolio.","Michael Lewis","Okay, great. And then for my second question, I just wanted to ask how you evaluate and maybe we should evaluate the effectiveness of the stock repurchase program. The company has a long history of strong NAV growth, but the NAV -- the consensus NAV right now is the lowest it's been in a few years and the stock price you already talked about, so I'm just curious, how do we -- how can we know and look at this and how do you look at it and know that this has been a good use of capital?","Marc Holliday","We look at it solely as an investment alternative. I mean that's -- and when we line up the investments, almost every time, the stock repurchase wins out because we buy more interest in a portfolio that gets better and better as we shed some of the non-core assets and we're buying it at a discount to private market value and our own internal values. For assets that we own, control, operate and is really very little in the way of risk of unknown or there's really nothing in the way of risk of unknown.","So, we look at the both absolute return and risk-adjusted as by far the best place to park our money, and we do believe that the program has been a complete success that we've been able to continue to make significant gains in our embedded NAV in a market that probably in the past year values topped out a year ago, maybe cap rates are probably, what, 25 to 50 basis points, that would have an enormous effect on value to your point about, hey, the NAVs are dropping.","Well, if cap rates are gapping out, 25, 50 basis points, you would expect to see that, obviously. But the point is, we did much, much more mitigation of that, almost eliminated all of that down flow risk because of the stock buyback program. And the gains on the program I think will be fully appreciated and realized when we stabilize the eight development assets we now have in portfolio. There's just an enormous pipeline of assets that we buy into every time we buy our stock at essentially below cost.","And when we achieve, stabilize value, and we impose that on an ever-decreasing shareholder base, I think the results will be very powerful. At that point, whether we get credit for it or not now in the public markets we can't entirely control, but we certainly see the benefits on paper of an investment program that yields the highest returns.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from John Kim from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Piljung Kim","Thank you. I was wondering if you could provide some more color on the announced acquisition this morning as far as you expected investment yield post CapEx? And also is this part of strategy to make Hell's Kitchen along with Worldwide Plaza, like, more attractive to tenants going forward.","Marc Holliday","Well, on the first question, I think we'll unveil some of those economics in December. We haven't closed on the exit yet, so I'd like to -- we're just in contract.","Andrew Mathias","General development plan.","Marc Holliday","We're -- the period between contract closure, the day after we close, we'll put our development team together. We're going to get live numbers. We've done the underwriting and we know the kinds of returns under different scenarios we think are achievable. The asset is in an opportunity zone. We will likely use it as a receiver. There's a lot of different benefits we get from this asset in different ways we think we can make outsized returns here, returns that would be on par with stock buyback, as I just mentioned.","But with that said, I don't think we're prepared on this call to go through any detail on that other than to say, we're in contract and give you a little information about what it is. So Steve you can respond to the target market.","Steven Durels","Well, this is a prewar building. It's timber construction, timber and brick. So, it's got the creative cool factor that everybody searches for in today's world; hardwood floors, wood beams, oversized windows, kind of an industrial vibe to it. And we'll celebrate that as part of our redevelopment and repositioning of the building. It's been owner-occupied for a good number of years at this point.","So, it's not a product that's familiar to the brokerage community and therefore step one will be introducing the building to the brokerage community, educating them about the opportunity. It's an ideal building that could go multi-tenant, could just as easily have one big tenant take down the space that we've got. And it's got a few roof setbacks to do great outdoors space as well.","So, we're excited about it and we've got little bit of air rights to play with that, if we find somebody that wants to take advantage of that, we can offer that up as part of the menu choice as well.","Piljung Kim","And my second is on the observation deck. I think your last presentation assumed 1.8 million visitors annually in a $39 ticket price and I'm wondering if any of those major assumptions have changed.","Marc Holliday","Not materially. I mean we have different scenarios, all which go up from there in terms of viewership, not in terms of ticket price. So, I'd say one-eight is the underwritten floor, if you will. That would be operating far less than full capacity where most of these, if not all of these objects, operate. So we'll hopefully eclipse those numbers, but are -- the underwriting in what we've shown publicly publically, generally and in December have been at those metrics.","Piljung Kim","Is that something that you'll provide more update on at your Investor Day?","Marc Holliday","Not much. I think Investor Day we're going to focus not exclusively but primarily on the 8 development projects that we -- that I mentioned at the outset to give more color on those and really to convey the enormous earnings and profit of those properties upon completion, some of which are as early as 2021 and as late as 2023 and 2024.","Piljung Kim","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Alexander Goldfarb from Sandler O'Neill. Your line is now open.","Alexander Goldfarb","Hey good afternoon. Two questions. First, for Steve. Steve, can you just comment a little bit on your sense of the market, sort of post-WeWork, from brokerage X, looks like last year, the co-working were big leasing driver last year and this year they dialed back, but obviously with the failed IPO, WeWork has pulled back more.","So, one, are you seeing an absolute impact in the leasing volume overall with WeWork pulling back in the city. And then, two, your sense of something happened to them, do you think that landlords or other operators would step in or you think that some of those tenants may not lease their space if they weren't leasing in a WeWork building?","Steven Durels","I think a couple of things to help put it in perspective. Co-working, generally speaking, is only -- is less than 3.5% of the overall Manhattan market. And when you look sort of the Midtown submarket, where we have the bulk of our portfolio, it's only 1.5% exposure to WeWork. So, what you've seen over in the co-working industry over the last couple of years, including with WeWork, they've migrated away from true co-working, and it's been more of a focus on the enterprise model.","So, when you think of Industrious and Knotel and WeWork's focus for the past couple of years on the enterprise model, what that means, that's leasing large blocks of space to companies that have 1,000 employees or more.","So, if WeWork were to fail, which we don't believe they're going to, but if they were to fail, the enterprise tenants are easily converted over to a direct tenancy with the landlord. Take our exposure to WeWork in particular, like at 2 Herald Square where 100% of that space is occupied and leased to Amazon. So, if there were no WeWork, Amazon would simply be our tenant, they step into that lease next day, there would be interruption of services and no break in our income.","So, I think co-working, generally speaking, with the enterprise model helps sort of stabilize the landlord's exposure to the industry, and I think we're going to see a little bit of pull back from that industry as they sort of find their way going forward. But you've seen other drivers in the market to take up the slack with the big tech tenants, in particular.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. And then the second question is on the DPE book. You guys are starting to pull it back as you guys have indicated over the course of the year, but it's also been incredible source of not only gains but also opportunities like the 712 Madison or 2 Herald or 3 Columbus, et cetera.","So, as you guys reduce the DPE book, is there not a concern but sort of a risk that maybe a lot of the good farther that you guys have gotten out of it, you may not get out of it going forward or there's enough in that DPE book where you can still get the sort of the successful deals versus just the generic refinancing deals that get paid off in normal course.","Andrew Mathias","Well, I think the intention is definitely to stay active in the DPE market. It may take the form of more syndications where we're selling larger pieces of positions but retaining toehold positions. I don't -- I think we always put a high value on that aspect of the program and the ability to owners' opportunities through the program, so we definitely intend to continue without a pace.","And if anything, as you said, we'll shift away from more of just the bread-and-butter, income-producing opportunities and try to shift towards assets that have more potential for ultimately making a deal with ownership or some equity upside, et cetera.","Operator","Thank you.","Matthew DiLiberto","I would add to that operator. DPE is a very important part of this program. Whether the balance is $2.3 billion or $2.0 billion or $1.7 billion, it's still by market standards probably the largest position of subordinate debt interest of any holder in New York City. So, it's a big program. And we've got a lot of relationships to a lot of positions.","Modulating that balance up and down is something we've always done in times -- sometimes market response. In this case, it's a source of liquidity for us for stock buyback and debt reduction. So, it's -- there's no hard and fast rule here, but at the moment it's trending down, which is planned and in 2020 we'll have a new plan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Derek Johnston from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Derek Johnston","Thank you. Hi everyone. So, I've been getting a lot of client questions regarding higher leverage levels. So, I'd like to get your take on how you look at leverage and how are you planning on balancing buybacks and debt repayment going forward, given the elevated leverage levels right now.","Andrew Mathias","Well, I mean, again, in every presentation, we don't believe our leverage levels are elevated. I think there's -- that's a popular misconception, but if you look at things by LTV, we're actually under-levered, and we feel we're very reasonably levered on a debt-to-EBITDA basis.","So, we don't believe our leverage levels are elevated, and we've kept within the guidance we issued at the beginning of the year, expect to end the year within those bands for -- where we laid out the share buyback program is going to take us. So, Matt, I don't know if you have anything to add?","Matthew DiLiberto","Yes, I think I agree with Andrew. The program -- the share buyback program was predicated on leverage neutrality, it has been throughout. That is our view going forward as well. And on an LTV basis, to Andrew's point, we are prudently if not unlevered.","Derek Johnston","Okay, great. And then just switching gears to One Vandy. Hopefully, Mr. Durels is in the room. How are things going with the top floors and leasing discussions progressing? I don't know if there are any executed leases on the top floors that you would share, but do you see them coming in higher or lower than you underwrote, and do we expect greater than $200 per square foot at the levels? Thank you.","Steven Durels","Sure. I'll remind you that we've already signed one lease on penthouse floors with McDermott Will & Emery, which is one of our early leases in the building, and the rent was in line with our underwrite for that part of the building. We're trading paper with tenants as we speak today and are hopeful that we'll have some good news to report in the not too distant future on some signed leases in that part of the building.","So, as we generally expected, when we started the leasing exercise at One Vanderbilt, we knew that the building would lease on the bottom-up partly because that's where the larger tenants who make their decisions further out in time would focus and the smaller tenants, because they're building tapers in its form, to get to the smaller floor place when you get the top of house, those tenants who make their decisions closer to their current lease expirations, they would be the last -- those floors would to the last to lease.","And that's what we're experience -- but we expected is what we're experiencing and we're completely confident that the rents that we've signed to date, the deals we're renegotiating and the balance of the building will lease up in line with plan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Stephen Sakwa","Thanks. Marc, I guess I just want to try and follow up on the buyback program. I mean -- I realize you'll give a little bit more detail at the Investor Day, but to-date, you've been able to tax efficiently sell a lot of assets and I'm just wondering how deep that pool is. My understanding was that the tax efficiency pool was sort of shrinking and I didn't know if that meant you had to use the DPE book to kind of effectuate more buybacks. So, is there any color you can sort of share with us on that.","Marc Holliday","Well, look I don't -- we'll see what we go through and don't go through in December. I mean every deal has unique structure and tax planning optimization model, and it's very hard to generalize. I'm not, like, trying to avoid the question. I'm just -- like, every deal is different and every deal a solution is different to maximize after tax and the cash flow proceeds. We've done a great job of that.","I think if we saw an end to it, as you were, and I think you'd hear that from us, but that's not what you hear from us, if anything, I think what you'll hear in December is we want to go further. We are fully committed to this program. And we believe it's a program that's working as it's -- as we mapped it out in all the stock price, which unfortunately is the thing we control the least.","But we like where we're headed, and we think we have the field to do more partially from asset sales and partially as was always intended from DPE. But the downdraft in DPE that you've seen, one, is a little bit more just sort of cyclical timing, two, we're a little pickier right now about the kind of deals we're doing, and we're not toughening up our standards, but we're certainly not relaxing standards, like some other lenders might be.","And I think we've done just an incredible job over the 21 years in this company of creating what I call best-in-class track record with respect to New York City, mezz, preferred, deal on mortgage rates of return and loss history.","So, I wouldn't link those two things together, but yes, DPE is a source for buyback, but we see continued ability to sell assets and sell big assets and manage the tax situation in ways where we'll be able to continue to do buyback with most, if not all the proceeds.","And -- but I wouldn't expect a full presentation of that in December because I -- it's just not something that I think it is in the interest of the company and our shareholders for us to do other than to let you know that we're doing it and we feel we can go deeper.","Stephen Sakwa","Right. But you don't feel like it would require a lot of 1031 exchanges in order to tax shelter gains, which typically if you've got big gains, you've got to pay them out or--","Marc Holliday","Yes. No, it wouldn't require that. I mean we're doing a little bit of that it just so happens on with -- we're doing 1010 Washington, but that's just because for those two deals, they married up in a way that works, so we're doing it. But we haven't really done much in the way 1030 one I don't think in the past year or two. And we might do more 1031s going forward, but not -- it's not linked to the buyback program, is all I'm trying to say.","We'll do 1030 ones where they make sense, and we're going to sell assets where we can and use our DPE to buy back stock we can, and we think we have a way to go. If we ever ran into a situation where we had a gain and we had to do a special dividend, we are 100% comfortable with that.","We just haven't been in that position. Will we be there or not with The News Building, that's something I guess Matt will give further guidance on in December or next year, beginning of next year, when we close. If we do, we do and -- but we think we have strategies where we won't have to or won't have to do very big ones. So, I would just -- I can't generalize it, I would just say, let's take it as it goes.","Stephen Sakwa","Okay. And then second, I know that you've got a large lease with Ralph Lauren coming up at the end of the year and you've got a building there with a ground lease that's sort of coming up for reset, is there any color you can just sort of provide as it relates to the leasing of that space or how we should be thinking about kind of the burn off of that lease and kind of the redevelopment and the capitalization of that building moving forward?","Marc Holliday","Well, the Polo lease was in place for about 15 years, and the deal for us has been very, very profitable. We have taken out all our lower bases and then some from the original purchase. So, at this point we're in a profit participation really with no downside, at least with the original capital investment and now we're looking to maximize the next--","Andrew Mathias","Building has got positive NOI without Polo.","Marc Holliday","Yes, it's got positive NOI without Polo and we're still making that on basically no basis. And now it's our job to figure out how to create a new 15-year asset out of that, which we would typically do with a fairly middle-of-the-road redevelopment program for an asset that's in a great location and we can deliver it at a very competitive price point, but we will likely wait until the rent re-val before committing any substantial sums of new capital, so we know exactly what the economic returns look like to us.","Once that's known and where -- we're preparing our 2020 guidance without leasing of that space, and we feel we're in a very good place without it if we are to lease it in 2020, that'll be upside, but that's not the plan right now. But when I say that, Steve is out there showing the building or showing that space, the space always shows better when there's no tenant there. Right now Polo is still operating. I think they maybe even are extending their time later.","Steven Durels","A little for a couple of months on the [Indiscernible] space.","Marc Holliday","Yes. So, I mean let's first get the space, which we right now it's fully leased building and it's a high cash flowing building. We will get it back. We will develop a redeveloping plan, we will take it through the rent revaluation. We think we're in a good position there given how that works and given the state of the market and then be in a position to share with you specifics as to tie your lease up and the capital and NOI creation, but it's all -- we look at it all as upside to our baseline at this point.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]","Our next question is from Blaine Heck from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Blaine Heck","Thanks. Good afternoon. Steve, can you talk a little bit about CapEx trends out there? It looks like your TI per foot in concession on fine deals were just a little higher this quarter, but we've heard from other sources that concessions may be leveling off in the market. Can you just talk about what you're seeing on the ground at this point?","Steven Durels","Well, I've been saying that concessions have leveled off since the second half of last year. Our numbers fluctuate depending on how much of the leasing that we do at any one point in time is our new leases for raw space versus renewals versus installations that may be leased by new tenants that have a salvage value to it.","So, it's -- but to do an apples-to-apples comparisons for long-term lease on raw space, concessions have generally been around $100 a foot in TI, sometimes a little heavier on the higher price point rents, sometimes a little lower on some of the more commodity buildings, but when you blend that together with renewals and retrofits, that's what pulls that weighted average down.","But broadly speaking, I think concessions have been leveled for quite a while, and certainly the free rent has definitely leveled off more than a year ago.","Blaine Heck","All right, that's helpful. And I guess related to that, given the current supply\/demand dynamics you guys are seeing in the market, you think you can give us a bit of thoughts on expected net effective market rent growth or decline in Manhattan over the next 12 months and maybe which submarkets you think are poised to outperform or underperform at that average?","Marc Holliday","Blaine, I think that's a little bit of commentary you should wait for December to hear.","Blaine Heck","Fair enough. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from James Feldman from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","James Feldman","Thank you. So, I guess sticking with CapEx, we get a lot of questions about whose portfolio needs to have -- needs to be upgraded to be competitive, can you just talk through, as you think across your portfolio, I mean what percentage of your asset base do you think is kind of in prime fighting condition for beat? And how much do you think actually still needs to have, whether it's lobby upgrades or other types of upgrades as you think about next couple of years?","Marc Holliday","I think all but 625 is probably meets that, maybe 750 Third. Two out of 30-something-assets, I would say are in need -- we may be considering what round trippers where we've done it already, 10, 15, 20 years ago where -- it's not like one and done, so our CapEx spend has been drifting down on the, let's call it, the steady-state portfolio. We've been devoting the money to new developments, separate issue. But on the same-store portfolio, our CapEx spend for base building redevelop is down materially.","And it was for 2019, and will be I think again for 2020 for sure. 625 Mad you heard me speak about before at some point that could be 2021, 2022 that will be on our docket, for sure. And 750 Third, not a heavy spend, but we'll be doing some work there because that's where we have some vacancy coming up and it's the time in its lifecycle where we should be attending to that property. But by large, I'd say we're in excellent shape in terms of our buildings. Just walk in and then you'll see they're all fresh and redone and look great.","Steven Durels","Just to add to that, to my point, we continually reinvest in the buildings. By way of example, over the past year and a half or so, we redid the lobby in public areas of 1185 Avenue of the Americas, and we redid 461 Fifth. So, not huge repositioning efforts, but the money that we've spent has been very effective and has contributed to some very effective leasing as well.","James Feldman","Okay, that's helpful. And then just latest stock trends, The Street retail market, have you seen any change over the last quarter or so?","Andrew Mathias","I would say, it's hard to pick quarter-over-quarter as a barometer. I mean we announced the graph [ph] lease on Madison and there's still activity, we just don't have a lot of vacancy to lease right now. So, it's still a correcting market from the top and I think a lot of landlords are holding out because they have capital structure issues for rents that were sort of yesterday's rents as opposed to today's rents, but we've been able to meet the market in circumstances where we needed to and attract high-quality tenants.","Marc Holliday","We've got good activity on One Vanderbilt. We have like a corner of left on Madison that we've got multiple deals we're negotiating. We're going through the early stages of repositioning Worldwide Plaza retail. We've got some lease there we're negotiating. So, on 1st Jan, we have activity on same-store portfolio, as Andrew said, it's like leased, so we're in great shape.","James Feldman","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Nick Yulico from Scotiabank. Your line is now open.","Nicholas Yulico","Thanks. Steve, I was hoping you could talk through some of the leasing activity on some of the other larger tenant expirations you have coming up. Putting aside 625 Madison, maybe you can talk about 1185 Avenue of the Americas where you have NHL and News Corp leaving. And then also the Advance Magazine group space.","Steven Durels","Yes. So, starting with the 1185, we have rolled in that building over the next couple of years. We're not -- we're sitting with miles amount of space right now. We're trading proposals with one tenant for two floors with another tenant floors for as much as five floors. Not to suggest that either of those tenants will end up executing leases on, but we're getting good exposure to the market and feel very good about the space because most of its high up in the building. And as I said earlier, the building has recently received some capital enhancements for the new lobby, new entrance, new elevator caps and they look fantastic.","On the Advance space, Advance has sort of spread, which is Cond\u00e9 Nast, just for those who don't know, they're spread between 711 Third Avenue, 45 Lexington Avenue and 750 Third Avenue. At 750 Third Avenue, we have leases out on two of the floors. At 711 Third Avenue, we have leases out on two of their floors.","And on 45 Lexington, where they've got the bulk of the space, we're trading proposals on another 80,000 square feet. So, that space doesn't come back to us for I think depending on which billing it is, anywhere between a year to three years out. So, I think we're going to knock off a good chunk, if not the majority of it, in advance of lease expiration.","Nicholas Yulico","Okay. Good to hear. Thanks. And then on One Madison, Marc, I think you said redevelopment could start by middle of next year, and I'm just wondering does that mean Credit Suisse would move out early ahead of the December expiration? And then what does that mean for I guess the rough timeframe for delivery of the new building?","And I guess, Matt, how should we think about at what point the building gets -- becomes capitalized and removed from FFO? Thanks.","Marc Holliday","Right. So, we're going to start doing soft demo actually in the beginning of the year and then we'll do some more invasive demo towards the second or third quarter of next year. Credit Suisse I think they're out of most, if not all the space, but they're certainly out of most of the space. And so we have arrangements with not just Credit Suisse, but some of the other smaller subtenants there where we'll be able to launch this project in the middle of next year and have a timeline that would bring us to a TCO by the end -- by the middle to end of the third quarter of 2023.","So, it's not a long -- particularly long development, given the complexities of a tower overbuild on a building that is going to go through a complete repositioning with new facade, new lobby redevelopment, new storefronts, outdoor space creation, it's going to be an incredible project.","Equal in my mind in many ways to One Vanderbilt, just different, but sort of equally exciting and equally attractive to a tenant base that wants to be there. So that's the time line, and that hasn't really changed since whatever time line we've spoken about initially, it's always been a 2020 start and kind of a middle to just after middle of 2023 finish. Matt?","Matthew DiLiberto","And to answer your question on capitalization, capitalization starts whenever CS vacates, whatever that might be. Their lease expiration right now is end of 2020, so the capitalization will start then. If they left earlier, it'll start at that point.","Marc Holliday","Yes, they still have some presence there.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Vikram Malhotra from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Vikram Malhotra","Thanks for taking the question. I had a couple specific ones. Just on -- any updated thoughts on plans around Worldwide, given the news on Cravath moving out from there?","Marc Holliday","Well, I mean Cravath move I think is, like, 2024. So, that's going to be -- it's going to be -- we're going to be -- we have plans, but if I said they were preliminary in nature, I'd be understating it. It's 2019. They're in their hard through 2024. Five years is a lot of time for a lot of different things to happen, which we've thought through in terms of redevelopment or advance leasing or growth within the buildings, et cetera. And so we'll -- I'm not sure I understand the question, what is the question exactly, Vikram?","Vikram Malhotra","Just specifically -- I mean any other thoughts -- I mean you have a JV there, any other thoughts on any capital in the building, any changes around kind of--","Marc Holliday","No, I mean way too early in. It's just -- I don't want to not answer it. I mean it's just -- trust me when I say, it's like way too early. I mean under that guise, we'll be planning for entire portfolio. I mean you've got remember, our average lease term in this portfolio is nine to 10 years. So, in nine to 10 years we have 30 million free rolling. I mean that's -- so there's always space, something that's five years out--","Matthew DiLiberto","That we're only 25% of.","Marc Holliday","That's -- five years out, for a built building, it's really quite excellent space. It'll have to be tailored to someone at that time with a refreshener, if you need to, but who knows what's going to happen in the next five years in terms of the demand that may materialize for that, whether Cravath has to hold over or not, I mean it's just all sorts of variables that it's way, way too early to have any kind of serious dialogue about it now in my opinion. I'm not saying that's right, I'm just saying that's where we are.","Vikram Malhotra","Fair enough. And then just on the Polo space, Matt, just on what potentially can be capitalized before redevelopment or can you give us a sense of how that might play out?","Matthew DiLiberto","So, capitalization is based on property level, debt, its stated interest rate, if there is any. In the case of 625, there isn't and then you would capitalize based on book basis at the weighted average of cost of debt of the company at the point that the building is vacated and put into redevelopment.","Vikram Malhotra","Okay, great. And then just one last one. If you can clarify, the McDonald's lease, given they've relocated, is that -- can you give us any sense of plans there in Times Square?","Steven Durels","Well, I mean the space is on the market. They've vacated. They continue to pay rent through 2023 I think, 2023. So, we're going to market the space and hope to find a quality tenant, but we're also going to be careful about who we select as we have McDonald's, they're still paying rent.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]","Our next question is from Anthony Paolone from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Anthony Paolone","Thanks. Just two quick ones. One, I think Marc you mentioned at the outset, 100 basis points of occupancy pick up I think in the fourth quarter. Anything particular that's driving that or is it--","Marc Holliday","So, the 1.7 million square foot pipeline, we're going to try and make as much of that as humanly possible by at least 31. There's a lot of money lines going around this place right now as to where it's going to ultimately land by today, well that line is already set by December 9th, which is Investor Day and then the ultimate D 31. If you want in that pool, we can call you after.","Anthony Paolone","Yes, but is that -- so is that a leased number, is that right commenced--","Marc Holliday","It's always--","Matthew DiLiberto","That's a lease number.","Marc Holliday","Always lease square footage occupancy.","Matthew DiLiberto","Up from 95.3 to the goal of 96.2. So we're right on the trajectory we expected to be as of the end of quarter.","Marc Holliday","Yes, that's not to say there's not work to be done. It's not locked and loaded. We've got to go sign a bunch of leases, but I think that's what we're here to do for the next two and half months.","Anthony Paolone","Okay, got it. And then just second one, I know you and Vornado did a nice job with 280 Park a few years ago, it seems like you've gotten some lift in rents from that project, but maybe just a small deal but I noticed in the quarter you had a deal that rolled down like 20%, I'm just curious, like, is there anything to read into that in terms where rents in Park Avenue corridor may have gone?","Steven Durels","No, it was a small deal of a tenant that went bust on us. As I recall, it was 5,000 square-foot tenant that was in a prebuilt space that the rent reflected the fact that we've put much of capital into that unit. But we have leases that are in negotiation right now of much larger than that one, that one little tenant, in the high $80s to low $100s.","So, very healthy rents, much higher than where the building was predevelopment. It used to be a $55 to $65 building and now it's a $85 to $120 building, depending on where you are. And we've got -- we don't have a lot of vacant -- we have very little vacancy to begin with and very little to roll. So, what we've got to play with is all some of the best parts of the building because the base of the building is all locked down long-term.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I'm showing no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Marc Holliday for closing remarks.","Marc Holliday","Okay. I guess no questions may mean no one's on the line, but for those that are, we again thank you for giving us the hour and enjoyed answering the questions and mostly look forward to seeing you all bright and early, 9:00 kickoff, December 9th, Jazz at Lincoln Center and we promise to keep it interesting.

This conference call is being recorded.","At this time, the company would like to remind listeners that during the call, management may make forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ from the forward-looking statements that management may make today. Additional information regarding the factors that could cause such differences appear in the MD&A section of the company\u2019s Form 10-K and other reports filed by the company with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Also during today\u2019s conference call, the company may discuss non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the SEC Regulation G, the GAAP financial measures most directly comparable to each non-GAAP financial measure discussed and the reconciliation of the differences between each non-GAAP financial measure and the comparable GAAP financial measures can be found on the company\u2019s website at www.slgreen.com, by selecting the press release regarding the company\u2019s fourth quarter 2016 earnings.","Before turning the call over to Marc Holliday, Chief Executive Officer of SL Green Realty Corp., I ask that those of you participating in the Q&A portion of the call, please limit your questions to two per person. Thank you.","I will now turn the call over to Marc Holliday. Please go ahead, Marc.","Marc Holliday","Okay. Thank you. Good afternoon everyone. Let me begin by thanking all of you who attended our investor presentation on December 5th. By all accounts, it was enormously successful and proud day for our company where we got to showcase our achievements for the year, we provided a strategic framework for 2017, goals, objectives and market expectations. I think we had a record crowd of investors and analysts who attended and that for us is always sort of a crowning event for the company, for the year and we covered a lot of ground so, I\u2019ll keep my comments relatively brief at the outset here so it\u2019s not too duplicate a lot of our thoughts and where we\u2019re headed for the year. But I will try to go into some updates about what has transpired since then.","It\u2019s only been about seven weeks that have elapsed since the investor conference, but in that time we\u2019ve begun to implement our plans and I think it\u2019s evident that even at this very early stage we are making great progress towards another year of sector leading operating and financial performance. We actually wound up exceeding the high-end of our guidance range by $0.04 thanks impart to lower interest expense, operating expenses cost controls in the real-estate portfolio and higher net interest margin in the debt and preferred equity structured finance portfolio. Also during those seven weeks, we leased another 205,000 square feet of Manhattan office space exceeding our already elevated goal for 2016 and chipping away at 2017 Manhattan office lease expirations which as we stand today, those remaining expirations are less than 900,000 square feet throughout the entire portfolio.","Given that we are executing at such a very high level on the leasing front, the available inventory of what we have to lease is obviously reduced and it should come as no surprise that SLG\u2019s quarterly leasing volumes will be below previous amounts when we have much more growth portfolio space and lease rollovers to attend to. This should not be mistaken by what I sometimes hear and read about, as a slowdown. In fact, as we sit today, we have a pipeline of over 630,000 square feet which has actually increased from our last Q3 earnings call by about 5% or more, even though we have less place to lease as we sit today and therefore we remain very confident that we will meet or exceed our stating leasing goals for the year.","At this point, given the high degree of occupancy in the portfolio, our focus shifts away from sheer volume of leasing and towards maintaining market leading occupancy of 97% or greater while achieving mid-teens or higher mark-to-market on expiring leases. This of course will be enhanced as we acquire or develop new inventory to drive future growth. This best in class operational performance reinforces the fact that high quality, well located and reasonably priced office space is still in high demand and we will utilize our enviable portfolio and market positioning to drive the best lease economics possible.","Before opening up the call for questions, I want to take a few moments to discuss a milestone achievement for the company that we announced this morning regarding the recapitalization of the One Vanderbilt Avenue development project. This morning\u2019s announcement of the completion of the joint venture with NPS and Hines brings to a successful conclusion our capitalization goals for the project that we set forth on this call one year ago. I can\u2019t tell you how excited we are to partner with NPS and Hines on this extraordinary development of what would become the single best commercial building in Manhattan.","After a global exploratory process conducted jointly by SL Green and Hines, we were fortunate enough to find a partner who shares our commitment and vision for developing, owning and operating this iconic property. Through its $525 million minimum commitment into the project, NPS and Hines will be providing the majority of the development equity capital left to fund over the next 3.5 years. I want to take this opportunity to congratulate all the men and women at NPS, Hines and Green who have worked diligently and of course tirelessly on this project for the better part of the last four months in order to bring it to fruition this morning.","In particular, the effort was led internally by Isaac Zion, Robert Schiffer and Andy Levine who made it their priority to close this transaction within this stated timeframes we laid out to everyone on this call 12 months ago. I can\u2019t be happier with the outcome which strikes the right balance between reducing SL Green\u2019s overall capital commitment to the project while still maintaining 71% ownership for the future. We thank our shareholders for having the confidence in us to put together this best in class of construction financing that we announced I think on the last call, $1.5 billion of construction financing along with this new venture ownership structure. You will all be substantially rewarded for this as the project moves forward towards its next phase of construction and lease-up which will unfold over the next several years.","So with that, I\u2019d like to open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Market. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","John Kim","Thank you. Since the Presidential election, there\u2019s been enormous optimism on the bank stocks and I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019re seeing any of that optimism reflected in lease markets from financial institutions?","Marc Holliday ","I think I can speak to seeing it reflected in a vibe and a confidence with all of the different counterparties we meet, whether it\u2019s bankers, potential partners, tenants, people in the financial community, brokers. I would say clearly, the vibe, the confidence, the psychology has become much more enthusiastic, much more positive, much more optimistic in terms of what everyone perceives to be the opportunities for growth and incentives, lower taxes and possibly with \u2013 regulation and whatever else is driving that enthusiasm, we definitely see it. In terms of translating that into signed lease deals, I guess over the past month or two, I don\u2019t know if you could point to it directly although may be Steve could shed some light on the experience we\u2019re having at 280 Park which is as good as an example of a financial oriented commercial asset as we have in the portfolio as any and I would say the experience there the last couple of months has actually been surprisingly robust. So Steve\u2026","Steven Durels","Yeah I think that\u2019s spot on. The end of last year and most of last year, financial services came back into the market in a material relative to the other business sectors. And post-election, we certainly saw bump in activity, tour activity, proposal activity and leases that are being negotiated 280 Park Avenue in particular. We have a number of transactions that are pending over there, reminding ourselves we don\u2019t have a lot of space left in the building at this point, but we\u2019re on track to basically knock off of the square footage in that building. And every deal that we\u2019re negotiating right now is a financial services tenant. We\u2019ve also seen some increased activity at 10 East 53rd Street, also dominated by financial services. So, it feels like that sector is back in the market, they\u2019ve got some new enthusiasm and we\u2019re hopeful that we\u2019re going to see more activity throughout the year.","John Kim","And then conversely as far as policy changes or potential changes, how concerned are you about a potential 1031 exchange \u2013 especially being one of the most active REITs as far as \u2013 capital.","Marc Holliday ","1031 is something that we\u2019ve utilized in the past as a mechanism for like-like exchanges and we\u2019re first and foremost optimistic that the new administration will continue to recognize the benefits to the country as a whole in terms of allowing like-for-like without - taxation. If it does happen, I don\u2019t see that being all that impactful to the way we operate. We have certainly demonstrated an ability to sell [indiscernible] assets, monetize assets in ways other than 1031 but still comply with all regulations for, not triggering current gains but rather differing gains this position and there\u2019s always other elements that are available to us such as dividend out the cash or timing sales for when you have excess shield in depreciation so that we can time these events to minimize or eliminate the tax burden if any.","I think we\u2019ve done that as good as anyone in the sector over the 20 years because we\u2019ve been sort of the highest net disposer of assets or interest in assets. I think Matt and Maggie and Mike and the team has done an extraordinarily good, thorough and logical job at guiding us through all of the various requirements for maximizing retain cash for shareholders and minimizing tax impact. We\u2019ll keep our eye on 1031, but I would say it\u2019s not something that we look at as having as much of an effect on a company like us as it might have on other parts of the community particularly individual owners who look to get out of projects with low bases into other projects that are more secure and have long-term cash flow nature. It\u2019s part of the state planning, it should remain that way into the future, but we\u2019ll just have to see what happens.","John Kim","Okay, thanks for the color.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Alexander Goldfarb","Great. Thank you. So, I guess Steve, just following up on your commentary obviously seeing pretty optimistic and have heard similar from one of the other REIT landlords. But when we speak to the brokers, they seem a little bit more subdue, they talk about increase of concession, sort of black market why would anyone pay hike north of $100 rent. So just -- is it a matter of it\u2019s a difference between landlords talking about specific buildings whereas when people are looking at the overall market, the overall market is still slow or is it that I\u2019m just trying to reconcile the two of \u2013 the building specific stuff or there are some trends in the market that are slowly building, they haven\u2019t gone through the full city yet, but given your commentary you\u2019d expect that we\u2019d start to see that ripple through the rest of the market over the course of this year.","Steven Durels","Right. Well with all due respect to the brokers\u2019 community, they frequently have a point of view that\u2019s either in their research reports that are trailing statistics - statistics were trailed with what\u2019s happening in the field and the broker feedback is sort of just of the moment reflective of whatever their current activity level is. The owners I think are better source of insight because we have a good visibility as to the deals that are actually getting signed, term sheets that we\u2019re considering versus other, one deal versus another and how the broader perspective as to the types of businesses that are coming through our door, whether it\u2019d be tour activity, proposal activity or actual leases that we\u2019re signing. So not surprised to hear you say that but in my travels, I think most brokers are fairly optimistic right now, I don\u2019t get a lot of negativity back from them over the past 30-45 days. So we\u2019ll see how the year unfolds but we\u2019re still feeling very strong.","Alexander Goldfarb","And as far as the One Vanderbilt JV announcement, sort of a two part; one, just curious the involvement of Hines, I thought you already had \u2013 as a construction manager and you guys seemed to hire a dedicated team internally. And then the other part of that is the equity commitment of not less than $525 million, does that mean the JV partners haven\u2019t paid you guys cash yet, they\u2019re just committed to fund the rest of the equity component of it and therefore SL Green has no more equity that needs to be funded in One Vandy?","Marc Holliday ","I would -- and again, I think we diagramed this out in December that our money was in I forget the number that we flashed up December, I want to say $894 million was left to fund and we\u2019ll be funding that alongside of our JV partners over the balance of the field in our respective ratios. But that was the way we\u2019ve always described it and the way we went out to the market. So maybe that\u2019s just a clarification, but we\u2019ve always shown it as such in whatever we put up there publicly. What was the other question? Hines? Well Hines is -- Hines has been there with us from the outset, so they\u2019re not new to the table, they\u2019ve been --","Unidentified Company Representative","[Indiscernible] involvement in partnership.","Marc Holliday","Yeah. They\u2019ve been a co-development manager in this project I think since 2012. So the only thing that\u2019s changed now is the Hines principles have invested significant amount of their own personal cash into the deal alongside NPS which sometimes they do and I think sometimes they don\u2019t. So we took it as an enormous vote of confidence from Gerry Hines and Tommy Craig and Chris Hughes and the whole team who sort of wanted as much as they could get, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m overstating it in saying that, but this is what we felt made sense. We could have gone deeper, but I think what I said in my opening remarks is we should try to strike a balance between bringing a sizeable amount of equity capital to defray future funding obligations while not selling off too much upside too early and may be there\u2019s no exact number but this one felt to be just right. And that\u2019s how we came to this 71-29 venture.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. Thanks, Marc.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Jamie Feldman","Great. Thank you. Can you provide some color on the transaction market and foreign flows and what you\u2019ve seen since I know the Investor Day was shortly after the election, but just any changes on where capital is coming from and interesting assets in New York City?","Andrew Mathias","Jamie, it\u2019s Andrew. I think it\u2019s been status quo which is to say an enormous amount of foreign interest. Obviously we announced the Korean deal this morning, so that\u2019s one data point. You still have a lot of the assets on the market that we spoke about on Investor Day, people are actively touring and so we\u2019re getting rid to bid on those assets. And we\u2019ve also closed several financings in the interim between investor conference and now and some of those financings have come from notable foreign capital sources. So, I think -- we haven\u2019t seen any change in terms of foreign demand since the election.","Jamie Feldman","Is there any shift in underwriting or change in underwriting outlooks? And is there a shift in the type like where money is coming from versus may be where the interest has been in the last couple of years?","Marc Holliday","Not that I\u2019ve seen. I mean Isaac anything -- in terms of the brokers\u2019 guidance from their conversation, I think it\u2019s still the same pool of suspects and targets.","Isaac Zion ","Yes, I agree.","Marc Holliday","And in terms of underwriting, people haven\u2019t modified their year.","Isaac Zion","You\u2019ll see a little bit more activity from the newer players and we sort of mentioned that at the end of the year as well like Japanese are a little more active. Clearly, the Koreans are a little more active, so still the larger players from around the world are still actively engaged in trying to find [indiscernible]","Jamie Feldman","Okay. And then we\u2019re hearing there\u2019s just going to be fewer assets on the market this year than the last couple of years, just more in the hands of long-term holders. How should we think about what that means for your debt and preferred equity business and the opportunity set if \u2013 deals?","Marc Holliday ","I don\u2019t know I don\u2019t want to take that as a presumption. I don\u2019t know that we agree there\u2019s going to be less fields I\u2019m not quite sure who\u2019s saying that. I mean we see a fairly significant pipeline of deals Isaac do you have any\u2026","Isaac Zion ","Right. Well right now in terms of what we\u2019re tracking, there\u2019s close to $20 billion of assets on the market, there\u2019s already been a $1 billion trade this year and there\u2019s another three or four that are actively being talked about now, they\u2019re actively being toured.","Marc Holliday ","Yeah and that billion includes the NPS deal this morning?","Isaac Zion","No, no.","Marc Holliday","So, I\u2019m not \u2013 I guess I would start by saying, I don\u2019t think we see necessarily a slowdown clearly from \u201815 that was kind of a peak year, \u201816 levels sort of reset themselves in the second half of the year but I don\u2019t see why \u201817 wouldn\u2019t be as on par with if not slightly ahead of second half of \u201816. I would actually say to you that\u2019s our expectation I would further say that on the heels of successfully concluding a major, major re-cap of 11 Madison I don\u2019t want to forget that one, that wasn\u2019t too long ago I know the memory here is sometimes quite short, but that was surely within the past six months domestic partner on the $2.6 billion transaction for 40% of that deal. Now we\u2019ve got One Vanderbilt re-cap behind us, you should expect will contribute certainly probably another big sale or re-cap to the market as they\u2019re both simultaneously out there looking very actively for new deals.","Jamie Feldman","Okay, that\u2019s great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Manny Korchman with Citi. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Manny Korchman","Good afternoon everyone. Marc, may be Steve, can you talk more about the relationship between pushing rents and maintaining occupancy if those are sort of both your goal? And how do you think about retention in that context?","Steven Durels","Well, I think our ability to push rents \u2013 let\u2019s just talk about the market overall. Our mark-to-market is going to stay healthy this year, so that\u2019s one measure of unlocking the embedded value in the portfolio. The overall ability to push rents is obviously a function of the health of the market and if leasing stays on paced with last year, then there should be pretty good absorption, less supply therefore there\u2019s good opportunity that rents will continue to increase this year. And we have the portfolio that\u2019s sort of in the sweet spot of the market to take advantage of that. The majority of our portfolio is in that sort of value play price point kind of the $60 to $80 price point and that\u2019s where a lot of the activity has been most recently. Reminding ourselves of last year\u2019s 2.5 million square feet of net absorption in the market, so if that supply comes off, there should be some pricing pressure. And as far as retention renewals, Marc started off by reminding you that there\u2019s less than 900,000 square feet of roll and that is clearly a function of a lot of hard years in advance of attending to early renewals which is always and has been and continues to be a top priority for the firm.","Marc Holliday ","Yeah, so I mean I think generally, better leased you are, the more you can try to drive economics to the point at which you feel you optimize them and the difference between crossing the finish line or not, I mean we tend to cross the finish line than anybody else, but clearly we have our goals set out for ourselves in our budget and if our net effectives don\u2019t lend where we think they can or should, then we\u2019ll hold our rents and take a little more vacancy and wait to make our rents, but more often than not, I think we have as good a barometer of anyone that fine line where supply and demand meet and where to make a deal and maximize our net effectives while keeping occupancy at 97.","Steven Durels","The other thing to add to that is with our high level of occupancy and low rollover, these are the times that we put a lot of emphasis on making sure that we\u2019re trying to uptick the quality of our credit within the portfolio. So, as we have tenants that are rolling out that are weaker credit, we use this as an opportunity to call some of that out.","Manny Korchman","Great. And then on the One Vanderbilt JV, could you just talk about how the partners would share in any cost savings or cost overruns? So for example, if cost came in $100 million less than you thought, would the equity check be smaller, would they get a larger share of the project, how would that sort of pan out?","Marc Holliday ","I would just look as it\u2019s a pro rata JV I mean there\u2019s no preps\u2026","Unidentified Company Representative","Side by side, overruns and JV.","Manny Korchman","Got it. Thank you.","Marc Holliday","Otherwise there\u2019s no opportunity for the partners to rise above 29%.","Manny Korchman","Got it. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Lewis with SunTrust. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Michael Lewis","Thank you. A couple of weeks back there was an article about the 625 Madison and I believe Andrew was even quoted in the article, so I don\u2019t need him to repeat everything that was said there. But I\u2019m wondering if what you think about the potential for significant mark-up signing ground leases and are there any that are close that may be you have negotiations already?? I know the 626 Madison won\u2019t start till 2021 so maybe that\u2019s a little further out, but is there anything that might be a surprise there?","Andrew Mathias","It\u2019s Andrew. I don\u2019t think -- there\u2019s a nature tension there obviously between fee holder and lease holder. That situation is only unique because we do own a fee interest across the street from 625 and the leaseholder on that property is the fee owner on 625. So, we have sort of the exact inverse position and we\u2019re going to do our best to try to affect a good outcome there. We\u2019re very cautious in terms of the leasehold positions. We take on and we\u2019ve been through probably more revaluations than any other firm in the city. So we understand the way appraisers look at these calculations when they\u2019re set. I don\u2019t think across our portfolio there\u2019s any other situation which should get that higher level of concern, 625 is probably the biggest pending revaluation we have. We have successfully revalued leasehold positions at 420 Lexington, The Graybar Building, 711 Third Avenue and many of our other assets. So it\u2019s sort of part of ongoing business here in New York.","Michael Lewis","Perfect. Thanks. My second question is as we all kind of evaluate the new administration in Washington and what that means, obviously a lot of the financial stocks have run - people have asked about that already on this call. How do you think about potential upside from your tenants for example, if the fiduciary rule doesn\u2019t go through, is that kind of a -- do you think that\u2019s a game changer in your space for demand or corporate tax rates get rolled back, does that dramatically kind of change your outlook?","Marc Holliday","I don\u2019t know if we can quantify bank profits, bank demand to the roll back or modification of the fiduciary rule or not, obviously it\u2019s sort of binary, it would appear to be helpful if it was repealed or at least certain aspects of it were reformed. But I don\u2019t know if we can quantify it as to what it would mean. I think that \u2013 we look at these things a little bit more generally in terms of the psychology of tenants who are making lease commitments into what they think are going to be a positive three to five years forward, always want to air on the side making sure they allow for enough growth and opportunity so they don\u2019t get themselves boxed in by making a long-term 10 or 15 year deal and calling their growth and their space incorrectly.","So I think that looking at that along with whole host of other economic reforms that are likely to impact not just the finance sector but legal sector and otherwise, we think that on balance, tenants will be a little bit more aggressive or should say defensive, would be a little more defensive when it comes to their own space and making sure, A, they\u2019re acting early to lock in rents now as opposed to what they might be increasing to in the next few years; B, making sure they have some growth space to accommodate positive economic conditions; C, flexibility so that if things don\u2019t pan out the way they wanted to, they have the ability to sublease, assign or small shedding rights. That will just unbalance we think tip tenants more towards an active market for this year and we\u2019re starting to see that sentiment take place now.","I know there\u2019s been couple of questions now on finance sector which is important because it\u2019s over 30% of our market, but I wouldn\u2019t overlook the substantial amount of dollars that might come into New York as part of any kind of major infrastructure spending bill because there are a number of shovel ready projects throughout New York that are kind of well-defined whether it would be the Gateway project, the tubes under the Hudson or Second Avenue Subway line extension now that the first part of the Second Avenue Subway is complete or continue funding to complete East side access, bringing LIRR into Grand Central or the major, major redevelopment projects that will be taking place at LaGuardia and JFK. So that\u2019s just to name a few and that\u2019s like -- it\u2019s probably $50 billion of projects plus or minus and that\u2019s not comprehensive. So that kind of excess activity, that kind of financial inflow could affect a lot more than just the financial sector, obviously we\u2019ll just have to wait and see what of that comes to fruition, how much New York is able to allocate towards it projects relative to the rest of the country and how quickly it happens.","Michael Lewis","Interesting times. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Vikram Malhotra","Thank you. Good afternoon. So just to get a little more clarity on the last point about the broader market, just in terms of your pipeline, if I remember correctly, may be three to six months ago you had mentioned that financial formed a very small part of the pipeline. Can you give us a bit more color on sort of what makes up the pipeline by price point and end market today?","Steven Durels","Here\u2019s a good statistic to answer that, of the leases that we have out right now, 45% of the square footage are leases with financial services businesses. And of the deals that are term sheet proposals, probably a smaller percentage but still a very meaningful portion of the pipeline. And I think if any of our percentage of deals done sort of trail away from financial services, it\u2019s probably going to be more of a function of the type of products that we are starting to lease up and we\u2019re going to run out of that inventory and therefore, it won\u2019t be -- financial services means we won\u2019t have the right space for them. But for the inventory we\u2019ve got right now, it\u2019s a very meaningful part of the deal flow.","Vikram Malhotra","And it\u2019s still in that sort of $70 midpoint range?","Steven Durels","Or higher, or materially higher quite frankly.","Vikram Malhotra","And just so my second question, given that you\u2019ve done so much forward leasing and you\u2019ve taken down so much of the space still left to do this year. Does this sort of allow you to focus may be even more, put more resources towards One Vanderbilt and does this any way change your timeline that you had shared with us at the Investor Day in terms of lease-up?","Marc Holliday","I would say with the announcement of the JV today that probably is directionally devoting less resources to One Vanderbilt. Our resources in the One Vanderbilt are fixed if we\u2019re talking about monetary resources. If we\u2019re talking about human resources, there is a completely up and running team that\u2019s kind of designated separate, it\u2019s marketing, it\u2019s building every day. So that\u2019s not going up or down depending on what happens to the rest of portfolio. I think what it means is that what we do best developing or redeveloping all these buildings, we\u2019re going to take a hard look first at our internal portfolio and see what\u2019s the next great redevelopment project that we can execute over the next couple of years like we did at 100 Park, 10 East 53rd, 3 Columbus etcetera, etcetera, I mean on and on and on, I mean that\u2019s our bread and butter stock and trade. And trying to lift those rents up whatever they are $10, $15, $20 put post-redevelopment. So we actually have one or two projects in our sites now for that purpose, just lending themselves for considerations due to some lease roll in \u201818 and \u201819 that would make that favorable. And also as Isaac said earlier there is $20 billion of -- so we hope to get our fair share of looks and opportunities within that portfolio, some of those are on market, some of those are off market within that $20 billion is proprietary, that\u2019s not $20 billion total brokered. So that\u2019s our tracking list and we would fully expect to convert some opportunities there to create more opportunity for leasing as we max out the portfolio. But that\u2019s just basically what we always do and have been doing. So that\u2019s where I\u2019d see the focus shift for \u201817.","Isaac Zion","The other thing to add to that on One Vanderbilt, the lease up timeline there is not a function of resources or tenant demand, that\u2019s really a function of construction timeline. We\u2019re still roughly four years out before we deliver it and being realistic about when tenants are going to make decisions that really needs to be more within the 20-24 months timeline before going to delivery as to when tenants are going to pull the trigger on those decisions. So that\u2019s why 2018 is really more of the target date for significant lease up.","Vikram Malhotra","Great. Thank you for the color.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Nick Yulico","Thanks. Just following up on One Vanderbilt, Steve, could you may be talk about some of the latest types of lease discussions you have in there, types of tenant size? And it sounds like you have some good activity there yet you are saying 2018 is more likely to get some announced, but wondering what are the chances of actually getting a lease done at some point this year because the demand is good?","Marc Holliday","I mean Steve will answer, but again, Nick, it would be no different than the same we\u2019re sitting here now working on our 2021 expirations. We\u2019re just not. It\u2019s too far out. Every year and you know as well as anybody, we work on expirations current year, a year out and then maybe we\u2019ll knock off some 2019s. Four tenants that are anywhere between that 50,000 foot to 250,000 foot range, that not just what I\u2019ll call customary, it\u2019s almost exclusive that the leasing activity we do in that size range really won\u2019t \u2013 sitting here at the beginning of \u201817 won\u2019t really extend beyond \u201819 certainly nothing in \u201820 or \u201821.","So that\u2019s the same analogy of saying hey, you\u2019re going to get One Vandy lease up or at least cut this year. We might, because it\u2019s not unprecedented, that we could do some early leasing in \u201820 and \u201821 but if you back over our 20 year history, it\u2019s just not how the market moves. It\u2019s not a statement about the market, it\u2019s not a statement about the building to the contrary the receptivity of tenants have been I would term extraordinary and the same degree of confidence we had in getting it financed, finding our equity partner, we have been getting it fully leased up at best in market range, but I would just cautionary - realistic to the timeframes when those side tenants will make commitments because typically you\u2019re looking one to two to may be \u2013 years out for physical occupancy. So with that, Steve.","Steven Durels","I think you really need to look at the lease up at One Vanderbilt as a marathon, right? This is not a sprint, it\u2019s a marathon. The efforts that are being invested today are really just to educate the brokers\u2019 community, get the word out so people understand what the product is, we\u2019re doing a good number of tenant presentations, but again, it\u2019s very early in those tenants\u2019 decision timelines. And it\u2019s not a one presentation, get a proposal, make a deal kind of exercise, it\u2019s a \u2013 you make a presentation and if you\u2019re talking to one tenant, it ultimately gets through a term sheet, you\u2019re probably making five or six or seven presentations as you sort of work up the corporate hierarchy inside an organization to build consensus on a long-term decision like this. But it\u2019s a lot of hard work, a lot of time and we\u2019re at very early stages.","Nick Yulico","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then Marc, just going back to your comments before about looking for some more opportunity in your market or in your own portfolio and thinking about over the last year you\u2019ve reduced your leverage, you have managed your expiration scheduling, you\u2019re trying to keep occupancy high. And so now it sounds like you\u2019ve may be become a little bit more optimistic about doing projects or may be the market I mean what\u2019s kind of shifted in that thinking?","Marc Holliday","I don\u2019t know that I did really clarify the shift I\u2019d say in most years, 7 out of 10 were the most acquisitive in the markets. So I would say last year if nothing else, One Vandy did take a lot of attention I think appropriately so. We settled litigation, with construction financing in place, we\u2019ve got the JV equity in place, the project is now almost 80% bought which is extraordinary at numbers we\u2019ll sort of be able to give you guys better update on come our April call, but I feel very good about the numbers we presented in December and may be there\u2019ll be savings for those numbers. There was a moment in time, we\u2019ve got the 11 Mad JV done, we did how much 3 million square feet lease \u2013 something, so I would just say that was the right thing at the moment and right now, it\u2019s not that there\u2019s any shift I would say, it\u2019s what we would traditionally do is go out there and hunt typically off market deals where we think we can go in, bring our value add brand and approach to anything in midtown Manhattan or South to 23rd Downtown and create value, I\u2019d say for us it\u2019s almost like a formula, it\u2019s a recipe. I\u2019m confident we can do it. We have an extraordinary amount of capacity right now to do it which will even be enhanced because as I said earlier I think we\u2019re also going to be looking to roll out one other big project, let\u2019s say in 2017 on the heels of One Vanderbilt or JV. So there will be -- hopefully this will be a year of opportunity, but consistent with other years, think back to growth portfolio 1O and 2O those were laden with opportunities and I think we will have our share of that this year.","Nick Yulico","Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John Guinee with Stifel. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","John Guinee","Thank you. Marc in an effort to just to get to a current valuation of One Vanderbilt, is it possible to provide how much total cash needs to be spent, someone can then plug in their expectation of gross value and subtract out construction spend over the next three or four years to come out to a current value today?","Marc Holliday","We put \u2013 I\u2019d rather than do \u2013 we can do those calculations, I don\u2019t know if have it here, we can \u2013 let me refer back to the numbers in December. We put the wholesome budget up there, this \u2013 what do you got there Matt? So it\u2019s about call it \u2013 at least the sources news we put up in December, amounted to $3.2 billion of which $1.5 billion was the construction financing, the balance is equity either funded to-date or remaining to fund. I think at the time we said it was $895 million left to fund, so that is what\u2019s left to fund. So the project is about $3.2 billion of total cost with I guess \u2013 commission everything else it probably gets up to a number of close to 3.3 in change that\u2019s the basis upon which NPS and Hines bought into the deal, it\u2019s not obviously not reflective of our basis and we put those numbers in December, but that\u2019s the magnitude of the project, that\u2019s the amount of debt financing for the project, the balance is equity and of what\u2019s left to fund $525 million we put [indiscernible] partners.","John Guinee","So overly simplistic if people think that the asset is worth $3.3 billion and that you have $2.4 billion remaining to be spent, a fair valuation as of today is roughly $900 million. If someone thinks that this assets were 2,500 a foot or $4 billion at stabilization, you have $2.4 billion left to spend the quick math is it\u2019s worth $1.6 billion. So I\u2019m just trying to get to a very simple way to put it in people\u2019s NAV.","Marc Holliday","So what it\u2019s worth depends on what you think is worth at residual. I think and again, I\u2019m doing this little bit by memory, so I want to have my proper \u2013 disclaimer. I think we put like around $200 million or so of stabilized NOI I don\u2019t know if we have that number here. So I think John it will come to I don\u2019t know what cap rates you want to apply to that and then you can sort of back into on a present basis what the value is you want to put in \u2013 by the way, the value is extraordinary, whatever, I mean you can make an argument for sub - cap because it will be I think the best building in Manhattan, you can argue for a forcap[ph] you want to be highly conservative I guess four in a quarter, four in half, I mean that\u2019s in the eye of the holder. So I\u2019m looking here $198 million of NOI base case rented 155 foot average in $2,028. So that\u2019s -- I don\u2019t want to put a number out there because there is no singular number, it\u2019s how do you want to value $200 million to stabilize NOI for this kind of building which I would say will be the trophy of trophies in Manhattan upon completion.","John Guinee","Great. Okay.","Marc Holliday","And therefore I think the number is very substantial.","John Guinee","Okay, perfect. Then the next thing is I was looking at I guess for Matt, I look at page one which sorry page 21 on your sup which looks like you\u2019re on about an $840 million cash NOI $210 million in the fourth quarter times four gets you about $840 million. But then looking at your cash NOI assumptions in your Investor Day, they add up to that $900 million. Is there a bridge between the fourth quarter reported on page 21 and your Investor Day numbers?","Matthew DiLiberto","Yeah that is in large part the 3.2 million of square feet of leasing for what hasn\u2019t commenced yet rolling through the numbers. So we have in total a million square feet of leases that have signed and not yet been commenced about 350,000 square feet of which is vacant space. So that will contribute the bulk of the growth in the portfolio over the course of 2017. Of course, offsetting that is a little bit of roll off, we said we have vacancy coming at 45 Lex and 220 is 42nd. But that leasing has a 6 to 12 month lag on it that Steve did in 2016 rolling through 2017 that are the bulk of that bridge John.","John Guinee","Great. Thank you very much. Talk to you in a quarter.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jed Reagan with Green Street Advisors. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Jed Reagan","Hi, good afternoon guys. It looks like leasing cost in your portfolio picked up quite a bit in the fourth quarter and would you say those levels are representative of where the market concessions are now? And may be just if you could comment generally on the trends you\u2019re seeing across the market in terms of leasing cost?","Matthew DiLiberto","Just so we\u2019re clear, define picked up quite a bit, what are we talking about?","Marc Holliday","I think the TIs were up modestly I didn\u2019t see \u2013 which large increase you\u2019re referring to?","Jed Reagan","Just in terms of concessions as a percent of first year rent so it\u2019s like\u2026","Marc Holliday","No, I got it just want to get to the number, I have Matt looking at the numbers.","Matthew DiLiberto","So Jed, you clear you\u2019re looking at the $48 of TI compared to $40 last quarter?","Marc Holliday ","Is that what you\u2019re referring to or is there something more than that? We\u2019re not hearing you Jed. That wasn\u2019t us, we didn\u2019t cut you off Jed.","Matthew DiLiberto","Jed we\u2019re not hearing you but Steve\u2019s going to answer your question\u2026","Marc Holliday ","So let me answer the question, I would first say if we\u2019re talking about TI, I think there was sort of a modest increase which I think that\u2019s just sort of fluctuation specific leases, month to month. Why don\u2019t you address that?","Steven Durels","So it\u2019s really driven by a number of deals where the higher rent price point deals and they carried the higher TI allowances rather us doing a build to \u2013 toward giving a greater amount of cash contributions. Something that you\u2019ve seen in the market before, but I think there\u2019s this perception that it\u2019s up across the entire market, not really true. It\u2019s really the high priced point of the market. So in our case, we had a number of deals that were signed in the fourth quarter that were rents in the 85-95 plus kind of range and not surprisingly, those carry a bigger contribution. And if that was a bigger part of our leasing for that particular quarter, it averaged up. So, I think we expect to see a more moderate level in the first quarter of this year.","Marc Holliday","Jed, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re still with us, but if you are, we looked at 17 budgeted concessions which we feel pretty good about versus 16 concessions, that\u2019s all new leases for \u201816 versus all new leases for \u201817. We actually have TIs and free rent as a total concession package flat to down year-over-year from 17 to 16. So again, I\u2019m not exactly sure where the increases are coming from which you\u2019re referring to but I think A, we see them as relatively steady for the bulk of the market other \u2013 they may be the very high end of Steve Durels just referred to and also more importantly from my perspective is I think we budgeted properly before that in 2017 so that we still should be right on the numbers of what we showed everybody in December. Alright. I guess that is it. We\u2019ll check if there are no more questions in queue. Jed?","Jed Reagan","Thanks for that color. Just one more if I may, with respect to the planned observation deck, does the pro forma forecast you guys laid out last month, does that assume there\u2019ll be a fifth observation deck at the Hudson yard? And do you think that deck opens before One Vanderbilt\u2019s?","Marc Holliday","Yeah, no that was \u2013 we\u2019ve had two or three different firms do studies. Those studies obviously look at existing but also look at future proposed and then they come up with expected market share for each. I think what --","Matthew DiLiberto","Both those -- are well aware of the plan deck of the Hudson Yard.","Marc Holliday","So the answer is yes, it incorporates it. Even with that, I think the numbers they came up to which we showed you in that \u2013 in December it was I think 1.9 million visitors a year if I\u2019m not wrong plus or minus. Capacity for the deck will be closer to 2.5-2.6 million, we think it will be much closer to capacity than it will be towards the kind of fair share projected because we do think it will be sort of an extraordinary best class up deck, but if you sort of look at them as all equal, that\u2019s the kind of numbers we flashed up in December. We\u2019ll take one more question operator, then we\u2019re going to wrap up.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with KeyBanc. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Craig Mailman","Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just curious your thoughts here on direction of cap rates, if long-term and short-term rates continue to migrate higher and that effect has kind of remain under pressure.","Matthew DiLiberto","I think \u2013 interest rates obviously we can\u2019t predict, but we have seen debt providers continue to be very aggressive and we see spreads I would say steady to even compressing as rates rise which often happens because you have bond buyers often target to an all yield as opposed to spread the treasuries. So, the cost of financing I think it\u2019s held barely stable and we don\u2019t project any big movement in cap rates, that notwithstanding we\u2019re looking at the curve of interest rates like everybody else and if something should dramatically exceed expectations in the curve, we wouldn\u2019t rule out the impact that could have on cap rates. But we think that that\u2019s unlikely this year and as we said that that demand which is really a lot of factors underlying it but a safe haven demand, currency demand and overall sort of growth expectation of New York, we find to be very fairly isolated from interest rates and we don\u2019t expect to see any big moves based on it.","Marc Holliday","Hey Craig, thank you for the question and I want to make sure for everyone who is still listening, we make sure not to let pass by the opportunity to celebrate the moment where just prior to this call, there was a press release as I understand from S&P that hit the wires just before the call started, upgrading the outlook for SL Green to positive from stable so obviously a step towards a ratings upgrade we would certainly hope in the future. This is the first important step so we now have two different agencies Fitch and S&P that have come out with outlook increases I think in the past 45 to 60 days or so which I think is a testament to the extraordinary job we and in particular Matt and Maggie and the team have done shepherding the balance sheet to probably the lowest levels of leverage, highest levels of debt service coverage and capacity we\u2019ve had as a company I think ever. So A, congratulations; B, all this means is that we\u2019re now going to have to relook at our goals for the year as we had talked about two upgrades, may be we\u2019ll have to talk about three upgrades based on the next call. I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ll get into that, but we\u2019re certainly very happy with S&P\u2019s affirmation today and Fitch\u2019s affirmation a month or two ago. So thank you everyone and look forward to speaking to you on the next call.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference.

Earnings Conference Call. My name is Sheena, and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions]","As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes.","And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Heidi Gillette. Please proceed.","Heidi Gillette","Thank you, everybody for joining us, and welcome to SL Green Realty Corp.'s first quarter 2014 earnings results conference call. This conference is being recorded.","At this time, the company would like to remind all listeners that during the call, management may make forward-looking statements.

I will now turn the call over to Marc Holliday.","Marc Holliday","Okay. Thank you, Heidi, and good afternoon, and thank you to all, everyone dialing in to join us today. It pretty much goes without saying how happy we are with our first quarter achievements and the subsequent transactions that we announced yesterday. Our results and achievements had something for everyone and certainly sets a strong early foundation for what we expect to be a very good 2014.","First and foremost, our Manhattan leasing results exceeded our expectations both in terms of leases signed and mark-to-market. The substantial leasing volume is reflective of accelerating demand as private-sector job growth continues in New York City at a historically rapid pace. Over 20,000 private sector jobs were created in the first quarter of 2014 alone, continuing last year's torrid pace of job growth, which neared 100,000 private sector jobs last year. Most of this growth in the first quarter took place among professional business services companies, which accounted for a quarter, probably slightly more than a quarter of the total growth. So clearly, from my perspective, job growth being the metric that has the greatest impact on tenant demand is clearly continuing at a strong pace, at historically significant pace. And at this point, it seems relatively unabated in it's job creation ability in these various sectors, notwithstanding financial services in the first quarter was down marginally. So again, these achievements were being done by all the other sectors that we've spoken about at length on these calls and in December.","Complementing our leasing activities, was a typically busy quarter on the investment front as well. Year-to-date, we entered into agreements to acquire over $1 billion of real estate in 4 separate transactions, highlighted by our agreement to buy out our partner in 388-390 Greenwich Street. I consider the lease extension of Citigroup in December combined with the sizable buyout of our partner to be among the most important and impactful events in this company's history. These transactions served to derisk significant future lease role and also created substantial earnings momentum, which we'll be able to realize this year and value creation, which we'll be enjoying over the coming years.","But while our investment volume for the year was front-ended, we were very conscious of making sure that we sold into this market, this market being exceedingly strong right now given high levels of investor demand, plentiful levels of debt and equity capital and as a result, we are able to achieve $586 million of sales and also 4 transactions. So that's over $1.6 billion of investment activity, 8 different transactions, the fourth month of the year is not even behind us, and that's not including another $160 million-plus of debt and preferred equity originations that we also were able to accomplish in the first quarter. So that's not to say we're by any means done for the year. We've got a substantial pipeline on leasing of about 1.4 million square feet. So we expect second quarter to be pretty much on par with first quarter on leasing in the range of 500,000 to 600,000 square feet, which would make for another outsized quarter putting us on target or in excess of our target for the year. And we do have further pipeline on the investments and sales front. So clearly, we've got a lot of work cut out for us for the remainder of the year, but I don't think I could have asked for a better start or a better market at this point to be conducting it in.","The sales in particular, produce a significant amount of net cash proceeds and capital gains, gains being on those 4 transactions alone greater than $225 million of capital gains on those 4 deals, and those are noncore value-add kind of deals, which I think just continues our tradition and reinforces our pedigree of being able to create these double-digit returns in a highly competitive market.","So for more color on that, let me turn it over to Andrew Mathias.","Andrew W. Mathias","Thanks, Marc. The core areas of investment activity was highlighted by 388 Greenwich, which Marc touched on. In addition, we announced several other acquisitions and dispositions continuing on our theme of accretively recycling capital. In somewhat of a pair trade, we sold our leasehold position and what is probably the last remaining IPO asset at a 4.7% cap rate, 673 First Avenue, and we'll reinvest the proceeds of that sale into a fee position at 635 Madison Avenue. Although, the going in cap rate is a bit below the cap rate we're selling 673 for, we're getting an enormous upgrade in terms of location, upside and long-term value in the fee position at 635 Madison. Our returns on 673 are truly incredible, a 13.6% unlevered IRR over the 16 or so year-period since our IPO. They speak for themselves.","We also announced several deals in the retail program centered around SoHo, the city's hottest submarket. Those deals were off market and featured in-place rents that are 50% and more below market and more opportunities to develop the space within those actual buildings.","Combined with our strategic investment into 530 Broadway, which closed during the first quarter, 115 Spring and 121 Greene Street give us some of the scale that we're targeting to achieve in the SoHo market. Again, continuing with the recycling theme, we also closed this quarter on our sale of our interest in 21-29 West 34th Street, booking a 55% levered IRR on our investment and we expect to close on the sale of our interest in 747 Madison Avenue shortly as well. As we continue to take profits on interest in retail assets we own across the portfolio.","With that, I'll pass the microphone onto Jim to dive into the numbers.","James E. Mead","Thanks, Andrew. I'm going to touch on the financing activities and our liquidity position and then turn it over to Matt to go over some of the numbers. We closed $1.4 billion in 3 financings this quarter, including mortgage financings on our office property at our 100 Park Avenue, and at the retail property at 724 Fifth Avenue. And notably, we took advantage of the demand from bank lenders for funded loans to expand our bank term loan facility by $383 million to a total $783 million, extending the maturity date and lowering the pricing of the facility by 25 basis points. This was an excellent execution that achieved a LIBOR spread that we believe was at least 10 basis points lower than any REIT at the BBB- credit rating. As we look forward, we'll be refinancing 388-390 Greenwich and expect that there will be sufficient proceeds to fully fund the entirety of the acquisition of our partner's interest.","So that, in combination with the other investments and dispositions we've discussed, leaves us in excess of our targeted $1 billion in liquidity. And so without any need to tap the equity markets for funding any of these activities.","Thanks. Let me turn the call over to Matt now, please.","Matthew Diliberto","Thanks, Jim. Obviously, we're very pleased with our first quarter results and outlook for the remainder of the year. We came out of the gates in 2014 with a flurry of activity that Marc, Andrew and Jim just spent some time walking through, which puts us in a position of raising our 2014 FFO guidance by $0.26 a share at the midpoint to $5.90 to $5.96 a share only 4 months into the year, equating to FFO growth of nearly 15% over last year.","In the first quarter, we saw operating performance as measured by occupancy and NOI in both the existing Manhattan and suburban portfolios that was in line and certainly ahead of our expectations. Renewed vacancy is nearly 100,000 square feet at 711 Third Avenue and 88,000 square feet at 810 Seventh Avenue. We put pressure on our first quarter occupancy in NOI but the strength of recent leasing helped alleviate that pressure and actually resulted in our first quarter same-store Manhattan occupancy exceeding our budget, putting us well on track to achieve an increase in our same-store Manhattan occupancy by 150 basis points by the end of the year.","And our same-store NOI growth of 1% on a cash basis and 2% on a GAAP basis was right in line of what we expected giving us confidence that we'd be able to meet our stated goal of achieving 3% to 4% cash in same-store NOI growth for 2014 as comparable NOI builds in the back half of the year.","The real catalyst to our upward guidance revision is the volume and timing of our real estate in debt and preferred equity investment activity. From an earning's perspective the most impactful real estate transaction is clearly the acquisition of our partners interest in 388-390 Greenwich Street which we anticipate closing in mid-May with financing in place.","Net of a one-time charge of about $4 million that we will need to take at closing, for an amortized cost related to the previous financing and acquisition of this size at this yield is an early highlight of the year and contributes roughly $0.14 of net FFO accretion in 2014 and even more in 2015.","In the debt and preferred equity portfolio, following a robust 2013, the first 4 months of 2014 have continued to provide a significant pipeline of opportunities to make new investments earlier in the year and at better yields than we originally projected, while the portfolio seismic fluctuate during the year, based on the current flow of activity, we projected the portfolio ends the year between $1.4 billion and $1.45 billion, roughly, where we anticipated. But the front loaded investment timing at better yields than the 8.5% we projected will be impactful and should result in $0.08 to $0.10 of accretion to full year FFO.","We expect to fund our incremental investment activity in part with further property sales, tapping into embedded equity at the asset level. Included in our initial guidance with the sales of 21-25 West 34th Street was closed in the first quarter and 747 Madison, which is expected to close during the second quarter.","While we have other opportunities to prove in the portfolio at attractive pricing had risen on the heels of the unbudgeted sales of the Arden portfolio in the first quarter and the sale of 673 First Avenue, which we expect to close in the next 30 days. We have several other assets currently out in the market for sale and anticipate being able to close at least 2 to 3 more dispositions before the end of the year. These sales will offset the FFO accretion for our investment activity by $0.03 to $0.05 per share.","Finally, during the first quarter, we recognized previously unaccrued interest income on a mezzanine investment that was roughly $7 million, or $0.07 a share greater than what we provided for in our initial guidance. This income was required to be accelerated based on the expected sale of the underlying property at a price well north of our last dollar of exposure.","With that brief summary, I'll turn it back over to Marc.","Marc Holliday","Okay, so we wanted to give everyone a brief overview today of our assessment of the quarter and the activities within, but we wanted to leave ample time to get into questions. I think, just to put a spotlight on it, the ability for us only 3 -- 4 months, I guess, 4.5 months after December investor to be able to come out with a guidance revision, and a guidance revision of this magnitude, I think is very telling about our feelings and belief about the momentum in the leasing market primarily in the mark-to-market, the accretion that we're realizing from our acquisitions and on basically, primarily if not exclusively, on a self-funded basis. The debt and preferred equity program, which continues to perform on kind of market-leading -- on a market-leading basis in this New York City market I think we're far and away the leader in subordinate. Debt provision, both in terms of volume and in terms of return to net business. And when you bring that all back, we felt that we had enough confidence in this market, and in the direction that the portfolio is going to come out with this earnings revision this early in the year. And as I said earlier, there's -- we have $1 billion-plus of liquidity that you've highlighted that will hopefully enable us to continue this momentum throughout the year.","So with that, let's turn it over to questions-and-answers.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] This comes from Jamie Feldman, Bank of America.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I was hoping you guys can just provide some more color on the leasing market. Just some more granularity in terms of, what size the tenants you're seeing the most activity from, whether they're small, they're big, they're start ups, they're established. They're looking for high rents or low rents, especially with supply coming online downtown out on the West side. Just how should we be thinking about what's really the sweet spot of the market right now?","Steven M. Durels","Jim, it's Steve Durels. The good news is I don't think there's a single theme to the demand, that's out there right now meaning that it's not limited to one part of town or one size of tenant the way it was a year or 2 ago. We're seeing tenants of size, large tenants that are out in the market, some driven by growth, some driven by expirations, some driven by consolidations. We're seeing higher price point tenants and within our portfolio, good examples of that are some of the pre-built spaces that we've done at 3 Columbus that have been leasing well. Some of the space is 600 in Lexington Avenue, which is one of our higher price point buildings. Where we had very good leasing activity this year. I think probably the best demand we've had since we've owned the building. And then continued activity on the lower price points as reflected down at the number of tours that we're getting at 180 Maiden Lane, where we're seeing a lot of Midtown tenants, shopping lower price points downtown. And then, the Midtown South market continues to be on fire. You saw the release today, where we had a corporate goal of leasing the penthouse at 635 Avenue of the Americas and we succeeded with that by leasing the top floor at $101 a square foot on a starting rent. Other than new construction at the highest price point that we achieved for a Midtown South building. So it's a little bit of everything all over town. I think it's driven by tenants who are hiring, tenants who feel good about their businesses and it's not limited to one industry.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, and then we'd -- Marc had mentioned a leasing pipeline. How does that shape up in terms of the same question.","Steven M. Durels","Yes, we've got demand right now from probably 5 or 6 sectors, I would say. We've got leases out with tenants in the finance world, marketing, legal, engineering, fashion, transportation. Those are probably the biggest demand we've got. I'd say the tenants that we are not in active negotiation with, but who we're seeing a lot of foot traffic from, in particular, are law firms right now probably more so than we saw last year. So it's -- though it seem to be there, at least within our portfolio, the big tenant demand.","Operator","And next is George Auerbach from ISI Group.","George D. Auerbach - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Andrew, you talked about the capital recycling so far in 2014. Do you get the sense of activity you'll see? And the market we'll see will be better this year than last? And if so, why do you think that's the case?","Andrew W. Mathias","How are you defining better by total volume? Or by price per foot or...?","George D. Auerbach - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I'd say volume and opportunity. It seems like in the first quarter and even in the fourth quarter, there was just more for you to do in both acquisitions than dispositions?","Andrew W. Mathias","Yes, I think it's extremely competitive out there and the pricing certainly in terms of price per foot I think this year will hurdle last year in terms of a better market volume, yet to be seen. So you got to see sort of what's going to come to market in the second half of the year, but we had the sale of the mobile building, which went to contract a couple of weeks ago to an individual entrepreneurial-type investor at really record-breaking price for a leasehold and a very large scale deal, the contract price there is rumored to be around $900 million. So I think year-to-date, we have seen $7.5 billion close, $9 billion under contract and about $5 billion more so on the markets. So it's very active out there. We're winning our fair share of deals. Most of our deals are off market like 388 Greenwich, like the retail deals I spoke about, but it's a very healthy environment for us right now to have a lot of success in.","George D. Auerbach - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Thanks. And also any color on the competitive landscape in the origination market? It didn't really impact yields in first quarter, but do you expect to see yield compression over the next 6 months?","Andrew W. Mathias","Let me ask David to answer that.","David Schonbraun","I think we've had a good run this quarter. And I think based on our pipeline, the next quarter or 2 may be as robust, or more robust that yields looking in line or even above, where we are. So I think just through our existing relationships and kind of be aggressive with capitals back and taking the whole thing down, we kind of have the same success we've had in other years. So I think we're comfortable with that even though there are more entrants into the marketplace, still I'd like to keep that competitive advantage and put out money at these returns.","Operator","Next, we have John Guinee, Stifel.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Steve, at the lower price point of the market, 180 Maiden Lane, a few other assets you might have, are you getting any competition from Jersey City? Is anybody considering actually going over to the other side of the Hudson?","Stephen L. Green","As best I can tell, most of the larger tenants that have been looking at Jersey City mostly used it as a stocking horse. We've seen a couple of big tenants, meaning 150,000, 200,000 square-foot guys, come through a door at 180 Maiden and been told that it was a discussion between the east side of downtown, the west side of downtown and Jersey. And I think in every one of those cases where we've seen those tenants, they ultimately turn their focus to stay in lower Manhattan. So, I mean, I've not heard or sensed that there's been much flight to the Jersey side.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then second question also for you, Steve, we got to Page 42 of the supplemental and it looks like a lot of roles in both your consolidated and your JV portfolio, a little bit of a potential rent, roll down based on asking rents in the consolidated portfolio, but a sizable rent roll up in the second quarter, 972,000 square-feet and the consolidated 254,000 square-feet in the joint venture. If you could just give us a little more color on what's happening with these sizable tenants?","Steven M. Durels","Well...","George D. Auerbach - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","If it's proprietary because you're in negotiations, just say so.","Steven M. Durels","No. Our biggest explorations, where we think that we're likely to lose the tenant or there'll be any material change in the rent, we sort of already been through those. It was Cranes at 711 Third Avenue, it was Draft at 810 Seventh Avenue -- 919 Third Avenue and it was PLI at 810 Seventh Avenue. There are no other really big guys out there, that I can recall other than AIG and Harper Collins, which, I guess, in my mind have already -- that was sort of a last year event, where we knew they were leaving and that's one of the reasons we bought those 2 buildings. But the rest of the portfolio, at this point, it's really about filling the vacancy that we already have. I don't think there's anybody expiring between now and the end of the year of any size so we don't expect to keep and see a rent increase on.","Operator","Next, Vincent Chao, Deutsche Bank.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just wanted to go back to rent spread this quarter which was quite strong. Just curious, just given your commentary, I think I know the answer, but just curious how broad-based those increases are, was there anything sort of maybe deal specific that kind of drove that number and how are you feeling about the 5% to 8% for the year?","Marc Holliday","Well, I think, we -- in our guidance, we increased that yesterday to 7% to 10%, so we're feeling having come out of the gates, little stronger-than-expected. I mean, I wouldn't read too much into to it because I don't think we're expecting mid-teens in the second quarter, but we didn't expect in the first quarter either so, it's a little bit of a crystal ball. But I think if you look out over the second quarter, you'll see mark-to-market that's probably more in line with our revised guidance. And too early to tell third and fourth quarter. But again, if we have good visibility through the first half of the year and that average for the first half of the year is up around 10%, that caused us to raise the guidance up to 7% to 10%, which is a pretty significant movement because 5% to 8% which it was previously was already aggressive for, I think, by any measure for commercial companies in its market. So we're -- we'd be happy to end the year and be able to report that we are within that strike zone and I think that based on the $1.4 million of pipeline we have in place, where we can at least better estimate where those numbers are going to be and for all the deals that are really not yet known that we'll be doing in the third and fourth quarters of this year, the market feels like that's about the right level where we'll be. There's no outlier deal or 2 that contributed to that 15%. We just -- every quarter, that number is going to bounce around based on what's expiring so it's not a -- I wouldn't read too much into it, other than I'd read more into our guidance of 7% to 10%, then I would read into the 15%.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And then just going onto the pipeline of investments that you guys -- that you mentioned. Just curious if you could give us some color on sort of the composition of that pipeline, and what are you looking at? It seems like retail was pretty active on the retail side here, but just curious what the pipeline looks like.","Marc Holliday","Our focus continues to be on retail. That's where we're seen in the best rent spreads and finding the most fertile ground for off-market deals. So I think you'll see some more retail deals executed. And looking at some office and residential deals too, but those areas are very competitive.","Operator","And next is David Toti, Cantor Fitzgerald.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Marc, I kind of want you to step back and talk about your structured finance portfolio, a little bit now that it's approaching about $1.5 billion. Can you just remind us sort of a guiding criteria if there is any, relative to return hurdles? Are you seeking to ladder in specific way? Or is it really just asset and relationship-driven?","Marc Holliday","So -- the last part of that question, David, just I didn't follow the last part.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Sorry, I guess, I'm just trying to understand that there's a -- if there's kind of a structural map as you build the portfolio out? Or is it more really opportunistic relative to the asset, the relationship and the return?","Marc Holliday","I mean, I think, this -- we're in 16th year of this program. And I would say that it's reasonably well defined from our perspective in terms of the kinds of assets we target, the kinds of return hurdles were looking for, which in today's market, I think, we had forecasted spreads, or yields on subordinate paper of about 8.5%, which we've been exceeding to date, so exceeding is a good thing. But I would always go with our guidance, rather than the actuals I think our guidance is our gut and feel as to where the market either is or will get to, throughout the year. Although we've been finding the ability to outperform that. The volumes are pretty much are on target, if you will, is what we have projected I think it was somewhere around $1.450 billion, $1.5 billion. In the past, we've talked about limiting the amount of investment in this particular business line to about 10%, which would be up close around $2 billion, so we're well within that, it always had been. I think we generally fluctuate somewhere around 5% to 6% maybe 7% or 8% at the high, and that really hasn't, except for some extreme moments in time, that's been largely consistent over the 15-year period. And we get -- we originate couple of hundred million dollars a quarter, but we get repayments. So I think the return hurdles we established based off our funding sources, so the funding sources for this are at slightly more expensive than for the equity component, but they're pretty efficient today in terms of the amount of equity and debt capital out there, looking for yield product, yield product is very much in vogue today. This is yield product in some of the best collateral out there in terms of how you can generate these returns nationally. I think our experience in Manhattan has been just heads and shoulders above most of the markets. And therefore, we're fortunate to be doing this in this market. We love the collateral pool we have. We have, I would guess the best relationships of any subordinate lender in town by far, which is why -- which is what keeps that business going at such a strong pace. Our market share, as an office owner is high, our market share as a lender it's even higher. So one business complements the other. And I think, that the collateral the target is pretty well specified, our relationships are strong. Our track records excellent and the returns are a couple of hundred basis points above the returns we look for in straight real estate because it is -- subordinate loan is a levered product, but I would say in terms of actual achievement, the returns in this business have been solidly well over 10% and I would say that represents excess return.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just a follow up on that. Given the sort of the growth of that platform and, again, I apologize I'm probably pulling questions out of my 2004 question list, but would you ever consider applying some of this business to sort of more of a broker concept where you're participating in maybe securitization, a machine of some sort? If you have the relationships and the absolute volume...","Marc Holliday","Well, I mean, that's are -- we do syndicate. And securitizations is just another form of syndication, as far as I'm concerned. So we are active, active syndicates. I think last year, I don't have the numbers in front of me, I think, we originated something like $1.7 billion originated, and we sold $1.3 billion and held, I guess, $400 million. So we love to syndicate. It's -- we prefer that we're not a securitization shop. We don't want to be a securitization shop, but having the ability to source and syndicate has an extraordinarily -- a shortening amount of indirect and direct benefits. Direct benefit is we -- it's profitability and higher yields on what we retain, but the indirect benefits are by delivering product to our relationships. We get product in return. It gives us broader access to the market, which helps the business grow and gives us more prominent names. So securitization, I would say, no, but to syndication efforts, definitely, yes.","Operator","Next is Manuel Coltron, Citi.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","It's actually Michael Bilerman. Marc, you talked about the exceedingly strong transaction market. Clearly, being able to sell into this market and glad being able to liquidate assets, and you talked about 2 to 3 more assets and I'm just curious, wholly-owned? Or joint venture? And sort of size because a Manhattan asset, especially, in your portfolio, it could be quite smaller, could be quite large. I'm just trying to get a sense of the total volume of proceeds? And potentially, how more aggressive you could get beyond 2 to 3 assets.","Marc Holliday","I think, it's -- Michael, it's pretty consistent with the guidance from the investor conference. We've got a couple of other deals we're looking at, which are generally wholly-owned, non-core, but of the smaller size. I mean, small is relative, there's nothing -- nothing in the portfolio that's small, but certainly on a relative basis of a smaller size, and whether we transact or not, on one or both, this year, we'll see. Obviously, we know we test the market. We try and get optimum pricing because these assets are hard to come by, so when you sell, you want to make sure you're -- you want to feel as if you're getting the right price and feel good about selling knowing that the next buyer is, obviously, buying with the expectation of making money. So we're very careful with it. We feel no pressure with it. We'll probably hang 2 properties out there. If we get our price, we'll transact it. If we don't, we don't. We've already done, I guess, close to 600 for the year. So that's probably somewhat in line with our guidance. Yes, net-net. I don't think you're going to see anything -- there's no statement coming down the road with a large scale billion dollar-plus kind of assets, but there is a continued focus on trying to prune and improve the portfolio and take money out of lower growth assets and then redeploy into higher growth assets.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then, maybe just coming back to Durels, just sort of on leasing. As you think about on lifting occupancy by the end of the year, I'm just curious, does that sort of exclude AIG and Harper Collins from what the current baseline? But even so, where is the growth coming from? And you think about the asset you're sitting in today, that occupancy has declined 660 basis points, big asset, I'm not sure if there's leasing going on there. I don't know how much of its 3 Columbus Circle. I don't know how much of it is sort of re-tenanting 7-Eleven, Third or 810 Seventh; where is the uplift coming that you're expected to drive through year end?","Steven M. Durels","It does exclude 180 and 10 East but the rest of the portfolio is rapidly filling it's a vacancy. The biggest chunks that we have of vacant space, where we feel good about -- if not filling all of it, filling a big chunk of it is 919 Third Avenue, where we have a 150,000 square-feet and we have active term sheet negotiations covering all of that space. 3 Columbus, where we have 150,000 square feet and we have either leases out or term sheets covering half of that space. Contrary to what the numbers may reflect, Graybar has actually been our most active building. It just doesn't reflect it in the Lease Commenced category yet, because of that deal we did with Metro-North for 260,000 square-feet and we have another 30,000 square feet of expansion space pending with them, and those leases just haven't commenced yet. Of that 260,000 square-feet, half of it was expansion space and my availability at Graybar today is down less than 2%. Hard as that may be to believe, Graybar was probably one of our weaker buildings 2 years ago, and is now our strongest building. We've raised rents in Graybar 3x over the past 6 months and are doing deals today in the mid-50s a square foot, whereas 1.5 year ago, we were doing rents in the high 30s, low 40s a square foot. So that's a little bit of granular response and then on the bigger side, we're seeing demand in the entire portfolio for vacant space, so I think that's where the lift is coming from.","Operator","Next, we have Jordan Sadler, KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Curious to sort of harken back a little bit to a discussion at the Investor Day regarding sort of tenants in the market. I mean, I'm hearing your comments, Steve, on the demand you're seeing. Things sound and seem to feel pretty good. Large tenants in the market, the guys that you guys had identified in one of your slides, a number of them from financials, legal and the TAMI sectors, and I know of or have heard of Macy's and Google, some others being added to the market, how is this dynamic affecting the market right now? I know there are some availabilities and some potential developments, et cetera, but are we setting up for a potential spike in rents or a broader spike in rents in Manhattan?","Marc Holliday","We're not underwriting a spike, most of our -- I'd say most of our competitors are and they're underwriting spikes that we see on the loan submissions, that are between 25% and 35% over the next 3 to 5 years, so very aggressive rental spikes. I mean, our whole way in which we've oriented this portfolio is about repositioning and leasing of vacant space and creating hundreds of millions of dollars of kind of identifiable earnings, without regard to any kind of rent spike. Rent spike would just be coming on top of that. So the earnings increase today is without regard to any rent spike or any rent increase from where we are today. We don't see a rent spike at the moment. However, the market would tell you that the next 2 to 3 years, given this dwindling amount of space, our portfolio being, I think, typical of that should push rents certainly higher than 3% to 5%, which is what it's been since the trough and, I guess, you could create a scenario for a couple of years about size increases between 5% and 10%. Rental increases, in certain product type, it is happening today, right? So the lease at 635 Sixth, which no one's mentioned yet, tripled, maybe Steve did. Yes, tripled -- $80 a foot for the regular floors, over $100 a foot for the penthouse space. I mean, that's clearly rent spike kind of material, and I would say, other of our Midtown South properties are increasing, not at 3% to 5%, but at probably, you can measure it, 10% to 20%. It does depend on which properties, which buildings, but we are looking at 27 million square feet, overall. And in that regard, we're modeling that out at returns that we think -- at increases that'll probably be at or exceed 5% for the next couple of years. So we have been talking about another 25% on top of the 25% we've already realized since the trough, to get back to and ahead, in certain cases, of peak level rents. We are there in certain properties, I think we will be there in most to all of our properties the next year or 2. So it's a good market and it's a good market, notwithstanding the overhang from the West Side, which has taken a couple of big tenants. But we sign, probably, 250 leases a year. So in the past 2 years, let's say, last year actual, this year projected, 500 leases, I can count on one hand the number of conversations where Hudson Yards was a main competitor for those tenants because the meat of our market, which is maybe anywhere between 10,000 and 50,000 feet, as \"the average,\" it's just not looking at multi-floor tenancy in new building Hudson Yards says, at their option. So we still feel it's a very competitive market. It's a good landlord market and we're still projecting 96% overall occupancy for the same-store portfolio, which started the year, I think, at 94%, Matt?","Matthew Diliberto","94.5%","Marc Holliday","So that's 200 basis points of positive increase in the same-store portfolio that we're projecting, which is a lot of leasing.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I appreciate that color. I had one another. At the other end of the spectrum, on 635 Madison, what's the play there? It's a little bit of a head-scratcher for me. I remember -- I think, the last time you guys were buying, encumbered fees were -- it was 2007, maybe. I'm just kind of what's the play on that deal?","Marc Holliday","Well, I think it's across the street from an asset we own at 625 Madison, so -- and the lease holder on 635 happens to be the fee owner on our asset at 625, so there's some potential synergies there. It's a very good receiver for our significant gains from 673 First Avenue, and it's a prime corner. So there's a significant revaluation. The rent on the existing position is significantly under market. So it's a revaluation opportunity in sort of the medium term, but it's our job to go out and create value in that position in the shorter term.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Is the GAAP cap rate below the 4 7 [ph] that you referenced on the sale or that's the cash gap?","Marc Holliday","The GAAP cap for both -- both are below, GAAP and cash are right on top of one another because the rent is flat until the next revaluation under the fee position.","Operator","Next is Vance Edelson, Morgan Stanley.","Vance H. Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just going back to the rent spreads and the higher mark-to-market expectations in Manhattan. Could you touch on pricing strengths by submarket? I know you mentioned it's hard to pinpoint any specific drivers in terms of overall demand, but does anything stand out when it comes to pricing, when we think about Midtown versus Midtown South versus downtown? Or is that also just strong across-the-board?","Steven M. Durels","Broadly, I would say it's strong across-the-board. I think, downtown, you've seen rents rise, I think, to a lot of peoples' surprise, rents have been rising kind of disproportionately, as a lot of the big blocks have gotten soaked up and as the World Financial Center is starting to lease up and there's a lot of the big blocks on the East Side of downtown, have found tenants or starting to find tenants from Midtown tenants, Nature America, Revlon, being examples of that, who've gone downtown looking for price relief-type space. But as that inventory gets soaked up and space diminishes and the rents are starting to escalate up. Midtown South, the demand is insatiable. So if you've got the product and you're putting the capital into the building, then there's a ready supply of tenants that are willing to pay for it and it's not just the TAMI market, the technology guys. But it's really traditional Midtown tenants who want to be cool Midtown South tenants, and they're willing to pay the price. The problem there is just a lack of supply of space or lack of buildings with large enough footprints or enough inventory that rationalize an investment to take advantage of the opportunity. And lastly, I think, Grand Central is starting to get a lot more traction as far as tenant demand and rents are increasing in Grand Central slowly. The best barometer of that being the Graybar Building, as I mentioned earlier. But Grand Central, which is probably a laggard over the past -- in 2013, that and -- oh, I see, that's Sixth Avenue. Sixth Avenue, today is, tremendous amount of activity on Sixth Avenue. If we had inventory at 1185 Avenue of the Americas, I can rent it for $10 a foot more today than we were doing deals last year. I just -- the buildings pretty well locked up. We're talking a few tenants about trying to recapture space in order to take advantage of the tenant demand. So it's a bit of a shotgun approach, but broad stroke, there's good demand everywhere and pricing is increasing. In certain some markers, more than others, but I think most landlords have a view and most brokers share it, that rents are on the rise.","Vance H. Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, and that's very helpful. And then, shifting gears, could you just touch on the suburbs and the improvement you're seeing there, occupancy starting to move up, months of free rent was down a bit. Maybe just bring us up-to-date on how you feel about the suburbs, in general, right now?","Isaac Zion","This is Isaac Zion. There's continued improvement across-the-board. In Westchester, in particular, we're seeing more demand from the health and health tech sector and biotech. In Stanford, it's financial services, general corporates. The activity levels in the 5,000 to 10,000 square-foot range are clearly improving, and we anticipate into the next quarter to have probably about 150,000 to 200,000 square feet of leasing as well, and mark-to-market to be about the same, flat to up a little bit. So things are generally positive, it's just the pace is a little bit slower than the city, obviously.","Operator","Next, we have Brendan Maiorana, Wells Fargo.","Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","In guidance, original guidance, or in your current guidance, I think, Matt, you laid out that $0.14 is higher from 388-390 deal offset by $0.03 to $0.05, or, call it, $0.04, the midpoint of dispositions, that sounds like maybe later in the year. And so, I guess, if I think about that, it's $0.10 up in terms of net property acquisitions. And some of that is driven by, timing with the 388-390 deal early in the year. Some of it is probably cap rate arbitrage, where you've got a higher cap rate on the 388-390 deal versus what you sell. But it seems like there's probably an expansion in the asset base, also. So, I guess, the question is, are you comfortable funding that expansion in the asset base with incremental debt? Or do you think, at some point, ATM issuance or an equity would be needed as you think about the investments for the year?","Marc Holliday","I mean, I think, right now we're focused on liquidity as a benchmark of sort of whether we are adequately funded and from a liquidity standpoint, and remember, the sales of assets that we're talking about also released large capital or large gains, as Mike had pointed out. So I think, from an overall liquidity standpoint, with the financing of 388 effectively paying for the acquisition and with the other things that we're doing, we have ample liquidity through the year. That doesn't -- so we're not -- we don't need to go to the equity markets to raise any money for liquidity purposes. We'll look at the market and look at what our need is, going forward, as we go through the year. And that will determine our stance on new equity, but I think the important takeaway here is that we really don't need equity to fund the plan that we have in place.","Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, just a question, probably for Andrew. But the retail deals, it seemed like the details in the press release yesterday were a little light. Just wondering if you can provide any color on size of those acquisitions and maybe current yield or longer-term yield expectations?","Andrew W. Mathias","We're unfortunately limited by contractual obligations until we close up those deals, which are expected to be this year, one of them in the fall and one of them later in the summer. So we'll be able to release further details at the time we close those deals.","Operator","Next, we have Michael Knott, Green Street Advisors.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Curious if there's anything to read into the slightly shorter lease terms this quarter? And then, also, Steve, just curious if you can comment on the trends in lease concessions?","Steven M. Durels","No, you shouldn't read anything into it. It was a -- we had a number of tenants that -- it was a hodgepodge of reasons. We know, in one case, we intentionally were lining up expirations on the floor, so therefore, we held the term back. In others, it was some tenants that wanted to do short-term because they had some growth expectations. But there's no broad trend that you should take away, just the opposite, quite frankly, is that we're more pushing just to reject short-term deals of late, in favor of holding out for longer-term deals, because we think the market and the leverages is our side to demand that. In concessions-wise, I think, if it's people who are trying to tighten it up, I think there's greater willingness of tenants that is to pay higher rents, in exchange for not taking it -- a reduction on the concessions. But I think the free rent's slowly getting tightened up a little bit. I think, there are fewer a build-to-suits where the capital sort of exceeds the typical allowance for wall space of $60, $65 a foot. So you see more deals where capping the capital, but it's -- that's still a tough fight right now. I think there's a greater ability to push rents as opposed to rein in concessions.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's interesting and somewhat backwards from what the normal course is, correct?","Steven M. Durels","Yes. And I think, that must be the world we're coming out of, where -- tenants who are capital sensitive. After the recession, it's certainly contrary to prior cycles but coming out of the recession where businesses were capital sensitive, there's a little bit of hangover of that mentality.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","And then, Andrew and Marc, just curious, the pricing on 673 First seemed pretty attractive. Seems like cap rates have been trending down further. Just curious if the fact that it's a partial user sale contributed sort of pricing now? Or should we read into it that cap rates in Manhattan have continued to trend lower even just over the last couple of months?","Andrew W. Mathias","I think, both. I mean, there's an incentivized buyer here, but I think that was roughly a market transaction for them. I don't view that it would have been a materially different result one way or the other had we taken it to market. There's a grab out there for good solid well-leased assets. This is one of those. It's non-core for us, just given its size and location. But for a lot of buyers who are kind of structurally priced out of the large scale Midtown Manhattan office market, this would be a highly attractive asset with great credit tenants and the ability to finance that project accretively well below the 4 7 cap rate would probably support a price right around there.","James E. Mead","If you look at the pricing on the Mobil building, in fact, that as well is a long-term leasehold and that is supportive of this kind of levels or even a little tighter.","Andrew W. Mathias","In that, obviously , Mobil was not a user. So you have 2 great, fresh data points all over the past week or 2 to go by. I think that we could conclude that there's a great investor demand and there's also big institutional user demand from -- which we've been saying, from the hospitals and from the schools.","Operator","And next, is Ross Nussbaum, UBS.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Marc, on the retail deals that you just announced and the ones that you might have in the Hopper, are you going to be partnering with Jeff Sutton on those? Or you going to be flying solo on them?","Marc Holliday","Yes, on the Greene Street deal, we'll partner with Jeff. And the Spring Street deal, likely not. Although we haven't had decided the full capitalization of those deals quite yet.","Steven M. Durels","As we've said in the past, it's really case dependent. Generally, most of the retail we own, we are partners with Jeff. We continue to partner with them on deals like 650 Fifth and which of the 2 here -- Greene Street deal. We're going to be partners with Jeff, so that's still -- that joint venture continues to produce great results and a great relationship. But not every single asset fits the matrix for us, or for Jeff, so occasionally, as in the case of Spring Street, well, that one we're purchasing ourselves whether we JV it down the road or not is, I guess, an issue for a later date.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And on the leasing front, we've been hearing that Bank of New York and Time are potentially close to taking 1 million square-feet around the World Financial Center. I'm wondering if that's what you're hearing, and then, if that's true, it would seem to open up your prospects for 180 Maiden taking off the far west side of downtown, if that's getting leased up, make's your life's a lot easier.","Steven M. Durels","I would agree with everything you just said. And add to it that, as they're finding -- if they make those 2 deals, I think that, basically, we'll lock up all of their big blocks of space at the World Financial Center, and the word is, that they're raising their rents in the center, which can only help things further as far as the east side having even that much more of a competitive advantage from a pricing perspective it.","Operator","And next, we have Alexander Goldfarb, Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Two quick ones. First, Matt, you addressed the extra investment income from the acceleration on the mark on that sale. The other property income that was $14.5 million was up considerably from the historic run rate. Was there anything -- what was in there? Was there one-timer stuff? Or was that a run rate for this year?","Matthew Diliberto","We had a promotive of about $7 million recognized in the first quarter coming into the year. We provide in our guidance for expected promotes or lease termination income, as best as we can project them, so that's what's in the first quarter.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay, so you guys got a double positive there in the first quarter, on that side --","Matthew Diliberto","Both are positive, yes.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","You got the promote and you got the acceleration on the preferred position, so that was good. On 1 Vanderbilt, how comfortable are you guys sort of emptying out that assemblage and starting demolition ahead of getting approvals?","Marc Holliday","We've made no such -- we're in the process of getting the approvals and we're certainly in dialogue with the administration, trying to get that. We've set the building up and there are selected areas we have begun termination proceedings, but I would say, it's been very slow, very measured. And we'll just have to see how that plays out through the balance of this year in terms of the entitlements. That building will be developed or redeveloped, there's no question that we will do that. I think, the question is, what will be built there and when, is the question we're still grappling with and that'll weigh in heavily on the timing of the actual vacate to the tenants.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay, so the point is that you wouldn't look to sort of emptying it out and demo the site before approvals. You're going to sort of keep some income there until you get approvals.","Marc Holliday","You know what, for reasons, I can't get into on the phone, I can't get into that exactly.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","I got you.","Marc Holliday","What our strategy is going to be, what our timing is going to be, we have a definite decision to move ahead and develop or redevelop this property, that's happening. And the timing is going to be largely predicated on the receipt of the entitlements, but with that said, we are -- we have every expectation of building this building at 1 Vanderbilt. We're optimistic we're going to get the zoning, it's part of East Midtown, or work through some other mechanism and we're very much focused in on it and it would be a great thing for Grand Central. It'll be a great thing for the city, for the MTA, to see this building built and everybody that we presented it to, with the administration, the civics, the neighborhood community, I think, everybody seems to be very much in favor of having a new building built, not just on the West side, not just the World Trade Center, but one right smack in the middle of Grand Central where you have one of the 2 busiest commuter hubs in New York City and it's only getting bigger with East Side Access. So -- and the thing we have to face is building that without subsidy, whereas, a lot of the other developments are with subsidy, makes it, certainly, more economic and easier, but we are prepared to move forward on a full market rate based development, on a site that is perfect for the building we've designed, with a lot of -- with a lot of benefits for the city and MTA, and it's a very special occasion. So we're doing it, but the granularity of when and how and what kind of income will be in place this year, next year, we can't really get into that.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

And hiring to date in most major sectors continue the pace as the job space continues to diversify away from the FIRE sector in New York City.","We were very busy this quarter in support of our business plan in all areas of SL Green. We signed 40 leases, covering more than 500,000 feet this quarter. Well ahead of projections as leasing pay shows no signs of slowing up.","We closed on the sale of 521 Fifth Avenue, concluding our very successful history with that building, which began with a mezzanine loan in 1999, continued to an equity acquisition, then recapitalization by a joint venture and then an additional recapitalization by a joint venture and ends with our sale to Savanna generating a 13.4% IRR over our 13-year equity hold period for the asset. Not easy to generate 13-plus compounded returns over that long a hold period but SL Green found a way.","We also finally converted our structure investment in 460 West 34th Street into a controlling equity interest in the property, coupled with efficient acquisition financing and the masterstroke of signing First Republic Bank to a major lease of the property prior to closing.","We expect a newly redeveloped 460 West 34th Street to become a signature asset for us in the far west side. Also, in the quarter, we acquired the remaining interest in 110 Greene Street, an asset that's performed very well for us and we believe has significant upside yet to be achieved.","In the DPE portfolio, we originated more than $130 million this quarter, with debt markets remaining highly liquid. One Vanderbilt construction remained ahead of schedule where we will turn the face -- the first space over to tenants next month and the topping out ceremony for the building is planned for September. The lease we announced with private equity firm Sentinel Capital Partners brings us to nearly 60% leased more than a year ahead of opening our TCO.","With the portfolio performance consistently strong and stock price continuing to trade at a significant discount to NAV, we remain staunchly committed to an aggressive share buyback program. We successfully purchased 1.3 million additional shares this quarter, continuing to rely on dispositions to fund the buybacks prudently and anticipate continuing this program if conditions remain unchanged. The leasing pipeline remains robust at over 1 million square feet and we would clearly expect to exceed our annual targets on leasing volume and mark-to-market based on leasing to date and pending transactions.","The real estate business is as active as we have seen it in the dog days of summer here and all our various disciplines here at SL Green are busy executing on the business plan.","The development teams are building One Vanderbilt, 609 Fifth, 460 West 34th Street, 2 Herald and 185 Broadway and heavy and planning on 1 Madison and others. The operations teams are dealing with blackouts and heat waves, the leasing teams are generating great transaction volume, the investment team is buying, selling, lending and scouring the world for the next great source of capital and the finance team is making sure it all stays on business plan. We appreciate all of their efforts.","And with that, we're happy to answer any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Manny Korchman of Citi.","Emmanuel Korchman","Andrew, you ended with a point on scouring the world for capital. Just wondering what your sort of current uses of that capital are. Is it all that construction that you talk about? Is it going out and trying to acquire another building? Where that is? And sort of where you're seeing the brightest spots for that capital right now?","Andrew Mathias","Well, I would say we're using it across all those various disciplines. So, in the DPE portfolio, we're using efficient senior capital to try to lever up our returns in the mezzanine position. As owners, we're bringing in JV partners. So that's where that capital comes into play. As sellers, often times we're selling to that capital so we'll meet -- we met in Israel with a group that we wound up selling a building to downtown in the past. So, I'd say, in the last six months, our teams have been in Asia, the Middle East, Europe, Canada and across the United States, meeting with different sources of capital. Actually David, you met with some South American capital here in the office too. So, I would say we have most of the continents covered and there is still an enormous amount of interest in New York City from both debt and equity capital. People still view it as the safest haven for their money and a lot of new capitals looking for ways to get into the market with every group that kind of steps to the sidelines as we're full up on allocation a new group seems to come forward.","Emmanuel Korchman","Maybe this is one for Matt. While looking at your spending needs over the next couple of years, you obviously have the big projects, which we've been through. You got that $300 million at 460 West 34th, the total share. What about some of the sort of updates or brightening the buildings, like 625, Matt? How do we think about how much money is going to be spent on sort of all those types of buildings over the next couple of years?","Matthew DiLiberto","Sure. So, most of our development projects are funded with financing that we've put in place already. So, One Vanderbilt, the equity financing, we completed in the second quarter. So, we have no more equity funding to put into that project, that's all now through the construction financing. 460 will be construction financed. 185 Broadway is construction financed. Those are the largest near-term projects. 625 Madison, and 609 Fifth -- sorry, we have 609 Fifth in process. That's also financed. 625 Madison really until we have some line of sight to what happens with the ground rent reset, we won't be doing anything in earnest there and 1 Madison is further out. So, from a funding perspective, we are -- everything is funded at this point or spoken for and capital throughout the rest of the portfolio given that it's all redeveloped is actually at historic lows and you're talking about just base building or nonrevenue enhancing capital. So, our funding plan over the next couple of years, we also are generating a lot of free cash flow is in great shape.","Operator","And next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb of Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander Goldfarb","So, two questions. First, Matt, just maybe looking at where you guys are trending year-to-date, it looks like on FFO you guys are sort of trending towards the upper end of your current guidance range. I think you outlined a few investor days, some potential for more lease term fees that may or may not happen. JVs that may or may not happen but it looks like on a run-rate basis, you're trending towards the upper end. So maybe you could just talk about what some of the negatives, if you will, or what some of the headwinds may be in the second half that would get you lower in the range versus something that would boost you either to the high end or maybe even above?","Matthew DiLiberto","Sure. So, for the first half of the year, on our numbers, we're running a $0.01 or $0.02 ahead just on that first 6 months. If we look at over the balance of the year, we are still squarely within our range, which is why we have not adjusted guidance at this point. We've had some positives in the first half of the year, some income events that we didn't anticipate and some performance in the portfolio that's better-than-expected but offsetting that to the balance of the year, you mentioned lease termination income. We had $12 million wired into our guidance, we've recognized just over $5 million so far this year but unclear whether any of that $7 million remaining will come through and if so, how much. We also layered into our guidance joint ventures of both 1 Madison and a further joint venture of One Vanderbilt, which may or may not happen this year. We did market JV interest in One Vanderbilt this year. We elected not to move forward at this point and 1 Madison, we shall see. We had between $15 million and $20 million of fee income off of those JVs laid into our guidance. For the balance of the year, we have not recorded any of that thus far. So, all told, keeping us in our guidance range for the balance of the year.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. And then the second question is just on the buybacks, which you guys have been very clear, your match funding, you got The News Building out there, which presumably once that sells will fund more stock, but at the same time, you guys have spoken about reducing the DPE and maybe using that to buy back stock. So maybe you could just update us on where you stand. I think you had $400 million of buybacks and guidance. But just where you stand on reducing DPE, and then also just given where the stock is would seem like rather attractive to be out buying meaningfully.","Andrew Mathias","On the DPE front, we are wire repayment bringing down the DPE balances. We've gotten actually some repayments that were expected since the close of the quarter and we plan to continue taking some additional repayments throughout the year. So, we do expect that balance to trend lower with the stock price where it is. We may very well elect not to reinvest it into new DPE originations or as much as we had planned on and instead allocate those funds for stock buyback but...","Matthew DiLiberto","In addition to that, the nearer-term use of the funds because we are trying to match fund buybacks with asset sales is repayment of debt, particularly our line of credit. Our line balance is higher than we historically keep it as at the end of the quarter, so in the near-term, we're using those DPE repayments to pay down the line.","Operator","And next question comes from John Kim of BMO Capital Markets.","Piljung Kim","On the discussion on global capital into New York. I was wondering, the public markets are basically the same as the private market valuations and any of the New York office REITS are incorrect. And I'm wondering if that has influenced pricing at all in the private markets?","Andrew Mathias","Short answer, not at all. I think the private market players that we speak to don't really look to repricing as any kind of indicator of the market. They view it as somewhat divorced from reality or not an indicator, a leading indicator or even an indicator of where the spot market stands. They're long-term investors and they're only interested in their own long-term returns. Unfortunately, the volatility and repricing make it somewhat difficult to attract new capital into actual REIT equities but building equities, the demand is still very strong out there. You have to look no further than the transactions for 521 Fifth, for 540 Madison, for 360 Lexington, the list goes on and on. The private markets have spoken very strongly that there is still enormous demand for New York City real estate.","Piljung Kim","And do you have any conversations with the capital sources as far as they could buy assets on one level but they could buy capital into your stock at a much discounted value? And are those contributions happening?","Andrew Mathias","All the time, I would say, and that was the genesis of my prior comment, which is, they view the volatility and the necessity to mark-to-market in REIT stocks as anathema to long-term real estate investing where they don't have the same issue. So unfortunately, as we go meet with these guys, everybody wants to own -- fortunately, I guess and unfortunately, everybody wants to own direct real estate and the REITs, the volatility has scared away a lot of these investors.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nick Yulico of Scotiabank.","Nicholas Yulico","I guess, Steve Durels, you mind giving a little update on the leasing market trends you're seeing? And then, I guess, tech, feels like it's getting a lot more active in the city. I know it's early but maybe you can talk about early interest in 1 Madison?","Steven Durels","Sure. Just a comment on tech, the TAMI sector was 40% of the leasing for the second quarter in Manhattan. So, it's clearly a big driver of leasing. So, both TAMI, financial services is still active in the marketplace and coworking continues to be a driver as well. We're seeing demand across-the-board in all the buildings and I guess a couple of examples to talk about specifically. One Vanderbilt has continued to be extremely active with half a dozen active proposals being traded with prospective tenants. So, we're hopeful that we'll land one or two of those and safely hit our 65% lease-up target for the end of this year. We've got a very strong pipeline of -- as Andrew said, well over 1 million square feet. That pipeline has been growing since the first quarter, dominated by both the three major sectors of legal, TAMI and finance and across all price points, we're busy as well. We're starting to see some early renewals, driven partly by tenant expansions throughout the portfolio. So, we've got a couple of big deals in the hopper that we're trading paper with some tenets, driven by early renewals and we're seeing new tenants come into the portfolio as well. Concessions, as we said last quarter, have leveled off. We haven't seen any movement off of that. And rents are modestly up.","Nicholas Yulico","That's helpful. And then I guess a question for Andrew or Matt. As we think about -- look at the portfolio and a lot of people look at your top tenant page and they see buildings where you have some move outs over the next several years. I think we know it's got both for Madison, for others it's not as clear. Even if you pick a building like, say, 1185 Avenue of the Americas, what is the thought process there? Are you willing to ride this out and deal with the retenanting? Or can you figure out that maybe it's better to try and sell the building, let someone else deal with the releasing CapEx and what type of market is there for bars to be buying assets like that right now?","Steven Durels","Well, before either Andrew or Matt respond to this, let me give you a little color as to what is in the market on the some of those buildings. 1185, we're close to going to a lease for a 2-floor tenant for some of that early renewal. 753rd Avenue, we just put a lease out for almost 100,000 square foot for a tenant for some of that space that's rolling off in a couple of years. So, all of those buildings where we have roll 753rd, 919 Third Avenue in particular, which seems to be on everybody's inquiry list are perfectly suited at the right price points in great locations with great assets to be extremely competitive within the market and we're already seeing tenant demand well in advance of any of that space rolling out.","Andrew Mathias","Yes. I would say we see a lot of that roll as opportunity. What we do, I mean, 220 East 42nd Street is a good example. That building had a ton of roll, we redeveloped the building, leased it up to visiting nurse services and young adult institute and a bunch of other great tenants. Now we have the asset on the market for sale. So, I don't think we would look to sell because we're afraid of having some vacancy. That's still our core business is redeveloping those buildings, bringing in new tenants, moving up the rent roll, hopefully, and sort of making the assets better. So, we're more likely to redevelop any of those assets and then sell to a core buyer then try to sell to a redevelopment buyer is going to require a higher return.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Guinee of Stifel.","John Guinee","Just a couple of nit questions. Steve, you'd mentioned the 1185 Avenue of the Americas, but I think you had a big lease out there. At the same time, that has -- it looks like the final year of operating lease, ground lease is 2043. Is there a strategy to get at that ground lease and get to the fee sooner than later? Or how do you think about the relatively short-term ground leases these days?","Andrew Mathias","Well, John, I'd say, we're always in dialogue with the fee owners of our various lease hold positions. And it's always a test of will to try to figure out kind of the right time because obviously, the fee owner wants to get the asset at the end of the lease in the best condition possible and the leaseholder also wants as much term to offer to prospective tenants. So those dialogues are always ongoing and 1185 is certainly an asset that's on the radar screen but there's nothing -- no further detail to report at this point but we're always constantly in dialogue with fee owners.","John Guinee","And then just another one. Looks like your 4 Suburban asset is about 1.1 million square feet, some at drive, et cetera. You're levering up to the tune of $229 million, which is about $208 a foot. What's the thought process there on an asset, which I think is on your for-sale list?","Andrew Mathias","Yes. There we saw a -- in a very efficient capital provider and decided to take advantage of it, much the same way that we did in Landmark Square in Stamford with the loan we have on that building from JP Morgan Chase. It is still part of the disposition plan; however, this was an efficient aggressive bid from a lender that we decided may at least we'll take care of the capitalization in the short term and may be very attractive to a future buyer as the loan is assumable in the future.","Operator","Our next question comes from Craig Mailman of KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Craig Mailman","Matt, maybe I just want to go back to your earlier comment on the process you guys ran for additional joint venture One Vandy and the decision not to proceed. Can you kindly just give a little bit more color on the reason why?","Andrew Mathias","Yes. I think just the -- short answer, the leasing activity was too good at the time and Mark and I really feel the closer we get to opening and if we can feel like we want to leg it out to opening, the higher price a we're going to get for the building. It's -- you take a discount for construction risk that we really don't view as a risk because the jobs 100% bought and there's not a lot of variability between now and opening. You take a list -- a discount for space left to lease that we see the leasing activity on and we feel highly confident in our ability to get leased. And then obviously, you see a discount because the observation deck is -- the operations are still speculative at this point. So we really -- as we sat and considered it, we had some very aggressive offers and we really felt that we weren't maximizing the potential of the building for sort of a short-term use that we felt was better off pulling it back and reintroducing it in the future for joint venture once we get closer to stabilization.","Craig Mailman","That's helpful. And then Steve, just curious on what you're seeing on some of these tenant expansions? Or just leasing in general in terms of tenant space uses. Is it materially changed one way or another in terms of kind of space per employee?","Steven Durels","No. I think people continue to migrate to a more open plan environment with a dense operation, although we continue to hear people concluding that they can't intensify or it's not really as successful at densifying as much as people at one time thought they could. So, their sort of idea of going down to 100 square foot per employee is -- was always kind of wishful thinking a lot. A lot of the tenants that are coming to our portfolio where they're changing their layouts. They're ending up at sort of anywhere from the 200 to 225 square feet per employee. That's when they're in an open plan environment, that's a good metric that I think people have been landing on. Once they factor in communal space and meeting space and support space. But it's clearly still a lot of businesses are changing how they use their office space compared to 5 or 10 years ago and I don't think that's going away.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck of Wells Fargo.","Blaine Heck","Just a follow-up on the private market and investment sales discussion. Some conversations we've had with brokers and the market suggest that there's more interest in core plus and value-add deals than core this year. Just wondering if that's what you guys are seeing on the market as well? And if there are any implications for pricing within those segments of the market?","Andrew Mathias","Yes. I would've characterized 521 as a fairly poor deal, and certainly, 30 Hudson Yards, which is a sale leaseback is about as core as you can get. 540 Madison had some vacancy. It was about 80% occupied or 80%?","Matthew DiLiberto","Not 80%. 85%.","Andrew Mathias","85% occupied. So, I don't really -- we see demand really at every level, core, core plus and value-add is basically development here. And there is still development side at 520 Fifth Avenue just got recapitalized as well. So, I think we're seeing strong demand across each sector of property investing.","Blaine Heck","Okay. That's fair. And then given your decision on foregoing the JV partner and One Vandy for now. Can you talk about the process related to getting a partner at 1 Madison or whether you'd reconsidered that as well?","Andrew Mathias","No. There's no -- we haven't commenced that process. I'd say we're really trying to fine-tune the exact plan for the building, which we're very close to doing so we can present somebody with a model -- an economic model that'll meet their expectations. Hard to go with a blank canvas and we've had a lot of different opinions and testing on different levels of expansion at the building. There's the base building, which is great, 1 million foot building and then there's obviously everything up to new development on top and we're running all the different scenarios there, while Steve is out having tenant conversations as well. So, the building is fully in the market for leasing but has not been in the building yet for joint venture, and I would just say, it's still second half of the year or if it trips to early next year type of exercise.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Sakwa of Evercore ISI.","Stephen Sakwa","I guess just following up on some of the conversations and questions around some of the tenant move outs. Matt, can you maybe speak to some of the, I guess, leasing upside or opportunities or leases that may not be so obvious that could replace some of that lost income like the Polo lease at the end of the year or Cr\u00e9dit Suisse coming off? What are some of the net positives that we should be looking at on the other side?","Matthew DiLiberto","Yes. We're going to spend some time, Steve. But in December, laying out in a more fulsome way. The next several years I think of upside coming out of some of these properties. Not the least of which are -- you're going to start to see income off 609 Fifth Avenue later this year as the retail portion, that opens up, then expect the office portion sometime next year. One Vanderbilt will be turning over space as Andrew said next month and if you expect the year so buildout, we'll see some income off of that next year. 625 Madison, we're losing Polo at the end of the year but then it goes into a redevelopment capitalization kind of structure until we retenant the building. So, there is an offset to the NOI that's lost there. And then we have the leasing that's going on this year. We're almost 1 million square feet through our goal. There are properties like 220 and 919 and some of the other Third Avenue properties that Steve mentioned that are going to be contributing as well headed into next year. So, on the redevelopment properties alone, offsetting some of the potential move outs, we're going to lay out the growth profile of those and give more detail in December.","Stephen Sakwa","Okay. And then I guess just going back to the asset sale of 220. Can you just sort of talk about the timing and kind of the interest level and when you think that asset could ultimately get sold?","Andrew Mathias","Well, we certainly expect this calendar year to get it sold, Steve. The interest has been great, tours are ongoing. Obviously, it's summer so got to get everybody through and give them a chance. But we would expect in -- hopefully in third quarter to have an agreement there depending on what kind of bids we get. Look, we're in a great position because we're sellers but we're not for sellers on any of this product. So, we're going to evaluate the bids versus all the other capital alternatives we're working on now and decide which is the most efficient for us.","Stephen Sakwa","Okay. And then just on the Westchester assets, I know you put the mortgages on but just from a timing and interest-level perspective, is that looking like that might get pushed out to 2020 from a sales perspective?","Andrew Mathias","No. We're still hoping to get some more assets sold this year for sure. The Stamford, Connecticut asset specifically. And in the balance, we'll address timing is not as certain there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vikram Malhotra of Morgan Stanley.","Vikram Malhotra","Just wanted to focus a bit on street retail. The assets you bought back, they were where you made investments in the DPE book, and then 106 Spring. Any update? I know there was potentially a couple of tenants that you were prospecting for some of those assets. And then just related to that, is your view still that Madison Street retail is bottoming?","Andrew Mathias","Sure. The assets, the 106 Spring, the 133 Green and 712 Madison, the 3 assets. Each is a different situation. 106 Spring, we've signed the tenant through the holiday season there while we do a sort of more fulsome worldwide marketing for a longer-term tenant. 133 Green and 712 are both occupied now, pretty much through the holiday season. So, there hasn't been -- 106 is the only one that's currently vacant and we filled it. Albeit on a temporary basis. So, we still feel good about our basis and those assets and the level of interest from tenants and we do feel strongly that Madison has bottomed as you say, there's a good core of demand out there, from different tenants and there's a lot more activity on the street. So, when we do see 712 Madison back with David Yurman's move out, who is the tenant there, we're already entertaining increase for that space. So, we feel confident that we'll be able to get it filled.","Vikram Malhotra","Okay. And then just bigger picture question with one of your peers, Vornado doing the big JV at that cap rate. Do you view that sort of as a good comp for the market and may be for your own portfolio?","Andrew Mathias","I can't really speak to the specifics of their JV. I mean, I think there's still a strong capital markets bid for New York City retail. I don't think the view is as dire as people are making it out to be and it's also -- we've worked hard over the last 5 years to really shrink the amount of our NOI that's attributable to retail. Stabilizing and selling quite a few of our assets including the sales of 720 and 724 Fifth Avenue last year. So, we still feel like there's a strong bid out there for retail and I think it's -- it continues to be part of our strategy but on a very selective basis. Any further questions, operator?","Operator","No, sir.","Andrew Mathias","Okay. Thank you, everybody, for joining us and I'm sure Marc will be back in three months when we speak again.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference.

My name is Philip, and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Heidi Gillette. Please proceed.","Heidi Gillette","Thank you, everybody, for joining us, and welcome to SL Green Realty Corp.'s fourth quarter and full year 2013 earnings results conference call. This conference call once again is being recorded.","At this time, the company would like to remind listeners that during the call, management may make forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ from the forward-looking statements that management may make today. Additional information regarding the factors that could cause such differences appear in the MD&A section of the company's Form 10-K and other reports filed by the company with the SEC.","Also, during today's conference call, the company may discuss non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC Regulation G.

I will now turn over the call over to Marc Holliday. Please go ahead, Marc.","Marc Holliday","Okay. Thank you Heidi, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining in. Many of you listening in today also attended or heard on the webcast our December investor presentation, which for us is always an excellent form to give in-depth market color and discuss goals and objectives for 2014. So that presentation, which is always sort of a highlight for our year in terms of being able to measure performance and describe the shareholder strategies and objectives, was something as a great benefit to us. And from the feedback we got after the presentation, I think we're confident that most shareholders found it to be very useful and informative as well. So we're still happy to put the kind of effort that goes into that presentation in order to do kind of a full dissertation, if you will, on where we see ourselves in the market. So having that just recently behind that, it's probably 7 weeks fresh, I think today what we're going to focus on primarily is material events during that 7-week period since the conference. And with that, I think you can put a circle around the Citicorp deal, the Citibank lease extension deal, which for us is really a crowning achievement for the company, I think for all those who worked on it, I would say, it was a personal achievement and getting that lease concluded for the company, for our shareholders after 18 months of negotiation, structuring and documentation and everything that went along with it, we were extraordinarily happy sometime and I think right after mid-December to get that signed up and announced, which made for good holidays for us. So I can tell you that much. And it was a deal where we had to do all of what I just said, while fending off the approaches of many, many suitors who were trying to convince Citi to relocate to various other locations and buildings throughout the city. And I think it's a real affirmation and testimony to the relationship we have with that tenant, to the flexibility and ingenuity, I think, that we put into that lease in terms of structuring something that worked for us and worked for the tenant. I think it's a real affirmation of Tribeca, what has now become, I would say one of the most desirable residential and commercial submarkets in Manhattan, which won out over many other locations and buildings that were deemed less desirable. And we couldn't be more pleased to have that behind us so that we can now, with Viacom put away for term, with Citi put away for term, it just allows us to really focus very offensively on figuring out ways to maximize our opportunities, mark-to-market and income opportunities going forward with the balance of the tenant base.","A little more detail, if you will, on the Citibank deal. I think that the deal is resoundingly successful for this company, both when measured against market conditions downtown and when just looked at in terms of absolute levels of investment returns that we and our partner, Ivanhoe Cambridge, will enjoy on this investment.","On relative terms, I think we look primarily at the more recent deals, with GroupM and Jones Day, GroupM at 3 World Trade, Jones Day at World Financial Center. And in that respect, we have a -- we were able to negotiate for a gross rent beginning in 2021 that, depending on where OpEx and real estate taxes go, but assuming that's somewhere in the range between 3% to 4% increases over time than that gross rent is somewhere right around $80 a foot. And that compares against starting rents with the GroupM deal at $68 a foot, starting rent at Jones Day at $60 a foot, each of which has a $5 bump. So that in the one case, the Tribeca location was about 22% to 23% better than a comparable vintage building that what financial center was able to obtain and 10% better than what new construction in the trade center was able to obtain. So we feel the rent was very appropriate, if you will, given the physical plant of 388 and 390, which are exceptionally good for financial tenants, the 388 floor plate was determined through the process to be as or more efficient for new construction and a 100,000 square-foot trading floor sizes at 390 are basically irreplaceable in that downtown market today. So that combined with the location and the autonomy of control over that campus, if you will, I think, was a major factor in helping us secure this tenant on a renewal.","And when you look at the concessions, I would say there too, we were on a relative basis -- fairly pleased with the outcome, if you will. Where -- I think we had TIs of about $51 a foot, which is as against roughly $80 a foot on a nonrenewal deal, let's say $80 a foot trade for a new deal, plus free rent, which based on that gross rent in 2021 was about 7 months free. And I think we've seen numbers in the market ranging from 16 to 34 months free. I think that 34 months free is on the Jones Day deal, if I'm not mistaken. So that, I think, speaks volumes also to the quality of this building, the quality of the location that Citi saw in this specific property. There were some reports additionally on some additional base building capital that we committed to this deal as part of the Citibank renewal. That's fairly standard for us. So I'm not exactly sure why in this instance it's called out as something unusual in the 1 or 2 reports we saw. I think there's about $67 a foot or so of base building capital that's going to go into the improvements of the building and the restacking of the floors to make them more efficient. And given that we had put $0 into the building over the past 5 or 6 years since acquisition, and this is the sum and substance of what we'll put into the building over the next 22 years, I think that $67 a foot amortized over 28 years of lease term is something obviously $2.50 a foot on a straight-line basis.","So we put redevelopment capital into almost every big building we purchase. In some cases, a little less. In many cases, more. I guess Viacom deal being a little less and 100 Park Avenue repositioning probably being more. So we think this is completely within the level of what's appropriate to invest, not really in a form of the tenant concession per se, but improvement to the asset, which we think is ultimately a good investment for us, and those are the economics of the deal now. Measured in terms of return, which is mostly how I like to look at these deals. I think we had an average yield through 2013 of about 9.25%. And as a result of this deal, going forward through, I believe, through the option date, that's actually a double-digit yield of somewhere between 10%, 11%. And I guess, most important one in IRR basis, which I think brings it all home to roost, the IRR deal from acquisition through date of earliest option would be something in around 9.7% to 10%.","Now I can tell you with certainty that our ability today to go out and find commercial space in prime Tribeca neighborhood, where we have a high-credit tenant net leased, triple-net leased and with only about 50% or 53% loan-to-value achieve 10% levered returns would be highly challenging and that may be an understatement. So the deal itself is something we look at as a real victory for the company, if you will. We -- our strategy of buying credit tenant, net-leased deals at the tops of market is filling us 2007 purchase proved to be the right strategy in so much as we were able to maintain a very high yield through the '08 and beyond downturn. And now we'll be able to enjoy a consistently high and rising level of revenue, notwithstanding our financing costs fell during the first 5 years of this deal from $60 million a year to $34 million a year. So that's, in a nutshell, I think, how we evaluated the alternative of entering into this deal, which on the one hand is a -- it's a lot of capital because it's a 2.6 million square-foot lease. So it's big building, it's a lot of return. I think our share of the return, of the net return, from inception through earliest purchase date is something like $300 million net profit. So this has been extraordinarily profitable enterprise, now we're happy to say, we'll continue to be so over time, although we will have to invest some more capital into the deal. But certainly, as it relates to, I think, downtown metrics and I think as to -- just the measures by which we have to deploy capital, then and today, it's worked out fine. We did have it as a backup to our strategy a residential conversion of the property, which we think also would have been quite exciting and quite profitable, which would have played out many, many years from now. But as it turned out, we were able to meet our objectives as Citi seems also to be able to meet their objectives with the lease renewal, and in our eyes, that was in the best interest of this company and our shareholders. So we were happy to get that done.","Some additional information, not really additional, just a summary of information that we posted on our website, which contains basically the data that's been disclosed in the press release, the supplemental and the 8-K, kind of put it all in one place, so people have the right data in front of them. And we can obviously answer any other questions, if you will, towards the back half of this conversation. But other than that, I'm going to open it up for questions, I would just say that if I had to handicap the 7 weeks since our December investor meeting, we are somewhere between on or ahead of expectations with respect to some fairly aggressive stretch goals and objectives we put up on the day of the investor meeting, both in terms of leasing and [indiscernible] philosophy, we have a good pipeline of leasing as it relates, even though it's January, which is typically not the most bullish [indiscernible] of months. We have a pipeline structured finance. We're working on other new equity investment yields and the sales market is still robust. So on all levels, we still see this as a market that is very consistent with what we conveyed 7 weeks ago. I think we'll be able to execute our program this year and we made that much the better by having the Citi lease renewal in the rearview mirror.","So with that, I'd like to open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Bank of America.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So I guess it's safe to assume you guys are maintaining your guidance from the Investor Day. And if that's the case, are there any changes to the underlying assumptions?","Matthew Diliberto","Jamie, it's Matt. No, there are no changes to our guidance levels at this stage.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then, I guess, just following up on the structured finance comments, can you talk a little bit more about the book and where you -- I guess if you look in the fourth quarter, it looks like your yields came down a little bit and your volume was a little lower. So can you just talk about maybe how you see that trending? And maybe timing on new starts or new initiations?","Marc Holliday","So, Jamie, yields actually, I mean, there are actually on the portfolio up quarter-over-quarter. I think you're talking about the -- maybe the originations in total are down, but remember we syndicate out some of those senior positions, and that takes our yield on the retained piece up. So the portfolio actually ticks up on a fairly static balance.","Unknown Executive","Well, otherwise said, I just want to make sure, I understand the question. The yield on the portfolio, I think, was up 20 basis points, 10 basis points quarter-over-quarter. And that was done on a balance that was roughly equal and a composition that was slightly more weighted like 400 basis points weighted to its mezzanine, so more ...","Unknown Executive","We had some bridge loans pay off in the fourth quarter, so that weighted the portfolio slightly more towards the subordinate paper in the portfolio.","Unknown Executive","Right. Separate and apart from that, there were new originations, quite a voluminous amount of which, I think it was $400 and some odd million, which averaged somewhere like 7, 10. So 10-point-something percent. If you're saying though that yield is less than the portfolio yield, if that's the question, that is true. But if you recall in our December investor meeting, we put right up on that screen, our expectation that we wanted to convey to you guys that we thought spreads would compress in 2014 and after almost 5 years, if you will, of spreads that were fairly well established. And there weren't a lot of market participants competing. That dynamic has changed. People have definitely come back in 2014 with allocations, with a desire to compete more for this business. And that's not hindsight. We did say that in the beginning of December, and I think, we actually modeled spreads as low as 800 to 850 over was our guidance back then. So I think we beat our guidance by a lot. But directionally, we're -- we have shed light on the fact that we see compressing spreads. And I think it's important that people on this call understand that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao from Deutsche Bank.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just got a question on the CapEx side of things for the Citi renewal. Just curious if this is like the Viacom deal where they choose the timing of the spend or just curious how much we should be baking in terms of the CapEx here?","Andrew W. Mathias","Well, it's not so much -- they have flexibility when they spend it. But there are -- there are stages as to when the capital is available to them. They get a little bit of money now and then it's spread out over the next 5 years as to when the balance of the money is available to them.","Unknown Executive","It's a combination of: One, when they're entitled to it; and Two, when they spend it. They've got to meet both those conditions, so that we try to stage the money in over time, which that's even a further point that I didn't make in my prepared commentary, most of the concessions granted in these markets are very much upfront weighted concessions. These concessions -- I don't have the exact schedule for. We don't know it because we don't know the timing of Citi spend, but there's a [indiscernible] component and benefit here to being able to spread it over 5 years and whatever the actual schedule turns out to be.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then, I guess, just curious if you can provide a little bit more detail on the option portion of the deal. I guess, starting in 2017, I think it is. I mean take a lot of the returns you discussed were sort of as of the early option date. Just curious what those returns look like if they don't exercise and what your thinking is currently on whether or not you'll take that option?","Marc Holliday","Well, there's really 2 parts to that. One is, if they don't exercise on the earliest date, but if they exercise on the latest date. And the second question is whether they going to exercise at all. The difference between earliest date to latest date is really small because on the one hand, there's a little bit of time value. On the other hand, we have rising rents due to CPI.","Unknown Executive","Yes, levered yield on the interim is right on top of the IRR.","Marc Holliday","So, I would say, we are somewhat indifferent between when -- if the options pull between 17 and 21 from a term perspective. Now if the option is not hit at all, our expectations are that it's certainly in this environment that would be accretive because their purchase option is roughly around 6 and 6.25 cap on projected NOI, if you will. And the cap rates today, we believe, would be less than that. However, depends on what the CapEx are at that point in time. But certainly, from an earnings standpoint, it's accretive. From a value standpoint, we think it will be accretive, but no way to answer that question until you're out there in 2021.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of David Toti from Cantor Fitzgerald.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","We've heard some reports of increasing property taxes and some pressure on assessments. Are you guys seeing any of that yet into the end of last year. I know you are underwriting. Any pressure on that going forward given -- especially given the change in government?","Marc Holliday","Yes, the property tax rules are out and it's consistent with our estimates. So as Matt said, our guidance for the year captured what we expected for property taxes this year. And it's an area of increasing budgetary constraints within the city. So we don't expect upward pressure on property taxes necessarily to abate. We just work hard with the city on the individual assessments for each of our buildings, making sure we keep those in line with reasonable market values and not out of line. So generally, I think, we feel it's a well-managed area of the business.","Unknown Executive","Yes, and also given that portfolio is plus or minus 96% leased, a lot of the increases are absorbed by the tenants because these are gross leases with stops and that doesn't make it any less undesirable to see increases that are higher than the rate of inflation, which is what we've been experiencing recently. But it does at least take away the earnings that -- mitigates the earnings impact of this increase.","James E. Mead","It certainly will have a negative impact on cap rates either because cap rates, if anything, are down quarter-over-quarter. So...","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","And that kind of leads into my second question actually which is there haven't been a lot of large scale transactions recently. And the commentary that we hear from some of our industry contacts in the broker community is that cap rates are relatively stable and that the consensus for you is that cap rates probably won't compress much further. But I seem to be hearing otherwise from you. Do you have expectations for continued cap rate compression? Is that asset-specific or market-specific?","Marc Holliday","I think we indicated in December that we do expect cap rates to compress further, part and parcel, with rental growth over the next 3 years, that we're estimating it 20% to 25%. How -- and I think you'll see some trades that are in contract now that will close some on the value of land which continues to increase and then some on some stabilized office assets, which are continuing to push, I would say, average cap rates down.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler from KeyBanc.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Marc, last quarter, you sort of talked about the leasing pipeline as being very strong heading into the fourth quarter and nailed the leasing number. And it sounds again like the guidance for, or at least the pipeline for early this year, is pretty strong. You care to offer, I guess, as to what leasing might look like next quarter? Could it be as strong as the fourth quarter?","Unknown Executive","Next quarter?","Unknown Executive","Fourth quarter is going to be difficult. Citi was a little bit of an anomaly.","Unknown Executive","Let's talk about Citi, let's talk about Citi.","Marc Holliday","What did we do without a Citi -- look, we have 2 million square-foot signed lease goal for the year. So that would be roughly 500,000 square feet per quarter. I don't know if the world is that good where we can -- yes if we can get it down to 3 months increment, some of these deals are just -- we try to get them done at the wire, and some do, and some sign 2 days later, it trips to the next. So I don't know, I think the velocity is good. I think we're on our 2 million square foot. I don't want to say run rate because there are some things that have to go right to get there. But in a market like this, things tend to go right. And I think we will get there. And if we're not at the 7, 70, as we did this last quarter, which we probably won't be because that was that was exceptionally high, I have every reason to believe we'll be right around the straight-line average, of leases, 500,000 [indiscernible]","Unknown Executive","I think it's going to be like last year. It was choppy from quarter-to-quarter, but that was not necessarily because the tenant demand wasn't there. There were a lot of deals we had in the pipeline. We've got a big pipeline right now, where we have 59 leases that are being negotiated, it's covering 900,000 square feet. I can tell you that some of the bigger deals in that, that are -- won't get done in the first quarter because they're complicated and they just sort of long-dated type transactions. But I think it certainly gives us comfort that we'll hit our 2-million mark for the year. And I think it's going to be -- it's -- we're going to have the first quarter will be less than the straight line, second quarter will be bigger, but behind all that is what's happening in the marketplace, which is we continue to see good tenant demand across the board in all the buildings.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, as a follow-up, any color you can offer around the new assemblage on Fifth Avenue?","Unknown Executive","Obviously, given the vague disclosure, it's a highly-sensitive and dynamic situation. So it's tough to offer much more color. We think it's a site with enormous upside. It's highly, highly underutilized. There are just some incremental transactions we're working on, which will allow us to fully exploit the value of the site. So we purchased it completely off market, and we're trying to keep the balance of our discussions under radar and off market. So more on that certainly later in the year.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Safe to say it's Midtown?","Unknown Executive","Safe to say, yes.","Marc Holliday","Next question, operator.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Josh Attie from Citigroup.","Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","On 388, 390, I just wanted to kind of confirm what the total CapEx number was. And then also kind of better understand how it would be spent. So looking at the presentation you posted on your website, it looks like the 3 different pieces, the TI allowance, the base building and redevelopment all kind of add up together to around $118 a foot. And then if you add in the free rent, you get roughly to around $380 million. And my first question is, is that the right number? And my second question is, how is that treated if the purchase option is exercised?","Marc Holliday","Well, I don't -- the number -- I'm not sure how to respond, the numbers are exactly as they appear in that 2-pager. Those are like to the dollar. So I don't want to characterize it one way or the other. Those are the numbers for this deal. What was the second part of the question?","Unknown Executive","How is it treated on the sale?","Marc Holliday","How is it treated on the sale? Well, most of these costs are expected to be funded or expended by the time of the closing of the option. So again, we're sort of modeling generally over the next 5 years. That takes you through '18. So there is, I guess, a slight chance for a mismatch. But if there is any mismatch, unfunded concessions would be credited.","Unknown Executive","Yes, Citi will get credit for that.","Marc Holliday","You can get -- assume the money spent and the option will be hit or not during the period, but it can be hit or not, but most of that money will be spent within the first 5 years.","Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. So all -- the whole concession package, including the free rent, would be credited to the purchase price if the option is exercised?","Marc Holliday","The answer is yes, but you got a, yes, but almost the vast majority has been funded or expended. So the credits, if any at the end, are very minimal.","The first closing can't occur until the end of '17, as I recall. And they could, but I'm not sure it's likely, I think there's lots of motivations why if anything it will close later than earlier, but who the hell knows? I mean that's something nobody has a good point of view on. But if you -- we're at the beginning of '14, the earliest closing is end of '17, most of the funds are expended, this is a tale that's not it will get credit.","Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And completely separate question. On the Investor Day, you talked about having net growth in the retail and residential portfolio of around $750 million this year. Can you just talk about how the acquisition pipeline looks? And whether it's more skewed toward retail or residential today?","Marc Holliday","It's more skewed towards retail today. We are -- we're looking at some residential deals as well, but I think from what we're planning on locking down on the first quarter, it's definitely more skewed towards retail. There's a lot of properties trading, a lot of good opportunities and continued strong tenant interest in our highly trafficked prime trade areas.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line Erin Aslakson from Stifel.","Erin T. Aslakson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So $412 million was originated in the fourth quarter, but only about $80 million was actually kept on balance sheet. What were the syndication fees related to the originations there, which are recognized in the fourth quarter?","Unknown Executive","No, we didn't recognize any syndication fees, right? If we had syndication fees, those would be onetime. Generally, we will scrape a little bit or raise more fees and those get amortized in over the term of the loan. There are no onetime syndication fees in the fourth quarter.","Erin T. Aslakson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. So the 12 [indiscernible]","Unknown Executive","The effect of the positive [indiscernible] syndication is expressed in the retained yield on the $80 million, I think you said, that's the right number? And that's, hardly 1 million. And that's always been the case from day 1 in terms of how we recognize that income.","Erin T. Aslakson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","All right. So the additional income recognized by the structured finance portfolio, the $5-odd million in the quarter was all related to interest rates? Interest rates...","Unknown Executive","There was one repayment in the quarter. That's the primary difference that you're talking about. There was a repayment within -- an early prepayment penalty that we recognized in the fourth quarter. Otherwise, the rest of it is interest income.","Erin T. Aslakson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, how much was the prepayment?","Unknown Executive","Roughly $2.5 million.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Auerbach from ISI Group.","George D. Auerbach - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Great. [indiscernible] ticked up quarter-over-quarter and spread looked a little bit better. Was this sort of a one-off result or anything that you think suggests that business in the suburbs is getting better?","Isaac Zion","I think, overall -- hi, this is Isaac Zion. I think, overall, the -- we've seen a lot of increased activity well-located buildings in Stanford and White Plains across industry lines, and I think going into early 2014, we've got some vacancies that we have to deal with, but I fully anticipate that occupancy will remain around that 82% and then start to tick up toward the end of the year as things get better and better.","George D. Auerbach - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And just one question on 1 Vanderbilt. With the [ph] moved the assets that are sort of [indiscernible] on the site into development. Can you just remind us of the timing of sort of when you empty out those buildings, when you maybe demo those. And we talked about it a little bit at Investor Day, but any early conversations with the new administrators about East side rezoning?","Unknown Executive","Well, on 1 Vanderbilt, we moved the assets to development. We are still working on various ways of seeing how we can get this development going under East Midtown primarily, if that comes back this year, as the mayor has committed to do several times publicly. And we're also looking to see if there are alternatives to the project we had originally proposed that would allow us to go forward under different formats. So I think that the zoning was just voted down in November. So it's only been, let's say, 2 months or not quite. And we would expect this is going to be resolved over the next 6 months. So I think a few months from now, I'll have a better answer for you on that. But we are still moving ahead on all fronts with the expectation that this will be developed. The only difference being that, as a result of whether East Side zoning goes through or not, we may have to alter the plans. But I think we can accommodate that into several different scenarios, and that's what we're working through now. And I would say, maybe on the next call, we will have more color on that, certainly within the next 6 months. And that's our kind of time line maybe the next 3 or next 6 months to have this sort of fully figured out as to what direction we'll be headed once we get through the planning process.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vance Edelson from Morgan Stanley.","Vance H. Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So first, just shifting back to asset valuations, I think you'd consider yourself largely in harvest mode now, although it's a relative term. And I am sure you're regularly approached by others looking to buy, unsolicited or otherwise. So could you just provide any color on whether it's sovereign wealth, or pension money, et cetera, that's knocking on the door these days? Is the trajectory of inquiries up or down the past several months? And is it mainly for the trophy-type assets? Or do you sense there's demand out there across the board?","Marc Holliday","Yes. Vance, let me just give you the first part of that and Andrew can talk about the composition of the players and the trends. We are not in harvest mode. I mean we sell because we always sell. We sell every year. We sold last year. We sold 2 years ago. I think we've sold almost every year over the past 10 years, except for maybe in '08 or '09, that I'm not sure. But short of that, we sell when it's right for the asset, when we feel we've gotten most of what there is to get out of the asset and we can redeploy into more profitable new investments. We are -- we don't make calls on the market. I don't believe that we're in the business of only selling if we think the market is one way and only buy if it's the other way -- we moderate. We buy more early and we buy less late and vice versa, we sell more late and sell less early. But with that said, we are still finding a lot of good new investment activity. Last year, I forget the number, was well over $1 billion of new investment activity. A lot of that was equity. And while there was no major [indiscernible] acquisition last year, I certainly won't extrapolate that out to this year because there are a couple of interesting things. The way we create value is typically highly structured and off market. And if we can get those deals done, even in a market like this, which is a -- [indiscernible] tight market, there are opportunities out there. So you'll see us certainly sell some assets this year. And that's as we did last year. And we set those goals forth at -- in December, you'll see us buy actively. And we're going to be recycling money into new value-add deals because this is a good market to do value-added. The leasing market is getting much better. And I think you're going to start to see good mark-to-market rents that are at least on target with what we've projected. So I would not -- yes, I think people seem to be overly focused on interest rates. I would just make sure you're not focused -- not only you specifically, I just mean generally, people don't focus on interest rates, we spent focusing on rents because as commercial rents go, so goes value, so goes the stock price. I mean that's something I tried to put up on the screen in December to show the correlation between mark-to-market and value and stock price as opposed to interest rates, which has far less of a correlation. So, anyway, the first part Andrew....","Andrew W. Mathias","As is typical in January, we've been visited by many, many sources of capital over the first couple of weeks of the year who all have allocations for this year and are aggressively looking for new deals. So, you have sort of all the groups that Isaac went through in December at the investor meeting. The Southern Well Funds, the pension funds, the individual investors. And we've seen a lot of new entrants to the market, particular Chinese capital, which we highlighted on Investor Day, but also in Noreastern [ph] and Norwegian and all of these guys are flush again with allocations for the year and are actively looking for deals. So we expect transaction activity to be healthy in the first quarter.","Vance H. Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. That's very helpful. And then any update or thoughts on the potential re-purposing of certain assets that you've mentioned in the past, the potential to tap into retail, residential or hotel demand? Do you think we'll see some of that down the road? Are you moving more in that direction on any assets?","Marc Holliday","Yes, I think -- we're always evaluating highest and best for any of the assets. Right now, our big redevelopment focus is 10 East 53rd, which is an office redevelopment. But that project is launched, and we're going to be bringing it to market top-of-the-line Class A space in a great floor plate on 53rd street. That's a prime area of redevelopment focus right now.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brendan Maiorana from Wells Fargo.","Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So probably for Marc or Andrew, but with 2 of your biggest assets kind of put together and put to bed in terms of the tenants you have there with Viacom and Citi. Does that -- are you thinking about being more aggressive in terms of doing value-add deals? I know you talked that they're attractive, but you've got a growth portfolio, that's -- call it, $3 billion or so. Might we see that number move up because you've got some pretty stable assets that don't have a lot of risk in your portfolio now?","Marc Holliday","Well, I think that's a reasonable assumption given our view of market rents, which we talked about earlier, that you'll see us continue to add growth assets, that where we can move the bottom line. And if we look to sell, it's going to be mostly stabilized bond-type assets where we've done our redevelopment work and we've executed our business plan, and we think we can take the money and reinvest into higher returning investments.","Unknown Executive","I would say also on the rental side, with coming expiries, it gives us the ability to, I think, push terms harder than we otherwise would if you had 2 major exposures out there. So with those put to bed, I think we can really try to help, meet the market, if you will, and push the terms and see if we can't benefit from what seems to be a market that's got a lot of job growth. 94,000 jobs last year. The stats say not a lot of office using as in prior years, but it was still positive absorption. And I think that number sort of belies the economic impact of 95,000 new jobs in New York City last year. That is an enormous amount of jobs that puts the total job count at over 4 million bodies. The city is projecting another 50,000 or maybe 45,000 or 50,000 new jobs, private-sector jobs for this year. And I'm not -- it would somewhat seem understated relative to last year's tally, and with the general feedback we're getting from tenants right now whose businesses seem to be doing on average extremely well and tenants seem to be growing in almost all sectors except financial row -- commercial banks. So I think we can push rents, we can push terms and we can be more aggressive as Andrew said on -- I mean in evaluating assets.","Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","That's helpful. Just switching gears question, probably for Jim. If I look at the mortgage on 388 390, it looks low from an overall principal. Now is there with the lease done now, is that something that you would think about refinancing? And could that be a source of funds as we think about over the next year or 2?","James E. Mead","Yes I mean, the answer is maybe. I mean, we're looking at it now, and it's got a high credit quality, very stable lease on it for the long term. So it would appear to us to be an enormously good candidate to look at for refinancing. So the answer is, we're looking at it, of course. We tend to concern with finance our properties and don't really drive leverage in our property level financing. So we're going to take a close look at it over the next few weeks and months.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Knott from Green Street Advisories.","Jed Reagan - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Jed Reagan here with Michael. Just wondering if you could talk a bit about the leasing pipeline in terms of how that splits out between the high end of the market and sort of the more value-oriented price point? Are you seeing more momentum in one than the other?","Marc Holliday","Well, if you measured it from the last couple of weeks or so, where all of a sudden we got a slew of offers in on the higher price point stuff. You would think that it was shifting towards that part of the market. But I think, in reality, it's much likely said at Investor Day, there's good demand across all price points as compared to 1.5 years ago, where it was all about the bottom end of the market. Today, it seems to be firing at both the bottom end and the top end of the market. Some good examples of that is 3 Columbus, where we're doing some deals in the tower of that building, the annual rents with $78 to $80 range, 600 [indiscernible] we've got 5 or 6 offers that we're negotiating in that building, and that's one of the boutiques, one of the higher price points in the portfolio. We just closed the deal a few days ago with 280 Park for 25,000-foot tenant. The bottom of the building rents there are still is been very, very heavy for that product. So we're seeing it across the board, but I think in particular, there's a continued improvement in the higher end of the market.","Jed Reagan - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Sorry, if I missed this. But, can you just clarify leasing commissions for the Citigroup lease that's included in the TI numbers presented in the supplemental? And if not, can you just share how much additional cost that represent?","Unknown Executive","The leasing commissions that we pay are shown in the -- on the FFO FAD page that shows the amount of capital expended related to the Citi deal, expended in 2013.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb from Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Just 2 really quick ones. First, is Citi putting in any of their own money into the renewal in addition to the TI that you guys are providing in the base building? Or they are putting in -- what are they putting in as part of this, if any?","Unknown Executive","Well, we're not in a position to respond to that. Citi is going to do, I guess, what it decides to do. We're lead to believe they're going to invest capital in the building to lease back, make it more efficient and potentially make some improvements beyond our base building. We've seen situations where they do, and I think they are plans where they don't. So, we're just not in a position to address that.","Unknown Executive","They have announced that its going to be the new global headquarters, though, and it's reasonable to assume.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. I guess we can ask Citi their call. Second question is, on the West 34th Street you bought out 2 adjacent -- I'm sorry, you sold out 2 adjacent properties both earned in joint venture, but you retained some development rights. Can you just comment on what your plans are for those development rights?","Unknown Executive","34th Street, we sold -- the stabilized retail condos and retained the air rights. We don't have any imminent plans for those air rights. It's in an area where there is a lot of new developments going on, and the future store houses a value. We wanted to save and didn't feel like we could get adequately paid for today, so we sold the income-producing portions of the property. There's no immediate plans for the air rights.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","And Andrew, how transferable are the air rights like what -- how far of a radius can you transfer those around?","Andrew W. Mathias","The block, which is a big -- between Fifth and Sixth is a very large block. So, there's a lot of potential between 34th and 35th Street there on the north side of the block.","Marc Holliday","Operator, we have time for one last question, and then we are going to -- have to take others in a different form.","Operator","All right, I understand, sir. Your last question comes from the line of Ross Nussbaum from UBS.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Can you guys talk about just an update on 180 Maiden Lane, as well as 280 Park Avenue in terms of different, I guess, time frames in terms of repositioning there? Just give us an update on how those are going so far.","Unknown Executive","Let's start 280, being the most advanced of the 2. Steve, why don't you?","Unknown Executive","Well, we profiled it at Investor Day, so the construction there continues to advance. We think we'll be materially done with all of the base building work by the end of the summer. We have a couple of moderate-sized leases that are in negotiation right now, and we just closed one for 25,000 square feet on the third floor of the building. We made some of the papers, we didn't put an announcement out. But, we continue to see that in our primarily financial services are the tenants that are coming through the door, and I think we're on track as far as both the lease of schedule and the rents that we're achieving.","Unknown Executive","The finished lobby on Park looks I think spectacular. If anyone has an opportunity to go pass and see it we kind of -- our aim and goal was to have the nicest lobby and presence on Park Avenue. I think we've achieved that. Top 180?","Unknown Executive","On 180, the redevelopment plans, we're working with the city to get the necessary approvals. AIG is finishing up their occupancy, and we're working with them on phase out. And we're actively showing the building to tenant prospects. So it's got lots and lots of showings, lots and lots of interested tenants. I think some of the dynamic of tenants being priced out of Midtown South is definitely starting to occur, and we're starting to see some of those tenants look downtown in the financial district. We expect that to be a big positive impact on the lease up there.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Andrew, do you have your arms around a capital budget for the repositioning of that asset yet?","Andrew W. Mathias","It's still in, I would say it's still in formation because it somewhat reliant on city planning. The City Planning Commission, which has purview of all the public space, which a lot of that building, the ground floor is public space. But by next quarter, we will have much better color.","Marc Holliday","Okay. Thank you, everyone, for dialing in today. And we look forward to speaking to you again in April.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may all now disconnect.

For more information you can email SLG2016@ slgreen.com, the invitations should be going out in the next couple of weeks. The format has changed slightly this year, we will be beginning at 9 AM on Monday December 5th, the door is opening at 8:30 AM for a light breakfast and we would expect to be completed by 1:00 in the afternoon. So again for more information, please email SLG2016@slgreen.com.","With that I will turn it over to our CEO Marc Holiday.","Marc Holiday","Okay, thank you Matt and thank you for dialing into the call today, we're happy to have the opportunity to review with you the results of the third quarter and provide some additional commentary on how we see things shaping up to New York City. Continuing a trend this year where we have outperformed many of our 2016 operating and financial goals, we had a very strong third quarter punctuated by 1.3 million square feet of Manhattan office leases signed at the market leading 29% mark to market. Once again SL Green has demonstrated its ability to outperform on the leasing and operational fronts notwithstanding any perceived or actual slowdown in the tenant market. In fact in the first 20 days of October, we've concluded nine additional Manhattan office leases for a total of 212,000 square feet highlighted by the two leases we announced this morning with Comcast and Nixon Peabody at Tower 46 and we welcome those two tenants to our portfolio. This brings our total Manhattan leasing production to 3 million square feet year-to-date that\u2019s 50% more than we originally forecast and a 28% mark to market on replacement leases with is about double what we originally projected at the beginning of the year.","These accomplishments are not just market leading, they are extraordinary by any measure and will rank among the two or three best leases years in our 19 year history as a public company. All the more notable because we achieved these results notwithstanding additional supply from Hudson Yards, making the point that high-quality, well-located and reasonably priced office space is still in very high demand. As further evidence of that tenant demand we have a current leasing pipeline of nearly 600,000 square feet approximately half of which are leases pending and held for signature. So I think that stat shows that notwithstanding we have cleared out a substantial amount of pipeline year-to-date, we still expect to achieve a lot more over the next two and a half months as we close out the year. Assuming the successful completion of these pending leases, we are looking at a rollover schedule in New York City for 2017 and \u201818 that averages less than 900,000 square feet per annum or just about 3% of our portfolio square footage each year. That's the lowest rollover rate in recent history.","That places our portfolio and this company in an unusually excellent offensive and defensive position by allowing us to focus our efforts on those future rollover spaces as and when they come up over the next 24 months and selectively make early deals with those tenants, the ones that allow us to drive the best economics possible. Notwithstanding our track record of keeping our portfolio well leased through our market cycles, we get the inevitable question, whether we can continue to outperform the market and I believe the answer is absolutely and unequivocally yes. While office using job growth has slowed in the second half of the year, the information sector continues to add jobs while the losses in the financial sector have been quite modest through August even though prevailing view is much different and inaccurate that being significant shedding of jobs in the financial sector. The numbers simply don\u2019t back that up and those are numbers that come right from OMB.","September job numbers are not out yet but they are few interesting points to make about the health of the city economy up and through Q2 and part of these numbers are through September, each of the big five banks have reported third-quarter financial results and pre-tax earnings were up 50% year-over-year and revenues which were flat for Q1 and Q2 for the big five were up 20% year-over-year in Q3. Add to that the total New York City jobs has reached another record level this year of 4.3 million workers driven by private sector job growth through the second quarter of 77 new jobs with third-quarter numbers coming out imminently. Hotel occupancies are still as strong as last year in the high 80s percent occupancy range and only a slight decline in ADR, the average rate even though there is lot of new supply being observed this year as a result of construction that was taken place in years past and Airbnb continues to be a competitive force notwithstanding hotels having an excellent year showing that tourism in the city is still very robust and has not missed a beat as a result of Brexit or otherwise.","So while New York's economy and job growth metrics aren\u2019t on the same pace as last year\u2019s record levels. By the way something we have forecasted to you at the beginning of the year, it is still shaping up to be a relatively good year with above-average job growth, economic performance and leasing activity along with below average sublet availability of well under 2%. We also have a positive outlook for longer-term trends and tenant demand due to the expectation that New York City will continue to benefit from nation leading population and job growth extremely low futures rates by any historical standard and fairly limited new contributions to office inventory over the next five years as compared to the total 400 million square foot inventory of office properties that currently exists in all of Manhattan.","Today, we gathered, I'm sorry, Tuesday, it seems like today, but it was Tuesday, we gathered for a very proud moment in this company's history as we along with Mayor DeBlasio and many other elected officials formally broke ground on the development for 1 Vanderbilt, a spectacular project that will transform the skyline and establish new blueprint for the revitalization of East Midtown. This groundbreaking event followed on the heels of our announcements recently of the $1.5 billion construction loan closing and that was led by five different domestic and international banks and carries with it an up to seven year term which is largely unprecedented in the construction loan market. And also on top of that we announced the withdrawal litigation claims against the city and the project. So a lot accomplished since our last phone call in terms of clearing the decks for continued progress on the construction of the 1 Vanderbilt, the financing and along with that we continue to be on budget and on track with that project. Andrew and I are extremely proud of our team for these great accomplishments and we are excited to be a part of this truly historic project. We understand that investor sentiment is mixed but we look forward to fully educating everyone at our upcoming investor day that Matt just spoke about as to the incredible physical attributes of the building, the compelling economics of the project, given our cost basis and the transformative effect will have in the surrounding area in which the majority of invested dollars reside.","So with that I'm sure there are people out there that have many questions on the quarter's results and we would like to get right into it and field the first one operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","John Kim","I was wondering if you could provide an update on the Aeropostale lease as far as if termination fee is still being negotiated. And also, if you could discuss what the mark-to-market may be and, in comparison, where that fits on page 50 of your supplemental.","Matt DiLiberto","Let's start first with status of the leases, it\u2019s beyond - John it\u2019s Matt, Aero vacated early in the third quarter, so the space is now vacant, it\u2019s out being marketed by our retail team. There is no termination fee involved that\u2019s a bankruptcy. So we were able to get them out, so we can market the space and get the mark to market which we highlighted as being somewhere between 20% and 40% which is, Andrew can expand on that a little bit but there is no termination fee from that and Aero is now out.","John Kim","As far as the retail leases on page 50 of your supplemental, is that the vacancy portion of it?","Matt DiLiberto","Yes, correct, in the vacancy.","Marc Holiday","Yes, they paid rent up and through the date of their occupancy.","Matt DiLiberto","They paid yes, so they paid all the way up through the day of their bankruptcy, they were current and then they paid through the end of their occupancy in early third-quarter.","John Kim","And what are your views of street retail rents overall? It looks like it has been declining in most - some markets in Manhattan. Where do you see the trends as far as rents in the near term?","Marc Holiday","We haven't seen many declines, I mean, I would categorize rents generally as flat in the sub markets that we operate in primarily Fifth Avenue, Times Square, SoHo, and Upper Madison. We are still seeing tenant demand but I would say tenants are slower to make decisions which is led to some longer lead time in terms of leasing up vacant space, but there are still active tenants looking in the market and we are in discussions on a lot of our vacancy in the portfolio now.","Matt DiLiberto","I think we feel pretty good about being able to achieve our mark-to-market on the vacated Aeropostale space and that will ultimately come to pass as a positive event for the company, I think we feel highly confident.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.","Alexander Goldfarb","Just Marc, on 1 Vanderbilt, you guys have finished the construction loan, so sort of going against the list, the checklist that you guys signed off. As you guys think about - especially in light of the leasing activity that you have, as you think about next steps, whether it's JV or leasing, you guys have paid off like almost $1 billion I think of incremental debt, so in a sense you have shored up the balance sheet. Do you still feel like you need to JV it before you get substantially more leasing done? Or do you feel that if you get more leasing done there's more value to be extracted when you do, if you should bring in a JV partner?","Marc Holiday","It\u2019s a great question Alex. I just want to clarify one thing I don't think we felt or feel the need to JV it, from day one I always said we had absolute flexibility to build it out of cash flow as we go forward the next four years or bring in a JV partner. So I would characterize it more as an intense and desire to bring in a JV partner which is there simply because of the field of project and for the significant amount of yield enhancement we can create by bringing in a JV partner obviously at the right time given that our cost basis in the property is low and there is lot of execution in terms of the development and leasing, for which there is lot of fee income that\u2019s associated with that. So I think it is always been our goal from the outset to bring new JV partner, I think the kind of schedule we had - I had mentioned to investors at the beginning of the year that something along the lines of towards the end of this year start to get to what we would consider more serious discussions with investors knowing that we had to get a few milestones behind us in order to best position our presentation of this project to shareholders and I think we've done that I think we\u2019ve done it as good as or better than I even could have contemplated in terms of we have best-in-class financing.","The site is, you or others on the phone who haven't seen it recently, it\u2019s really exciting and I think very impactful to walk over to 42nd and Vanderbilt just and get a sense of the scope of the project and the location of the project in its direct proximity to Grand Central and just how extraordinary it will be when that building is up in four years. The response from the tenant community so far has been nothing short of excellence in terms of having - I would say checked every single box of what we possible could check and what you would want to do in delivering the best-in-class office building with an understanding that tenants in the 50 to 250,000 square foot range typically are not making those kind of space commitments much more than 18 to 24 months ahead of time which given our schedule would put the bulk of that leasing effort sometimes towards the end of \u201817 and into \u201818. I think 2018 being kind of the sweet spot of our marketing efforts. So with that said, we are in front of, we are having discussions with a number of different potential JV partners, the good news is we are on a path and I feel very comfortable that we will be able to achieve our goals but obviously our goals are to make sure that the deal is probably structured with the kind of partner that shares our view and vision for long-term ownership and on an economic basis that\u2019s equitable and fair for both parties. So I think that we are doing - we\u2019re on track there and we\u2019ll just see how it goes.","Alexander Goldfarb","But the point is do you feel that it's better - it's more prudent to JV it because it's a really large project or it sounds like you don't feel like you're giving up upside because once you have more leasing done it would seem like a JV partner would pay more for it. As you said, Marc, your spend now through next year really isn't that much, given it's just dirt right now. It's not like you have a structure up.","Marc Holiday","And Alex, I'm not speaking as to the exact time. So whether it\u2019s the beginning of the year or middle of the year, end of the year, next year. I mean, I think you got to trust us to do the right thing by the asset. I don\u2019t think, we\u2019ve done a lot of really successful joint ventures, successful for us, successful for our JV partners and I think we are very skilled at this in terms of most importantly selecting the right partner having the right structure, sharing the right vision and then obviously getting the right economic package for both parties. So I\u2019m confident we will do a good job there, we don't feel pressure, we don't feel the need, there is a desire for the reasons that I mentioned, the timing, I think you got to leave it to us to see the measure of when the right time to do it is but we are not the kind of people that try to grab the last dollar, we don't warehouse space if we think rents are ticking up. It\u2019s a business, we\u2019ve got a lot of other projects and investment to focus on beyond 1 Vanderbilt, so we don't want to let it consume us. As important and spectacular as it is, it\u2019s one investment and this is $20 billion plus company. So we have a lot of other things we\u2019re focused on as well and I think you know we will take it in due course and we\u2019ll time it for when it\u2019s optimal to do it and I don't think we're going to ever look back, we never look back and say oh, [indiscernible] it will be fine when we get it up.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay, and just quickly second question. Matt, you didn't mention guidance. Your beat onto the Street was pretty big in the third quarter. Is there anything offsetting in the fourth quarter that we should be thinking about that would affect the run rate because it looks like otherwise it's like $1.35 type-ish number for the fourth quarter.","Matt DiLiberto","To be at the upper end of our range implies a 1.39 [ph] fourth quarter to be at the upper end of our either normalized or absolute guidance range. We are certainly trending at the high end of our range. Looking at fourth quarter there aren\u2019t many anomalies like we are seeing in non-recurring items like we've seen in the third quarter so it should be pretty clean quarter and we look at within the range at the upper end to maybe a slightly ahead the but not warranting to change to guidance.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Jamie Feldman","I guess going back to 1 Vanderbilt; I mean we have seen the higher end of the market, see some slowdown from hedge funds, financials under pressure. What are you guys monitoring as you think about - you remain confident in the project, but what are you monitoring? What should the Street be monitoring as they think about your prospects to be successful there and hit your target rents?","Matt DiLiberto","Well, it\u2019s important to keep things in perspective as far as the timing goes. We don\u2019t deliver this building until - for occupancy until 2020, so to measure the depth of the market by what's happening today in 2016 at the high-end of the market. I don't really think is necessarily the barometer that anybody should be focused on. I think that whether the market is robust or not, this is a unique product that offers a unique value propositions to those tenants that needs the finest office product in the world. And we know that it\u2019s going to be receive a warm welcome because the feedback that we get from tenants today as they evaluate the project really don't look at it on a dollars per square foot basis, they looked at it on a cost per seat basis and what the building offers from an efficiency point of view meaning the amount of - the lesser amount of square footage per employee that tenants can occupy in this building offset because of the column-free floors, the amount of infrastructure that\u2019s already baked into the building and the amount of amenity space the tenants house outside of their demised premises allows them to reduce their total occupancy costs per head. And I really think that as we get closer to the time lease-up period, we\u2019re going to be converting those conversations that we\u2019re already having with respective tenants over to leases. So and just I think and we'll speak to it in greater detail at the investor conference but the rents that we\u2019re targeting are not the highest end of the market surprisingly enough. When you really normalize the rents for the majority of the office space in this building you get into a - what one could argue is an affordable rent for those tenants who need the best product in the world.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. Are you able to quantify that in terms of the conversations you are having, like how many square feet of interest there really is at this point?","Matt DiLiberto","I have a presentation an hour after this call today for 0.5 million square foot tenant. I had two presentations last week and I'm probably running at a clip of one to three presentations almost every single week. The majority you will be interest to know are financial-related businesses and most of them are in the 100,000 to 200,000 square foot range, some as small as 30,000 to 60,000 square feet. So, and I point that out because when you're in that size range as Marc mentioned earlier, we are early to the game for those type of tenants to really pull the trigger on a decision, they have to be, you know, they are educating themselves as to the opportunity, they are preparing themselves to make a decision but you know they need it closer to the finish line for delivery before they actually pull the trigger.","Marc Holiday","Hopefully that answers your question Jamie, puts you a little bit at ease on 1 Vanderbilt, let\u2019s move to the next question which hopefully is not 1 Vanderbilt.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Guinee with Stifel. Your line is open.","John Guinee","Oh my God Marc, I was going to ask you a question on 1 Vanderbilt but...","Marc Holiday","All right, fire away. By the way, welcome to the third-quarter 1 Vanderbilt...","John Guinee","Actually, Steve, these are a couple softballs for you. First, Steve, how many tenants, when it's all said and done, do you think you would actually just pull from existing SL Green buildings, existing SL Green tenants? That's one. Then, second, are you thinking about this joint venture to appease the shareholders or it's the right real estate thing to do? Said another way, if doing a joint venture was not going to help your stock price, repeat not going to help your stock price, would you actually do it?","Steve Green","Well, all right, so I\u2019ll take the first one and Marc will respond to the second one. We have shared the 1 Vanderbilt presentation with a couple of tenants within our portfolio and they are good candidates for the building. It\u2019s an interesting conversation because in some of those discussions with those tenants, we point out to them assuming they\u2019re the right profile tenants, we point out to them that where their anticipated escalated rent will be upon expiration of their current releases in our portfolio, which we can speak to obviously knowledgeably about that. Is that it puts them within $5 to $10 of what our pro-forma rent is for 1 Vanderbilt. The other one we further point out to them the ability for them to lease less square footage because of the relative attributes of the building that I spoke about earlier that in reality it would translate into an occupancy savings for those tenants. So, we\u2019re having those conversations, we\u2019ve targeted some of those tenants and we\u2019re also actively getting in front of them.","Marc Holiday","All right, let me [indiscernible] I think because I\u2019m not sure if it's exact end of what you said, but I think the question was JV [indiscernible]. The answer is and you have to just trust and believe in what we say, we\u2019re not JVing it to get a few bucks in stock price that would be criminal, it would be outlandish to do something like that for the sole purpose of thinking stock is going to go up or down quickly. By the way it\u2019s almost like everything we've heard for the past 18 months about do this, cost price will do X has been completely wrong. So if anything, I would take the under on that, we\u2019re doing it to the same fundamental and sound reasons we would typically JV any large project, some diversification of investment opportunity, I mean he have other uses for the capital. And if properly structured economically, while we won\u2019t maximize aggregate profit we should maximize aggregate return and that\u2019s what we have always been about that\u2019s how we have been able to drive 7.7% growth in FFO from the day of - compounded growth in FFO from the day for our IPO back in 1997.","It\u2019s how we have been able to drive outsized investment-class total return to shareholders and it's really how we do our business is by balancing aggregate gain which would drive you to retain everything versus maximizing return on capital which leads you to do a JV, maybe it\u2019s a partial JV, maybe it's not half, maybe it\u2019s 40% like we did with Pru at 11 Madison, maybe 35%, where 30% or 25% [indiscernible] and then you don't give up much in the way of governance but there is something between 30% and 50% where we can structure I think a very appropriate joint venture, introduce this product to the domestic and more weighted international community who loves to own best projects, best market, best location and you can check those three boxes, unusual you can check those three boxes but when you can there is deep demand for that product I think it\u2019s warranted that we - and prudent that we do that for diversification for return maximization and I think that is a good course, we don't give up much by doing it. We will always own the majority of the project whether it's 51% or more, it will have SL Green\u2019s brand on the building and it\u2019s something that we are all going to be very, very proud of, no matter what - anyone who has reservations about this project now is going to be standing at that ribbon cutting in 2020 and is going to feel like a champion when we open the doors to a lease successful number one building in New York City and we are going to be able to stand up and say which many other can\u2019t we did it profitably on time, on budget.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Petersen with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Jonathan Petersen","No 1 Vanderbilt question from me; I will let you off the hook. Maybe a little more straightforward in general though, on the balance sheet side of things you guys have obviously been a net seller over the last few quarters and the leverage levels continue to come down. Trying to figure out what the debt to EBITDA is right now, but probably somewhere maybe high 7s at best or in the 8s. I'm just curious; in the leverage metrics, have you guys got where you want to be? Maybe - I know you will probably talk about this in the investor day, but kind of give us a sneak peek on what you're thinking about in terms of leverage going into next year.","Matt DiLiberto","Yes, on a consolidated basis our debt to EBITDA is 6.5 times and on a combined basis that\u2019s all in it\u2019s about a turn higher than that. It\u2019s about a full term on both metrics slower than we had originally projected to be at for the year, so we\u2019re certainly comfortably in it 7.5 times and now we are at 6.5. So we\u2019re right in the area we like to be with $2 billion of liquidity our target is 1 billion, we have a very comfortable liquidity position. So I think we are exactly where we wanted to be and slightly ahead and gives us a lot of flexibility on the balance sheet.","Marc Holiday","And I know as much as we try to orient the thinking on this particular topic to debt to value as opposed to debt to EBITDA because not all EBITDA is created the same and I think it is distortive metric to be used when applied towards all sorts of disparate companies. Putting that aside if you look at debt to value for those few people out there that still look at the traditional definition of a leverage ratio, we are right about 35% debt to value which I think by any measure in New York City maybe even nationally but certainly and Manhattan is considered to be at a very low level. So I still look at one out of every ten reports uses the word above-average leverage not exactly sure what that means but the reality is our leverage level based on our assets and the equity subordination we have in those assets something much closer to 35% which we have to compete against people who are 50%, 60%, 70% debt to value routinely and we do it, we do it because I like to think we have the best in class investment team here and we are able to do it, but it's obviously not as easy to achieve the kind of growth that we do achieve using more expensive capital than our competitors. So we just have to be that much better on the buy and that much better on the execution to make up for it and we have, but looking at it from that standpoint, not just debt to EBITDA, that is where our levels reside right about now.","Jonathan Petersen","Great. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Manny Korchman with Citi. Your line is open.","Manny Korchman","Good afternoon, guys. Marc, appreciate your commentary earlier about sort of the oncoming supply. Given the fact that that supply is newer product, the fact that there is incentives that make it economically beneficial to the tenant, why wouldn't it be a bigger factor to sort of you realizing rental rate growth and you realizing leasing in your new project?","Marc Holiday","Well, I think there are two reasons. I'm going to give you a bit of a curveball here. The addition to supply of new inventory, Manhattan is a good thing, whether, I don't know how it\u2019s gotten characterized, it\u2019s kind of this awful thing, you didn't hear that from us. I mean, that's for sure, because what that addition is a representation of a great market because only great markets can create the demand to warrant the construction of new projects and do it in a way where the vacancy levels are unchanged, they are still roughly right around 9.5%, 10%, which is where they\u2019ve been for several years now and do it in a way where there is very little sublet space and I think Steve, that's about 1.5% if I'm not mistaken. So historical lows and do it in a way that's very measured, so it's not all coming on in one year.","So when you look at the inventory as we\u2019ve done in depth and will do again in December when we meet with a lot of you folks on the phone, I won't take you through the math now, but you basically wind your way down to sort of, at most, I will say about 2.5 to 2.75 million square feet per year, and when you calculate the, sort of the breakeven job growth to absorb that incremental square footage, it's only about 10,000 office using jobs a year, and over the past five years, at least, the city has done two or three times that.","So the issue is not the inventory to me, it's the job growth and if we have office using job growth, then we are going to have a drop in the vacancy level. Even with about a one, I guess that works out to be, no, not even to 75 basis points per year addition to inventories, we have 400 million square feet in Manhattan and as I said earlier, we\u2019d be adding about 2.5 to 2.75 million square feet a year and that's if most everything goes, not everything necessarily will go, but if everything goes. And that's a healthy market and as evidence of that, in 2015 and \u201816, we competed against that, and yet we had two of our best years on record, last year and this year.","Those are not aberrations. That is just a reflection of a market that can withstand this sort of incremental and pretty modest increase in inventory over the next few years. It's not going to be more than that. I would challenge anyone to show us a calculation where it\u2019s more than about 75 basis points a year of increase, and as long as we have the job growth to offset or exceed that, we\u2019re in great shape and even if the jobs fall below that in any one or two given years, I think the effect on the vacancy rate will be de minimis, and we seem to be able to outperform within the market anyway. So even I think we\u2019re always going to get more than our fair share of leases.","If anything, I see over the next two years, the issue for us is we\u2019re not going to have that much space to lease. So, to kind of worry about what the effect of this incremental space delivery is going to be, much of which has been spoken for already and represents growth out of the space that\u2019s been moved out of and we factor that into our analysis. We don't have a lot of space and we\u2019re going to focus in hard on that space. Try to get it done ahead of time, the best economics possible. We can't renew, we\u2019re going to re-tenant and I have no real concern that we won't be able to maintain a very high vacancy rate or a very high occupancy rate, vacancy rate. Right now, we are 97.5% leased. I mean, that's, I don't know if there is another company in New York City that's 97.5% leased same-store. And maybe by year-end, it will be higher than that.","So it's mostly, we are very positive in what I\u2019ll call the modest additions coming to market, and the fact that those additions are largely almost exclusively far west side and downtown, which, no matter what, are going to compete at a rental price point that is less than core midtown and that's not in any way to disparage those markets, those are important markets for companies that want to be there and want to sacrifice certain of the amenities and locational attributes of being in midtown for a lower rent price point, that\u2019s fine, but for everyone that does, there is many that don't and that's why we leased 250 leases a year in midtown is because those 250 tenants don't want to be far west downtown. But there are some that too, and there is room for both, so I don't see as an issue.","Manny Korchman","Thank you for the detailed answer. Much shorter response to this one I think. The debt and preferred equity book, you added a project in Brooklyn. Can you give us any color on what the project is?","Marc Holiday","It's an officer repositioning project, large, very well located office repositioning in Brooklyn.","Manny Korchman","Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dave Rodgers of Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.","Dave Rodgers","Yeah. Maybe just quickly on operations and, I don't know, maybe this is for Matt. But NOI margin or NOI over revenues fell this quarter; same-store NOI kind of retrenched. If you said it earlier on the call, I didn't hear you; was there any kind of one-time impact or thing we should be thinking about that impacted the quarter that either repeats or doesn't repeat going forward, Matt?","Matt DiLiberto","Sure. The big thing that happened in the quarter that was non-recurring was aero where we not only lost about $2 million of rent like actual cash rent, but we had a $70 million write-off of old straight line and FAS 141 balances, that goes right through rental revenues on the income statement. That $2 million cash rent loss also flows through same-store. So, you had two factors in our same-store for this quarter, which obviously flow through the year and will flow through the balance of the year, sales will affect the fourth quarter. The loss rent from aero was about $2 million. We also gave free rein to Omnicom over 220 East 42nd streets as part of the recent renewal. That was about $1.2 million in the quarter and will be a slightly larger number in the fourth quarter. So we've kept our 6% same-store NOI target for the year, which is sector leading by a lot. We would be at 6.6% through the nine months, we are not for those couple of anomalies, we will work hard to maintain the 6% in spite of those couple of things for the full year, but that's what you saw in rental revenues and same-store.","Dave Rodgers","Great. Second question and maybe two parts to it. But one, just thoughts on more or additional asset sales in your core Midtown markets, assets that maybe are stabilized. You are clearly a little concerned by getting ahead of some of the lease expirations. Are there more assets you can sell despite the fact that you are ahead of your own leverage targets? And if I would put a b) question in there, I'd say can you talk about the 11 Madison kind of repurchase that you might have to go through and what's the likelihood of that?","Marc Holiday","So, I will address the 11 Madison Park. That was a - the modification we\u2019re going forward is customary, so there is a very, very nominal chance we have to buy that back, miniscule is probably a better word, what we had there was a closing that happened in kind of reverse order to traditional closings where normally you get that modification between contract signing and closing, we did it simultaneous and then left a little modification done, that will get done here in the next few weeks and alleviate the buyback.","Dave Rodgers","Got it, thanks.","Matt DiLiberto","In terms of more asset sales, I mean we\u2019re always evaluating asset sales. I would say getting 11 Madison done and getting the Blackrock recapitalization done in 57th Street, we've satisfied our targets in terms of generating liquidity and the liquidity position that we sit in, however it's a great market to be a seller of assets. There is still an enormous amount of demand for prime real estate assets and we are always sort of evaluating the next sales. So I wouldn't be surprised to see us explore the market for more asset sales, but none we are going to identify today.","Dave Rodgers","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jed Reagan with Green Street Advisors. Your line is open.","Jed Reagan","Hi, guys. What are you seeing in terms of rent growth trends in Manhattan today? Is it fair to characterize the market as flattening out in your view? And are you seeing any changes in the concession environment?","Marc Holiday","The rents have been pretty much as we anticipated this year. They have been on the low side through the 3% to 5% range, it depends on where you work, which submarket you are talking about and which part of the market place. Whether it is the high-end or the low end of market. Clearly, there is more velocity in the more commodity price point portion of the markets. Call it the $50 to $80 price point as compared to the above $100 price points, and particularly above $130. But there has been rent growth, we've seen rent growth in certain of our assets and clearly you get a sense of that from the mark to market that we\u2019re posting.","So, but on the concessions side, at the high price point end of the market, the concessions clearly have stepped up on the capital side, not on the free rent side, because you've seen a few landlords rather than adjust any kind of rents for very expensive space, simply sort of offset it with more capital to stay competitive, but I think that's a thin part of the market as opposed to the overall marketplace. Our concessions on average have been pretty consistent throughout the year.","Jed Reagan","Okay, thanks for that. There's been some chatter recently that you may be looking at an investment in NYRT. Would you say those rumors are off the mark?","Matt DiLiberto","Not going to, don't even ask. I mean for you to bring it up is absurd, I mean really absurd. Not doing down this rabbit hole second time with you guys. Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore. Your line is open.","Steve Sakwa","Hi. Thanks. I guess I wanted to ask about a little bit on the street retail. 650 Fifth is something that you guys have owned for a while and I know the last retailer it seemed like closed in the basement there. I'm just wondering if you could sort of just talk about that project. And just in particular I guess following up; what other investment opportunities do you think might unfold? And do you think you are a net seller or buyer in that business over the next 12 months?","Marc Holiday","Hey, Steve. On 650 Fifth, we are working hard, I mean, it's been a focus of ours, we've had seemed to be a little snake bitten on that project with a couple of deals that got within we thought spitting distance of getting over the finish line and then fell apart, but we continue to work hard on that project and we have a couple of interesting prospects for the space. So continue to be optimistic, we\u2019ll have something to announce there hopefully in the near future.","In terms of the street retail business and I think the pricing in the market for these assets has definitely moved us a bit to the sidelines. You haven't seen us be as active in retail, as we have in the past, and that's unfortunate in terms of our acquisition volumes, but it is very encouraging in terms of the value of the assets we own. When you\u2019ve seen assets like 693 Fifth and many, many other assets trade at really core stabilized type values with enormous valuations. We feel emboldened about the inventory that we own, just difficult for us to really buy much value add out there, given the investment landscape now.","Steve Sakwa","Okay. And then I guess can you just talk a little bit about the debt and preferred book? You guys were pretty active in the quarter. What is your expectation in the fourth quarter and how do you see that sort of trending over the next couple of years?","Matt DiLiberto","I think with the fourth quarter, we\u2019re on track for our stated guidance of about another $150 million, which should put us right around $2 billion for year-end of balances. It's a good time in the market for the business, there is - the CMBS market has come back, but there are still a lot of uncertainty, regarding risk retention and that's moved quite a number of originators a bit to the sidelines. So it's pushing nontraditional capital to the forefront in terms of getting financings done and we feel very good about the opportunities that we are finding, and the debt we are originating now. So we've also been active syndicators which we have been in years past, and are on track this year to be another active syndicator, sort of verifying the liquidity and the positions that he own, and we would expect that to continue as well through the fourth quarter.","Steve Sakwa","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Blaine Heck","Thanks, related to that last question, Matt, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think the $41 million of additional income from the recap of your debt investment was included in the investment income line, which would make the residual investment income a little over I'd say $34 million, which is a pretty substantial drop from the first two quarters. So is that right? And if so, is there anything else one-time in nature going on?","Matt DiLiberto","No. So, you are correct, the $41 million of incremental was in investment income, the balance are the income from the balances moves each quarter based on investments that are in there and an average balance we did originate a bunch this quarter, but I think on average, the balance was lower this quarter, and we had some pretty juicy investments pay off earlier in the year, like, 550 Madison, 605 West 42nd. So we\u2019re on track for our full-year target on income the third quarter, barring that one $41 million item that you noted was below, but we are on track for balances and income for the year.","Blaine Heck","Okay, fair enough. And then, Steve, if I'm hearing you right from your earlier commentary with respect to some of the questions that were asked, it seems as though the higher price point segment in the market continues to be tough currently, but you think it can get better by the time you guys are delivering. So I guess is that right? And what do you think it is that might drive the improvement in demand in that segment?","Steve Green","Well, let's - again, let's kind of put it in perspective. If your view is the high-end market is well into the triple digit rents, there will be still a considerable number of leases signed this year and at that price point. In fact, there will be more square footage leased this year at $100 plus rents than there was all of last year. So there are fewer deals, but what's interesting is the size of the deals is growing in that sector of the market place. And I think it's misleading to evaluate where a marketplace will be four years from now, based upon where it's been over the past two quarters. So that's I think a lot of our faith or a lot of our confidence in our rents four years out based upon the kind of feedback that we get as to them recognizing the quality of the asset.","Blaine Heck","Okay, that's helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with UBS. Your line is open.","Nick Yulico","Thanks. Turning to the 28%, a little over that, mark-to-market you've done year-to-date on the new leases signed, how much of that will actually commence this year versus benefiting you next year?","Matt DiLiberto","I would say from a renewal perspective, obviously, those kick in immediately, certainly from a GAAP perspective. The new leasing, which is things like BNS or the Tower 46 leases, those have 9 to 12 months of lead time on them. I don't have the numbers on my fingertips in terms of exactly how much of the 3 million square feet we've done now will be next year, later this year or next year, I\u2019d say the majority given where we are in the year, that's been signed in the last couple of months is more impactful to next year and certainly a new leasing is a next year impacting item.","Nick Yulico","Okay, and I guess you're going to go into some of this at the investor day, but if we use like say your lease expiration schedule on page 48 of the supplemental, it looks like your leases in place today are, call it, a little over 10% below where market asking rents are. So as we think about the 28% you've done this year versus this page which says it averages out at a little over 10%, how do we think about that sort of change in the mark-to-market and how it may affect some of your growth opportunities over the next couple of years?","Matt DiLiberto","I will say it's accurate that we will get into this in more detail in December, that's the lead off, but I would also say if you look back at where we thought our mark to market would be one year ago on what we did this year, it was not 28% either. So Steve has done a very good job in outperforming his own and our expectations and we\u2019ll look at it into more detail on our expectations for next year in about six weeks.","Nick Yulico","Fair enough. Just one last one quickly on the banks. I know everyone talks about the banks maybe not being as impactful as they were in the last cycle. Banks have trimmed down space, maybe they don't shed some more space in the market. But I guess one of the things I'm wondering is - maybe Steve or someone else could comment on is there is still some non-headquarters bank space in the market that perhaps banks won't need all of that in the next five years as banks face some new capital rules that haven't even begun yet. How should we think about that risk of this potential excess space for banks in the market? Thanks.","Marc Holiday","Nick, I don't think we can do that on this call. It's a forecast that we think is the near or mid-term demand for banks and the impacts, we can take your questions duly noted and focus in on that in about a month and a half, but we can't say that in 60 seconds and I just want to leave it with, I don't think it's a foregone conclusion that banks are going to do poorly over the next few years or do great the next years. I mean, we sort of take it as we see the numbers come in, in terms of profitability and job growth. The banks right now are reasonably healthy, a lot of the leasing in the first half of the year was financial services driven, not just big one, but the financial sector. Whether that will be the case in the second half or not, we\u2019ll see, but we are not seeing, I think what you've heard earlier, any major reductions in bank space demand or putting on the space of sublet space or anything that would raise sort of cautionary flags for us on the banks, it's a good trend that what used to be 40% of the market now is closer to 30% or 35% of the market, probably a third of the market.","And maybe in 3 to 5 years, it will be 30% of the market, because you have healthcare growing, education growing, the government sector is growing, information is flowing, technology is growing, business services, so it's a dynamic market, that's the beauty of New York City, dynamic and you have so many calls, so many claims a limited amount of building inventory that it's just not easy for most tenants to lease space and when they can, they are relatively quick to do so. And let's see, we will forecast how we see banks play into that mix in December, but it's a complicated question, and I don't think we will do justice on this call, but it's duly noted, so thank you.","Nick Yulico","Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Craig Mailman","Hey, guys. Just quickly I think you noted that you guys have actually checked off a lot of boxes of what I think investors had thought would move the stock, but you're still trading at a mid to high 20% discount to NAV. You guys put in the $1 billion share repurchase plan not too long ago. Just curious your thoughts on executing on part of that. How you view returns on buying back stock versus investing elsewhere and how you manage leverage potentially.","Matt DiLiberto","My first instinct is, let's handle that in December 2, but it's a fair question. So we put that program in place because, a, it would be imprudent not to. So we wanted to put something in place and make it meaningful so that we have a tool available to us if we see things happening within the stock that we feel are so violently dislocated that we view it as an opportunity that exceeds all other opportunities available to us at the time. And so one, it could be viewed as therefore moments in time and then there is a second view, which could be if there continues to be sort of the systematic dislocation between private sector valuations, which continue to be fairly robust and public market valuations, which I would say in general are below that and like us seem to be far below that, then I think you have to start looking at systematically dealing, how you approach that problem with stock buyback being one of the tools that can be used along with asset sales and dividends and special dividends and everything else.","So it certainly isn't exclusive, but it's certainly something we are becoming increasingly focused on as we see a year like this year where there is going to be $40 billion of sales, probably by end of year, all of which are executed at cap rates and per square-foot prices, pretty much right on top of last year's record $60 billion or $65 billion of sales and while the volumes have decreased, the pricing for the well located redeveloped well position assets really haven't decreased and we could see scenarios where in 2017 that demand may increase because on a relative basis, the kinds of returns those assets produce which are anywhere between 5.5% to 6% unlevered and that might translate to 7% to 8% levered. Those are by and large, considered to be excellent core returns for great properties, which justify the pricing levels which are so dramatically ahead of what the implied pricing levels are in the public security.","So I would say it\u2019s there at a prudent - it\u2019s there for opportunistic and maybe it will there systematically. If this diversion doesn't seem to correct itself at some point in time, but for now, we have not executed on it at this point and if not, I would say the current focus of us at the moment, because we have all these other what I consider to be excellent opportunities that we are taking to manage both in the equity, other equity investments and leasing and redeveloping and structured finance. So we are having a real buzz here, but it is there and it is something that I think we are going to pay a lot of attention.","Craig Mailman","Thanks for the color.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Brad Burke with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Brad Burke","I'll just ask one question. Marc, a bigger picture question to follow up on your point about New York not needing much growth to offset the 75 basis points or so of annual supply growth. The office job growth in New York has been pretty robust over the last five years and it doesn't seem to have translated into meaningful improvement in Midtown availability rates. So if we are now looking at what looks like decelerating job growth, why wouldn't that translate into higher availability rates going forward?","Marc Holiday","Well, I think if you look, I don't know what period of time you are looking at, Brad, but if you look at, we can again do this in December. We've got a lot of stuff that we can knock off in December. If we look at from, I will call it the trough of the market to where we are today, I think the availability rate is in about 400 basis points, and that's what the job growth. It's the best I can tell because a lot of these are occupancy, our occupancy is up about 400 basis points, and I think availability has gone down from about 13.5 to 9.5. So that's a lot of space, 400 basis points, 400 million square feet and since a lot of the inventory is future inventory, all of the absorption if you will in reduction, I think, but seems like predominantly if not exclusive to job growth.","","So I think it has been there. The only reason you haven't seen it take a whole another route in 2016 is because while private sector job growth is almost 80,000 new jobs this year, which may put it on pace for 100 total by end of year, which would make it one of those rare record work, or near record years. The office using has lagged behind that, we may only get this year. I'm speculating about 10,000+ jobs which would be, let\u2019s call it, half of the prior year, but as I mentioned earlier, the big five numbers are up and even though you can't punch everything off of that, looking more broadly at Wall street firms broadly define, their profits for the year were estimated to be by the city, $10 billion.","In fact through the first half of the year, they were $9 billion and the city I believe will be revising its estimates for the full year, and it's going to be well in excess of $10 billion. So it's not to say by a long stretch that office using job growth for the balance of this year or into next year couldn't pivot and be the higher, but anyway, to answer your specific question, as to whether it's been translated or not, we will do a little study for December, but I think you have seen the correlation between job growth and reduction availability, which has been fairly programmatic through \u201815 and has leveled off a bit in\u2019 16.","Brad Burke","I appreciate it, thank you.","Marc Holiday","Thank you. All right, everyone. Thank you for the call. We\u2019re right about 3:05. So right on time. We are looking forward as we always do to a great investor day in the newly revamped style that Matt took you through at the beginning and I guess that will be the next time we have an opportunity to speak to everyone. So until then, we will keep working hard. Thank you very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

Thank you.","I will now turn the call over to Marc Holliday. Please go ahead, Marc.","Marc Holliday","Good afternoon, all, and thank you calling in today. It's hard to believe that the book is already closed on the first quarter. More typical let down in activity we often see in the winter months was certainly not appearing this year as we had a very active quarter with solid results. I\u2019ll hit some highlights and convey to you some observations on how our markets are performing, before opening up the phone for questions.","On the demand front, our leasing performance was ahead of budget and we remain on track to meet or exceed our leasing goals for the year. We concluded leases for nearly 350,000 square feet of Manhattan office space within the portfolio having a 21% mark-to-market, supporting our December projections of market activity in Midtown.","Since the end of the quarter, we signed another 70,000 square feet of deals and our current pipeline is actually expanded from the last quarter to a total of 665,000 square of leases and term sheets currently in negotiation. This pipeline represents over 50 transactions almost entirely made up of deals for space that are 50,000 square feet and under reflecting the highly lease nature of our portfolio.","At this point, we are really just filling in pockets of space around the portfolio and renewing our bigger exposures which are scheduled to be happening in the future generally occurring within the next 24 to 34 months so that we keep maintaining our industry-leading average lease terms of 10-years plus and we keep our near-term rollovers for the balance of 2017, 2018 and then into 2019 at very, very low levels relative to the total portfolio size of about 28 million square feet.","A particular note, we're generating this leasing activity while still holding the line on tenant concessions. Our average TI for renewal deals was just under $20 per square foot for the quarter and just around $63 per square feet for new deals. This represents levels well below what we incurred throughout all of 2016 which makes our rental achievements for the quarter I believe that much more impressive.","We certainly read the reports and we\u2019re aware of certain deals will take a different approach and buy up the rents with outsize TI packages. While these occurrences are infrequent in terms of you know number of deals in the market where we see that occurring, they often do get a lot of scrutiny enough variety and I think that elevates to a level that indicates a trend which really we don't see within our portfolio but our philosophy is to lease at the market and hold the line on tenant concessions and we encourage shareholders to take note of the varying approaches to leasing, none being right or wrong different.","On the retail leasing front, certainly our success is we're not limited to office as we carry out our business plan to re-let substantially all of the space vacated by arrow style last year and to do so it rents that will ultimately result in a 30% mark-to-market relative to the old arrow rent.","The lease we previously announced with the Korean technology giant, LINE FRIENDS, combined with a just recently announced retail leased to Viacom is certainly further proof of SL Green's ability to outperform the market with respect to retail, as well as office. In fact, we currently only have two spaces available within our high street retail portfolio with limited explorations to 2018 and in those limited instances we believe we will have the opportunity to substantially increase our rents due to the below-market nature of what's rolling.","While there are fewer retailers in the market at the moment, we certainly have a different retail story to tell as our high street portfolio continues to be a source of extraordinary earnings growth and profitability and I think this was crystallized in our recent announcement yesterday regarding one or two Green Street where we entered into an agreement to sell a 90% interest in the property and an attractive valuations to the Company due to the expectations of our ability to lease that space and favorable market rates in the near-term.","So these balance leasing markets both in the office and retail sides of the equation are supported continued high property valuations and I think this is evidenced on the largest of the sales with the sale 245 Park Avenue which trophy asset that traded hands to a Chinese purchaser with several others including ourselves in pursuit.","This transaction shows that private institutional demand in contrast to public read equity markets is still significant with what seems like literally amount of equity capital searching for high quality deals in Manhattan.","I\u2019ll sort of wrap this with a discussion of some of our achievements relating to our One Vanderbilt development project in the first quarter and then we\u2019ll take some questions. There's a lot that went on in the first quarter, I\u2019m happy to say that we are really starting to feel the excitement and the enthusiasm of this development project as we complete our excavation, we begun our foundation walls, we will be laying our first deal in June and by the end of this year, we would expect to have five or six floors of steel rising from base level of the project.","In furtherance of that, Tishman construction has signed the GMP with us for the entire construction cost of the project and I'm happy to say that that GMP was signed below the low-end of our what we call the goalpost, the low end of our goalpost budget. So we have experienced some savings to date with our 80% procurement and we expect to be able to deliver the other 20% of procurement at or below budget as well and you know essentially a big element of risk in the project has now been assumed by Tishman not just for construction costs but also milestone scheduling all of which I believe will lead us to a very well executed development that will be delivered both on time and under budget.","So we were happy to report that and that was done in conjunction within a matter of days of having received from the city of New York our building permit. So it's good to know that we can actually go forward and officially build this project. We've cleared, we took about six or nine months of hurdles with the city to submit all the plans and go through all the requisite, inspections and meet all the different requirements to be eligible for this permit. We now have it so we are completely green light to go in that regard.","Obviously we talked about previously in the first quarter of closing of our joint venture for approximately 29% of the equity with the Korean pension fund service and with Hines investors. And that obviously 71% of the project with us but with $525 million equity commitment that we now have in the project combined with the $1.5 billion of construction financing which is locked and loaded, our future equity commitment to the project between now and 2020 is less than $100 million a year and we feel that this project is now extraordinarily well-capitalized and able to be completed so that really all focus at this point can be put on marketing and leasing at this space while the construction group carries out the construction project.","And to that end, in furtherance of our marketing efforts, I would say we achieved a sort of a pivotal moment and the deal where we were able to partner with one of the most renowned chefs and restaurant tours in the country perhaps in the world Daniel Boulud. And we are extremely happy to have announced just days ago our partnership with Daniel to construct and operate a 11,000 square-foot restaurant on the second floor of One Vanderbilt, I think really marking a point of, not just fine dining which is certainly will be but really a whole rebirth of great restaurants in this Midtown area.","This restaurant I think in particular will be leading the way not only for the local business folks and in residents and tourists but also for tenants of this building this will be an extraordinary amenity in terms of the food offerings that will be made available to tenants in a number of different ways throughout the building.","So, all in all great progress in three months happy to report that, and it really I think sets up well for a hope will continue to be very successful 12 to 18 month marketing efforts as we continue to meet with tenants on our path towards being able to sign-up some leases which we know had rolled out. Our expectations for that both last December again January a lot of that happening towards the middle and end of 2018. So, that's the report on One Vanderbilt and the quarter.","With that operator why don\u2019t we open up the calls for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from John Kim of BMO Capital Markets.","John Kim","Thank you. Marc I wanted to ask if you can elaborate on your views on the pricing of 245 Park Avenue, do you think this is a high watermark as far as price per square foot for the size and how will this impact pricing for properties like Worldwide Plaza and 1515 Broadway if at all?","Marc Holliday","Well, let me first speak about 245. I don\u2019t really see it as a higher watermark, I mean it's about 1240 foot or so depending on I guess, you know, what foot you're using, but let's call it right around 1200, 1250 foot. That I think for trophy asset and quality location is somewhere between average, maybe even below-average. I think the best building in New York today have commanded and I think will continue to command $1500 a square feet and higher, the best building new construction 1800 square feet to 2000 feet.","So that to me - if you want to add high watermarks, they'd be looking at 1800, 2000 feet for that's the construction in new - in best locations 1200 a foot, I think is unto itself unremarkable I would look at the yields going in cap rate on that, its reportedly somewhere around between 4.8% and 5% again depending on exactly how you would go about measuring that.","And I think when - most importantly the proper for measurement is what kind of expected returns would a investor be able to see a project like that and I think is very consistent with returns where they've been marked for assets sold in '15 and '16 and beginning of '17, I would say unlevered IRRs approaching 6% and levered IRRs is of depending on how much leverage you put on to 8% and 8.5%.","So I think you heard on these calls before 6%, 8%. 6% unlevered, 8% levered for trophy assets completely in line and I think completely understandable in an environment where borrowing costs are 4% or less for conventional level of financing. It's an excellent asset and I trust the buyer will be quite happy with this particular purchase over the long haul.","John Kim","Can you provide an update on 1515 Broadway and what the potential use of proceeds going to be?","Marc Holliday","Well, an update in terms of that's one of the assets that we currently are in discussions with certain larger investors for potential JV in the property. So I can't update you rather than to say, I would have said you looking for, we're in discussions and I think we are having good discussions. But, that\u2019s the update.","In terms of the later expect the use of proceeds, you know, everything is front of our business plan. We saw our goals for the year when we met in December, I presume that we had acquisition goals, we have the potential for increased levels of structured finance.","We have a stock repurchase program that's up on the - that\u2019s been allocated and approved and we could always choose to further de-lever although sitting here on an NAV basis below 37% loan-to-value, that, you know, I don't think is necessarily the highest and best use of those proceeds but it is a possible use of proceeds. I would point you towards those and possibly others. Thank you.","John Kim","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O\u2019Neill.","Alexander Goldfarb","Good afternoon. Just first, on the New York REIT, the stock position was there something - presumably this was something legacy for many guys were in the hunt for it or was this transaction that was after you guys were pursuing that company?","Matthew DiLiberto","Alex, this is Matt. So that position we divided in the second half of '16 and then sold out in the first quarter.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay, cool. And then, maybe for Steve Durels. In some of the broker commentary you were highlighting - and Marc you talked about it but the increase of concessions out there in the marketplace. How do the tenants look at it, are the tenants swayed by, you know, there is one landlord that\u2019s offering a huge amount of concessions that high base rents versus other one, someone else is more on effective basis.","Are the tenants really swayed by that or is it something where we are going to see more of this comment and more appropriate commentary about concessions especially as step on the far west delivers?","Matthew DiLiberto","I don\u2019t think there is a consistent way that tenants look at, it has a truth. Everybody manages their business from a different point of view. Some are all about capital preservation, others are about occupancy, savings, so it really depends on who you talking to. You could sort of bucket a little bit by industry sometimes but, having said that, it's very hard to partial that.","I mean we deals with tenants where they want the turnkey installation and they want to pay a premium rent, it will put the capital into the space. We have other tenants who come to us to say, hi, we are sitting on capital, we are willing to put in the space, we would like to net down our rents.","And, you know, from the management of our portfolio we have the flexibility to address each of those desires.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. But, you have never seen - but it sounds like in general, you don\u2019t see tenants unless or like to maybe a small looking for pre-built, it doesn\u2019t sound like you have tenants who are readily swayed because one person is offering significant concessions first and other there, sounds like they look at pretty much the effective?","Matthew DiLiberto","No, no, I think just the opposite. Some tenants look at it net effective but I think the driver could be one young person looking in and saying, I want to lower my occupancy cost and therefore net out some concessions. Others will look out and say, I want to preserve my capital and I\u2019m going to pay higher rents.","So, it really is great tenant specific. Clearly, you have seen some landlords going to the market, and it's sort of a new phenomenon I can tell you, certainly in my career where landlords who generally have a short terms investment horizon or willing to spend extraordinary amount of capital to buy out the rents, because they expect to exit other buildings in the near future.","But, that kind of new to the game but, and I think it's part of it is driven by the fact that interest rates remain low.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. I appreciate that. Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Jamie Feldman with Bank of America.","Jamie Feldman","Great thank you I guess Steve sticking with you in the leasing market can you just give us a little more color on kind of trends you saw during the quarter I know you still come toward the 1.6 million square foot target, but thinking about how much you did in the first quarter look at your comfort keeping that level?","Steven Durels","Well I tell you the big difference is that in some of the buildings that we were challenged with last year even though we had good velocity and buildings we had portions of certain buildings that were challenged.","First example being 10 East 53rd Street where we did a lot of leasing but it was on the top half of the building and this year we've been able to knock off a good portion of the base of the building which are, the larger four place relative to a small building, but don\u2019t upgrade lying there and different price point.","But last year it was hard pressed to even generate proposals and this year we've already signed two leases we\u2019re about to already sign a third floor we\u2019re trading paper for the balance. So that building is well on a path to be fully backed by third quarter I would say.","Tower 46, same story and that went down to the last 145,000 square feet of space over there. We're about ready to sign a full floor lease. We got a lease out in one of our pre-builds, tour activity has picked up partly because I think you know once the building was fully introduced to the marketplace we started to see more tenants come through. Once the first tenant occupies the building and the doors were open for business that generated a level of activity.","So I feel very good about that. And the fact that quite frankly we don't have any big blocks of current vacancies to speak of - we've got pieces and parts that were backfilling in us as Marc spoke about. So we\u2019ve got good velocity and \u2013 a lot of deals to meet the leasing target because we don't have that big block in the B sort of two or three big monsters that ramped it up for us.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. And can you remind us what are you next big blocks that you\u2019re working on or that you have available now?","Steven Durels","Well I\u2019ve got a Tower 46 to start 146,000 square feet remaining. 45 Lexington's got 200,000 square feet and the news building the 220 still has gone a 124,000 square feet. After that the largest I know but those are not contiguous blocks those are just availabilities after that our largest availability in the portfolio drops down to more like 67,000 square feet.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. And then your next big expiration?","Steven Durels","Would be 100,000 square feet of small spaces rolling in Graybar so the largest unit of being about 20,000 square feet and another 70,000 square feet of 45.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. All right, thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Manny Korchman with Citi.","Manny Korchman","Good afternoon. Steve just while you\u2019re earn on if I'm thinking about tenants renewing and whether they think about renewal timing and also rate. Are they more willing to sign with you now sort of 24 months ahead of expiration are they willing to roll a dice and see how sort of momentum of rental rate and availability goes over the next calls to off to 24 months?","Steven Durels","Again it\u2019s not a hard and fast rule with that it\u2019s generally driven by size of requirement so the bigger tenants have a longer time horizon where they'll make a decision earlier to the game the smaller guys went away to the last minute, most tenants I think are influenced by or many tenants are influenced by their point of view as whether they think the economy and the marketplace is headed.","But, you\u2019ve seen us over the past several years we\u2019re able to get ahead of our lease roll because we\u2019re actively out there encouraging tenants to do early renewals. And that\u2019s benefited us through our market cycles and as we sit here today with a beneficiary, with a low rollover of both 2017 and 2018. So we can weather wherever storms comes our way.","Manny Korchman","Great and then on March it\u2019s going impact anyway RT appreciate the timing comes from that but maybe you could provide us some more behind your thought process of both buying and deposition and selling it more recently?","Steven Durels","So I think in terms buy into it we underwrite and we pursue New York City assets so I don\u2019t think we\u2019re particularly driven by weather it\u2019s owned in public or private entity I mean you should assume I would think at all times that any large deal New York City-based asset \u2013 office asset offerings will have significant interest in and from time-to-time take a division. What was the second part of the question?","Manny Korchman","Why sell now?","Steven Durels","Well when you say sell now I think we sold now I think we sold \u2013 a few months ago as I recall but we sold it right after the announced plan of liquidation. So I think just right at or when we plan a liquidation it was either done or in our minds was headed towards absolutely being dumb we decided that was the right context in investment for us so that was it.","Manny Korchman","Right thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Lewis with SunTrust.","Michael Lewis","Thanks not to beat New York REIT to debt but were you initially interested in finding the security or the company \u2013 because if it was security why not just buy shares of SL Green which also traded at this now?","Steven Durels","Can you ask that Michael I am not sure I understood that?","Michael Lewis","I am just wondering if you were interested in you sort undervalue at security or if the interest initially was really to own the assets or the company and if it was the security why by that instead of buying your own stuff?","Steven Durels","Look I mean I don\u2019t look at it as either\/or so that\u2019s I think those are your words. We buy assets routinely I guess you can make a question why do we buy any assets. This was a stock purchase I think we\u2019ve got industry-leading knowledge of New York City assets. We thought it was a prudent investment we made at that time I think it turned out we were right but I think we made money on it.","So I'm not sure how 4.5 million to us a share of purchase or whatever you know thereabouts has any bearing or relation to everything or anything else we do in the company. I wouldn't set it up as a either\/or scenario, I think we invest lots of money every year sometimes in fiscal year ability to more or some years less. And we\u2019re always looking to try and get the best risk-adjusted returns we can and cover all the ground we possibly can in New York City. And so I think that you\u2019re already saying job well done, so thank you. Anyway, next question.","Michael Lewis","My second question this largest mezzanine position in your book is that 666 Fifth Avenue and if it has given it\u2019s been in the news quite a bit lately, how do you kind of view your position there?","Steven Durels","Yes, I think first of all what is your largest position.","Matthew DiLiberto","It is not 666.","Steven Durels","I mean we don\u2019t disclose - our position specifically \u2013 we don\u2019t disclose specifically\u2026","Matthew DiLiberto","We don\u2019t disclose our position specifically but it is not typically.","Michael Lewis","Do you have a loan on 666 Fifth or you can\u2019t disclose that either?","Steven Durels","No, I mean we never have - I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re saying yes or no because it\u2019s.","Andrew Mathias","We don\u2019t disclose specific mezzanine investment.","Steven Durels","I think this supplemental to-date has given just about as robust our disclosures as we can short of actually pinpointing particular locations we do that really for borrowers who otherwise are in a custom to that type of discrete note I disclosure of the capital stacks when they borrow traditionally from banks other forms of lenders. So but I think we put just about everything else in terms of type of loans, exposure, rate, term and everything so it\u2019s all in there, but no you asked about the large exposure it\u2019s not 666.","Michael Lewis","Okay. The largest one it\u2019s look like the last dollar per square foot is almost $1,200 is there anything to talk about there then?","Andrew Mathias","Yes, it\u2019s an asset with a significant retail components so I think the asset yeah.","Michael Lewis","Understood okay.","Andrew Mathias","About 1,200 north of book.","Steven Durels","It is short of get to may be more of the hardware what you\u2019re asking we are extremely confident that that book is money growth. If that\u2019s the question I am just not sure of the question. But if the question is hey you got a big loan at \u20ac1,200 a square foot do you think what do we think of that and others. This portfolio on average we think is about 65%, 70% loan-to-value just like our value.","Often our borrowers value, appraised value, market value tend to be a little higher but in our internal values we\u2019re at around 65% to 70% less dollar there is nothing in the portfolio approaching you know anything that would be over 100 or probably not even over 90 or 80.","So it's an extremely good collection of New York City collateral almost entirely made up of office and retail, maybe some multifamily and maybe a couple bridge loans. I want to say almost completely devoid if not entirely of luxury condo loans, development or otherwise and its yielding somewhere between 9% and 10% my guess.","So this is a program we've been doing for about 20 years extremely profitable you know losses are infrequent almost not for two I would say nonexistent and dating back on this over a decade ago and you know it's still a very good market for us to be originator and syndicator of that paper which we did inside in the first quarter. I want to say over $450 million worth of so of new originations.","Michael Lewis","Okay. I appreciate it thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley.","Vikram Malhotra","Thanks. Just on One Vanderbilt the partnerships that you announced can you give us anymore color on sort of what the economics of this partnership is this sort of template on model let me be used for other retail restaurant deals in the building?","Steven Durels","No I think to the contrary because this is not a template to roll floor this is very what I would call special situation I mean we have many restaurants, tenants and leases and some very excellent and high-performing - World number one restaurant just voted this year 11 Madison soon to becoming Four Seasons 280 Park legendary forces with 280 Park it\u2019s very high performing lava over say 25 Madison we have excellent tenants and restaurant tenants and we have ones that are very profitable in the space.","But this is, I think you have to look at this much differently this is a part of the fabric of the building because of the interconnectivity of the importance of creating a restaurant that is both a destination a quality of food offering that are going to be consistent with the extraordinary high quality of the building itself and the location itself.","And the kind of amenities that it can provide to our tenants of the building which is something that we want to be a part of quite frankly and having the opportunity to partner with the Chef Daniel Boulud to look as extraordinarily honest and real happy to do it and the economics are pretty much straight up. I mean we\u2019re going to all be investors.","We\u2019re going to our joint venture consisting of us and our partners they are going to put up the lion share of the capital. But Daniel has a real money invested and I can\u2019t speak the cost or any details yet because this restaurant now will be first design and costed, but we are confident that it will be squarely within our budget because we have a within our three point whatever billion dollar budget.","There is - obviously ample dollars that have been allocated for restaurant and amenity space and op deck et cetera. So it will fit squarely within that and the profitability we hope will be in excess of what would have achieved as a leasing results because we've got some really special things that were working on together that we think will be quite successful and quite rewarding in monetary sense. So we\u2019re really looking forward to it. Thanks for the question.","Vikram Malhotra","Okay. And then just on the back on the leasing pipeline I am just trying to get a sense versus the last quarter we\u2019ve been tossed back and forth on different ways, verticals in the financial segment in terms of easing. I am just wondering in your own pipeline have you seen that the composition change anyway are financials now a bigger part smaller part and any interesting trend by price point?","Steven Durels","There is no double that the pipeline of both leases out and term sheets been negotiated are heavily weighted towards the fire sector right now within our portfolio. No comments about the overall market per se but I think that\u2019s a function of the product that we currently have available are the type of buildings that appeal to that profile tenant you, but within the leases out probably half the square footage that we have leases out right now are with our fire sector tenants and the good third of the leases that we have in term sheet negotiation are in the fire sector as well.","Vikram Malhotra","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI.","Steve Sakwa","Thanks, good afternoon. Steve I was just wondering if you could spend a little more time on the leasing and just maybe give us a sense for the types of tenants and their desire to expand are these new deals, are these kind of movements within the city, are these new tenants to Manhattan just trying to get a sense for you know how many are taking expansion space, how many contracting and maybe if there is any kind of flavor around the industries?","Steven Durels","Well first remember that with the leasing that we've done to-date and with the leases that we are asked right now there's no monster deals right it has been a lot of mid to small type leases because of \u2013 while we stop right now.","But generally speaking it certainly not new initiatives moving into the city its tenants that are making decisions to either go into a different quality building or different quality of space. They\u2019re restacking they want to use the space differently a bunch of them have been driven by expansion, but maybe I think it\u2019s different tack on it.","One of the things for instance that is \u2013 that\u2019s kind of notable right now I think if you look at 280 Park Avenue, 280 Park has been on fire this year. And we had more space we have more deals for that building and all the financial services most of them have an expansion component. And if we signed all the leases that are out right now we\u2019ll be down to 1% vacancy in that building.","So that building is put away when you look at tenants over 10 East 53rd Street pretty wide diversity of type of businesses both financial services, luxury goods, fashion tenants are driven by largely by needing to restack and pick up expansion space. And then if you look at Tower 46 I think that\u2019s been a pure track to percent who want upgrade for the quality of the space.","Steve Sakwa","Okay, thanks. That\u2019s it from me.","Operator","Our next question comes from Craig Mailman with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Craig Mailman","Just on One Vanderbilt I know you\u2019ve kind of recent expectation can\u2019t expect leasing until next year, but one of the financial service tenant that importantly looking at your buildings also now importantly looking at the west side. Just curious if those requirements would be the same or if they\u2019re kind of different and they could take space at both spots?","Steven Durels","Well I tell you know what any big tenant of size is coming through our doors there is no doubt about it. We still are you three and a half to four years out on time horizon so that\u2019s our biggest challenge to-date, but you know whether they come our way or they go to the west side it confirms one thing very clearly which is that New York City is start for new construction.","And if our building were being delivered sooner than we would have a very active leasing pipeline right now. And I feel very good about that based upon the presentations that we begin with the tenants and feedback that we\u2019re getting from both the brokerage community and the tenants that we sit with.","Craig Mailman","And on the pricing has that I think you guys need around 150ish average, is that price point and receptive to people I know it's very early in the process but just to explain to that?","Steven Durels","We don\u2019t need 150 - 150 you\u2019ll remember we put up on the screen with a 7.1% development yield which is fairly extraordinary for a building of this quality and size. So I would just \u2013 lead is funny word I mean that's our expectation, Mike I hope you guys can hear me at the other end otherwise I will be doing a lot of talking and no one been hearing. That\u2019s our expectation of where the market will be with rents at the base of the building, taking some below that and rents above middle of the building, somewhat higher than that.","But I thought we put up on the screen around December a deal at a $135 a foot which still yielded something in excess of like 6%, or right at 6%, just in excess of 6% which is still actually quite high. So you our expectation of pricing averages about 150 for the building.","We feel very good about that price level based on all the conversations we've had up to this point and where it falls in relative to the other significant and most attractive Midtown properties around town where those leases are being done here. They were many, many deals done at levels of a 125 foot and higher over the past 12 months, it just not the million square foot deal now we are not targeting the big million square foot plus financial user for this building and we said.","So and you know that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re not going to have those discussions, doesn't mean it couldn't happen, doesn\u2019t mean it couldn't work great, it just means that this is a very you know we\u2019ve spoken from two building that is designed for value users and kind of the base and mid-session of the building and very high end users at the top of the building who are very focused on location, amenities, design, space, infrastructure, and the like.","And within that regard I\u2019d say we feel very good about where the rents will come out in $20, $22 or something like that as we talking about rents four or five years from now.","Marc Holiday","Just to add to add that the presentations that we've been asked to give to tenants have been with users that have been everything from as small as 35,000 square feet to obviously the very large tenants but the majority of them are for a large tenant and this generally in the 150 to 250,000 square foot range. And we think you know likely what will happen is will land one or two tenants like that and the balance of the building. We will be one and two, four tenants at a time.","Craig Mailman","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nick Yulico with UBS.","Nick Yulico","Thanks. Summing your total a bit about the West side and how it relates to the rest of Midtown I mean sounds like there are some leases in the works that are going to get related Hudson yards some more even further leased up. Brookfield, sounds like has a good interest and starting to hear stories about tenants actually being turned away from West side looking for space because they can\u2019t be tolerated.","And so I\u2019m wondering how much does that are you seeing that helping traditional Midtown yet and what you're trying to lease in One Vanderbilt I mean have some has that activity picked up and that tenants just can't be accommodate over there and increasingly working EBITDA?","Steven Durels","Yes, you\u2019re correct. New construction five Manhattan less in particularly they\u2019ve got two deals pending it left one or two tenants on the side line because they would slightly pull the trigger. Does bode well for us maybe but I think they\u2019re going to deliver this space immediately. Our is still off in the time horizon but it tells you one thing and I keep saying and I think it\u2019s an important which is that tenants want new construction and One Vanderbilt being the only new construction to be delivered in Midtown, is the place where tenants are going to come once we're in this - in the sweet spot of timing.","Nick Yulico","Okay. And then I guess just on the tenant preferred equity investment activity I'm wondering if you could remind us at what at what level you\u2019re comfortable providing financing. If you look it for example 245 Park there looking for it looks like about an 80% overall loan-to-value on their financing I mean can you just remind us kind of where you\u2019re willing to land up to on that and where is sort of pricing in the market right now for that type of mez for those types of investments?","Andrew Mathias","It\u2019s Andrew Nick and we definitely do not have a hard stop anywhere in the capital structure so we are risk adjusted return investors which means we\u2019ll judge the risk of any given position, but what we think is the appropriate return on it and that sort of where we\u2019ll provide capital that goes for equity preferred equity junior mez, senior mez the note, a note mortgage whatever part of the capital structure it is that\u2019s the platform we filled and that\u2019s why we are so successful at generating above market returns.","So because we are one of the only guys in New York City if not the only guy in New York City that can do that so we've seen areas of the capital stock compress for sure. There is a very active senior mezzanine paid right now I think you\u2019ve seen us sell pieces of debt we\u2019ve originated into that market. So you\u2019ve seen ourselves senior mezzanine positions on several of the loan origination we\u2019ve done over the last six months. The CMBS market is near its post 2007 lows so AAA spreads they were at 75 to 80 over swaps.","So the CMBS market aggressive, the debt markets in general there is a very active senior b.i.d. which creates great market conditions for us to generate above average returns in the junior portion.","Nick Yulico","Thanks everyone.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank.","Vincent Chao","Good afternoon, everyone. All of my questions have already been answered here, but maybe just sticking with a DP portfolio I know there is not a lot that\u2019s going off of the balance of the year but I guess is anything notable in terms of timing of the ex Greece scores are practically radical?","Matthew DiLiberto","It\u2019s Matt I mean it\u2019s pretty radical I mean there is nothing really to your point there is not much left to expire for the year or to mature for the year, but nothing significant any one giving quarter and t much like you saw in the first quarter are expectations are that the originations that David and his team do at least equal if not exceed whatever mature at any one given course.","Vincent Chao","Got it okay and then just maybe a cleanup question again maybe on the account side here you mentioned the deconsolidation of position at [indiscernible] Third. Can you just talk about how that\u2019s going to sort impact the reported numbers going forward?","Matthew DiLiberto","Sure yeah we got hung up in accounting no man\u2019s land when we sold the asset last year about February at which point we had to keep the real estate asset on our books and $135 million debt position that we originated couldn\u2019t be shown and we couldn\u2019t record income on it.","The buyer of the asset the current owner refinanced the mortgage in April which means starting with the second quarter we won't have to keep the real estate assets that we actually don\u2019t own any more on our books any longer and we can start to pick up the income on the debt position that was $135 million position and about 5.75% yield.","We will start recording income on that here in the second quarter and that is consistent with what our expectations were when we put out guidance as we did expect the current owner to refinance the mortgage this year.","Vincent Chao","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo.","Blaine Heck","Thanks. Matt sticking with you it\u2019s look like the spend related to Viacom at 1515 Broadway was relatively modest this quarter which was a positive to cash flow. Can you remind us where you are with respect to the total spend there and whether we should expect that to go away this year?","Matthew DiLiberto","Originally I think when we did a lease we said we would expect to go away like two years ago so it's a bit beyond our control is really money that allocate to Viacom to use at their discretion and they have taken quite a long time to use it. So I want to say we have you call it $50 million or so less to fund them I think our expectations are that happens this year but really no way to tell.","Blaine Heck","Okay. And that's been a pretty big drag on cash flow the last couple of years or so and I guess once you guys have done sending on that you'll be seeing higher cash flows so do you think that\u2019s going to have any direct affect on your thoughts on the dividend?","Matthew DiLiberto","Dividends get evaluated at the end of every year as we look forward to the next. Our expectations are we payout a 100% of taxable income we\u2019ll continue to do so whether I don\u2019t think Viacom contrary to your point I don\u2019t think has been necessarily a big drag on cash flow. Every year we have leasing capital we need to spend that's just one lease that had high capital spend for the last few years. But with income increasing cash flow increasing you would expect a dividend to increase.","Blaine Heck","Fair enough, thanks.","Marc Holliday","Yes I think we have time for two more questions please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jed Reagand with Green Street Advisors.","Jed Reagand","Good afternoon, guys. You mentioned that GMP with Tishman and how that was set at the low end of the budget range. Just curious if that crystallizes savings versus the kind of $3.2 billion total budget you guys have laid out for One Vanderbilt if so what that new budget is?","Marc Holliday","I think we\u2019ll revisit that a little later Jed I mean I did say in December and also to reiterate now our goal unlike I think of lot of other people's goals when we set out on a project like this is, God I hope we need budget. We want to realize hopefully significant savings to this budget that we presented to you in the past, but there\u2019s still a long way to go, there is still a lot of unknowns and the GMP is a giant step forward in terms of realizing upon, you know not just the savings at the time of GMP, but also with respect to all the contingency we have in this deal to the extent unused by the end would represent additional areas of significant savings.","So I think it's too early for us to start to quantify that and as we go forward we'll have an opportunity to do that but it does feel good sitting in the position we are now not only to be able to identify those areas of savings right at this early stage before it pieces still and put into the ground just based on purchases we\u2019ve contracted for but also the milestone dates look like we pulled the project forward so far about a month.","And whether a month sounds like a lot to you or it doesn\u2019t sound like a lot to you, in project of this size 30-days forward from what was expected to be in August day to go vertical now in July big, big difference. So it's early and we hope to have continued success as we go forward with the construction but so far things look pretty good.","Jed Reagand","Okay, that's helpful. And then have you guys seen any kind of noticeable changes in values for the street retail market, Manhattan, I guess where would you ballpark cap rates for kind of stabilized retail at this point and investor retail in the city?","Marc Holliday","I think the first part of the question no I think the values they\u2019re still a lot of demand for retail properties no better indication and our trade on one or two green we announced today. And then in terms of stabilized cap rates we always looked between 4 and 4.25 on a stabilized cap rate basis.","Obviously most of our street level retail as part of the prime portfolio has rents that are significantly below market, so we\u2019ve used lower cap rates in terms of expressing the value of those assets. But when they're sort of stabilized and marked at current market 4 and 4.25 cap I think is a good indicator.","Jed Reagand","Okay. Could you guys see yourselves being net investors or net sellers in that business over the next year or two?","Marc Holliday","I think it totally depends on the opportunities. We\u2019re watching the market carefully. There is some interesting situations in terms of properties on the market and tenancy situation. So we'll continue to monitor that is just be totally based on opportunity but certainly not an area of investment we would shy away from.","Jed Reagand","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Guinee with Stifel.","John Guinee","Great, thank you. Matt real quick, depreciable real estate reserve charge of 56 million, can you explain that if you haven\u2019t already. And then second changing over a little bit multi-family, any place on the island on Manhattan where landlords have pricing power in terms of the rent residential and then do you have an opinion on the pricing or the valuation of the condominium market.","Marc Holliday","Where is the net expected rent of John, common, we're prepared for the first time.","John Guinee","You know there were 24 of those already I think.","Matthew DiLiberto","I think the first one is for me right John, so depreciable real estate reserves when you put assets out for sale like we have, exactly likely growth under contract in Sanford Towers which is out being marketed, you need to take the potential losses on those ahead of actually closing on them.","John Guinee","Okay. So suburban market, okay.","Matthew DiLiberto","You got it.","Marc Holliday","On the multi-family question, I think we're seeing good lease up statistic continually to skies, so when I would and say on the far west side of 42nd street, we continue to see good absorption in that building and that's increasing net effective rents so I guess it say there is pricing power there although we are leasing the top of that building as we go up.","So the rents per foot for the higher apartments and I think Manhattan in general multi-family is a relatively balanced market. But I think for new product with great amenities like building like sky, there is pricing power. Residential condominiums I don\u2019t think anybody in this room has any view of.","John Guinee","Great. Thank you.","Marc Holliday","That would do it for today. Thank you everyone and look forward to speaking again sometime this summer.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen this concludes today's presentation. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day."],"19654":["SL Green Realty Corp (NYSE:SLG) Q4 2018 Earnings Conference Call January 24, 2019  2:00 PM ET","Company Participants","Marc Holliday - CEO & Director ","Andrew Mathias - President & Director","Matthew DiLiberto - CFO","Steven Durels - EVP & Director, Leasing & Real Property","Conference Call Participants","Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners","Craig Mailman - KeyBanc Capital Markets ","John Kim - BMO Capital Markets","James Feldman - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Derek Johnston - Deutsche Bank","William Catherwood - BTIG","Nicholas Yulico - Scotiabank","Stephen Sakwa - Evercore ISI","Michael Lewis - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","John Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company","Vikram Malhotra - Morgan Stanley","Blaine Heck - Wells Fargo Securities","Operator","Thank you, everybody, for joining us, and welcome to SL Green Realty Corp.'s Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Results Conference Call.

[Operator Instructions]. Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Marc Holliday. Please go ahead, Mark.","Marc Holliday","Okay. Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We've closed the books on another banner year for the company, in which we met most of our key objectives and positioned the company well for continued growth and outperformance in 2019. Once again, SL Green led the way in New York City in all major areas of our business. On the investments front, we made attractive acquisitions of 460 West 34th Street and 2 Herald Square, in each case, acquiring these assets in unconventional and off-market transactions at pricing that should yield substantial profits to shareholders. We also made a strategic investment in 245 Park Avenue, whereby we will receive an 11% preferred return while also enhancing yields through SL Green's management and leasing of the asset, which we took over responsibility of at the beginning of this year. Additionally, we took possession of 2 high-quality retail assets through the debt and preferred equity program, one on Upper Madison Avenue, one in Soho, and we are comfortable with our basis in these assets. ","Taking advantage of the strong sales mortgage in 2018, where Manhattan investment sales volume topped out at $33 billion for the year, we disposed of mature and non-core assets like 3 Columbus Circle, 635 Madison, 1745 Broadway and a development property in Brooklyn. And in the fourth quarter, we also sold our remaining interest in 131 Spring Street, another retail asset. Most of all, we focused on implementing an aggressive share buyback program that takes advantage of the unprecedented discount in our stock. To date, we have acquired 18.8 million shares and units of SL Green equity, with every intention of continuing this investment strategy in 2019, pursuant to the remaining $686 million of authorized buyback capacity. Without question, we continue to believe that the repurchasing of our shares at today's heavily discounted pricing is the most attractive investment opportunity before us. With that said, we received some questions as to why we weren't more acquisitive since our Investor Conference about 6 or 7 weeks ago, and that is simply a function of timing of receipt of capital proceeds from sales and dispositions that could be used to acquire additional shares in a leverage-neutral manner. To that end, we have substantial disposition goals for 2019 that will provide the fuel for additional share repurchases, and we covered the extent of those dispositions in December at the Investor Conference. To be more aggressive in our approach, we necessarily require that we meaningfully increase leverage, which is something that we have said in the past that we're simply not in favor of. Our confidence in the underlying value of our shares is predicated on market conditions that continue to be quite favorable for the New York City economy.","Moving to leasing market. At 32.4 million square feet of leasing activity Manhattan-wide, 2018 was the most active leasing year in nearly 2 decades. And the vast majority of this activity was in Midtown, which finished the year very strong in the fourth quarter and hit an all-time high of 23.7 million square feet leased for the year. So again, extraordinary numbers that show that tenants still in this market have very high desire and aptitude to lease space as jobs are growing and economic activity continues at pace. New York, of course, is no longer a one-horse town, with leasing demand coming from many different segments of the market, including finance, technology, coworking, media, professional services, health care and a litany of other business segments that have created a very diversified demand base that New York City enjoys, maybe more diversified than any major CBB in the country. The market velocity is reflected in our own portfolio performance, whereby we have now brought our own same-store lease occupancy to 96.1% on the strength of 2.3 million square feet of Manhattan office leased in 2018 and another 158,000 square feet of space leased in just the first 3 weeks of 2019.","Note that our 2018 leasing exceeded budget by 700,000 square feet, with a mark to market of 8.6%. We believe leasing momentum will continue throughout 2019 based on our current pipeline of over 750,000 square feet that's already established at the beginning of this year, and that's on the heels of almost 2.5 million square feet of leasing since January 1 of last year.","On top of that, we have the benefit of forecasted job growth. In 2019, in the private sector and the office-using sector, on the heels of 65,000 new private sector jobs in 2018 and a forecast for -- in excess of 20,000 office-using jobs in 2019. There is an incredible amount of economic activity in the city right now, driven by secular shifts in demand. Amazon coming to Long Island City, J.P. Morgan to break ground on its new headquarters, Google's campus expansion, Disney's relocation downtown, and WeWork's breathtaking ascent are just some of the examples of what sets New York City apart from most other major office markets in the country. The dislocation of tenants from buildings impacted by these developments, along with other major redevelopments like 666 Fifth Avenue, is helping to drive positive absorption in addition to job growth and decreases in vacancy levels were seen across the board in this past quarter. So with 2018 now in the record books, we are already hard at work on executing our business plan and creating shareholder value, as we laid out in great detail in our Investor Conference in December of last year.","Notwithstanding these great efforts and our team's extraordinary achievements, our stock price continues to be totally disconnected from the underlying value of the portfolio and the value of this company that year after year demonstrates an ability to outperform in the areas of investments, leasing and operations. Even though we've had a bit of a rebound in the start of 2019, the performance of our stock seems completely divorced from the underlying strength in New York City fundamentals, and we have real conviction that with continued outperformance and share repurchases, the stock should and will return to normalized levels that are reflective of the extraordinary value that is represented by the finest collection of New York City commercial assets ever assembled. And in the process reward our shareholders for their continuing loyalty and support.","So with that, I would like to open up the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Manny Korchman from Citi.","Emmanuel Korchman","Mark, on your sort of closing comment there on the stock returning to more normalized levels, you've been trending at this for quite some time. When you talk about more normalized levels, are you talking about a smaller gap to what the private market value would be or do you think you can achieve almost no gap to the private market value?","Marc Holliday","Well, I think the stock should trade at a premium to the underlying assets, that's where the natural price should be because it would be reflective of not just the value of the assets but the value of this platform, which is extraordinary in many other types of formations. There is a value, sometimes a substantial value, for this platform that we have amassed over 21 years, best-of-class professionals, systems, technology, marketing, tenant loyalty and all the rest. So I think that real estate is worth what it's worth. The team has an extraordinary value on top of that. That's where a properly functioning REIT market should ascribe value to the company. Now value of the real estate is in the eye of the beholder and the way we try our best to illuminate value for ourselves and for shareholders in the market is to be aggressive miners of profits, harvesting real estate and either sell JV assets that are either non-core or reached a level of maturity to demonstrate that value, which we think we've done an excellent job of over the years and did in '18 and intend to do in '19.","Emmanuel Korchman","Great. And then, just turning to Street retail for a second, you've added a couple of assets to your portfolio. I understand the basis and that it was attractive to you. How do you feel about retail in New York City more generally and sort of the direction of whether it'd be retail rents or retail fundamentals?","Andrew Mathias","Manny, it's Andrew. Yes, I think you've got to look submarket by submarket when we go through the retail sort of landscape in New York. And I think in most of our submarket trade areas, we think that rent's at bottom and we're starting to see more activity in kind of affirming of rents that would adjust that there's -- there could be some positive momentum as more retail start to explore those markets with the new pricing level set. Clearly, last year, with the Pooma and Vince leases at 609 we see a bottoming in the Fifth Avenue south of 49th Street area. Soho, there's been more activity lately. Madison, we've seeing a return of activity north of 57th Street on Madison and Times Square has sort of stayed active throughout the entire downturn. So I do think we've seen a bottoming of rents and we'll see more activity in the capital markets this year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb from Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander Goldfarb","Just following up on the DPE book. So two parts. One, if you could just provide more color on the two pieces that gave rise to the $6 million loan loss? And then two, as you take back those two retail properties, are these that you think that you'll quickly flip or you're intending to hold these for the long term?","Andrew Mathias","I'll take the second part of your question, Alex, it's Andrew, and then let Marc answer the first. I think the -- we did last year take back an asset on Third Avenue and quickly resold it, and that's certainly a strategy we can employ. With these two particular assets, they're just in the door, so we're evaluating alternatives. And I wouldn't rule out a quick capital markets transaction. I also wouldn't rule out -- both are leased right now with upcoming tenant maturities, but I wouldn't rule out us putting those assets out in leasing market at well-reduced rents from where they were available previously under old management, old ownership and seeing if we can drum up some leasing activity.","Matthew DiLiberto","And it's Matt, on your first question on the two DPE positions. Yes, I mean we constantly evaluate the portfolio, not only for new originations but also for dispositions on occasion, looking to lighten some exposure, two specific positions. One relatively small, and the other, we're looking to sell a participation in order to move the paper. We just mark to market those two individual positions, again it's on the paper, it's not the underlying collateral just so we can trade this over the course of the next couple of months.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. And then, Matt, while you're there, on 245 you talked -- Marc talked about the 11% coupon and then also fees. So is it 11% on the $148 million investment? And then fees, so -- just trying to get an understanding of how much sort of earnings we're going to get off of 245 between the aggregate of the coupon plus all the fees?","Matthew DiLiberto","That's right. Yes, you stated it correctly. It's 11% on the debt position, $148 million, and then we have leasing and management fees on top of that.","Andrew Mathias","And we still have the other mezzanine...","Matthew DiLiberto","And we still have another mezzanine position as well. Which is, it's a lower-yielding position, another $55 million of mezz that's a legacy position.","Andrew Mathias","More senior position in the capital structure.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay, but in total, sort of Matt, how much earnings are you looking at getting off the building, when you combine all 3 of those elements?","Matthew DiLiberto","You're probably talking $15 million to $20 million.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Craig Mailman from KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Craig Mailman","Maybe just a follow-up on Manny's question. You guys have been active with the buybacks, stocks react a little bit here off the bottom. But what are the levers do you think you could pull if you get through the $2.5 billion and the stocks still trading at a pretty healthy discount to NAV?","Unidentified Company Representative","What are the levers?","Marc Holliday","You're saying beyond continued asset sales or...","Craig Mailman","Yes, what other way would you guys look to narrow the gap? Or you just need to continue to sell assets and kind of cut into the bone here and special dividend back or -- I know you guys have...","Marc Holliday","We had a similar question I think at the Investor Conference. Maybe it might have been you, Craig, I'm not sure. But what I said then and I'll just repeat for purpose of this call. We -- you shareholders are looking at that stock price every day, hour, minute. We look at it as well for you, but we run our business to create value and we do that, we think the best in the business here in the city. And in that regard, the way we get that value is ultimately, by selling our JV assets, which is what we do. So as long as we own that value, which we do, and there's a point I made in December, we know we can always get to value. We own it. We can sell it, we can distribute it, we can reinvest it, we can buy shares with it. But the stock price fluctuates daily and sometimes when you just look at the volatility between a month ago and the low, I mean it's incredible, 20 points, which is over 20% of volatility in a 4 to 6 week period whereas the value of the real estate is like bedrock.","It really doesn't have anywhere near that degree of variability, in any given year it might be up a little, down a little. But right now, we see a very well formed equity and debt market that has real desire and demand to put out debt capital and equity capital this year. New York City still is among the top of the list for most of those institutional foreign and domestic investors, and we feel confident that you'll see very solid trades beginning in the next month or two as people get the gears turning for new investments in 2019. We'll be a player in that, selling assets and proving out value of those assets. Not just proving value, but realizing value. And in realizing the value, we -- that is the lever. So I think we're doing it. I think we do it as much or more than anyone else in our sector. I don't know what's beyond the real estate value. I mean, I think that's it. That's the -- your limit is the real estate value and we have every intention of realizing that for our shareholders.","Craig Mailman","Okay, no, that's helpful. Then just on One Madison, obviously, there's been some rumored interest from a large tenant. Looking at the space, could you just talk a little bit about what you guys have seen there and if that tenant is really kicking the tires or is that just a kind of rumor on the news?","Andrew Mathias","Well, we're early in the market with that building. We've got a spectacular redevelopment plan for the building. The building is probably, without a doubt I should say, the single best located building in the Midtown South submarket. It has the unique attributes of large four plates. It has a really beautiful design as part of our redevelopment. And it's got so many attributes to it that we're in the early stages of introducing the opportunity to the marketplace. We've probably only sat with 7 or 8 tenants at this point in time because it is early in the game. And I can tell you without hesitation that the feedback from each of those tenants was very strong. But as far as any real advanced conversations with anybody, we've got nothing to discuss.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Kim from BMO Capital Markets.","John Kim","A question on 625 Madison. I know you addressed this at your Investor Conference, but can you provide some potential timing on the resolution of the ground rents reset? And also, as this is impeding your ability to release the space.","Andrew Mathias","Well, as to the reletting of the space, we see no impediment that there should be, or will be, other than these errant articles that are probably placed by people of interest with information that is generally factually, we think, somewhere between inaccurate or absurd. So we have a very good feel and read on where we think the reval will shake out, albeit that's in -- that's a few years down the road. And all of that was taken into account when we made the initial investment about 15 years ago. So ground leases and FNB resets is nothing new to us, and hopefully, other people who deal in that part of the market. The vast majority of what we own is pretty simple, but we do have a couple of these leasehold assets with FNB renewals. And in the case of 625, it's been a wonderful investment. I mean, relative to where we purchased it back then, the ability to do that 15-year Polo deal right on the heels of the acquisition, we'll see what the disposition of the Polo space is at the end of -- as their lease term comes at the end of this year. But we expect, at 625, as we expect anywhere in the portfolio, if there is vacancy to fill, we will fill it. The building is in excellent part of the submarket and has an ability to be on the lower-end rent provider in that submarket. We always find that's a recipe for success as opposed to being a high rent provider in a less desirable part of the market. This is the inverse of that, and we think there will be demands. Steve's already -- you're having conversations. We've got 1.2 million square feet that rolled this year or at least that's where we started, maybe we've chipped away that already. Every year, this company is going to have 1 million to 1.5 million feet roughly of space that rolls. Polo's no different than other space that we will fill, if we're presented with vacancy. And I think we do it quite well as evidenced by the fact that we stand at 96.1% lease, which is probably the highest amongst the office sector.","John Kim","When you talk about the inaccuracies of the press article is that the amount that it could be potentially reset to or is there -- were there any inaccuracies...","Marc Holliday","I don't want to -- I probably won't speak to it any more than what I have said for a whole bunch of reasons, not the least of which is some overriding legal reason. So I think I said -- what I said you can read into it, you've seen the article. But you understand what I'm saying.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jamie Feldman from BOA Merrill Lynch.","James Feldman","As you look at the remaining debt and preferred equity book, what's the likelihood we'll see more, either similar deals where you buy out a building, like the retail buildings, or more impairments as you get ready to sell some assets there or some paper there?","Matthew DiLiberto","I mean, we mark the book every quarter with our accounts. I don't -- Jamie, to say, what's the likelihood, I mean, this represents our best estimate as of today of the value of the book. So I can't speculate about what could happen in the future, but this is our best estimate as of today. I mean, you can look at the 20-year history of this program if you want to look to sort of the results we generate.","Marc Holliday","I mean I would sort of add to that by saying I think it's an amazing testament to platform program. The stewardship of David, Rob Schiffer, Andrew Falk and others who run that business day-to-day, that we are in this business of generating these extraordinarily outsized returns while getting, on average, 30% or more equity subordination and having a book that makes about 9% and can ride through these dislocations in the market, most recently in the retail market, with just these -- what I would term relative to $200 million a year revenue modest adjustments to carrying value. We hope the book, as it sits today, is in very good shape. We think it's in good shape. It's a very solid book of business and it could be that we see nothing more for the balance of this year. It should be based on what we see today. Matt, you want to add to it?","Matthew DiLiberto","Yes, Jay, I just want to make the point, I mean, this -- we've been carrying these positions at par, and we could continue to had we not elected to sell the paper. It's a different exercise when you're looking at the ultimate carrying value of the book of business. You look at the underlying asset value, we could carry it apart we elected to reduce exposure and move them, and so we marked them to prices where we can move them efficiently.","Marc Holliday","Yes, that's a good -- that's a great point. I mean, there's a difference obviously between collateral impairment and in a mark to market on a piece of paper that we are looking to sell as part of a risk mitigation strategy. But that's -- there's no -- you shouldn't take into -- you shouldn't come away with the belief that, that means the underlying collateral in and of itself is impaired. This is -- when you manage a book of business, you're constantly trying to manage the risk of that portfolio, and we have a couple of sales teed up that we might or might not execute on. But we intend to execute on at the moment, and we made those adjustments.","Matthew DiLiberto","And if we sell at a better price than the mark, we get that back.","Marc Holliday","Yes. We'll also continue to be opportunistic in terms of opportunities within the book. So I wouldn't say that is done for the year in terms of opportunities following on heels of 460 West 34th Street, 2 Herald and other opportunities that have originated from the finance book. You may see us take more assets into equity from the debt book as the year goes on.","James Feldman","Okay, that was very helpful. And then, Steve, if you could just talk about your thoughts on net effective rent growth, what are your latest thoughts on what could play out here.","Steven Durels","Well, I think what we've seen throughout most of 2018 and certainly, we're experiencing as we sit here in 2019, concessions have, we think, leveled out. Free rent, I think leveled out some time ago. TI contributions don't, from my perspective, feel like that they're trending up any longer. It's deal by deal, it's building by building as far as what we have to pay in order to lend to the tenant. But on an apples-to-apples basis, it's not going up, it's leveled off. And I think that base rents are modestly improving. So therefore, by definition, net effectives should be modestly improving as the year continues.","James Feldman","Okay. Can you talk -- can you just -- I know this is my third question but just, can you -- is there a way to bifurcate the market in terms of where rents are moving and where they are not?","Steven Durels","Well, I think one thing. No, I think in our portfolio, we've seen rents on the lower price points increase more so than at the higher price point. But having said that, we've done an awful lot of leasing at the higher price point space. One Vanderbilt obviously being the best example of that. And as the year has proven out, tenants have been migrating to better quality space. So that means, new construction and redeveloped buildings and being the owner of a portfolio that the majority of our buildings are in fact redeveloped is one of the reasons that we've been successful in keeping it to a full.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Derek Johnston from Deutsche Bank.","Derek Johnston","Can you discuss the progress with the disposition plan and basically, a private market update? And do please include the suburban portfolio. How has price discovery been trending? Are you seeing any interest from cross-border investors or primarily domestic? And how our cap rates and asset value shaping up? They are long two questions.","Matthew DiLiberto","Progress and dispo plan and private market update. Well, I think you'll see as early as next week, the launch of an asset that I think we may have mentioned it before, but I don't see any reason why we cannot. We're going to be in the market with 521 Fifth Avenue for sale. It's a joint venture asset owned by us and account managed by LaSalle. And we -- it's a great building, great assets. We've owned it for a long period of time, it's well leased. But the fitting of the program of trying to recycle assets like that into stock that we think is trading on heavily discounted basis, we think that, that has reached a point in time that we're going to put that in the market. And we're fairly confident that the private market, which I said earlier, I think there's a lot of equity, a lot of debt out there, debt market is very aggressive. We'll meet or exceed both our internal NAV and our pricing expectation. So that will be something that will be real time. There are other assets that we have teed up beyond that for the, sort of, second, third of the year and the back of the year, but we tend to take them one at a time. And I would expect capital rates will be still consistently where we've said in the past, in that 4.5% to 5% range is where we hope to or expect to see pricing settling out on -- for stabilized assets in the first half of this year. Andrew, you want to add to that?","Andrew Mathias","Yes, I think there will be more price discovery as the year goes on. I think there's only been one trade, 237 Park Avenue, partial interest, which traded at a very healthy valuation over $1000 a foot that's been announced thus far this year, although there's several other assets in the market. You asked about the suburbs further. Suburbs is tough, I mean I can let Isaac speak to it in more detail. There is not the liquidity in the suburbs as there is in Manhattan that should come as no surprise to anybody who has been listening to our guidance previously. So we're working hard to try to move the suburban assets.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tom Catherwood from BTIG.","William Catherwood","So, Marc or Steve, in the past, you guys have talked about how leasing has shifted from the West Side back to the East Side of Manhattan in 2018. Do you think this is primarily a result of available space or was it pricing or tenant preference? And how do you expect that trend to play out in 2019?","Steven Durels","Well, what we've also said is that in today's world, tenants will go to where the good product is. And the success that Far West Side enjoyed was the amount of new construction that was over there. It's a secondary location. And the -- but they tend to sacrifice location for the quality of the buildings. That's now shifting back to Midtown, particularly with -- as you've seen with One Vanderbilt Avenue, where the best-in-class product is paired with a best-in-class location. Tenants will come back to the natural place of convenience, and they'll pay the rents necessary to support that decision.","Marc Holliday","I think also looking at the average rents achieved on the West side, initially versus the kinds of rents that are now required to lease that space to make these deals work, sometimes I think the average rent of most of the available 4 million square feet of space are $100 and up, probably averaging close to $115 , $120, $125. And I think there may be resistance point, where tenants who didn't have a resistance to paying $85, $90 a foot to make that locational change, may think twice at $115 a foot and up. And I think that's where you've seen an extraordinary amount of triple digit leases this year in Midtown primarily, for both new product like One Vanderbilt but also for very good redeveloped product like 280 Park and buildings like that.","William Catherwood","Got it. And then on 245 Park, in the past when you guys have mentioned the need for some capital improvements in the buildings similar to what you guys have completed at 280 Park. With your preferred position in the management of the asset, how much control do you have regarding capital plans and how should we think about future capital needs?","Marc Holliday","Well, we don't control the decision on capital expenditure. We would execute it. We'll certainly design it, value engineer it, recommend it and be a proponent of whatever we think makes the most sense. But ultimately, this is a venture and we have an equity position, it's preferred equity position, but it would require HNAs willingness and desire to execute a program like that, especially if it's an ambitious program that approaches $100 million or more, and that's yet to be seen. We just, I think, really got into the building within the past few weeks. So a program like that will probably take minimally 3 to 6 months to conceptualize. And then, based on what we come up with and how that affects the returns and HNAs long-term desires for the assets will have -- we'll sit with them and decide on a direction for the asset.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nick Yulico from Scotiabank.","Nicholas Yulico","First on two Herald. I guess there was a report that Hamleys has taken the retail there. Can you just give us an update on what's going on with the retailer?","Marc Holliday","Nothing finalized yet, Nick. So Retail is still available and if you know any tenants, you can refer them to Brett Herschenfeld.","Nicholas Yulico","Okay. Just a second question on, going back to the talk about the asset sales and this idea that there could be this bucket of other potential sales, which sound like could be some big numbers there. I guess how should we think about if you were to execute on a large amount of asset sales. What do you need that capital for? Is it to not do as much JV equity in One Vanderbilt? One Madison? Is it to pay down debt? What would sort of affect that decision making on those additional asset sales and what you use that capital for?","Marc Holliday","Well, there's different executions for different uses. I mean, generally, we're looking to raise money to buy back stock and keep our leveraged levels neutral. I mean that's the basic goal we have. But obviously, we're also making investment in some key development properties like One Vanderbilt, like One Madison. And 460 West 34th Street, which we haven't closed on yet but will be another redevelopment project that we think is going to be an absolute winner based on our price point and the quality of that building and the location that it sits. And we'll be sort of evaluating, as you mentioned, joint venturing of One Vanderbilt and One Madison, which we don't look at as a negative. We -- it's not like we're trying to sell assets to avoid joint venturing because these joint ventures come with a whole array of development fees and incentive fees and the like, which lets us get value for our shareholders for the sweat and resources that we put into these development deals beyond just accretion of value. So I think you'll see us probably tap into some JV equity for some significant dollars on [indiscernible] for One Vanderbilt, One Madison. And assets sales that might start with 521 Fifth and where we might have 1 or 2 other properties sort of in mind for the year depending how it goes. We're unlikely to do all of that because that would exceed capital or plan or need for the year. So we'll just be trying to figure out how to optimize that and then there'll be 2020 to deal with before you know it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephen Sakwa from Evercore ISI.","Stephen Sakwa","Steve, I was just wondering if you could provide a little bit more detail on sort of the pipeline that Marc mentioned? And sort of the discussions that you're having with tenants? I realize renewal is a little bit different than a new lease but just given sort of the economic uncertainty, what are sort of the challenges or what are some of the things that the decision makers are thinking about as they go into the leasing process, and have you seen any slowdown in sort of the decision-making process?","Steven Durels","Well, we've got over 750,000 square feet of deals pending between leases out and term sheets that we think are likely to go to lease. The complexion of those tenants, financial services clearly is the -- is a dominant within that group, but it's still like we saw last year, strong demand from tax, strong demand from legal and other business services, particularly strong demand at One Vanderbilt Avenue, which is -- currently everything in the pipeline has been both finished the services in law firms, and we are extremely busy at that building as we sit here today. We're at the point in the leasing program in that building where most of the deals that we're talking about today are single-floor type deals. So it's not doing the 150,000 or 200,000 square foot big deal, it's doing the 1- and maybe 2-floor type transactions so it'll be more volume. But the number of transactions and the number of tenants willing to transact at very fulsome rents is I think a very good barometer to the strength of the overall market right now. I don't get a lot of feedback from tenants saying, I'm worried about anything particular. I've heard more of the same of I want to reinvest in my space, I'm willing to take long-term commitments, I want to restock, I want to use my space differently. It's all about employee retention and recruitments, and then they want different work environments. So I think it's really, as we start 2019, very much the way we left off in 2018.","Stephen Sakwa","Okay, and the second question, I guess maybe for Matt or maybe Andrew. Just on the suburban assets and the write-downs that you took this quarter, I guess where does that fit into that disposition program? And just given that you took the write-down with that sort of implies that those were going in the market and are likely to be sold in the near future?","Matthew DiLiberto","Yes, Steve, those are assets that we had as part of our plan for the year, the asset disposition plan. So we're going to be working on those, Isaac is spearheading that effort. And we put those -- we marked those down to the value that we put up on our implied NAV page back in December. So once you change the intent of your hog strategy for an asset, you need to write it down to what the value of the asset is, and so that's what we did this quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Lewis from SunTrust.","Michael Lewis","I saw that Harry Macklowe wants to build a 1500-foot office tower with an observation deck across the street from St. Patrick's Cathedral. And it's early and he has plenty of hurdles to clear, but I'm curious to your thoughts about -- you mentioned getting those triple-digit rents in the city now. I mean, do you think we're at maybe a tipping point where modernizing Midtown space now, after many years of no net new supply in New York, now we have Hudson Yards, do you think we have another -- some runway here of new supply in New York?","Matthew DiLiberto","I'm sorry, that last part you said Michael, is it indicative of what?","Michael Lewis","Yes, just wondering if you -- I used the Macklowe example, I suppose...","Matthew DiLiberto","Okay. New supply coming? Is that the question, Mike? This is the [indiscernible]. Well, look, these -- the East Midtown rezoning of which -- that proposed building would be availing itself of, had a limited amount of air rights coming from landmarks as a potential pool that could be reallocated to other sites by purchased TDR air rights, and we hope and expect new buildings will come off that zoning text change. So obviously, One Vanderbilt kind of led the way with the Vanderbilt Corridor rezoning, J.P. Morgan's 2nd Avenue shoot with the East Midtown rezoning. I think there was one other small deal but I don't even recall offhand which address a small amount of air right. But Manhattan -- East Midtown is so built out in infilled, the number of opportunities to do what Harry is trying to do by assembling sites and getting tenant position and acquiring the air rights and then finding the tenants and financing and Everything. A, very tough to do; b, very long dated, so that when I look at over all of these Midtown, I think if we got incrementally another 3 or 4 good new big buildings out of it over the next 15, 20 years, I would view that as successful. And successful because it's important that Midtown does have an ability at all times to offer an inventory of new space for those tenants that want to pay rents for the state-of-the-art efficient, super toll space. But by no means at all do I think there'll be any kind of overbuilding, if you will, of that kind of space in these Midtown because I think the economics and physical constraints and time parameters of what it takes to do it just won't allow for much more than a handful of buildings over a very long period of time.","Michael Lewis","Got it. And then, my second question. I saw you did a couple of deals with WeWork, and I wanted to ask about, not only just how you think about the risk in our own portfolio but do you think there is a point or maybe we are nearing a point where WeWork becomes more of a risk factor to the overall New York market now that it has several million square feet?","Marc Holliday","Well, we had put -- coworking has its faults. Has certain benefits for landlords, certain benefits for tenants, and we outlined some of those couple in December. I don't know if you recall but we had a couple of slides devoted to just that. And coworking as a group, inclusive of the WeWork deals, I think we have something like, I want to say, 3% of our inventory devoted to coworking, so -- if that. I got to think that's 2% to 3%, maybe 3% at most. So if anything, we're underrepresented in that segment. I think we're comfortable with that because we are 96% leased, so it's not like we have a lot of space to lease. I think often you'll find people who have an abundance of vacant space they're looking to fill, sometimes in the bottom part of buildings or whatever will turn to coworking, but we've done it in the instances we thought it made sense, the WeWork at 2 Herald, which is kind of an umbrella for Amazon who is temporarily, but not so temporarily, locating in that the space, for some time, I guess till their headquarters is built.","And then -- or if not, they have other enterprise tenants we assume who can fill that Amazon space, if Amazon moves out and 609 was kind of a boutique building with about 130,000 square feet, which we thought lent itself well to coworking because it was kind of underrepresented in that area and WeWork things will make go of it and we hope they do. So we look at coworking as something that's good for our market. It takes space up. It's improving the space to a very high degree. So we like that, we like to see that space improve. Their facilities are currently running at 80%, 90% plus as reported to us. So we think it makes sense. Whether it's economic or not, we don't really -- we just have -- we're not in the business beyond Emerge212 so we know the economics of that business, and that business for us has been quite good over the years, although small. But I look at coworking as a net benefit for us as office owners in our market because it absorbs space and improves space, and it's filling a need to service tenants who want highly serviced space.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Guinee from Stifel.","John Guinee","Drill down just a little bit more on WeWork, please. Is this a deal where landlords are putting up zero TI dollars, zero of the FF&E dollars, getting a 15-year lease with a full corporate guarantee or is this a -- the other end of the spectrum, where the landlord's spending $100 a foot plus for tenant improvements, $50 a foot more for FF&E and only getting a guarantee from the individual LP associated with the building. What's the scope on how sausage is actually made on a WeWork's deal?","Steven Durels","Well, I'll speak for the deals that we've done with the WeWork and we've done one modest deal with Knotel as well. The concession packages that we've done and the rents that we've achieved are completely in line and one could argue maybe even more favorable than we would have done with any other type of tenant. So you read about other deals, where landlords made the JVing with the coworking companies, or they're putting up a disproportion amount of the TIs, that's certainly where that industry is trying to drive it, but it's not been in the deals that we've done. And as far as the security deposits that we've been able to achieve, we've gotten what we feel is very fulsome coverages between letters of credits and parent guarantees, the full extent of which we're not at liberty to really disclose but I can tell that from a credit perspective, we think we are well protected.","Matthew DiLiberto","I think, John, we have -- you mentioned paying for FF&E, I mean, we wouldn't -- we haven't even considered taking it to that level. And I think that's more in the nature of the partnership deal Steve was discussing, where you have -- we have WeWork pitching to landlords, hey, build out the space, I'll sort of fill it with tenants for you and I'll take a percentage sharing in the profit.","Marc Holliday","Yes, not to say -- by the way those deals may be fun and we may consider that down the road. We haven't done that. Again, we haven't had a need to and we would want to see the economics proven, but other -- some landlords are going down that pit, we haven't, there's no right or wrong there, it's just we -- we are treating it, for the moment, as just a straight-up market lease exercise.","John Guinee","Okay. And then on 245 Park. I think I understood that you've got $55 million somewhere in the capital stack and then another $148 million of preferred equity. What's your last dollar investment on a square-foot basis? Are you in this thing all-in at $1000 or $1500 a foot?","Matthew DiLiberto","On Page 29 of the supplemental, it is, let's see, $993.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vikram Malhotra from Morgan Stanley.","Vikram Malhotra","Just going back to some comments on The Street retail assets. Can you maybe give us a bit of color how these deals you did, how they sort of evolved? And I was a bit surprised about your comment on offering them to market at lower rents, my understanding is rents are either at market, or in the case of Greene, below market. So I just wanted to get a sense of like how do you see the long-term stabilized return here?","Marc Holliday","Well, I'll clarify your second question first. Just -- the sponsors, the prior owners of these properties, they had a much higher basis than we have in these properties. So they had to achieve higher rents. So when I referred to lower rents, if the prior ownership needed just $1,000 a foot in order to sort of justify and make a good return on their investment, we're coming in at 65%, 70% of the prior owner's basis. So arguably, we should be able to offer them for, call it, 30% lower rent. So we'll balance that disparity versus where we think the spot market taking rents are but we can offer a lower rent. I'm not saying that the -- that's not versus the rent that the in-place tenants are paying, that's versus the rent that the old, prior ownership was offering. And then the first part of your question, the genesis of the deals, these are -- if we make a structured finance investment, we're underwriting it as though we're owning the asset in our basis. So there are assets that we're comfortable owning at a loan basis, obviously, market conditions permitting, and these are assets where we've concluded we're comfortable owning them in our basis. We think there is a good market in Soho for the particular assets we've taken back, and we would expect them to be successful investments.","Vikram Malhotra","Got it, okay. And then, just second question on the DPE book. I understand that these are marks on the paper, not necessarily a view on the underlying asset, but what prompted you or what made you look at the one retail and the one office asset or the paper itself and say, hey, there is a risk building, we don't want to hold it anymore? And can you just clarify, like what percent of the DPE book is Street retailed today?","Marc Holliday","Well, that's a couple -- I'll answer the first part of the question, which is, it wasn't that, that there is risk building, it was just that we look at the returns that we're earning on that paper, and we've decided as the stock price goes down kind of the implied return of share buybacks goes up, so as the return on share buybacks increases, it makes some structured paper and the return on the structured paper less appealing for us to own. So we looked at those assets and said, let's take a mark -- let's market them for sale, take that money and redeploy it into stock buyback. As to the second or part B of the question, I don't...","Matthew DiLiberto","Percentage of Street book at Street retail is less than 10%. Somewhere between 5% and 10%.","Operator","Our last question comes from Blaine Heck from Wells Fargo.","Blaine Heck","Just one for Marc, following up on asset pricing. It seems as though in 2017 and 2018, there was kind of a shadow market of deals that were brought to the market and then pulled back, because the seller wasn't getting the pricing they wanted. So I guess if those transactions were included in average pricing numbers, do you think on average, we've seen any shift to kind of higher cap rates overall versus the peak this cycle?","Marc Holliday","No, I think if anything, it was probably an overexpectation on part of the sellers who were bringing assets to market that may have still been looking for pricing in that 4% to 4.5% cap rate, which would have been closer to the peak, or mini peak levels that we saw maybe in 2015, that probably for all but the best assets are not there now. And combined with the fact that there is one of the things I think people realize as they were marketing their assets is that there was a very strong debt bit away, where they could refinance very aggressively, low spread, high advance rate and remember, tax efficient. They -- unlike our analysis, maybe you guys as holders of our stock, the analysis you might too, most of the deals you're talking about are individual owners who -- where the tax consideration of sale is kind of paramount and on an after-tax basis, they might have concluded -- we know in a couple of instances they did, in fact, conclude that a very efficient refinancing was just a better net exercise than sale at a number they thought: a, was not fully reflective of where they saw value; and b, maybe not reflective of where they hope the value will come back to as markets firm. So I don't think it's -- I don't think it would change anything in my assessment of stabilized core office cap rates in the 4.5% to 5% range. There were enough trades done last year, a major subset of that $33 billion would flow into that category, some of which we sold, some of which we bought. So I feel confident that, that was the pricing, now it just -- it relates to what will be the pricing in '19. That is something that over the next few months, will come to full light, and on the next conference call, we'll have data points to discuss.","Blaine Heck","I guess, just as a quick follow-up. How would you characterize kind of the bid-ask spread at this point. Do you think it's any wider now than normal?","Matthew DiLiberto","No. I 'd say...","Marc Holliday","I don't think so.","Matthew DiLiberto","I'd say, usual. No, there is no...","Marc Holliday","Okay. I guess, that's it. Thank you for everybody. 3:00 on the nose, we've got this down pretty good at this point. So appreciate the questions and we'll look forward to speaking to you again in a few months.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen for attending today's conference. This concludes the program.

This conference call is being recorded.","At this time, the Company would like to remind listeners that during the call management may make forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ from the forward-looking statements that management may make today. Additional information regarding the factors that could cause such differences appear in the MD&A section of the Company\u2019s Form 10-K and other reports filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Also during today\u2019s conference call, the Company may also discuss non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC Regulation G, the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to each non-GAAP financial measure discussed and the reconciliation of the differences between each non-GAAP financial measure and the comparable GAAP financial measures can be found on the Company\u2019s website at www.slgreen.com, by selecting the press release regarding the Company\u2019s second quarter 2017 earnings.","Before turning the call over to Marc Holliday, Chief Executive Officer of SL Green Realty Corp., I ask that those of you participating in the Q&A portion of the call, please limit your questions to two per person. Thank you.","I will now turn the call over to Marc Holliday. Please go ahead, Marc.","Marc Holliday","Okay. Thank you and good afternoon, everyone. With the second quarter now in the books, I\u2019m pleased to state that we finished up the first half of the year on plan. In certain areas like earnings and mark-to-market on Manhattan leases, we are trending ahead such that we are likely to end the year at the upper end of our guidance ranges. In other areas, like lease termination fees, we are trending behind our annual averages but this is likely a positive as we are nonetheless on track with earnings and implies less tenants looking to buy out of the spaces.","Each year, we set out for our sales between 16 and 20 fairly robust stretch goals for the Company, as you know. And nearly seven months into the year, I\u2019m confident that we will meet the vast majority of our stated objectives for 2017. Also notable in the quarter is the initiation of stock repurchases at very attractive pricing which we believe represents an exceptionally good opportunity for the Company, given our strong liquidity position and balance sheet.","Recall, approximately one year ago, the Company authorized up to $1 billion of stock repurchases due to the prolonged disconnect between the stock price and the underlying value of our real estate assets. After executing on approximately $7 billion of asset sales, in 2015 and 2016 we generated nearly $2 billion of net proceeds that we use to retire debt and to build a store house of capacity for opportunities going forward.","As there continues to be significant investment interest from foreign and domestic capital sources for well-located high quality Manhattan office assets, we developed our own internal convection that repurchasing our stock represents among the most attractive investment opportunities for the Company at this time. SL Green\u2019s Manhattan office portfolio from which we obviously generate the vast majority of our revenues, has been undervalued in the market for quite some time. And back in December, we set forth in detail the financial rational underlying this belief. Over this period of time, we have been quite successful at confirming our net asset values through voluminous sales of assets and the market has also confirmed pricing from many other comparable non-SL Green assets. The debt markets are liquid, competitive and quite stable, and the interest rates continue to hover around levels close to historic lows.","The New York City economy continues to appear quite strong with a record low 4.3% unemployment rate and an increasing labor force participation rate. Office using employment in New York City, the statistic that we monitor closely, is up at seasonally adjusted 20,000 jobs through May of this year, which is on par with the last several years. And recall that those years were at -- or had set historic highs in terms of office using employment levels and increment to employment base. And this 20,000 jobs through May will likely result in an upward revision to the city\u2019s full year estimates, assuming the Depart of Labor stats that are due out this afternoon, continue to show growth in June. The big five New York City banks also reported earnings up 4.5% Q2 over Q2, although most of the office using job growth is coming from the diversified business services sector and not from the fire sector.","Also of note is the leasing velocity and leasing volumes in the first half of the year, which amounted to about 2 million square feet of net absorption in Manhattan. And our own leasing pipeline bears out this increasing leasing velocity as our pipeline stands at 1 million square feet, over half of which are represented by leases out to signature or under negotiation that\u2019s obviously up substantially from last quarter.","The one area of weakness that we see in the market is in the retail sector where demand in some sub markets has slackened and valuations have adjusted accordingly. Fortunately, our retail portfolio is in great shape with almost all of our high street retail holdings leased for term to credit tenants with the only exceptions being 609 Fifth Ave, which we will begin redeveloping next year and 719 Seventh where construction was recently completed. I think good evidence of the strength in our high street retail portfolio was the culmination of the complete re-tenanting of the Aeropostale space in the second quarter with the final piece to the puzzle as it were a lease out to -- a lease that was consummated with Kiko Cosmetics, an Italian cosmetics firm. That brought to bear a full 30% plus in revenues, turning a situation that many had thought would be a negative, into a huge positive for the Company.","Accordingly, given all of that, we view stock repurchases as a very attractive and viable use of investment capital. And we may continue to make similar investments in our own portfolio, side by side with shareholders, so long as these dynamics persist. As not to say, the stock repurchases will define the sole use of our available capital but rather we believe that stock repurchases have a place alongside a balanced investment strategy that includes asset purchases and potentially special cash distributions. We believe that this balanced approach will enable us to maximize value for shareholders while maintaining an opportunistic approach to growth through asset purchases and dispositions.","With that I would like to open up the call for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. ","John Kim","Marc, in your prepared remarks, you said you were confident in hitting many of your 2017 goals and objectives. A couple of them seem like they would be difficult to achieve including 97% same-store occupancy as well as the greater than 2.5% same-store NOI growth. So, I\u2019m wondering, if those two components in particular, you still feel confident in.","Marc Holliday","Yes. I don\u2019t -- I mean, as I said, I think it\u2019s very, very outset. We\u2019re right on plan. With those two metrics in particular, Matt can elaborate more, but I think that we would -- we feel based on the pipeline and second on activity and everything else that we\u2019re going to be right on top of, so we head slightly behind those exact numbers, which is I think what I affirmed at the beginning of the call. But, Matt, do you have any color on that?","Matt DiLiberto","Yes. I am just going to add a little color to the same-store NOI number. There is a variable for lease termination income in there. And so, Marc alluded to the fact that we\u2019re behind, for the first half of year, on lease termination income, almost $2 million behind our expectations, and we had some layered into the balance of the year. And if that materializes, we\u2019re good; if it comes up a little shy, we will be at the lower end of our guidance range. But, we will have to let that play out. But our target of 2.5, the midpoint of our guidance range is maintained at this point.","John Kim","And my second question is in relation to a clampdown in Chinese institution. I realize, there is a difference between sovereign wealth funds and state-owned enterprises. But, I am wondering if this clampdown impacts you at all in terms of directly or how you feel about how that impacts Manhattan office pricing?","Andrew Mathias","It\u2019s Andrew, John. We haven\u2019t seen any direct impact from the clampdown. Obviously, we saw 245 Park trade in the first half of the year to HNA, which is a Chinese company. And we continue to see Chinese investors actively look at both equity and debt opportunities in the market. So, it hasn\u2019t changed from our perspective the appetite from that sector of the world.","Operator","Our next question is from Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank.","Vincent Chao","Just last quarter, we had a pretty healthy discussion around concessions in the market, and it does look like the free rent and TI per square feet per year were up in the portfolio this quarter. I was just curious, if you could comment on the level of concessions that you are seeing, both in your own portfolio but also across the broader market?","Marc Holliday","Before we get to broader market, Matt, do you have those numbers? Let\u2019s just go through the numbers. I think sometimes they are talking little\u2026","Matt DiLiberto","Yes. Because we all keep reading that there is something going on in the market with increased concessions, and I won\u2019t address that part of it. But in our numbers, the concessions are up, concessions are up. And I think what gets lost in the stats that are published are not only what properties leases are being done at but more importantly the new and renewal mix. So, we did as we took a look at the last two years and quarter-by-quarter new versus renewal leases to see what the true net effect of rents are. And consistent with what we said last quarter and at the end of the year and with our expectations, net effective rents are up on all, call four metrics. So new and renewal leases, both on a signed and commenced spaces, our net effective rents are up. So, while the stats may give the allusion of concessions being up, you are not appreciating the fact that there may be a higher mix of new leases this year versus renewals last.","Marc Holliday","So, that\u2019s with respect to our portfolio where I do believe that robust discussion we had last quarter was mostly around our TIs, our free rent, our concessions, which had been trending somewhere between stable and down year-over-year. And I think through Q2, other than the mix of new to renewal but on a apples to apples basis, new to new, renew to renew, we are Matt, what, stable?","Matt DiLiberto","Yes.","Marc Holliday","Yes. So, with respect to the markets, Steve, do you want to address that?","Steven Durels","I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve changed materially this year. The concept of increased TI in connection with buying up rents, you have seen it in the market driven by couple of landlords in particular. But that was sort of in the market mid last year or maybe even a little bit earlier. Certainly, we have experienced where we have to do turnkey installations for tenants, construction cost rose last year. But I don\u2019t think there has been any noticeable change through the beginning of this year to as we see it today.","Vincent Chao","And then, just second question, just on the FFO guidance. I\u2019m just curious, if the fee that we generated this quarter, the 19% total, was that all contemplated in the original range.","Marc Holliday","Yes. I saw -- a lot of that -- if you refer to as onetime, I just want to clarify, we have a substantial joint venture management business and from that we generate substantial fees of all natures that are in our guidance every year. And I don\u2019t really understand the one-time nature of that. I think that is -- there will be much more fees coming out of One Vanderbilt investment as a result of our joint venture, as well as countless other joint ventures we have. So, that\u2019s just in our book, JV fee income. I\u2019m not sure, onetime or it relates to there. It could be considered larger project but there are significant fees that this company will experience over the development lease-up, the stabilization of One Vanderbilt bill as well as other projects that we\u2019re working on. So, I think that\u2019s something that you will see in some greater or lesser magnitudes as we continue to go forward.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jamie Feldman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. ","Jamie Feldman","Steve, I was hoping you could just give some more color on what you\u2019re seeing in the leasing market. I know you guys referenced good net absorption in the market. But we also know, there has been good activity for some of the new development, especially the Hudson Yards. So, maybe, if you could just talk bigger picture about where the demand is, how it matches up with your portfolio, what you think we may see going forward, and may be tie in the leasing pipeline, the 1 million square-foot pipeline that Marc mentioned.","Steven Durels","So, I think there is a sentiment in the market that you can see in the press and some of the mix reports that are out there from the brokerage community, sort of colors the picture and to trace reality a little bit. I think the pipeline that we\u2019ve got, says it all. With 1 million square feet, a pipeline that is growing from first quarter to the second quarter really is representative of the strength of the overall market. Yes, tenants are migrating to new and redeveloped type products. I think that\u2019s a good think. I think Manhattan has been star for new construction for many years, because we even have the benefit of new construction being in the product mix. If we had this discussion a year or three ago, everybody would have been scared about the prospects of filling new construction. But obviously Hudson Yards and downtown, wherever there is new buildings, tenants are migrating to it. That bodes well I think for our prospect at One Vanderbilt.","And certainly the increased number of tenant presentations and request for proposals that we\u2019re experiencing at One Vanderbilt further evidences the demand for high-quality product. Our pipeline has continuing a mix of types of business, led heavily by financial services interestingly enough of the over 500,000 square feet of leases that we have out, over 200,000 square feet of it all of our financial services related. And then after that it\u2019s a wide variety of different types of businesses. So, like we saw at the beginning of the year or even towards the end of last year, good demand across the broad at all price points and all geographic locations.","Jamie Feldman","And how much of that pipeline is for One Vanderbilt?","Marc Holliday","I don\u2019t want to break that out. It\u2019s a small -- it\u2019s a relatively small portion of the total million. But the leasing for One Vanderbilt, we have pretty much on track for 2018 second half and beyond. Anything we do ahead of that is kind of good news early stuff. We\u2019re sitting here in the middle of 2017, coming out of the ground, building a lot of enthusiasm. Clearly, we are having a lot of meetings, we are trading some paper for sure on One Vanderbilt, but we are not going to revise what otherwise I think a very conservative but prudent lease-up projection that begins in the second half of 2018, we\u2019re a year away from that. And our focus right now is predominantly and primarily on our portfolio, which comprises the bulk of that 1 million square feet.","Jamie Feldman","And that\u2019s mostly stuff you think gets done this year, is that a better way to think about it?","Marc Holliday","I hope so. Otherwise, we are not going make our guidance, but I reaffirmed at the beginning. So, I feel pretty confident that we are going to make 1.6 million this year.","Steven Durels","I\u2019ll add to that a little bit because some of the analyst reports noticed that second quarter number of leases that we signed this quarter was lower than maybe their expectation was. This quarter could have easily tipped by 100 to 150,000 square feet of additional lease signed. It\u2019s really just a function of documents sitting on tenants\u2019 desk for execution. So, if not for vagaries of a week here or a week there, it\u2019s actually stronger than the numbers suggest.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O\u2019Neill.","Alexander Goldfarb","Marc, can you just -- on the stock buybacks, can you just talk a little bit more about it. The news reports out that you guys are contemplating looking at Worldwide Plaza, there is this potential JV of 1515, so you have proceeds that will be generated. Can you just talk in general how you think about buying assets, presumably at market versus your stock which is at substantive discounts?","Marc Holiday","Well, as I said earlier, I think we are taking a balanced approach. There is no all-in approach on stock buyback or investments or do nothing in stockpile equity. I think that\u2019s a bad approach, because any one of those can be the right or wrong approach at a given time. I think a much more prudent way to look at it is that as we generate substantial amounts of liquidity through joint ventures and sales, and at this point internally generated funds from operations because with a mostly leased portfolio we are generating sizable cash flow, how we invest those moneys. And those moneys are being invested in what we think in the aggregate will give us good risk reward returns, be it development or redevelopment of projects, new acquisitions, stock and [indiscernible] debt reduction, although now given where debt levels stand, we don\u2019t foresee further deleveraging but clearly we\u2019ve done extraordinary amount of deleveraging over the past few years.","And then, there is always a potential depending on the tax situation at a point in time for special dividends. So, I think that balanced approach is what will give our stock and this Company the highest return over time, not taking a point of view on any one of those approaches. But that combined approach, we feel will maximize NAV. I mean, we\u2019re looking to just increase our NAV per share from where it stands today to something significantly higher for the balance of this year into next year. And stock buybacks have a big role to play in that but there are still deals out there that we think we can -- we have a pipeline that we feel we can acquire at attractive pricing, make significant unlevered and levered returns. And in those instances where we do the partnerships, significant fee and promote income which really adds between 300 to 500 basis points of returns to those investments which puts them on par with many other opportunities we have for the money.","So, I think that\u2019s the approach we\u2019re taking. I think it\u2019s working well and we will continue on that approach for the foreseeable future. ","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. And then, switching to retail, you mentioned the softness in retail. And I think the two buildings cited, one was the American Girl and the other one was the new signage in the Times Square. So, can you talk, if given the change in retail with your expectations from mark to market on American Girl or your expectations for the signage building have changed? And then, are there any other material retail exposures coming up in the next sort of 12 to 18 months?","Andrew Mathias","It\u2019s Andrew, Alex. I don\u2019t think our expectation for mark to market has changed on those assets. I would say our guidance was more in line with our own internal modeling and the market as opposed to may be where the perception was the market was going to go, because people are modeling some pretty explosive growth on those assets. So, we\u2019re still confident in our numbers there. And I don\u2019t think beyond those two. 609, the tenant is still in occupancy until the beginning of next year; and then 719, obviously we just finished construction. Beyond those two, we don\u2019t see any other major retail vacancies coming up in the portfolio.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Manny Korchman with Citi. ","Manny Korchman","And Marc, just as another -- two on the buyback. Was there anything specific that change in your mind, I mean just asking [ph] at a discount for credit while that transaction environment\u2019s probably been frothy but stable. And so was there anything that changed whether that you saw that you\u2019re being incrementally priced out, is that sort of a proper concept of deals or was it -- sort of what made you change your mind from going to be a non-buyer stock with [indiscernible] to actually using that tool. ","Marc Holliday","Sorry. Non-buyer stock, what was the rest of that?","Manny Korchman","Versus actually using the buyback and actually... ","Marc Holliday","Well, I mean, I don\u2019t know if there was a flashpoint. I would say that we wanted to see some real I would say longevity and proof and evidence of the fact that the capital markets in 2017 were still functioning well and asset values were holding and that there was so reasonably high -- the demand for the kind of well-located assets we talked about. And as we were out there talking with all sorts of investors globally and domestically about existing deals, new deals, One Vanderbilt et cetera, it became very evident to us, as there is just a ton of equity out there for private market, direct real estate investment. It\u2019s kind of like the opposite of what seems to exist in this overall REIT sector where I think the flow seem more challenging but in the direct equity space there just seems to be an incredible appetite, desire, demand, again for the best markets, best located assets with great sponsorship. And for those situations, it just appears to us like that. The pricing levels are still very firm, the amount of equity out there is still significant. The debt capital to finance those deals and finance them efficiently is competitive as we have seen. I mean, it\u2019s really quite competitive and it\u2019s competitive at rates that are, as I said earlier, at or near historic lows.","So, when you take the totality of that kind of environment and appetite for assets and we put it through our own models and get to our evaluations, which as we sell assets, we can prove against our own work the validity and veracity of our internal investments against market. And the more we saw that market holding up, those numbers holding up, the more it became clear and obvious to us that at current trading levels of the stock, it seemed so dislocated and such a glaringly obvious investment opportunity that we wanted to use some of our own capacity in that direction and using that capacity that we had built up quite intentionally from 2015 and 2016. So, I think all things came together. But beyond that I can say there was flipping of the switch.","Manny Korchman","Maybe one for Steve. Steve, there has been a little bit more focus on sub lease states in the city recently. Have you seen that and how does that sort of impact whether it\u2019d be your leasing momentum or hitting that 1.6 million square-foot goal by year-end.","Steven Durels","Yes. It\u2019s in the statistics. We haven\u2019t experienced in our portfolio and certainly have it, felt it from a competitive element. I can\u2019t say we\u2019ve lost any deals to sub leases. It\u2019s still at a -- on historical basis, on the very low end, as far as the ability goes. So, it popped up; it was driven by a few specifics. It doesn\u2019t seem to be a broad trend and certainly nothing that I can put my finger on, anything to worry about right now.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Lewis with SunTrust.","Michael Lewis","You have been asked a little bit about how you could hit guidance and some of the pieces of it. I want to flip that around a little bit because as I look at the numbers, where you did 335 in the first half, even if you exclude the $0.09 promo [ph] and the $0.10 of fees in the second quarter, you still did 159. So, you are running ahead of the upper end of the range. You are going to have a tailwind from the share repurchase in the back half. I don\u2019t know maybe you could comment if you have any more -- if you expect anymore JVs this year. You already said that there may be some lease termination fees. I guess are there some offsets there because just the way the numbers lay out, it actually looks like to me at least that maybe you\u2019re a little ahead?","Marc Holliday","Matt will answer it. We may be a little ahead. I don\u2019t know -- I think you are reading too much into it. We certainly feel like we\u2019ll be in the upper end of the range. You get down to a level of pennies, upper end, right on, little above the high. I mean there is still six months to go. So, I have to see how the year plays out. But earnings wise, I think we are doing quite well, which is why it kind of surprised me to read some of the things in the report, filing the earnings release. That particular is amongst our strongest. And I said earlier, I think it will be at the high end of our range. Your point is, could it be a little higher, don\u2019t know, we will see where we end up at year end. But certainly towards the higher end is currently what we\u2019re managing to and trying to achieve through all of our activities between now and end of the year. Matt, do you have anything to add to that?","Matt DiLiberto","Yes. And Mike, I\u2019d say the one big variable, I touched on it earlier, you alluded to it, lease termination income for the first half of the year, it was about $2.5 million short of our expectations; and for the balance of the year, we have another $4 million baked in. So, if that doesn\u2019t materialize your 6.5 million -- or $0.065 to the bad. Now that we go into every year modeling that same amount of lease termination income $8 million a year because that is the six year historical average. So, it\u2019s not just pulled out of thin air, but it hasn\u2019t shown up this year, may not show up for the balance of the year. And if you run that out and you come out to the high end of the guidance range, well then you shouldn\u2019t raise guidance. That\u2019s Marc\u2019s point. And move guidance, move it materially and for good reason and with confidence. And so, we like the way it is.","Michael Lewis","I don\u2019t want to use my second question on this, but so this is will be part B of the first question.","Marc Holliday","No, too much in the pipeline here; we got one more bullet.","Michael Lewis","All right, let me shift and I want to ask about the increase in the debt and preferred equity investments, it\u2019s up quite a bit over last year, especially in this quarter. And you know when you talk about your uses of funds, debt capital being available but maybe there are some holes in the capital structure that you guys still fill. How do you kind think of that, could you grow that a little bit more and how is that attractiveness versus the other uses you might have?","Marc Holliday","Well, I think the book did spike up a bit this quarter because the 2 Herald investment that we made has been well-publicized. That was sort of an extraordinary opportunity that we took advantage of, quick close and was probably outside of our normal sort of projections for the business for the year. So that\u2019s that -- balance is being a little bit higher than we anticipated. However, we had a significant originations model for the second half of the year, which we\u2019re in the process of lining up. So, I think we\u2019re still very comfortable operating around that 10% of total assets level on the structure finance portfolio and continue to see very good both, short trading type opportunities and longer term investment type opportunities in that business.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI.","Steve Sakwa","Most of my questions have been I guess asked and answered, but just circling back to the pipeline Marc and sort of 1 million feet that needs to be done in the back half of the year. Realizing that you have 1 million square foot pipeline today and I assume that there is some fall out, something won\u2019t happen around or renewal might not happen, a new deal doesn\u2019t happen. What does the sort of shadow, shadow pipeline look like, and what would need to happen to the extent that some of this 1 million feet doesn\u2019t materialize, what sort of the backup plan or what else could happen between now and December to feel that gap?","Marc Holliday","So, a couple of things, Steve. We\u2019re setting here July 20th, I guess, right, 20, 21? And remember, I think you\u2019re referencing the June 30. It\u2019s a very dynamic shot, Steve. You sign a lease a day, 250 a year, one every business. I think that\u2019s what Steve Durels likes to tell. So, you should assume we\u2019ve already signed some between now -- between year-end and today. So, the pipeline we are giving you is as of today. We are ahead of 6, maybe closer to 7 or 6, I don\u2019t exactly the numbers, but it\u2019s probably right. And so, for another 900,000 feet, we have over 1 million square feet specified already and there is term sheets for a bunch more. So, we think we will get there and that\u2019s route for us, Steve. That\u2019s -- we usually don\u2019t miss, we usually overachieve. And between July and December, we will have new deals, like new deals that aren\u2019t even yet on our pipeline. It\u2019s still I won\u2019t say early but it\u2019s not late. So, we will have new pipeline like the moment we hang up the phone. So, we are just giving you our best estimate. We have done our reforecast; we have looked at our leasing volumes occupancy for the end of the year. We think we will hit a 1.6 million and I hope we do.","Steven Durels","Yes, let me sort of just reaffirm what Marc just said. It\u2019s interesting that how frequently the pipeline number changes, in fact Matt and Marc come to me with regularity saying, can you update the pipeline, and everybody gets surprised because literally in a 10-day period the numbers can change, and frequently to the positive. So, it\u2019s just a function of we\u2019re out there obviously marketing every day. And the numbers that comprise the pipeline or leases out for execution and term sheets that are being negotiated which are those term sheets that we think are highly likely to convert to a lease. There is a whole slew of proposals that are being traded within the leasing departments and the brokerage community on deals that we are fighting to get on the shortlist of a tenant\u2019s prospect.","So, at time goes by, those will get filtered down, some number of those will convert over to leases out as well. So, it\u2019s a very fluid number.","Steve Sakwa","Okay. So, it sounds like between things you\u2019ve done in the last couple of weeks plus the pipeline, you are more than adequate to hit the 1.6 million. So, thank you. I guess just on going back to the DPE book that Michael Lewis asked about. Just sort of what is the market like today? And I know you sort of talked about that book maybe getting up to 2 billion, and it\u2019s pretty much there today. So, at this point anything that\u2019s newly originated does that either get sold down and you only keep a small piece of it, you expect more kind of payoffs or do you think that that book actually grows kind of well beyond the $2 billion figure?","David Schonbraun","Hi. It\u2019s David Schonbraun. I think, look, it\u2019s a very fluid market, so we are going to have payoffs along with originations. So, I think we are going to keep the balances in line with what we projected. So, you\u2019ll probably see a couple of loans pay off and new ones be originated. I think it\u2019s an active market. There is a lot of new capital coming in. I think we\u2019ve been able to kind of hold the yields around where we projected, but it\u2019s definitely a lot more competitive. I think in the past couple of months, activity has picked up which gives us a lot more opportunities.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Mailman with KeyBanc Capital.","Craig Mailman","Thanks, guys. Marc, you talked earlier about maybe doing more in the buyback which I think would be helpful. But assuming maybe that doesn\u2019t move the needle here on closing the gap to NAV, I mean would you guys -- and private market values stay where they are, would you guys consider accelerating asset sales meaningfully to prove the value and potentially the special back to shareholders?","Marc Holliday","Well, there\u2019s a couple of different things in that question. I mean first, in terms of the accelerating sales, 7 billion in 24 months, I have to think that\u2019s sector leading. I\u2019m not sure because I don\u2019t have that data in front of me but it feels like it, certainly in the New York City marketplace. So, could we accelerate that even further? We could, but it\u2019s not -- to me, it\u2019s not about acceleration, it\u2019s about selling into a recapping when it\u2019s prudent to do so. I mean, we are in the market right now with 1515 that has nothing to do per se with buybacks. That has to do with having a business plan for the asset which we have achieved -- that which we have yet to achieve because there is still a lot more growth in that asset that we see coming down the pike. And we think it\u2019s just prudent in an asset of that size to bring in a partner right now. And like I said, we will take those moneys and decide how to deploy it, or I think to your question, potentially special dividend it if it\u2019s otherwise not tax protected. And that comes down to a matter of figuring out the mix of what you sell to generate gains and\/or losses and comes down to tax structuring.","But I don\u2019t think there is a notion here that where accelerating the plan per se from what we have for this year, we think it\u2019s a good plan. We are selling some assets this year; we are JVing some assets; we are right on plan; and we will come up with a plan for 2018 shortly and roll out some more assets and also roll in some more acquisitions, maybe some buybacks, maybe some stock dividends. But no, I would say it\u2019s not like -- I don\u2019t think there is a -- I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a swaying in our strategy, the speed at which we are executing.","The other thing you said is, if it doesn\u2019t close the gap on NAV. It closes the gap on NAV. The issue as to whether the stock price reflects that or not is the separate issue. But, when we buy our stock back at $103 a share average and if we have a underlying valuation on the implied models in December 140 or more, you have created NAV, whether or not the stock reflects that. So, we are focused on creating value. The stock is going to have react the way it should react in a good market, and be reflective of NAV but it may or may not. But at a minimum for investors, we are creating value -- when we make investments, we think we are creating values through these buybacks.","Jordan Sadler","Hey Marc, it\u2019s Jordan Sadler. Thanks for that. Now that you\u2019re something of a REIT investor, I have a follow-up. Not long ago, SL Green was the best and really only pure play New York office REIT, and today there is three other at least similar players for investors to choose from. And surely, you guys are among the biggest and well leased, but how is SL Green going to differentiate itself from the rest of the field over the next three to five years, how should we be thinking about that?","Marc Holliday","Well, I think that we are differentiated. I would like to think others are becoming more like the model we set. But our model is always changing. When we see opportunity in the retail sector, we were big retail buyers; then as the market cooled, we haven\u2019t really invested much in retail, and stabilized that portfolio. We I think are taking a pretty affirmative and leadership role here in getting out there, buying back our stock, a lot of I think our peers out there will also look to their stock as being somewhat dislocated. But, we want to be very affirmative with that. And to do that, you have to be a seller. And I think we sell more than most; I think we sell the most. And I think that\u2019s not something that\u2019s just a 2015, 2016 phenomena, you can go back 20 years. We own 28 million feet. We probably owned and sold over 20 million feet. I mean, we\u2019re a regenerator of capital. We like to eliminate value; we like to deploy that where we think we can make the most money. And for the moment, the stock we repurchase is very attractive. It\u2019s hard to say looking three to five years out, it will depend on a lot of things, with market, with the stock price and what part of the market do we like at the moment in time, office equity, retail, multi, debt and preferred equity, we have a lot of tools that are at disposal. But, first and for most we\u2019re commercial owner. And I would think three to five-year out, we will still be a very significant, if not the largest and hopefully the best commercial owner. But what will be relative sizing, we will see. But whatever it is, I just hope that the stock price is 50% more-higher than where we see it today.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Nick Yulico with UBS.","Nick Yulico","Just turning back to 1515 Broadway and if you were to do a JV and sale there, what is the likelihood of being able to do something that\u2019s other than a 1031, where you could tax protect some of the proceeds.","Marc Holliday","I think one of our goals at 1515 is to structure that transaction in a tax efficient manner. And we have a couple of creative solutions that we\u2019re working on to achieve that goal. So, I would expect that the transaction there will be executed tax efficiently.","Nick Yulico","Okay. And then just going back to the guidance on same-store, Matt. Your year to date 1.5% same-store NOI growth, ex lease term income, the goal is still for 2.5% for the year. What are the items that help you in the back half of the year?","Matt DiLiberto","Sure. Our guidance was with lease term. So, we\u2019re actually trending even better ex lease term than the goal for 2.5% would indicate. But the back half of the year, you start to see the benefits of last year\u2019s leasing at properties like 919 Third, 280 Park, 711 Third, 125 Park, this is Bloomberg in 919, 280 Park\u2019s been leasing up, it\u2019s going be 1% vacancy by the end of the year, 711 where you saw the vacancy for the second quarter tick up; that leasing that we\u2019ve already done, kicks in, in the second half of the year. So, you\u2019re seeing the 6 to 12-month leasing activity start to flow through in the back half of the year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley.","Vikram Malhotra","On the none move-outs that you highlighted, can you just sort of give us an update, where are you in terms of backfilling some of that and can you remind us of any of other larger move-outs over the next 12 months?","Matt DiLiberto","Yes. It\u2019s Matt, Vikram. The three properties you\u2019re referencing, we reference in our press release. The 485 Lexington that\u2019s city space that rolled out in the first and second quarter that\u2019s a lease-up plan for late this year, primarily next. The other two spaces are really leased up. It\u2019s vacancy from Omnicom at 220 East 42nd Street, that space\u2019s been leased to VNS, a 300,000 feet. They will be in middle of next year, obviously not in the numbers yet. And 1515 is the Aeropostale space which as Marc just touched on earlier, has been fully leased. Some of that income will start to roll through the back half of this year and be fully in place next.","Vikram Malhotra","And on the move-outs, any other larger move-outs for the back half or the next few months?","Matt DiLiberto","No.","Vikram Malhotra","Okay. And then, just on One Vanderbilt, I guess from your Investor Day or just maybe over the last 12 months, you referenced the leasing pipeline keeps changing, it\u2019s very dynamic. I am just sort of wondering, over the past year, has your thought process in terms of either type of tenants or size of tenants or mix of the building, has that changed at all?","Marc Holliday","No, really hasn\u2019t. I mean, we\u2019ve presented to prospective tenants that have been everything from single floor users all the way up to 1 million square-foot users. The predominant profiles of the tenants have been heavily skewed towards financial services, where we have seen some big international corporate headquarters requirements as well. So, we still think that the building will ultimately is likely to be another two, maybe three tenants of size, meaning 150,000 to 200,000 square feet in the size and the balance of the building be single floor users. If we get lucky, we\u2019ll have somebody bigger, that\u2019d be good news, but our expectation is unchanged.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jon Petersen with Jefferies.","Jon Petersen","Great, thanks. I was hoping you could touch a little bit on the suburb. Leasing velocity seems to be picking up there a little bit, occupancy\u2019s been trending higher. And we noticed that market forecasts from CBRE are kind of rosy right for the suburbs which is the first in quite a while. And so, kind of pairing that together with some of the buildings you sold recently, just kind of wondering against that backdrop, are you viewing the improvement in the market as an opportunity to liquidate your suburban assets, do you want to hold on a bit and let NOI trend higher, or will there always be a suburban component for SL Green?","Marc Holliday","There is a lot in that question too.","Jon Petersen","Yes.","Marc Holliday","So, start with the market, I guess, is that suburban\u2026","Matt DiLiberto","The market is strong. The market up there again in White Plains and in Stamford in particular has been strong. We have taken advantage of that, the team up there has really been working very, very hard. They have done about two -- about 300,000 square feet of leasing year-to-date. I think we anticipate another couple of hundred thousand feet before the end of the year. And we are actually pretty far ahead. So, that\u2019s been very, very strong. With respect to what we are going to do on a going forward basis with the rest of that portfolio that\u2026","Marc Holliday","Right now, I think we had a -- trying to think a goal for this year of about 100, and we have met our eclipsed that already. So, there is one objective, if we can take it to the table. So right now, we have nothing more that we are concerned at the moment. Second half of the year, we will revisit, again going back to the concept of acceleration where -- I mean it\u2019s a very -- that market up there has improved. I think on the margins, we probably will try to identify another asset that we think is somewhat stabilized and\/or would meet the margin nicely and try and get some optimum pricing, whether that\u2019s second half of this year or beginning of next year have no idea because that hasn\u2019t -- it\u2019s not what I\u2019ll call the focal part of the strategy for the rest of the year, having got those original sales done. And given the fact that as I said, markets are improving; mark-to-markets are up; occupancies are up. So that\u2019s all very good and really credit to the excellent team we have up there in White Plains, who on a much more limited capital regimen, manage to keep that portfolio really sort of best in class up there in that metro area. So, I think that\u2019s what we can really say about that.","Jon Petersen","Well, I mean I guess just to push a little harder on that. I\u2019m just kind of curious; I always viewed the suburban asset as something that you did eventually want to dispose off. So, I guess the question is since things are improving, is now the time to do a portfolio sell or a number of buildings, and I don\u2019t mean maybe in the second half of this year but just over the next couple of years, is that a possibility?","Marc Holliday","That may be your feeling or opinion, I\u2019m not sure we have ever. I\u2019d say, it\u2019s never been really us, I say, we have always looked at it as a relatively high yielding portfolio, the cap rates in the suburbs 6, 7, 8%. Since it\u2019s very stable and requires very little capital, and the people out there are doing excellent job, I think we have always tried to strategically pair it down where we think like I said, either book ends, something is highly stabilized or on the other end something where we just don\u2019t think we could make much of it, so smaller deals on the left hand and mature deals on the right hand. But I would say in general -- I know Steve, you just did a couple of deals up there and it\u2019s from Manhattan...","Steven Durels","Well, the Manhattan relationships where Omnicom just expanded by 25,000 square feet for that market which is a very -- a large deal with a highly priced tenants. There have been a number of deals that in 16 Court, which is part of the suburban portfolio. That building stabilized at this point and continues to have very good activity. So, I think now more than ever, we have seen the Manhattan portfolio and the suburban portfolio really working in tandem with one another.","Marc Holliday","I think it sounds probably less than 5% of revenues at this point, and shrinking each year. So, I hear what you are saying but I would say -- I think the approach we are on right now is the best approach for us, given the way we look at it. But I guess we will always be looking at that to recalibrate our thinking.","Operator","We do have our next question from John Guinee with Stifel.","John Guinee","I guess, if I was to connect all these dots, assets sales, share repurchase, special dividend, running the DPE book over 2 billion, stock price not appropriately valuing on a NAV basis. The next logical conclusion, I have is that perhaps you guys are no longer going to play by the REIT rule book and lever up to a level that management is comfortable with, rather than what the street might expect. Is that a fair statement to say, it\u2019s appropriate to lever up a bit?","Marc Holliday","I think we started the year -- if you measure leverage as debt to EBITDA which has its own flaws in and of itself, which I think everyone recognizes, but we still use it. 6 -- what\u2019s Matt, next 6.6, 6.7? 6.7 we sit -- with all those dots and all those things we have done, I think the 6.7 -- it\u2019s 6.8. So, 6.7 to 6.8 is lever up. I guess it is up a tenth of a turn. But no, I think that -- I do think the industry in general is at a somewhat of a competitive disadvantage in growth, operating at between 30% to 40% debt level depending on whether you\u2019re at low end or high end of the spectrum when you have most of the real estate investment rolled out there, investing closer to call it 50 to 55, maybe 60%. So, I think that\u2019s an issue that the industry faces. I have been pretty vocal about that that -- we are executing within the parameters of I think where REIT shareholders want to see debt levels. But, I think query, whether those debt levels are a reason why the growth levels for certain REITs in many markets for at least for office companies, I\u2019ll speak to them in particular, I can\u2019t speak to other sectors as much but certainly for office companies are not as accurate and not as competitive. Combined with the fact that office companies have acquired so much over the time, a lot of them and us are digesting what we have, leasing up, redeveloping, executing, JVing and the like.","So, it\u2019s not simply a matter of operating within low leverage levels but clearly when you do go after an opportunity, if you think it\u2019s a good opportunity to stay within these parameters, it does take a little bit more cleverness and ingenuity and resourcefulness to compete with the players out there that are operating in some cases nearly two times the debt levels. So, I would say, no, I think that our debt levels are relatively consistent with where they\u2019ve been. I think our guidance at the beginning of the year was seven or below and that\u2019s where we\u2019re, and I don\u2019t really see that changing now through year end.","John Guinee","Great. And then, a second question, this would be more of an education question, Matt. You did the 2 Herald Square, bought the mortgage, the first trust as it appears on page 30 of your DPE book. You obviously quoted the default rate of 11.1%. Can you sort of educate as to how much will you actually collect in current income on a loan investment like this and how much you\u2019d accrue and then how you would unwind that accounting eventually?","Matt DiLiberto","Well, I mean the accounting rules tell you, you\u2019re only allowed to book income that you expect to collect. Our expectation is that we will collect the default rate and therefore we\u2019ve accrued at that rate. If we do get repaid and I think the handicap at this point is that we will, we will get paid the default rate from the period of time that we bought it through repayments in cash. And that\u2019s I think likely at some point over the next few months.","John Guinee","So, you buy the loan at 2.50 and then you accrue at 11% and you\u2019re able to get paid back at 2.50 plus 11%.","Matt DiLiberto","Yes.","John Guinee","Or you get hold of the building.","Marc Holliday","That\u2019s the ultimate remedy in all loan position, but yes, that\u2019s right. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jed Reagan with Green Street Advisors.","Jed Reagan","It seems like there has been a slowdown in transaction volumes so far this year in Manhattan but you mentioned earlier that there is still lot of equity capital out there and debt capital is still healthy. Curious, how you guys kind of bridge that disconnect. Are you seeing bid [ph] spreads widen out between buyers and sellers in the market, or are you seeing cap rates moving higher for office and street retail this year?","Marc Holliday","Well, I think part of the -- there\u2019s been a fair amount of volume this year, although it is off from record levels in the last couple of years. The refinancing market is creating a very attractive alternative to sellers that can\u2019t achieve sort of very high expectations of pricing. So, we\u2019re seen several assets sort of tested on the market, if you will, and then the ownership deciding to refinance in lieu of selling at levels that are below their expectations. But, there is also quite a backlog now of deals which we would expect to be consummated in the second half of the year. So, we will definitely expect volumes to be up in the second half of the year. Just there\u2019s been a little bit of a standoff between buyers and sellers out there, and I would say deals are taking a little bit longer to get done.","Jed Reagan","And as far as where things are transacting value-wise, any noticeable changes on the office, street retail side?","Andrew Mathias","I think we haven\u2019t really seen any changes, positively or negatively. Obviously, every asset\u2019s unique. So, it\u2019s hard to sort of generalize on cap rates. But, I think the -- you are still seeing good office buildings trade, north of a 1,000 a foot sort of across the city.","Marc Holliday","I would just add to that, it\u2019s very disciplined equity. It\u2019s a lot of equity, that was my point earlier and I do believe there is a lot of equity out there but it\u2019s disciplined. So, at a price, you can have six offers and 5% higher, there may be none or one. And if you are the seller who is trying, not just to sort of get value but as a seller, a lot of these are irreplaceable assets, you have a tendency to want to push not just for value but value plus, that\u2019s where that standoff may get created, or that\u2019s where that elongation may arrive. I think that is more of the issue with people really trying to sort of get -- you can only sell it once, so you try to get that optimum execution. And if you are what I call realistic transactors like we are, hence we sell and JV and do a lot of deals, because especially in the context of JVs, we want to do well, we want the partners to do well. So, I think that\u2019s why we transact as much. But for sellers who are kind of one and done, they hold out for a high price and it doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s not a lot of equity out there, it just means maybe that gap, that gap maybe solved by concession, or that gap maybe solved through a financing as Andrew said, but it doesn\u2019t mean there is not a lot of participants in these deals.","Jed Reagan","That\u2019s helpful. And maybe just a quick one for Steve. Are you seeing any changes in taking rents and Midtown office these days and are there any sub markets where you guys are having to cut rates to track tenants?","Steven Durels","No, not the least. I can\u2019t think of an instance where we\u2019ve cut our rents in the past six months, and just the opposite of couple of the buildings, I think the gap between they ask and the take has narrowed a bit.","Jed Reagan","And broader brush that kind of feels consistent with the market in terms of rent environment?","Steven Durels","Yes. I am not hearing anything from the brokerage community that would be contrary to that.","Operator","Thank you.","Marc Holliday","That\u2019s it. We are all set?","Operator","That is correct.","Marc Holliday","Thank you very much everyone and we look forward to speaking again after the summer. Enjoy.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may all disconnect and have a wonderful day."],"19652":["SL Green Realty Corporation (NYSE:SLG) Q2 2018 Earnings Conference Call July 19, 2018  2:00 PM ET","Executives","Marc Holliday - CEO","Matthew DiLiberto - CFO","Andrew Mathias - President","Steven Durels - EVP, Leasing & Real Property","Analysts","Craig Mailman - KeyBanc Capital","Michael Bilerman - Citi","John Kim - BMO Capital Markets","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill","Jamie Feldman - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","John Guinee - Stifel","Michael Lewis - SunTrust","Blaine Heck - Wells Fargo","Steve Sakwa - Evercore","Operator","Thank you, everybody, for joining us and welcome to SL Green Realty Corp's Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Results Conference Call. This conference call is being recorded.","At this time, the company would like to remind listeners that during the call, management may make forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ from the forward-looking statements that management may make today. Additional information regarding the factors that could cause such differences appear in the MD&A section of the company's Form 10-K and other reports filed by the company with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Also, during today's conference call, the company may discuss non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC Regulation G. The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to each non-GAAP financial measure discussed and the reconciliation of the differences between each non-GAAP financial measure and the comparable GAAP financial measure can be found on the company's website at www.slgreen.com by selecting the press release regarding the company's second quarter 2018 earnings.","Before turning the call over to Marc Holliday, Chief Executive Officer of SL Green Realty Corp, I ask that those of you participating in the Q&A portion of the call, please limit your questions to two per person. Thank you.","I will now turn the call over to Marc Holliday. Please go ahead, Marc.","Marc Holliday","Okay. Thank you, everyone for joining us for SL Green\u2019s second quarter 2018 earnings call. As I believe was evident from our reported results last night, we are off to another very good start to the first half of this year and it was an excellent second quarter. So it was similar in many respects to our first quarter, where our results were pretty much in line with expectations and guidance, but once again in line, that term in line I think materially understate the extraordinary effort and execution that went into producing these results and going into the kinds of results we produce quarter-over-quarter, year over year.","A lot goes into it to get to summarize into 8 to 10 bullet points, but we'd be happy today as part of the Q&A section to talk about each of these individual items that make up what I think a quarter that was very much in line with our prior guidance and talk about the kinds of activities we see in the third quarter that will continue to help us achieve our goals.","Notably, in this quarter, we had 71 leases signed in New York City and the suburbs covering more than 570,000 rentable square feet of office space. We closed or contracted for seven discrete property dispositions, representing a gross aggregate asset value of over $1.5 billion. We acquired the leasehold interest in 2 Herald Square, following foreclosure of the asset, a foreclosure that was consummated in under a year's time from start to finish. We originated or acquired $541 million of new debt and preferred equity investments, deals that were originated during the quarter at a retained yield of about 9.5% on average between mortgage and mezz.","There was also substantial construction and leasing progress at One Vanderbilt. We\u2019ll talk a little bit about that later. And notably and obviously a continuation of our share repurchase program totaling an additional 3.5 million acquired in the second quarter alone. So all-in-all, I think a very respectable three months for the company and it should be obvious that most here have not yet begun to take the summer holidays. So maybe after the call. But at its core, our business strategy remains unchanged.","Property dispositions and joint ventures to fund targeted acquisitions and the largest stock buyback program in the commercial REIT sector and we do this in a way that is predominately leverage neutral and we do it in a way that maintains our liquidity in the range of $1.5 billion to $2 billion. So that while we\u2019re pursuing the strategy of growth and accretion and optimization, we\u2019re also doing so in a way that is very protective of the balance sheet.","The capital market environment for the strategy remains favorable, as private sector values remain well above the implied net asset value of the company and we have been able to execute this program in a tax efficient manner, thus far avoiding the need for any special dividends. You should expect to see a continuation of this program in the third quarter, as we have already identified additional assets for disposition in the suburban and Manhattan portfolios and we still believe that the repurchasing of our shares at current prices to be the best large scale investment opportunity that we are presented with.","Also of note, leasing velocity accelerated in the second quarter, both in the market and in our own portfolio and this was consistent with our expectations and puts us on track to meet or exceed our leasing goal for the year, notably the current pipeline stands at 1.3 million square feet and this is pipeline that is roughly consistent with the pipeline as it stood in the last quarter, notwithstanding 540,000 square feet of space leased in just Manhattan in the second quarter.","So the business narrative in New York City right now, the narrative amongst businesses and amongst our tenants is fairly positive and we see a lot of activity and expansion taking place in the market. This activity has not yet resulted in any observable spike in rents, but concessions do seem to be leveling and we are making substantial gains in leasing up our previously vacant space, as is evident by the 40 basis point improvement in our occupancy.","I\u2019ll save any further market commentary for the Q&A portion of the call as it relates to the leasing market or the property investment market. But before opening up the lines for those questions, I do want to state how absolutely pleased I am with the progress at One Vanderbilt. Construction continues at pace and as I\u2019ve alluded to in the past, the prior gains we've made in scheduling now has been solidified as the completion date under our GMP contract for the project has been moved up by five weeks from September 30, 2020 to August 25, 2020, a date where the building will be open just a little over two years from today.","So, very exciting and credit goes to our entire construction team and staff that has carefully coordinated every facet of the job and the 500 plus hardworking men and women that are on the site day after day, moving this project along at a pace that even exceeded our ambitious timeline at the outset.","If you haven't already seen the progress, I would encourage you to stop by next week and view the first installation of what will be over 8140 panels of [indiscernible] curtain wall, it\u2019s going to be extraordinarily impressive as we begin to apply the curtain wall to the building and leasing as you know from prior announcements now stands at about 31% pre-leased with this quarter\u2019s announcement of the McDermott Will lease and we expect to have additional announcements between now and December, as we continue to actively market and negotiate with tenants for additional space at the building.","So with that, I'd like to go right into Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with KeyBanc Capital.","Craig Mailman","Just curious there have been some news reports about interest in 245 Park, just curious if you could comment at all about your interest levels, either from an equity position or deposition.","Marc Holliday","Unfortunately, we can't comment too much on that particular project. We have talked about 245 Park I think on prior calls in response to questions, in terms of the quality of the asset, location of the asset and what we perceive as an upside in that asset must be one that could benefit pretty substantially from a moderate redevelopment, sort of playing off the heels of the success we've enjoyed at 280 Park and in line with the other construction and redevelopment improvement that's taking place on park and buildings like 425 Park that announced to be new world headquarters for JP Morgan and obviously just a few blocks north of One Vanderbilt.","So, the building itself is a very substantial building, at least about 1.7 million or 1.8 million rentable square feet located in an extraordinary location, right at the base of Park Avenue near Grand Central and that asset is something that we've followed very closely, underwritten carefully and in the second quarter, made a phase one investment. That basically is a structured finance investment, it\u2019s in the DPE Portfolio. It gives rise I guess to what you might see as a tick up in the DPE portfolio in the month -- in the quarter that just finished. And that's really where we stand at this point. We already had an existing mezzanine investment in that project and we've stated that earlier. So, really this was in addition to that previous investment and where we go from here is part of a Phase 2 and something that may be more equity like I think is yet to be seen and something that we may be able to comment on future calls.","Craig Mailman","And then just curious, as a second question, you had mentioned you guys have been pretty tax efficient so far funding the buyback to sales. Just curious about what you guys have kind of in a till here, if you guys still \u2013 what kind of cushion you have left to continue to sell assets, fund the buyback without any tax implications?","Matthew DiLiberto","It\u2019s Matt. As part of the kind of five primary criteria to fund buybacks thus far have been very tax efficient, not requiring any special dividends, using a lot of tax protections and strategies to create that and plan to do so for the next 500 as well as to how much is left. I mean, there's a whole host of things that goes into that. There's not a number that I\u2019m going to quantify for you to say how much tax efficiency we have left, except to say that we certainly have a plan for the next 500 to be tax efficient and there is certainly room for much more, but how we go about doing that is part of a multi-faceted exercise and evaluating the assets, the funding, the returns, the liquidity, the leverage, the earnings and tax efficiency.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Manny Korchman with Citi.","Michael Bilerman","It\u2019s Michael Bilerman here with Manny. I just had a question on the debt and preferred equity originations you did in the quarter. Who wants to talk about it, but can you just give a little bit more color on sort of the number of transactions, the type of the transactions, were they refis or sales, the type of borrowers and just sort of, give a little bit more detail about, because it was a pretty big origination quarter, so just trying to get a little bit more color around it.","Andrew Mathias","Sure. I think Marc highlighted obviously that an additional investment in 245 Park was part of the activity in the quarter and then we additionally had a large structured deal we did where we originated a mortgage and mezzanine position and then we'll probably ultimately sell a piece of that mortgage, but for now, we still have it on our balance sheet. Across sectors, office and really multi-family and we haven't really changed any of our underwriting criteria. It's kind of standard for our structured finance book.","Michael Bilerman","And Andrew, how do you think that\u2019s going to go through year end in terms of repayments that you're expecting versus what's in the pipeline now from an origination standpoint, where does this DP book sit at the end of the year?","Matthew DiLiberto","Michael, it's Matt. So this is the high watermark for the year. As we provided guidance back in December, we said overall the balance would be down, average and absolute. This will come down over the balance of the year, just looking out over the next quarter, I'm looking at north of $400 million of repayments, with very little incremental origination to offset that. So definitely the high watermark of the year, consistent with how we planned for the year to go, because the originations ebb and flow and repayments are a little less predictable, but that balance will come down over the balance of the year.","Michael Bilerman","So [indiscernible] and selling down positions that you originated this quarter, we could be in the $1.5 billion range by the end of the year?","Matthew DiLiberto","That's really low. I wouldn't go that low, but down year-over-year is our expectation and we are maintaining that.","Andrew Mathias","I thought we have guidance. This is the guidance on this. It\u2019s down 100. So we\u2019re not changing guidance right at this moment. So, I would say, the best proxy if you're trying to look at what we've -- how we think about it through the end of the year would be last year's balance minus 100, it's a living breathing portfolio and it's a lot of activity, so you can't be that specific, but that that's a very good estimate.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.","John Kim","Your leverage today is above nine times net debt to EBITDA if you include a portion of that. And presumably this will be going higher with One Vanderbilt, your buyback at 245 Park Avenue. So can you remind us what leverage levels you\u2019re comfortable with and how this compares to the target of 7 times, which is defined by Fitch or maybe calculated differently?","Matthew DiLiberto","John, it\u2019s Matt. So we are at 6.8 as against our 7.0 goal on Fitch\u2019s math. That is the balance sheet leverage, including off balance sheet, we are at 8.8, so two times higher, factoring the sales we just closed and on an LTV basis, we are exactly neutral in the low-40s and our expectation is, over the balance of the year, ex One Vanderbilt, that stays flat to even down based on growth in EBITDA. So I\u2019m sure leverage is affected by a large scale project going on where you have no EBITDA, but the underpinning of our share buyback program of being leverage neutral certainly on an LTV basis is maintained.","John Kim","So the main difference with Fitch is they exclude development CapEx as well as, they only look at balance sheet?","Matthew DiLiberto","Well, most of the rating agencies use balance sheet, not off balance sheet. They all calculate it differently. So one of the greatest or one of the hundred flaws with debt to EBITDA is everybody calculates it differently. So we use one of the three agencies as the standard, but they have a calculation that includes certain things, excludes certain things that maybe other rating agencies or other equity investors don't, but we had to create some standards so as not to create just our own math.","John Kim","And then with the sale of the 724 Fifth Avenue, is this a one-off transaction or do you expect to sell more of your retail assets?","Marc Holliday","Well, we've sold some retail. So I don\u2019t know about one-off. I think we showed a slide in December that showed over $2 billion of sales in the retail portfolio. And this is a continuation where we buy opportunistically, we stabilize and then depending on sort of the growth profile of the asset, we\u2019ll look to exit.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander Goldfarb","Two questions. First, just going on your JV side at Worldwide Plaza, your partner in New York REIT just had it, well the CEO Wendy just left. So curious if that changes anything as far as the partnership goes or strategy for the building or this means that New York REIT may accelerate their sale and if that -- if you guys have any view of whether you'd increase your ownership or you\u2019d say as it?","Marc Holliday","Well, I think the only thing we can comment on -- only thing we know is that Wendy has moved on. Will be -- we had been dealing with this investment, both with Wendy and at a board level. So I think there is some continuity there and there were colleagues of Wendy who were with us every step of the way of underwriting and making the deal who are still with the company and I guess will continue to be our counterpoints, adding variety for the asset. So we and RXR, we operate, we lease, we handle all the day-to-day management and activities of the building.","So in that regard, there's no change at a building lever. We have a mid-term plan, about a three year plan of making certain improvements of the building, capitalizing on some near-term leasing opportunities, which includes some recapture of space, which actually has been going on this year. On a smaller scale, the bigger opportunity out there is to focus in with [indiscernible] on their lease role, but that's not until 2024.","And there's also some opportunity to upgrade retail, which we're working on with RXR along 9th Avenue Frontage. So all of that is sort of in the works. We look at that as kind of a three-ish year business plan at which point, we'll reevaluate the building at that point. So I don't think anything has changed there. As far as what NYRT, what their intentions are with the interest they own, that's not something we can shed any light on.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. And then the second question is for Matt. Matt, just curious if you've sort of framework for what you think the change in FASB accounting for internal leasing cost is going to have on you guys for next year or maybe the way you guys do it already, you already expensed it, so it\u2019s not an impact.","Matthew DiLiberto","Yeah. I hate to announce it on the call, but we\u2019re going to Steve and his entire group, so we\u2019re not going to take any other charge for that. We are going through the process right now of evaluating the impacts and alternatives. I don't view the impact to be meaningful. There will be an impact of course because you can't avoid it entirely, but there are strategies to mitigate it and we\u2019re working through those right now.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jamie Feldman","Marc, I want to go back to your comments on rent and concessions and just hoping you can provide a little bit more color or maybe Steve provide more color on were our rents rising in any types of assets right now, any submarkets are declining. And the same thing with concessions, like is there a way to dig a little bit deeper into the types of assets or submarkets that might be different than the overall market trends?","Marc Holliday","It's very hard to go through, whether it's submarket by submarket, building by building. A rent that's coming up for renewal, whether there will be a large mark to market or not because it depends what vintage year the lease was signed. I think that, in general and we can talk about some specific submarkets and Steve can do that. But in general, we can take our pulse from the vibe we get from our tenant base. And remember, we have almost 1000 tenants in the New York City, maybe more and it covers the entire gamut of industries and sectors.","And we are -- since this is our only market, I would say we cover this tenant pace as good or better than any recovers the tenant base, because we are in front of them 365 days a year, management wise, leasing wise, marketing wise, early renewal wise. And Andrew and I meet with them and we get a sense of the level of business optimism that's out there in terms of expectations of growth in revenues, expansion, M&A activity, et cetera. And I would say and what I said in my comments was that that sentiment right now is really fairly positive.","We see -- we're dealing a lot right now in a portfolio that doesn't have that much vacancy, trying to create space in buildings to accommodate the needs of tenants that want to consolidate or want to grow and we're only in midtown, Jamie. So, that commentary is really condensed into submarkets that would include 3rd avenue for sure, Grand Central Park certainly, 5th and 6th avenue, we have a big presence. I can't really differentiate submarket to submarket.","I\u2019d say it's fairly consistent and it's evidenced by a couple of things. One, I'm looking at a CBR report in front of me where the headline is highest mid-year leasing activity since 2015. So that's a fairly positive commentary from midtown Manhattan, strongest quarter of leasing activity since \u201915, exceeding 5 million feet and it's almost 10 million feet for the half year, which if you extrapolate would be 20 million feet for the full year, which would almost be a record year. So clearly, the velocity is there.","And the rents, which is one of the two projects primes you asked about, the rents we see, affirming of rents, but we don't see we\u2019ll call a spike. So we're moving rents where we can, but I think we're moving them responsibly. We\u2019re maintaining a mark to market, which right now I think for the first half of the year is averaged about 7% or in that range, which is within the range that we wanted. We'd like to see it higher, but it's solid and it's right where we would have expected it to be and it's a result of fairly significant amount of demand, not only that\u2019s taken place in the first year, but also was in the pipeline.","We have pretty good visibility into the leasing for the next six months, both in our portfolio and the market and it should be, this will end up being quite a good year in the leasing market with concessions that have generally leveled off. And Steve can give a little more insight as to where are they dropping and where might they still be rising. And once that are affirmed and rising a touch, what I had said previously is in the second half of the year, hopefully, we can start to push those rents and see the market respond to a tightening and all of this is not withstanding the additional inventory, Manhattan West and Hudson yards.","We've always said that there's enough employment growth in this market and we only have the numbers through May. June numbers are actually coming out for New York City ironically. But through May, the employment growth was very good, very much on track and that's driving this demand. I think his level of optimism, notwithstanding, what we hear out there in terms of reasons to be nervous, you want to be nervous in a macro sense, but in our micro New York City economy, everything is pretty much operating at full tilt.","So Steve, I would see if you want to add to that.","Steven Durels","I would add a couple more data points just to reinforce what Marc is saying, which is Midtown is really the big part of the leasing story this year. We said in the last earnings call, where within midtown, last year, it was about the leasing that was taking place in the Far West of the Hudson yards and the Manhattan West. This year, it\u2019s all really focused back to Midtown core and within that Grand Central Terminal Park Avenue and 6th Avenue have been the dominant beneficiaries of the. Grand Central, in particular, which has been 52% of the leasing activity year to date.","So contrast that to last year and we've seen over 2 million square feet of positive absorption this year in Midtown. So the fundamentals of the market are very strong. And we're seeing to the extent that we see, rent appreciation, it's been more, I think it's been more on the lower end of the price point spectrum. There is continued strong demand for high quality product, but it doesn't feel like that rental rate has been increasing. It feels like, to the extent there's been rental rate appreciation, that's been at the lower end of the spectrum.","Jamie Feldman","And then I guess on the concessions side, you said a lot of that didn\u2019t come in at all and is it more on the free rent or constructions cost side, or GI side?","Marc Holliday","I think tenants are more willing to -- I think they\u2019re less willing to sacrifice concessions as opposed to pay a little more rent. There are still a few landlords that are out there that are with outsized concessions that are buying deals and it skews people's perspective of the market.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of John Guinee with Stifel.","John Guinee","Hey, Matt, can you give us the other 99 flaws to net debt to EBITDA.","Matthew DiLiberto","Yeah. I\u2019ll write them all down. I\u2019ll distribute them in an email. No problem.","John Guinee","And talk a little bit about what it costs to build new product these days in the core of Manhattan around One Vande and the Plaza district versus what you think it might cost at Hudson Yards.","Andrew Mathias","Well, are you excluding land?","John Guinee","All land. To the extent you guys have that kind of number at your fingertips, if you don\u2019t, it\u2019s not a big deal.","Andrew Mathias","I think exclusive of land, it's probably 1200 or further so, wherever you\u2019re building it to get to finish phase and then obviously land is far more valuable in Midtown East than it as in the West side of Manhattan. So you have to adjust, but there is no difference appreciably in construction cost between east and west and south.","Marc Holliday","Yeah. And I would \u2013 the 1200 a foot, everybody defines it differently. We like to be very comprehensive when we give a number. That's everything. I mean, that's hard, soft, tenant improvements, marketing, deficit ops, leasing conditions, everything. So that\u2019s we think the right way to look at it. The actual hard cost or physical construction might be in the $600, $700, $800 foot range, but that's not a meaningful answer and at least we don't think. So, to deliver soup to nuts, that's probably the number and you gave you.","Land cost could be anywhere from three to, I don't know, $800 a foot on top of that. So you\u2019re looking at sort of all in 1500, 2000 a foot in that range and One Vande falls right within that range. That's probably as good a proxy as any and the only real variable if you will from location to location will be the link component.","John Guinee","And then second question, third question after net debt to EBITDA. Have you formulated any plans for One Madison Avenue, the big credit space?","Marc Holliday","Yes. We have fairly exciting plans that have been formulated with much of that having crystallized in our minds and in our plans over the past three to five months and we're looking forward to unveiling glimpses of what that will look like and what our strategy is in December. But even though, we probably won't elaborate in much detail until then, we have a fairly comprehensive and set plan as we sit here today.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Michael Lewis with SunTrust.","Michael Lewis","I wanted to ask about street retail, both in terms of fundamentals. What you're seeing? And then also kind of more strategically, I know you answered a question about obviously some sales you've done and maybe some opportunistic buys, you\u2019re always looking for, but is there any thought to kind of changing your exposure to street retailer or would that be kind of a knee jerk reaction?","Andrew Mathias","We had a very active leasing quarter on the retail side. I mean, we signed Cody at 719 7th, which was the kind of credit timing we were looking for, for that asset. And we signed PUMA at 609 5th avenue in the largest deal to be done on 5th Avenue in sometimes. So we're getting, we feel, more than our fair share of tenancy and in terms of the percentage of retail as a percentage of our gross or our net, I think we're fairly comfortable with that number. We've been continuing to maintain or reduce that percentage over time as I answered to the earlier question. And as we sit today, we\u2019re having some exciting retail conversations on 2 Herald, we have a lot of activity in other retail areas of our portfolio. We still view it is a business we are active in and want to continue to be a first mover in for sure.","We also see some opportunity coming out of that sector. I mean, as the question was asked before about the sale of 724 5th and the redemption of 720, Andrew referenced $2 billion of other sales over the past few years, but while that\u2019s taking place, you have things like 2 Herald and we would expect imminently to announce another small deal on the Upper East Side, retail, residential, just sort of things that would be an outgrowth of a market in which is going through change, going through some dislocation and repricing and whenever you have that, you have a \u2013 you sort of have a period of paralysis if you will and then an inertia and then once you get past that, that usually then the next phase of that usually represents opportunity.","And I would hope and think we\u2019ll be best positioned selectively. I don't think in any kind of large scale and certainly nothing that will materially alter the percentage of retail we own in the portfolio. But it's, for us, it's not about percent of retail, it's about the profitability of what we own, trying to move out of mature investments and move into value add investments where we can continue to push earnings, value creation and the like.","Michael Lewis","My second question maybe for Matt. I realized guidance was left unchanged. I wanted to ask a little about the components of guidance. Maybe more dispositions obviously, maybe more buybacks than you\u2019ve planned at the beginning of the year. I was just curious if there's any other components that are kind of moving, it looks like G&A is running pretty well versus your original guidance. Is there anything else kind of worth talking about?","Matthew DiLiberto","No. I mean you hit on the things that are, if there are any real variances or variables, I should say, that\u2019s them. But the sales, we've talked about a buyback program that is earnings friendly. And so the next leg of the buyback program, the 500 is engineered to be that way as well. It is more than we expected to do when we came out with our initial guidance, but it keeps us within the range, based on how much we expect to do and how we expect to fund that. G&A, yes, running ahead of our expectations. That's a good thing. And the other ins and outs, whether it be the debt portfolio, interest expense basically wash themselves out. So keeping us right in our range.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo.","Blaine Heck","Steve, just on One Vanderbilt, you guys got a nice lease there this quarter and I know you talked about the bulk of leasing coming in late 2018 and 2019, but can you just give us an update on the pipeline there, maybe the number of prospects and the aggregate square footage of deals you guys are kind of actively working on.","Steven Durels","We have four active proposals that we\u2019re discussing with prospective tenants. We've got at least two more that we think are prospective tenants who are diligencing the building. We think they're likely to submit RFPs to us, whether we land any of those tenants is too early to really tell. But based upon the amount of tours, the amount of presentations, the enthusiasm for the brokers\u2019 community, the reception that we're getting from prospective tenants, we are very confident that we're on plan, if not ahead of plan.","Blaine Heck","And then Matt, just following up on the guidance question. I think your original guidance for other income was around 24 million. You guys have done 28 million thus far this year. Can you just give a little color on what\u2019s being included in that number in driving it higher than expected and maybe your outlook for the rest of the year?","Matthew DiLiberto","Sure. It's actually not ahead of our expectation. So let\u2019s so its classification of items on the face of the income statement. We present our guidance for other income, net of the expense for our service corp, which actually runs through operating expenses on the face of the income statement. So all in all, as I look after the, excuse me, the balance of the year, I expect to be within a few million dollars of our original guidance. So it's really just a classification issue.","As for the quarter, the biggest item in the other income line item on the face to the income statement are about $6 million of tax refunds we got up in the suburbs. Those were large part in our guidance. It\u2019s just a matter of timing. We didn't have them all baked into the second quarter, but that\u2019s when they rolled through, but all in all, largely on track with our full year other income guidance.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore.","Steve Sakwa","Marc, I guess you quickly touched on the kind of the One Madison and I guess my question really related to kind of the Credit Suisse lease in 2020 and the Ralph Lauren lease in 2019, are there any kind of comments you can make about those two large expirations?","Marc Holliday","Well, Credit Suisse lease is up in 2020 and we have a very robust redevelopment and development plan for that building that, as I mentioned earlier, we're going to go into a deep dive on, on probably in December when we get to some real time to meet with everyone and present some visual. So in terms of status of lease, what exactly do you mean by status of lease? They\u2019re in through 2020. Do you mean, are we going to be taking back the lease early?","Steve Sakwa","Well, I just didn\u2019t know what they were renewing for a piece of it, if they were going to give you back all of that, if that was going to completely vacate. I was just looking for a sense for some portion of how much they may stay?","Marc Holliday","I was never \u2013 the plan and again I just wonder, because \u2013 I want to make sure it gets, it\u2019s looked at the right way. This building is a 100% redevelopment and development candidate, so that a renewal of the lease or a portion is not -- was never expected nor is expected, nor do I think it's really physically possible. So, the commencement of that work will begin in 2021.","If your question was earlier and by making some kind of deal with CS, that\u2019s to be seen, but that not a now moment.","But, this building, in our opinion, is sort of the next great, not good, but very great opportunity within this portfolio to create extraordinary value in a part of the market that today has the lowest vacancy rates and is achieving the highest rents and we want to deliver a product that is both -- appeals to the tenant base that wants to be what really, I would say is the best sub market in the USA right now. This Midtown submarket, certainly in New York City by far.","And then make sure we have the right tenant who can create the kind of excitement and pay the kind of rents that are consistent with that level of development. So, the CS lease is not really a part of that exercise per se. I can't say whether they'll be the tenant or not. I guess that's possible, but before you get to that juncture, there is \u2013 there will be a couple of years of physical work to do with that building. So -- and we've talked about that and that's still the path we're on. There's no change in path there.","Steve Sakwa","Okay. So just to be clear, we should assume that that building basically goes dark, the rent goes away and you commence some sort of large rescale redevelopment project that takes several years to unfold?","Marc Holliday","For sure. Yeah. The lease is up December 2020. So starting 2021, for sure and remember, we don\u2019t want to sort of preempt, but the major value paradigm here is, there's somewhere between 250,000 and 450,000 square feet of unused -- and a bulk of that it as of air rights that can be used on a building which was built as a podium. So, I think the best we can say is let\u2019s table that conversation for a few months and we'll have more to come on that, but this will be a very exciting redevelopment, not only for the company, but I think for New York City.","And then on 625, I would say it's too early to comment on any conversations ongoing there.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we have a follow-up question from the line of Jamie Feldman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jamie Feldman","Can you just provide more color to 2 Herald Square and the JV that you guys announced there and just kind of leasing challenges or leasing plans there.","Matthew DiLiberto","Well, it's Matt. So Andrew alluded to leasing progress over there on all fronts up to the retail side, as to the JV, we expect a JV in financing later in the year. We will provide more details at that time. It will be a little bit premature to go out with that at this point, but a JV in financing, our expectations in the second half of the year.","Operator","Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. So with that said, I'd like to turn the call back over to CEO, Mr. Marc Holliday for closing remarks.","Marc Holliday","Okay. Thank you, everyone and we're back to work everybody.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect.

My name is Mark, and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the call over to Heidi Gillette. Please proceed.","Heidi Gillette","Thank you, everybody, for joining us, and welcome to SL Green Realty Corp.'s third quarter 2013 earnings results conference call. At this time, the company would like to remind you that listeners -- during the call, management -- sorry, the company would like to remind listeners that, during the call, management may make forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ from the forward-looking statements that management may make today.","Additional information regarding the factors that could cause such differences appear in the MD&A section of the company's Form 10-K and other reports filed by the company with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Also during today's conference call the company may discuss non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC Regulation G.","The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to each non-GAAP financial measure are discussed and the reconciliation of the differences between each non-GAAP financial measure and the comparable GAAP financial measure can be found on the company's website at www.slgreen.com, by selecting the press release regarding the company's third quarter 2013 earnings.","Before turning the call over to Marc Holliday, Chief Executive Officer of SL Green Realty Corp., I would like to highlight that in our earnings release from last evening, we did once again announced the company will host its Annual Institutional Investor Conference on Monday, December 9, in New York City. To be added to the conferences email distribution list, please email SLG2013@slgreen.com. [Operator Instructions]","I will now turn the call over to Marc Holliday. Please go ahead, Marc.","Marc Holliday","Okay. Thank you, Heidi, and thanks to all of you joining us this afternoon. We would like to provide you with some color on certain factors influencing our market and on the third quarter's financial results, followed by your questions. Overall, we're still seeing very good market fundamentals, which enabled us to execute our business strategies that we've enumerated throughout the year, including new purchases like the retail, residential and commercial project known as The Olivia; redevelopment of growth assets out of that value-add portfolio like 280 Park Avenue, 3 Columbus, 635 Sixth Avenue, to name a few; sales and harvesting of hard-fought gains like the recently closed 333 West 34th Street; major leasing signed and commenced, like the new leases with Bloomingdale's and the law firm of Meister Seelig, which were signed in the third quarter; and structured finance originations, which exceeded $180 million in total and still provides a very attractive risk-adjusted return after we sell and syndicate out senior pieces of that capital stack.","Underpinning these favorable market conditions is the continued strength, diversity and vibrancy of the New York City economy, which added another 88,000 private sector jobs this year through August, only through August of 2013. This is well ahead of the city's initial forecast for year-to-date, which was about 54,000 jobs, and I think you're likely to see a revision upward in November, ending the year somewhere right around that 88,000 total job creation number. While only 10,000 of these jobs are classified as office-using, that still represents over 2 million square feet of new demand and counters the refrain I sometimes hear about the shrinkage of the labor force in New York. This simply isn't the case, and hasn't been, since the recovery began in 2009.","Of particular note, the closely watched FIRE sector is essentially flat for the year through August and Wall Street profits for the first half of the year was $10 billion, which was roughly on track with last year. While I think expectations are that the second half of the year will be less robust, it will still be a very profitable year on Wall Street, at least as things look at this moment.","Switching focus to the leasing front, I read with interest last night some commentary from analysts that looked at 440,000 square feet of leasing as a deceleration and possibly a signaling of a slowing market. I don't think anything could be further from the truth, and I also think it's probably somewhat flawed to measure the leasing market in terms of signed leases in 3-month increments. I think it's better to look at the picture over year-to-date of 1.8 million square feet. Actually, 450,000 feet signed -- or 440,000 feet signed is on track with 1.8 million per year, that's not through 3 months. And looking out over our pipeline over the next 3 months, we see very encouraging signs, not the least of which is almost 100,000 square feet of leases already signed in October and then another 1.2 million square feet of leases that are either out for signature or in negotiation and pending. That's about as high as we've had our leasing pipeline at any point in the past year. And in speaking with the group, just prior to the call, it's our estimate at the moment that approximately 750,000 feet in total of those leases will likely sign in the fourth quarter, which would put it on track with last quarter's roughly 750,000 feet, which represents near all-time highs for the company in any quarter and would end the year at about 2.5 million square feet leased without any exceptional bias towards any one tenant.","So I guess you'll read into it what you want to read into the third quarter's leasing results, but from our vantage point, and I presume that's why everyone's dialing in, is to hear our thoughts and commentary on the matter, we look at the pipeline as robust. We think the market is very balanced. And we think demand is reasonably good. And as this demand continues to clip along, there's going to be a need to look at how we're going to be able to house this new tenant demand into the future, and we get to the discussion about East Midtown rezoning. This is a very important rezoning proposal that's been put forth by the city to be voted on by the City Council sometime in the middle to end of November, of next month. They will be voting on a plan which would result in a limited number of sites receiving bulk and density increases beyond current zoning, including our site located right across the street from Grand Central station at what is known as 1 Vanderbilt.","We believe the passage of this new zoning is essential for incentivizing the development of new buildings in one of Manhattan's most desirable commercial districts. The City's proposal is putting density right where density belongs, surrounding one of the busiest rail transportation hubs in the country, with over 1 million commuters and visitors daily. This establishment of a district improvement fund, from which developers can purchase air rights at a cost of $250 per square foot, subject to future increases, is being established to fund necessary transportation and other important public-realm improvements, which were unveiled by the city within the past few weeks.","We've come this far and we certainly hope the Council will approve this rezoning proposal to encourage the selective renewal of East Midtown's commercial inventory. Another note on leasing, as we've commented on in the past, we continue to be engaged with Citigroup on an extension of their lease beyond 2021 at 388-390 Greenwich Street. We believe that we presented Citi with the most compelling offer, containing substantial economic benefits, flexibility, certainty of execution, iconic architecture and the most desirable neighborhood today, to live, work, play and eat, Tribeca.","We're focused, very focused on making this happen, but at this point, we can't comment further on the status of any details associated with this particular transaction.","So the combination of, I guess, all the factors I touched upon, including, primarily, leasing up the growth portfolio, same-store mark-to-market increases in rents, expense control, all have enabled us to guide towards a midpoint in earnings that is 13% higher than just last year. This earnings momentum, which we foresee continuing into 2014 and 2015, in conjunction with improving FAD and cash flow numbers, enabled us to reward investors with a sizable dividend increase, which Jim will speak to the rationale of the underlying -- the amount of that increase, a little later on.","But for more color on the capital, the investment market, sales market and some of what we're -- how we're fine-tuning our strategy in light of very, very enthusiastic market conditions, Andrew is going to take you through the next few minutes.","Andrew W. Mathias","Thanks, Marc. Third quarter saw a continuation of the themes we've been seeing all year, all leading to a very strong sales market. Interest rates continue to be well under control, with the 10-year treasury again reaching 2.5%, leading to a liquid debt market. Spreads continue to be very stable. Some spreads, including on the floating rate, that seems to be compressing again. Note that liquid debt market, combined with enormous inflows of foreign capital, is creating an environment where assets are trading for untested, unseen numbers in all different parts of Manhattan. The latest example of this was 1 Chase Manhattan Plaza, where a large Chinese conglomerate bought the deal on an all-cash basis, signed a hard contract, beating out a litany of residential developers and other traditional sort of New York bidders. They all were topped by a Chinese conglomerate, which is the theme we've seen throughout the year. Chinese capital, Norwegian capital, other sovereign wealth funds, all targeting New York as their primary entry point to the U.S. and all targeting the U.S. as an attractive investment market where they want to increase their investment allocations.","Additionally, alternative uses continue to drive a lot of these transactions, as the residential market, both rental and for sale in New York, continues to appreciate and continues to drive significant transaction volume. We participated in this frothy market with our sale of 333 West 34th Street, which Marc referred to. And further, we've put 1350 6th Avenue on the market to test pricing levels for a prime 6th Avenue asset. In addition to 1350, we're exploring other recapitalization strategies with respect to other assets in our portfolio, trying to find the exact right mix of deals to best improve our asset allocations. These transactions all serve to demonstrate a widening gap between our actual at the market NAV and market views of our NAVs, which in a lot of cases, including on 333 West 34th Street, badly trail the market prices we're able to achieve.","We also continue to contract and sell properties in the Arden portfolio in Southern California, and sold a property in Stamford, Connecticut, this quarter as well.","On the structured finance front, we have continued very strong originations in our portfolio. We have an active pipeline for fourth quarter and we continue to be the market leader in originating primary positions and syndicating both senior and pari-passu positions with great success and at great profitability to the company. For example, in August, we closed $160 million acquisition loan on a B-class asset on Madison Avenue. And in early September, syndicated $110 million senior mortgage, leaving ourselves a prime high-yielding $50 million junior position on that asset. We have more transactions like this in the pipeline and feel very confident about our abilities to keep our balances roughly where they are and keep our rates of return consistent with our current rates of return.","We're also adding some fixed-rate positions with longer duration to help balance out prepayments over the next 2 to 3 years. We do view these yields as sustainable, given our 15-year track record of originating high-yield paper in the structured finance program, and look forward to continued originations and profitability.","And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Matt, to talk about earnings.","Matthew Diliberto","Thanks, Andrew. The first 9 months of 2013 have obviously been very profitable for the firm. And with only 3 months left ago, we see a clear path to finishing 2013 with earnings well above the expectations we set out last December, even after taking several nonrecurring charges throughout the course of the year, including a noncash charge of around $7 million this quarter, relating to accounting balances of a tenant who vacated their space early.","Based on the performance of the first 9 months and our view of the next 3, we took the opportunity last night to increase both our FFO and FAD guidance significantly. Our FFO guidance range was increased from $4.90 to $5 a share, to $5.12 to $5.16 a share. This increase is due to the performance of our real estate portfolio, which, in a strong and strengthening market, is performing in line to slightly ahead of our expectations. Certainly leasing, as well, outpaced our initial guidance.","And due to the performance of our debt and preferred equity portfolio, or as Andrew alluded to, our ability to source new deals, has provided a relatively stable outstanding principal balance throughout the year, with still more pipeline left to close in the fourth quarter, while maintaining a robust average yield that currently stands at 11.2%. In addition, our earnings this year have benefited from some other income events, which are generally not provided for in an initial guidance due to their uncertainty.","With regard to FAD, which adjusts FFO for GAAP-related items and second-generation capital expenses, are increasing guidance from $3.10 to $3.20 a share to $3.51 to $3.55 a share, not only reflects the increase in our FFO expectations but also takes into consideration the continued slow pace of spending by Viacom who, through the third quarter, had yet to spend any of the capital they provided under their 2012 1.6 million square foot lease renewal. We've layered in about $15 million of expected spend for Viacom in the fourth quarter of 2013.","With that, I'll turn it over to Jim to touch on the dividend.","James E. Mead","Thanks, Matt. We announced that dividends would be increasing by 52% to the annual rate of $2 a share or a quarterly rate of $0.50, beginning with the dividend that will be declared later this year, for payment in January 2014. As many of you know, it's not really in our nature to pay out more than we have to, and we continue to have plenty of places to invest our capital. So the reality is that the increases, because our taxable income is increasing, and as Andrew said, we've got some asset sales planned that would also have gains that need to be sheltered. So while we are managing our taxes to have as low a dividend as possible, the $2 for 2014 is our best guess at the moment. And if anything may be light if we close on more property sales. And in that case, we'll have to revisit our dividend level unless we adopt other strategies to shelter or defer gains.","What's clear, though, is that at $2 a share, we still have room to grow and we'll likely need to grow over time. Our payout ratio will be modest, in comparison to other office REITs. And as we move forward into 2015 and beyond, we expect to see sizable growth in our income stream from the lease up and stabilization of the portfolio of growth assets we purchased since 2010.","I'm now changing topics for a moment. I also want to say a few words about an important achievement this quarter. We received an upgrade in our -- to our outlook from Fitch, which is the step that precedes receiving their full investment grade rating. The analysts at Fitch really understand us well, and in fact, they made their target ratios more accommodative earlier this year as they became more comfortable with the security of our operating cash flow and our focus on reducing balance sheet risk. So this is a great accomplishment for our team, led by Matt, and puts us right on track to get our second investment grade rating, having already achieved investment grade from S&P a couple of years ago. Thanks.","Marc Holliday","Okay. So Heidi already went through some of the details for the upcoming investor meeting, right? So hopefully, that will be the next opportunity we'll get to make a fulsome presentation on these topics and a host of many, many other topics that we'll be preparing throughout November for a day that we consider one of the most important days for us in terms of our communications with our -- with you, folks.","So we look forward to that, and I guess, at this point, we'll open up the line for questions and answers.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Vincent Chao, Deutsche Bank.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Curious, just on the rent spread for the quarter, obviously, there was a big one lease that skewed it quite significantly. But just given the size of it, just wondering if you could provide some more color on what was going on there? I guess there was a bankruptcy replacement, but just curious what caused you to mark the rent down so much on that one roll over.","Steven M. Durels","Yes, that one lease was that 810 Seventh Avenue where we had a hedge fund that had a little over 17,000 square feet. And they had signed at the top of the market a few years ago, in the last cycle. And the rent was in excess of $100 a square foot. So we leased it at a healthy rent, but on a mark-to-market basis, it watered-down the averages for the quarter.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. You would replace it at market rent, though, you think?","Steven M. Durels","Yes, we replaced it at a full market rent, and I think it's arguably, probably, a below-market-concession package. Because we inherited a very nice installation, so we really just gave them some modest money to redecorate.","Marc Holliday","Yes. That deal, as I recall, Steve, was 0 TI. So, obviously, for a new tenant, that's dramatically below $40 to $50 average for a new tenant. And I think it was only 3 months free rent, which -- so there's no adjustment for -- on a net effective basis, it's actually much higher. So we stripped it out. So you can look at it both ways, with and without, take your pick. But if you look at it with that lease, understand that, that was a brand-new lease done with almost nothing in the way of new concessions.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And just -- I know you said the lease pipeline is very strong and very broad-based. I was just curious if you could just maybe provide a little bit more color on what you're seeing between the different submarkets in Manhattan in terms of demand activity, that kind of thing?","Steven M. Durels","Sure. The good news is like we said last quarter, is that we're continuing to see really no one pocket, geographically, drive the demand, nor one industry. Really, all across our portfolio we're seeing good demand at all price points. Sort of the value-play type tenant, that $45 to $50 kind of tenant, is active in the market. The very high price-point type tenant, north of $100 for top floor space, that seems to be back in the market, much more so this year than last year. And then, on the types of tenants that we're seeing, we have active either leases-out or term sheets being negotiated with tenants in technology and media businesses, transportation, financial services, legal, publishing and a good-size lease-out with a consulting firm. So no one user group is driving the demand, and I think that's one of the healthiest things. And last point, I think, worth making on that is a couple of the buildings that were laggards last year, for instance 711 Third Avenue and 810 Seventh Avenue, where we had very slow leasing last year in those properties, have good momentum this year, with active leases out. 810 Seventh is on track to be at least, until we get some more space back from future roll, up to a 95% occupancy. In 711 Third Avenue, half of my vacancy there has leases out. So that drives a lot of why we're encouraged about what we're seeing in the marketplace.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay and just last one, just in regards to the commentary about the 10-year. Obviously we had a spike there and it's pulled back again more recently. It sounded like you're exploring some other potential sales. Is that -- how much of that is driven by what's going on in the treasury markets today? Is there more buyers that have sort of -- does it help you from that sense? And how are you thinking about sort of taking advantage of this pull back here?","Andrew W. Mathias","And I don't think -- I don't think when it spiked out to 3, it didn't really have a material impact. And in fact, we printed 333 West 34th Street at just about the high of the 10-year treasury market probably this year. The buyers, as we've said, are just not that sensitive to relatively small moves in rates. So I'd define it as 25 to 50 basis points. I just don't think it makes a material impact. People have a view that the markets continue to tighten, rents are going up, and because of where spreads are, the cost of debt is still, from a longer-term historical perspective, whether the 10-years are 3 or the 10-years are 2.5 or 2, the all-in cost of debt is still very attractive, and that's driving these buyers more than month-to-month moves in the treasury.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Guinee from Stifel.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Great. Well done, guys. Kind of a big-picture question for you. It looks like your next mayor is going to be Mr. de Blasio, and depending on who you listen to, he's anywhere from a Clinton centralist to a very far left. Talk about what that's going to do to your business and also to operating expenses and how your operating expense increases may be mitigated by your lease structures.","Marc Holliday","I'm sorry, John, the question was?","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","The question is it looks like de Blasio is going to be your...","Unknown Executive","On expenses.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Expenses. Just how property tax is going up, any other aspects of your business going up and how you might mitigate those increases by, vis-a-vis, your lease structures?","Marc Holliday","Yes, I don't -- I wouldn't equate the potential win by de Blasio in November as in any way, connected to real estate tax increase. I mean, I think everyone always has a theory, with incumbents and with new administrations, that real estate taxes become a source of potential revenues if other sources cannot be identified. But I think that the tax burden on the commercial sector is very full and, relative to other sectors like, particularly some of the residential sectors, arguably overtaxed. And because the real strength in the market right now is much more oriented towards residential rents and sale prices, versus the commercial rents, which are increasing but not to the same degree, I wouldn't necessarily conclude that real estate taxes on, for instance our portfolio, will come in to attack any more or less so than increases have been experienced over the past -- in this current administration, where taxes have gone up. Now a lot of that tax increase does get passed through to tenants until a date of reset, when that tenant expire or vacates. But -- so there is, certainly, a lot of interim protection on any kind of tax increases. But we do model very routinely, conservatively, these tax increases going forward. And I think we've got a very good handle on that and whatever increases occur get phased in over, generally, a 5-year transitional period and a lot of that gets passed through the tenant. So I can't speak to the very, very long term of where things might be headed, but certainly, I would say in the near term, near term as defined the next 3 to 5 years, I don't see that as a particular area of risk to us and particularly relative to other areas that may be more at risk.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then a second and last question. If you look at your structured finance book, your originations run about $200 million a quarter and you redemptions run about $100 million a quarter. And during the last 5 quarters, your weighted average yield has increased 180 basis points. What are you doing differently to cause that yield to go up so much in a pretty competitive environment with a lot of people in the space?","Andrew W. Mathias","I think the average yield is skewed up by certain extremely profitable transactions that we've had, outlier profitable transactions like the Sony Building, which I think we did a case study on. And our average origination, I would say, has skewed up slightly to be more profitable. That's solely because the senior debt markets have gotten more liquid. So when we're originating that $160 million loan that I spoke about, there are simply more competitors for the $110 million senior mortgage that we syndicated and that drives down price. So whereas we used to be syndicating that senior mortgage at 400 over LIBOR, today, we're syndicating at 300 over LIBOR. It's literally that kind of spread compression. And we're seeing increasing amounts, particularly of German banks and U.S. commercial banks, coming into the floating rate, transitional loan sector, which is further driving down spreads, which is a terrific dynamic for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rob Stevenson.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","You sold a couple of assets in the Arden portfolio this quarter. How much are you seeing value recovery there? And is there more harvesting that can occur near-term or were these select assets and much of the value harvesting out of that portfolio is that going to be further off in the future?","David Schonbraun","This is David. I think we've seen significant value recovery over the past couple months. Part of it is the market in general. Part of it is now that we have the right-size capital stack, we're leasing up the properties and kind of doing the right thing and creating value. So it's a combination of the market and us, together with Blackstone, creating value. So I think we've sold kind of well in excess of where we thought values were 1 year ago. We're going to continue to harvest the portfolio. I think, both of us intend to sell assets as they become ripe and we intend to cycle out of it over the next couple years.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then, Marc or Andrew, I mean, given the commentary on Chase Plaza and competition for assets out there, I mean if you guys continue to harvest out of your own portfolio and sell deals, where does the capital go? Do you guys expand the structured finance portfolio, given the higher yields there? Are there still deals at the margin that maybe require some redevelopment that you guys -- or still could be competitive from a capital standpoint? Can you just talk about, from a capital deployment, how you see the next sort of 6 months shaping out?","Marc Holliday","Well, I think, we're -- how you've seen the year unfold is probably a good indicator of where we would see things over the next 6 to 12 months, and that's with money going into kind of varied sources. A lot of it is headed towards redevelopment, because right now that is an enormously profitable place to be and a rising rent environment is improving your own building stock, which typically is not quite as costly as bidding for new product. And for $100 a foot or less, in many instances, we can move rental points $10 dollars a foot or thereabouts, or $7 to $10 a foot. So that -- we have an enormous pipeline of redevelopment for next year, which is very capital-intensive, including 10 East 53rd Street which, as the market gets better, I think our scope of program there continues to be upgraded towards the top-end rents. And that's an investment that we think is going to turn out really well if the market continues on its current trajectory. Then we've got 180 Maiden, which is going to take some level of repositioning and redevelopment after the AIG expiration in 2014. And we have a really exciting new plan developed by all the different group heads here, oriented towards kind of the technology and creative tenant base that we see spilling out of Midtown South, for which 180 Maiden is going to be a perfect candidate for. And the redevelopment, which wasn't envisioned that way initially, it was envisioned towards financial tenants, is now being redesigned and upgraded into something that's going to be pretty spectacular. And there are other examples of that. The Olivia, which we just purchased, we're going to be more aggressively renovating those residential units than, I think, prior ownership had done, which is a different philosophy of -- investment philosophy. And we're going to be trying to really upgrade our rents in that multiuse, mixed-use project over on 33rd and 34th Street. 280 Park will be completed next year, that still has a ways to go. You heard Matt talk about the capital that's still needed for the repositioning of 1515. And 635 Sixth, another extremely exciting and successful development where we've increased our underwritten rents and projected NOI, but we've also underwritten some additional capital to go along with that. So redevelopment is kind of right in the middle of the mix, along with some incremental increase in structured finance and new retail projects, both ones we've closed this year and ones that we have in pipeline, along with a continued interest in the commercial product type. But on that -- and you heard Andrew's comments earlier, where we're kind of in a neutral zone there to a net seller zone on commercial, until we see either greater rent increases, which would put it on par with these other avenues of investment, which are just more attractive at the moment.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa of ISI Group.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I guess, Marc, I wanted to tackle a little bit about kind of rent growth. And obviously, you're looking at a lot of transactions but not winning and haven't really bought a traditional office building in a while. And I guess I'm just curious, as you kind of look at where the bidders are winning and kind of where you guys have bid, is it a function of those investors getting much more aggressive on rent growth or just accepting a much lower IRR in your opinion?","Marc Holliday","Well, I would say that if you see us, as you call, not winning a particular deal or not pursuing a particular deal, it's because we see greater opportunity elsewhere in the areas I just covered. So it's not to say any of these deals unto themselves are bad deals or unsupportable deals. We're -- we have a limited capital base and we're looking to optimize returns. And if we see higher returns on a risk-adjusted basis at any point along the spectrum, then that's going to necessarily make our pursuit of some of those bigger office deals just a little less frothy. But with that said, I think people who are winning those deals tend to be syndicating out that equity to people who have extraordinarily high visions of what rent growth is going to be like in Manhattan. And even though we're pretty bullish on where rents are headed, there's always a group of people out there who are more bullish. And those people now have capital and we can't say they're wrong. It's one of those things where if job growth continues at 75,000 to 100,000 private sector jobs a year and office-using jobs are in the 15,000 to 20,000 to 25,000 jobs a year, then there's going to continue to be significant demand, which is going to drive up rents particularly as some of the new product that has been a bit of an overhang for the past few years gets leased up in Hudson Yards, on the far west side and down in the Trade Center zone. So we see that getting better. Every new lease is getting tighter and tighter. There's no real new supply to speak of that's going to be delivered over the next few years. The jobs are there, so we do see rents going up. It's just a question of we've -- we already control 28 million, 29 million square feet of office. And I think right now we're looking to optimize and not necessarily looking to bring in that next incremental building unless it's strategic or we have a particularly good tax advantage situation or we need a 1031, in which case, the tax efficiency might drive us to do something a bit more aggressive to shelter corporate taxes for shareholders.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So just, I guess, on the rent point. I think you had said this last year, you thought there would be cumulative 25% rent growth over kind of a 3-year period, and I assume we're kind of 1 year into the 3 year. So of that 25%, how much do you think has actually transpired?","Marc Holliday","Let's just go back in time. At around 2009 or '10, I don't recall, we -- I think it was the '09 December meeting, we said 25% over 3 years.","Unknown Executive","Later.","Marc Holliday","That was -- maybe it was '10 -- '11, '12, '13? I mean, we're way in excess of that. So if that's the question, we're we'll beyond that. In terms of additional increases, I had said earlier in the year, what are we projecting versus what the market is projecting? I said the market was kind of, on our estimation, projecting increases as high as 40%, 40% to 50% over, maybe, the next, I would call it more like 3 to 5 years, Steve. I don't if I -- I don't remember the 3-year comp. But I would say, easily, 40% to 50% over the next 3 to 5 years and we were more like 25%. But again, both are really aggressive and both drive cap rates that are going to be kind of right on top of borrowing costs, 4% or 4.5% cap rate kind of talk, and that is where the market is. It's interesting, we traded around 5 or 5 plus and the cap rates are below that and there's going to be record sales volume. I think Andrew mentioned earlier, it's like a $30 billion -- let's say record, record book for the peak in '07. So booked for '07, a $30 billion sales yield. So any notion, I think, that there's any kind of pull back in the market over interest rates or slack tenant demand or a feeling like rental growth isn't going to be very aggressive, it's just our version of aggressive or someone else's version of aggressive, it's really just we don't see that right now. We see a very, very good market and we're just trying to make the best allocations of capital.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brendan Maiorana of Wells Fargo.","Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I appreciate all the kind of leasing color on the pipeline. It sounds like it's progressing pretty well. Just was interested in kind of an update on that year-end occupancy target, which I think still implies a pretty good ramp in the fourth quarter in terms of the occupancy number. And then, secondly, kind of similar question with respect to same-store, it looks like maybe there's lower other income and higher operating expenses which are keeping the trend a little bit below that 4% target, which you guys had laid out for 2013?","Marc Holliday","Well, I mean when you say below the 4% that we're currently at...","Matthew Diliberto","We're roughly 3%. We set out a goal in our guidance of 3% to 4%. I think we set a stretch goal of north of 4%. We'll certainly be within our 3% to 4% range by the end of the year. It's the way we're working at.","Marc Holliday","Yes, I don't think -- I would -- I don't believe we're below our range on a same-store NOI. I think we're squarely in the range of 3% to 4%. We're going to try to finish at 4%, and we'll do our best. But I think, seasonally, third quarter is high. So you may be looking at third quarter OpEx numbers that are traditionally high. Or maybe you're making a relative comment, which I'll leave to Matt and Jim to address. But I think we will certainly meet our target on same-store NOI. And your other comment about occupancy, my recollection is the goal was about 96%, which was a significant same-store increase, year-over-year, and I think we're at 95.8%?","Matthew Diliberto","Yes. We're at 95.8%. So, Brendan, just I'll go back, it's Matt, to the operating expense point first. Third quarter is traditionally the highest-expense quarter of the year, was right on top of our expectations for this quarter. And when you look at operating expenses, you got to look up to the revenue -- the recovery of that expense load as well, which came through in large part in this quarter, but the deal, as it relates to taxes, does lag a little bit, so you'll see a little more of that in the fourth quarter. And as it relates to occupancy, based on the leases we have signed, we are at 95.8%. In the commenced -- based on leases that have commenced, we are at around 94.4%, 94.5% but we would expect to meet our goal of 96%, based on signed.","Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's great. That's helpful. And then, Marc, I know you don't want to give guidance in December, but I think I heard in your prepared remarks that you said you felt like the earnings momentum that you guys have shown this year, you think that momentum keeps up in next year, as well. I'm just wondering if you could kind of frame that up a little bit in terms of where the components...","Marc Holliday","Well, I can't really quantify that because then nobody would show up in December. So we're going to try to leave just something left on the bone here. But certainly, we've been flashing up on the screens at presentations and investor meetings the enormous profitability in that growth portfolio, which was acquired since 2010, which I think totaled about 18 properties, which we're now in various stages of repositioning, redevelopments and stabilizing. And that portfolio of real property, along with the structured finance portfolio and the enormous success we're having in the retail portfolio, are all converging to translate into the kind of sizable earnings increases that we have been projecting. So I think it's nothing more than we've been saying, but it feels like until people see it, it doesn't necessarily get fully credited for. And I do think, when we do get to 2014, on top of this latest earnings revision, we're going to be talking about, certainly, another healthy year next year, which is consistent with the kind of numbers we laid out there in December of last year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler from KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I wanted to touch on this -- Andrew's comments about the right mix to improve the asset allocation across the portfolio, and Marc you spoke to it as well, a little bit. Better opportunities in retail and resi, it sounds like. What do you view -- how should we think about the rent growth profile for resi versus, maybe, office?","Andrew W. Mathias","I think the reason that we like the resi assets that we purchased is that we're underwriting very modest growth there. But with capital investment into the apartments, we're able to achieve significant mark to today's market. We don't need big market rent growth to make attractive returns on the residential buildings we've purchased thus far. So that's what's attracted us to that asset class. I think Olivia is very much on that theme. I think the DFR assets that we purchased last year are very much proving that theme where we're beating our acquisition budgets pretty significantly with modest capital spends. And it's a better underwriting feeling we get from being able to sort of take today rents, grow them at, call it, 3% annually and still make compelling returns just by virtue of bringing rents to market as opposed to relying on market rent growth.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. Okay. So more of a redevelopment play opportunity, it seems, in the resi space?","Marc Holliday","Well I would call it unit upgrades. I mean it's -- these are -- there's not -- there's no...","Andrew W. Mathias","In the case of St. Luke's, it's redevelopment. That's a full redevelopment. But mostly our assets we've bought are just unit upgrades, as Marc said.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then maybe for Steve. On the office side, I mean, it sounds like you're confident in seeing good activity and feel good about the office side, generally, although it's not necessarily translating into rents, which I think I understand why. But can you maybe give us a little bit of color in terms of what you're seeing from financial service tenants? I know they're not the whole market, but I'm curious at the margin, if you're seeing any differences there? And then just talk about the small tenants and if they're still driving the market somewhat.","Steven M. Durels","Sure. The -- on the financial tenants, they're out in the market, not the big investment banks but, certainly, the commercial banks are out in the market. There was a big deal that was just signed on Park Avenue 1 week or 2 ago for 0.25 million square feet with Cap One. So there's a couple of big commercial bank requirements floating around. There seems to be still good demand from the small to medium sort of hedge fund, private-equity type tenant, and that's the kind of tenant that we're seeing over at 600 Lexington Avenue and a little bit at 810 Seventh. It's certainly the profile tenant that we expect to be the dominant tenants when we bring 10 East 53rd Street to the market. And -- what you didn't note is, as compared to last year, sort of the big tenant is back in the market. There's a lot of requirements floating out there in the 100,000 to 250,000, 300,000 square-foot type user group that wasn't as prevalent last year as there is today. And the last thing worth noting is we have, in fact, been raising our asking rents, maybe not portfolio-wide, but certainly in a good chunk of the portfolio. And maybe the best case in point, and a very good barometer of the market, is the leasing activity at the Graybar Building. Whereas 1 year, 1.5 years ago, we would have been doing deals in the $39 to $44 price point, and today, we're doing deals, starting rents, really in the $47, $48 on the low side, to many of them in the $52, $53 price point. So that's -- to Marc's earlier statement, as there's -- we've realized that increasing asking rents already and then we think there's more gas in the tank.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman from Citi.","Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","It's Josh Attie, with Michael. Can you talk about the composition of the 1.2 million square foot leasing pipeline? Given that the lease rate is already pretty high at almost 96%, maybe how much of it is a renewal of future expirations, versus new leasing on some of your growth assets?","Marc Holliday","Sure, of the 1.2 million, it's roughly -- well, the vast majority is new. So -- leases out we're seeing, is about 340,000 square feet. And that's sort of evenly distributed between new and renewal. But then, on the leases in negotiation, I would say it's -- I would just say significantly skewed towards new.","Steven M. Durels","And in that new component is a big chunk of tenants expanding.","Marc Holliday","So when I say -- new, in that context, is renewal and expansion, as opposed to a straight renewal. So we don't have it exactly as per new. But I would say to you, at least 50% represents true net new leasing and probably more.","Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And separately, when you think about residential, how large of a portion of the portfolio do you feel comfortable allocating to it if opportunities that The Olivia continue to present themselves?","Marc Holliday","I'm sorry, how much of the portfolio do we see...","Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","How much of the portfolio do you feel comfortable having allocated to residential?","Marc Holliday","Residential? Well, it's -- I don't see it -- we've been asked this question, and I think it's played out the way I've said over the past 2 years. We see this as an opportunistic investment vehicle where we, through relationships or use of OP units, can get into a residential investment that, in many cases, has a retail or commercial element with it like the Frankel deal, like The Olivia deal, those being the 2 biggest. Or the build-to-suits down at -- for Pace, where we, through our network and relationships, we were able to lock up sites and do 2 net lease build-to-suits. So I'd like to say we'd allocate a fair amount to those deals because those are extremely profitable deals, either now or in the future, after we are done doing our repositioning programs. But I think the reality is it's opportunistic and, therefore, the reality is I don't think it's going to get all that large other than maybe 1 deal or 2 a year, as it's been over the past couple of years.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Marc, just a follow-up to Josh's question. If you're at 95.8%, including the leases that are not yet commenced, and you talk very strongly about this pipeline, especially with a big amount being new and expansions, where does sort of occupancy get to by year end or early next year? Could we be pushing sort of the past peak occupancies that you had?","Marc Holliday","So the question is, on the 95.8%, which is where our same-store occupancy is on signed leases, and then we've said there's another, let's say, 1,200,000 in the pipe where we might convert about 3 quarters or so. I mean, 750,000. Where will that take occupancy for next year? Is that the question?","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Well I'm just saying -- if you -- that amount of square footage brings your portfolio pretty fully leased. And so I'm just trying to picture in my head, are -- we get to...","Marc Holliday","I got it. Two things: one, the leasing in that 1.25 million isn't all in same-store assets. So it doesn't, therefore, affect -- all of it doesn't affect 95.8%. A lot of the leasing, definitionally, or at least in some cases, non-same-store assets, where there's a lot of development or -- and\/or existing vacancy. So that's one. Two, you have to buffer the leasing pipeline with the expiration pipeline. We have leases expiring as much as we're leasing. It's not all one way. And my recollection is, for 2014, I think there's about 2 million square feet that is expiring. So we'll have to be tapping into that. And obviously, there'll be some attrition out of that portfolio offsetting these numbers. So those 2 factors: 2 million square feet of lease expiration next year, I think there's about 350,000 square feet more of lease expiration this year; plus, whatever portion of the 750,000 feet is new, as opposed to renewal, and making a differentiation between same-store and non-same-store. So the answer is, we think it will be [indiscernible]. I can't -- wait 'til December and we'll figure out how much. But I would not add 1,200,000 to 95.8%, that will give you a wrong number and too high a number.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","That's what probably -- we're just trying to figure out sort of -- because your commentary sort of points to a very healthy in the largest pipeline that you had, and we're just trying to parcel that out between how much is roll, how much is new, how much is...","Marc Holliday","We're going through our budgets right now. And if you can hang in there, 6 weeks, we'll have it all for you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb from Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","First, Bloomies is getting some good space at 919. Matt, question for you first on the ratings. Sort of curious, do you need to be long-term unsecured -- I mean, investment grade, or if you have 2 of the 3 being at the unsecured level having that investment grade, then that gets you to the cost savings and all the good stuff that you want?","Matthew Diliberto","Will certainly, I mean, our focus right now is on the 2 rating agencies, S&P and Fitch. We've spent a lot of time with them. One had a full investment grade rating on us, the other has now set a clear path to investment grade in the kind of 12- to 18-month range. We would ideally like to get all 3, but clearly, our struggle with Moody's kind of continues here. Getting 2 of the 3 is important. There is pricing benefit in it, because with 2 of the 3, you'd get into an index that's important for pricing. So I would say, our long-term goal is to ultimately have all 3 and we're still optimistic we could get somewhere with Moody's, but in the near term, Fitch was a great outcome and a testament to a lot of hard work on the balance sheet that the whole team here has done, and continue our relationship with S&P.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","So what about, Matt, the long -- there's the senior unsecured rating, where you're investment grade, and then there's the long-term rating where you're still BB plus across the 3? Do need the long-term rating to be up at investment grade as well?","Matthew Diliberto","I think you're referring to -- there are 2 ratings, there are several ratings. One is a senior secured rating and one is senior unsecured rating. And what we're focused on is the senior unsecured rating.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay, perfect. And then the second question is on the mezz portfolio, as you guys look at new opportunities, are you seeing -- with all the sort of condo construction coming, are you seeing pricing, better pricing on some of the condo activity where you're looking at paper? Or is the pricing really determined whether it's condo or office, it's really more LTV driven where the rate is really more LTV driven rather than whether it's a resi or a office product?","Matthew Diliberto","I don't think we've done any condo loans. We have no condo loans in our book right now, so all the returns you're seeing are on commercial, multi-family and retail.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of...","Marc Holliday","I think we're going to -- we'll take 1 or 2 more questions, operator. And then, unfortunately, we'll have to follow-up with others offline.","Operator","Okay, so you want another question?","Marc Holliday","Yes.","Operator","Okay, so your next question comes from the line of Ross Nussbaum of UBS.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I was hoping you could help me out with some, hopefully, simple math. I'm just looking at your earnings guidance for the year, and you had earned $3.77 in FFO in the first 9 months. So at the midpoint, it suggests the number for Q4 of $1.37. So I'm trying to understand that, relative to the clean $1.41 you earned in the third quarter x the charge, and just what are the items that are causing it to slip from Q3 to Q4?","Matthew Diliberto","We had a tough time hearing you. It's Matt. I think your question was if you look at the midpoint of our guidance for the fourth quarter, you'd say that, that is a tick down from the third? Was that the question?","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes. Basically, your guidance suggest that the FFO is going to slip in Q4 from Q3, excluding that charge.","Matthew Diliberto","Yes, I think the primary difference -- we don't view it as a tick down, necessarily, but I think the one item, or one line item that we consciously don't project forward, because it's got a lot of uncertainty, is other income. And so if you look at our traditional run rate in other income, it's roughly $5 million a quarter. This quarter, it was around $9 million. That would be about the $0.04 I think you enumerated.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, perfect. The other question that I had was on 180 Maiden Lane. And is there a sense of the capital investment that you think you're going to need to put into that asset to reposition it? And then just talk to us a little bit about the marketing plan for the asset and why will that building potentially lease up before Brookfield Place or World Trade Center or the Rail Yards, given that, that's sort of the supply that's out there?","Marc Holliday","Ross, the second piece, Steve will elaborate on. The first piece, I would say was just about finishing with our budget, so I think it would be a bit premature, other than to say a base building program is likely to be about $50 million, plus or minus. What I don't have for you offhand is whether some of that is reimbursable or not out of insurance proceeds, because we took on some damage in the storm last year. And I don't -- and so some of what we're doing, as part of the redevelopment, is also restoration, insured and covered restoration as part of Sandy. So I just don't have that number for you. Just to give you a sense of magnitude, I think as a base-building number, that number is a decent starting point. And then, obviously, leasing capital on top of that. Steve?","Steven M. Durels","And then on the marketing side, remember that this is one of the better buildings downtown. It was an institutional-quality building built for Continental Insurance. It was 1 of only 4 glass -- true glass and steel buildings downtown. The floor plates are very efficient, the views are unobstructed from the sixth floor and above. And we're inheriting an amenities package from AIG that we're capitalizing on as part of the leasing program, which include a health club, a cafeteria, an auditorium space. So the package of -- and all of those are being renovated as part of our marketing program. So the package of amenities that tenants are receiving, I think, with the quality of the building and the infrastructure that Goldman Sachs had previously updated in the building, leaves us with a very, very strong product. And on a pricing point, if you sort of think of the Trade Center as kind of a $70-plus kind of product and Brookfield in the kind of very high-5s to low-6s kind of price points and we're in the sort of mid-4s to $50 price point. And so I think we've got a -- the right product and a price-competitive product.","Marc Holliday","I think we're going to take one last question and wind up the call. So, operator, this is -- we'll take one more.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Marc Holliday","Jamie, are you still with us?","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Can you, guys, talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the suburbs?","Marc Holliday","Sure.","Isaac Zion","The activity in the suburbs so far has been pretty solid, actually. Year-to-date, we've leased close to 750,000 square feet. For the entire year, last year, we leased 650,000 square feet. The activity in Westchester is slightly better than Stamford. Historically, these are small tenant markets, but we've seen some activity. We signed a 67,000 square foot lease, a 30,000 square foot lease and a 25,000 square foot lease, all in the last month or so. And we've got a pretty good pipeline throughout the end of the year. I anticipate we'll probably be at about 850,000 square feet by the end of the year. And our occupancy started the year at around 80%, I think it will be closer to 81.5% to 82% by the end of the year. So while it's not the city, it's not close, things are definitely positive on a relative basis.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then just any thoughts on harvesting some of those assets? Or just how long do you plan to hold?","Andrew W. Mathias","We sold one, Jamie. We sold a building in Stamford last quarter. It's still not much of a capital market out there, so there's not a lot of transactions changing hands. And I would say, we're -- if we see a bid we like, we definitely -- we're happy to sell assets out there. But as of now, Isaac and his team out there, are doing a great job blocking and tackling, and keeping the occupancy as high as possible. So we're going to keep managing and keep running them and keep clipping cash flow until the investment sales market improve out there.","Marc Holliday","Thank you, everyone, and we look forward to speaking with you, all, in December.","Operator","Thank you very much. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day."],"19651":["SL Green Realty Corporation (NYSE:SLG) Q1 2018 Results Earnings Conference Call April 19, 2018  2:00 PM ET","Executives","Marc Holliday - CEO and Director","Edward Piccinich - COO","Matthew DiLiberto - CFO","Andrew Mathias - President and Director","Steven Durels - EVP and Director of Leasing & Real Property","David Schonbraun - Co-Chief Investment Officer","John Levy - Independent Director","Analysts","Emmanuel Korchman - Citi","John Kim - BMO Capital Markets","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill","Nick Yulico - UBS","Jamie Feldman - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Anthony Paolone - JPMorgan","John Guinee - Stifel","Michael Lewis - SunTrust","Vikram Malhotra - Morgan Stanley","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank","Steve Sakwa - Evercore ISI","Jed Reagan - Green Street Advisors","Operator","Thank you, everybody, for joining us and welcome to SL Green Realty Corp's First Quarter 2018 Earnings Results Conference Call. This conference call is being recorded.","At this time, the company would like to remind listeners that during the call, management may make forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ from the forward-looking statements that management may make today. Additional information regarding the factors that could cause such differences appear in the MD&A section of the company's Form 10-K and other reports filed by the company with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Also, during today's conference call the company may discuss non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC Regulation G. The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to each non-GAAP financial measure discussed and the reconciliation of the differences between each non-GAAP financial measure and the comparable GAAP financial measure can be found on the company's website at www.slgreen.com by selecting the press release regarding the company's first quarter 2018 earnings.","Before turning the call over to Marc Holliday, Chief Executive Officer of SL Green Realty Corp, I ask those of you participating in the Q&A portion of the call please limit your questions to two per person. Thank you.","I will now turn the call over to Marc Holliday. Please go ahead, Marc.","Marc Holliday","Okay. Thank you, everyone, for joining us for SL Green's first quarter 2018 earnings call.","As I believe was evident from our reported results last night, we are off to a very good start to the year. In many respects, our results were right in line with our expectations and guidance but I think that the term in line belies the extraordinary requisite focus and effort necessary to produce these results.","47 leases signed in New York City in the suburbs covering more than 530,000 square feet of rentable office space, 9 separate and discreet property sales and door closings that we executed in the quarter exceeding $1.5 billion of gross asset value, $225 million of new debt and preferred equity investments originated or acquired during the quarter at a retained yield of 8.6%, substantial construction and leasing progress of One Vanderbilt, and a continuation of our share repurchase program totaling an additional 3.9 million shares acquired year-to-date. That's not a bad three months.","But as you know, these kinds of results are not uncommon for SL Green and you should certainly expect to see more of the same throughout the remainder of the year as we continue to execute our strategy centered around creating value through strategic repositioning and leasing of our extensive New York City portfolio and then monetizing gains in a tax efficient manner for reinvestments into acquisitions or development pipeline and of course, our considerably underpriced stock.","And further, we do all of this while attempting to maximize earnings, occupancy and liquidity, while we also keeping reliabilities predominantly fixed, long term, and within prudent levels. The strategy is pretty easy to articulate. However, the execution is akin to solving a Rubik's Cube quite difficult but there are solutions and strategies to get us to our goals.","And the good news is that this market environment generally continues to be a favorable one for enabling us to carry out our strategy. The local New York City economy keeps producing record office using jobs with growth revised up to 28.000 new office-using jobs in 2017 and projected to be another 20000 jobs higher in 2018.","Wall Street profits were $24.5 billion last year up 42%from 2016. And the big five banks have already reported that their first quarter 2018 earnings were up 18.5% year-over-year. These are just some of the positive economic forces that are underlying an all-time low unemployment rate in New York City of 4.2% and which are also causing wages to rise based on compensation data from the city showing that comp is up in many sectors of the city.","As a result, the vacancy levels actually decreased slightly in the first quarter for Midtown and Midtown South as 1 million square feet of space were net absorbed on over 6.2 million square feet of leasing activity in those markets, meaning new leasing activity outpace space returns and new additions to inventory in the first quarter.","This level of activity is consistent with what we are experiencing in our own portfolio, as we have leased approximately 415,000 square feet of space year-to-date, and our leasing pipeline stands at over 1.3 million square feet. The majority of which is represented by leases out for signature or in negotiation.","This volume of leasing is very encouraging for this time of year and the mark-to-market on these pipeline leases are within our guidance range. The New York City investment sales market is also showing signs of strength with over $12 billion of transactions in only the first quarter of the year.","For those of you that listened in to our December Investor conference, this sharp increase in activity should come as no surprise. As we emphasized an upturn in the sales market that we saw developing in the fourth quarter that we projected would carry over into 2018 and it has.","Pricing has remained relatively stable for high-quality, well-located office assets and the expectation is for this trend to continue in the near-term is there is an abundance of domestic and foreign equity capital with acquisition objectives for 2018.","The acquisitions are happening across the entire spectrum of product and submarkets with a complete diversity of buyers other than many other REITs who continue to sit on the acquisition sidelines other than a limited number like ourselves in a couple of others.","As long as this market exists, we will continue to be active participants both as a buyer and a seller, focusing on the net proceeds generated there from to fund all of our redeployment opportunities on a leverage neutral basis.","Some of those reinvestment dollars are obviously being directed towards our transformational, iconic One Vanderbilt development project which continues to rise up from the ground having now reached the 14th floor of steel. The project is ahead of schedule, under budget, and continue to generate strong leasing interest that we are confident will enable us to meet or exceed our leasing goal for the year which was said at around 37%.","We were obviously extremely pleased by JPMorgan\u2019s recent announcement to develop a 2.5-million-square-foot global headquarters building in East Midtown just blocks up the road from One Vanderbilt. We are proud to have helped pave the way for this important new development by taking a leadership role on the passage of Vanderbilt Corridor and East Midtown rezonings, and we look forward to more announcements like this in the East Midtown market over the years as the positive effects of these new developments present tenants, not only within ability to locate in the best and most desirable submarket in New York City, but also wanting which we\u2019ll be able to deliver new construction.","So, with that summary, I would like to open it up for questions and we\u2019ll take them hopefully as they come. And look forward to the first one.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Emmanuel Korchman with Citi. Your line is now open.","Emmanuel Korchman","Marc, you spent some time talking about the buyback program and opportunities to sell assets. As we get closer to serve your allotted goal of $1.5 billion, how do you think about that program? Are you thinking about re-upping the program and then sort of as we think about what you got left to sell, do capital gains taxes and sort of other limiters start to play in as well as leverage, when you think about buying back more stock?","Marc Holliday","Well, maybe, I think the way I would respond to that, and we\u2019ve talked about this a bit in the past, as long as these dynamics continue, which is a very high and robust - a solid and robust market for asset sales which we have right now, good pricing on a cap rate per foot IR basis, and this kind of enormous dislocation of stock price to underlying stock value, then yes, I think we would look to continue the program certainly to fill out our allotment of $1.5 billion and then going beyond is a topic we\u2019ll be discussing with the board probably in the next few months towards an additional allocation assuming all of those dynamics stay the same.","The second part of your question which relates to the ability to execute that program via continuation of sales, and the answer there is yes. We have formulated strategies beyond the $1.5 billion in 2018 and 2019. And the ability is certainly there to go beyond in ways that would be very efficient for the company, earnings efficient, tax efficient and also obviously taking advantage of a big discount in the stock price. So, that's the way we think about it currently and with these current market dynamics, we'll continue.","Emmanuel Korchman","?And then a second one for me. Another REIT recently disclosed that one of their large projects ran into some cost overrun issues with one of their contractors. And in the past you spoke about GMP contracts protecting you, but in this case, it sounds like that might not be the case for this other developer. How do you think about sort of those contracts and a project the scale of One Vanderbilt and exposure for SLP?","Marc Holliday","Well, I'm happy to report Ed Piccinich has joined us today for the call. You all know Ed. Ed is spearheading and overseeing the construction of One Vanderbilt and I think he's best to address the issue of risk and cost containment on the project.","Edward Piccinich","So, I think some of the information that you see flowing today with respect to LF Driscoll versus who we used Tishman, I think we're comparing apples to oranges.","We have one of the premier contractors. I think I would go as far as saying the best on the planet alongside with our developer. Tishman has built 90% of New York City\u2019s super tall structures; whereas LF Driscoll, the last time I looked, they have done one in Philadelphia. They\u2019re maybe on their second.","So, I think when you look at our projects as a whole, there is enough sharpshooters on this project with respect to every aspect of the business. We have 94% of the trade that\u2019s been awarded. It\u2019s below budget, as Marc mentioned early on in his commentary. The steel package which was a major purchased item is completed, 90% fabricated. I don\u2019t know all the details on the LF Driscoll but like I said Tishman has done every premiere building that you can think of here in New York City.","So we feel very comfortable that we have all these major packages bought out and in addition to that Tishman also has a subguard policy in place covering anything below $30 million where we as owner for the major trades are bonded and as the obligee have direct rights to the assurity.","So, I'm happy to reinforce what Marc mentioned early on in his commentary that we're in good shape and we continue to remain very optimistic and confident that we're not going to hit any of those type of speed bumps.","Emmanuel Korchman","Could I ask a quick follow up? Just, can you comment just quickly on what's happening with construction costs in your city more generally?","Marc Holliday","More generally, I'd say they're up no more or less than we've been seeing traditionally over the past few years. It's obviously doesn't affect One Vanderbilt because as Ed just said the project has bought. But as it relates to interiors and other work we do, the labor rates are subject to binding arbitration, and they have their increases in them and but short of that, I would say we see construction cost levels rising consistent with levels they have in previous years.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","John Kim","It looks like you already have exceeded your 2018 goal of selling $600 million of assets. And I'm wondering if you have an updated figure as far as dispositions for the year.","Marc Holliday","We may have one on the next call. Right now, we don\u2019t. I would simply say that we expect to exceed those amounts with some transactions, hopefully transactions between now and the end of June. And I think at that point we\u2019ll have better visibility to give you a better update on what that number is. But suffice it to say, we expect to go beyond the $600 million.","John Kim","And can you just comment generally on the increased sales activity in Manhattan year-to-date? Is it sellers more willing to lower the price to meet the market or buyers looking to acquire while rates still remain relatively low? Can you just provide some commentary in why the pickup in the volume?","Andrew Mathias","It\u2019s Andrew. I think we\u2019ve seen pricing has not eroded really much at all. We\u2019ve just seen an enormous influx of capital both foreign and domestic which I think we foreshadowed, as Marc said, in December. So the Chinese capital took a step back and it took six months or so for the market to gather itself. But I think what we started to see happening in Q4 and saw it really happened full throttle in Q1 was alternative sources of capital step in and filled the void that was left by Chinese capital taking a step back.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Jordan Sadler","It\u2019s Jordan Sadler with Craig. You wanted to touch based on the activity at One Vanderbilt. Last call, I think you talked about trading proposals with four tenants and I was curious if we could get an update there.","Steven Durels","So, it\u2019s Steve. So, we\u2019re tremendously activity. We\u2019re trading proposals with seven different tenants for sizes that range between one to four floors each. We\u2019re in advanced discussions with a couple of them. And by comparison to a year ago, we are extraordinarily busy and getting a very, very strong reception from both the brokerage and the tenant community.","And as the building comes out of the ground, people start to realize how in fact it\u2019s changing the neighborhood and they can start to imagine themselves in the space. It\u2019s really brought an increased enthusiasm for the building.","Jordan Sadler","And maybe coupled with that, I'm curious about the mix of tenancy that you\u2019re there. But, just maybe more broadly, Steve, what are we seeing in the marketplace? I think there had been some optimism and we had some play last year and early in this year regarding financial services, maybe coming back and be a bit stronger obviously. But, what are you seeing so far this year and for the rest of the year\u2026","Steven Durels","Well, with One Vanderbilt in particular, we\u2019re seeing - the tenants that we would have expected, so financial services, a little bit of legal as evidenced by the recent signing of agreement with [indiscernible] but heavily weighted towards financial services.","But, when you look across the market more broadly, there's a pretty broad range of industries that are out there. Grand Central Terminal, Midtown, in particular, versus a year ago is extremely active. Leasing in Midtown is up 25% over this time last year, whereas a lot of the leasing last year was done over Hudson Yards and Manhattan West.","All of the activity has shifted back into the core of Midtown. Grand Central, in particular, is extremely busy, one of the strongest quarters in the last four years, and the tenant mix if you look about of what we've signed which has been a lot of legal, financial and professional services businesses.","Legal, in particular, and financials are really leading the way. It\u2019s a very good reflection of the overall market. The tenants that are in the market or leases that were signed, year-to-date, have been 37% finance and 25% legal. So, there's a lot of strong demand particularly set back in the Midtown market.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is now open.","Alexander Goldfarb","Maybe, Steve, just continue with One Vanderbilt. Can you just comment on Jamie's decision over to rebuild 270 Park, has that brought a lot more interest of people to look at One Vanderbilt? Or in your view with the fact that steel is coming out of the ground has been the main draw and that tenants aren't really thinking about the impact of JPMorgan rebuilding next door?","Steven Durels","I think the decision by JPMorgan is a huge compliment to One Vanderbilt. It's a huge endorsement of Midtown Grand Central in particular. I think that just the visual side of those two buildings next to one another changes the whole dynamic in people\u2019s mood and enthusiasm for the grand central market. And I can tell you the commentary for both tenants looking at One Vanderbilt, and broader looking at the Midtown market is nothing but a big applause.","Alexander Goldfarb","And then the second question is on the DPE book. With all the commentary on flattening yield curve. How does the flattening yield curve affect your guys ability on the DPE book? If you could just comment.","Marc Holliday","Well, parts through them a couple of pieces. As floating rates have increased, albeit percentage-wise a lot, but whole index not that much. I think it\u2019s around 2% in the LIBOR. Floating rates still continues to be a very attractive option for the kind of transitional borrower base that we have, and it still competes sort of on-target with fixed rates with all-in rates may be close to - on a mortgage basis in the fourths. 4.5%, whether it\u2019s floating or fixed, right?","But the issue isn\u2019t always just rate. I would say the vast majority of what we do, maybe 80%, 85%, 90% of what we do are transitional projects which is big-value creation being taken place in years one to three, construction, lease up, redevelopment, repositioning, assemblage, bridge loans.","So very few of those kinds of borrowers will want to encumber those projects with long-term fixed rates debt. Even as the floating rate equivalent becomes somewhat on par with the fixed rate. And David Schonbraun, if you could speak to that as well?","I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen a migration towards fixed as the yield curve is flattened, in fact I think our origination pipeline and origination to date has been kind of on par with prior years. There's an intentional effort as you know to bring down those balances somewhat as we're bringing down the balance sheet if you will through the share repurchase program.","And as we're orienting more money into the share repurchases, unfortunately, we have such good earnings momentum that we are able to do just that and you do it while maintaining our FFO outlook. So, David, any additional thoughts on that?","David Schonbraun","Yes, I think to take advantage of the fixed rate market, you have to really have product that\u2019s well leased and put away where a lot of the loans we're doing are more transitional. So the yield curve is a little less impactful.","If anything rising LIBOR enables us to get a little more yield and kind of keep yield as spreads compressed a little bit. But in terms of people going fixed versus floating, that decision is really still being made based on kind of what's going on with the asset level in terms of income stability and kind of lease duration.","Alexander Goldfarb","So you're widening your spread?","Marc Holliday","Widening spread, widening spread on LIBOR? No, the extra yield kick up for us comes if we're using existing liquidity to fund LIBOR-based loans that have a higher LIBOR. That's definitionally more profitable for us but that doesn't necessarily mean widening spread. I think what you saw is at least on an all-in rate basis we're still right around that 9% which is a very, very strong for this market, this environment and this still very low historical levels of interest rates.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Nick Yulico with UBS. Your line is now open.","Nick Yulico","Steve, just going back to the New York market, how much of the demand when you\u2019re talking to the tenants is actually lease expiration driven versus firms looking to expand?","Marc Holliday","Well, I don't know that I can really answer that. I can tell you that of the leases that we've signed year-to-date and is that a good 30% of those had a growth component to them. So, our portfolio as a barometer and the leasing that we've done to date, we've had a very good first quarter. That's probably a good indicator that there's a lot of growth out in the marketplace. When you say that 30% of the square footage that we've leased to-date had a growth component from the tenants leasing versus what they were leaving behind.","Nick Yulico","And I guess just one other question on a big picture standpoint right if you think about the development you're doing if you think about the midtown upselling potential of other sites. I mean doesn't this make the market more expensive from a rental standpoint? And how does that play out over the long run? Is that sustainable?","Marc Holliday","This prospect of new development raises the rents. Is that what you're asking?","Nick Yulico","Any idea that if you have more firms pull at JPMorgan, right and build bigger, right, and you have bigger projects, more expensive projects in Midtown. Ultimately, it means its higher rents. Is that \u2013 understanding you need to modernize the stock in New York City, but is that sustainable from a cost standpoint?","Marc Holliday","I think the duration over which that might happen is so long as to be non-consequential to us right now. This is a 240 million square foot Midtown market. So, any new development on the order of a couple of million feet. Remember, this is between us and the JPMorgan building. Let's call it 4 million feet or so of new space being delivered over the next five to six years.","This is what I've tried to express in other forums, this concept of just how vast and deep this inventory is in New York City and Midtown in particular, 240 million feet. And how the new development that gets so much of the attention and focus - when you annualize the new inventory over the period of years to deliver it, it winds up being much less than even 1% of the inventory per annum. The last stat I think I showed in December was close to 67 basis points per annum.","Now, in that time, some projects will have delivered, and the new ones will have come on five years from now. So, I think that number is still roughly accurately. But it's a drop in the ocean.","So in terms of the affordable rent market which is really our market here in, not just Grand Central, but in New York City, and we own 28 million square feet, that affordable rent market is where we play. And I don\u2019t think the marginal projects that you're seeing are going to dramatically affect those rents.","I mean, yes, there will be a tightening as the attraction of a particular submarket increases, but I think that is much about us redeveloping projects and bringing our buildings up to Class A-plus standards whether or not it's not a new development to drive rents up $10, $15 a foot which is what we do routinely. But I can't say that any one or two developments in Midtown will greatly influence that rental metric.","David Schonbraun","I will add to it though is that with new construction comes an enthusiasm by other owners to renovate their buildings and that\u2019s what help keeps our midtown market and overall market very healthy and what was the core of the eastside rezone and why we need it to happen.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","James Feldman","I was hoping you could talk about the trend in concessions and free rent. Just I know you provide in the supplemental commenced leases but you record an AFFO for the quarter is current, so maybe just talk about is it consistent with maybe what's recorded in that commence leases and what's the trend overall right now?","Marc Holliday","Well, look, as we\u2019ve said in the prior call, there's no doubt that concessions on the TI side, less in the free rent but on the TI side, over the past couple of years have risen. Our average for leases that were signed in the first quarter were up higher than typical. But in reality, that was skewed by three individual leases.","Of the 28 leases that we signed, if we pulled those 3 leases out, our average TI would have been less than $42 a square foot and our free rent would have been less than three and a half months of free rent.","So there's - I think it's important that when we talk about TI across the portfolio, it gets skewed depending on how many deals we do where it\u2019s raw space versus new deals and renewal deals and versus spaces where we're retrofitting. And that's where in any one particular moment in time, you see the numbers kind of move about.","Broadly speaking, TI, I think for the past six or nine months I think generally has flattened out in the market for new building \u2013 or I'm sorry, new space on raw deals, and free rent I think has been sort of flat line for the past 12 months.","James Feldman","And any latest thoughts on the observatory plans at One Vanderbilt?","Marc Holliday","There's a - we\u2019ve got a lot under design development right now. A lot of exciting things that I think will probably be in a better position to roll out towards the end of this year, maybe in our December Investor Conference, you\u2019ll never know.","But, the answer is very excited putting together a team to make it not just a visual experience but sort of a complete experience by integrating technology and content, and food and viewing and social media and everything to make it something very special.","So, it\u2019s getting a lot of attention. We've got a very good team working on that, maybe we'll be able to introduce later on this year. And we have or now beginning - now that we've completed the physical envelope of what that space will look like, beginning the actual interior design of the observatory, and we'll have some great images to share with you soon. But I'd say just a touch premature at the moment.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Paolone with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Anthony Paolone","Maybe for Steve Durels, can you talk about what you're seeing either in the market or across your desk in terms of co-working as a percentage of the demand and how you\u2019re thinking about that world right now?","Steven Durels","We get inquiries with co-working businesses all the time. It\u2019s clearly an expanding footprint in the market. Everybody\u2019s got sort of the watches the WeWork, but there\u2019s a lot of other businesses out there than that same industry type. And we really don't have a lot of exposure to the industry within our portfolio. We've done some deals with WeWork and with others over the years, but none of the deals that are in our pipeline are co-working business.","Anthony Paolone","And then second question, you talked about just strength in the private market for deals and starting the year off pretty strong. I guess we're going to see 245 maybe trade and it traded last year. Any sense as to whether you think that's up, down, or sideways versus the pricing a year ago as an indicator of the market?","Marc Holliday","Well, I think we can't really comment that deals in the market and we\u2019re also a lender here. So I don't think we should be opining on value. I would say that I think \u2013 as I stated back at the time, I think 245 is a very good asset. It's an asset we went hard to acquire at that point in time.","And then we subsequently made a sizable investment in the capital stack which we think has worked out quite well. It's obviously just a beneficiary by everything that Steve just talked about and what's going on over in east midtown and being directly - diagonally across from the new JPM headquarters.","I think that entire stretch of park, which includes our building at 280, JPMorgan's new building, and 245 and others with Levinson and Lapidus we\u2019re doing at 425 Park, I mean, it's just \u2013 it's solidifying great value in that area, and the rents we achieved affordability in that market are well into the triple digits. So I would think the values generally year-over-year for product like that is fairly stable.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Guinee with Stifel. Your line is now open.","John Guinee","Just a few really quick questions for very quick answers. First, Marc, promise me that JPMorgan is not putting an observatory at the top of their building. Second\u2026","Marc Holliday","That would be the irony of ironies, but I doubt they will.","John Guinee","Second, some uninspiring suburban office sale numbers. They are what they are but they are under $100 a foot. If Stamford - the Landmark Square deal is to sell this year, is it going to be that same sort of number or will it be a multiple of $100 a foot?","And then three for Steve, just a - and if you\u2019ve answered this question, I just sort of missed it. Just very quick numbers. If you take \u2013 comparing Hudson Yards, 399 Park, One Vanderbilt and you say turnkey TI package or whatever the package is, similar floor level, what\u2019s the rent differential? Is One Vande $20 more or $50 more than Hudson Yards? And is One Vande $30 more or $40 more than 399 Park?","John Levy","On the suburban side, with respect to Stamford, those are downtown assets. So we sold Stamford Towers last year, it was close to $300 a foot. The rents are higher, the buildings are better. The vacancy is significantly less. So I do expect it to be significantly higher than what we\u2019re able to achieve in Rye Brook and in Valhalla.","Matthew DiLiberto","And then with regards to your leasing question, it's a little bit of an apples and oranges scenario that you\u2019ve posed because there's a dynamic in the market where new construction on TI actually doesn't carry as much in the concession package as does older generation buildings like a 399 Park Avenue.","So, I would guess that that TI and 399 Park are $100-plus TIs. In new construction, Hudson Yards and One Vanderbilt, typically, we've been closer to anywhere in the $85 to $90 price range of TIs. And then on a rent basis, Hudson Yards, the latest generation of leasing over there has all been triple digit and what's left to lease whether it's at the spiral or the balance of what's available at 55 Hudson Yards are all going to be $100, $105, $120 and the rents have gone up to $130 of square foot depending on which building and where it is in the cycle.","So, if you compare that against, say, One Vanderbilt, it really - I'd really have to answer the question about where you are in the building, at the bottom of the building, at the top of the building, are you the first entity or the last?","But also wildly different product. One Vanderbilt is a high-quality, best-of-class location, best-of-class infrastructure, and you get a lot more for your money.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lewis with SunTrust. Your line is now open.","Michael Lewis","At the bottom of Page 32 in the supplemental, you give the cost breakdown for One Vanderbilt and I think everybody on the call knows a lot about the rent expectations and returns and so forth. At the top of that page, there's several development and redevelopment projects listed. Maybe some of these are overlapped with the growth portfolio you laid out in December. But I'm just curious if you could comment on the cost maybe to those projects, the return, kind of the potential NOI that's kind of lying dormant there that maybe you're not getting credit for in the stock price?","Marc Holliday","Well, what do we have on the page, Matt?","Matthew DiLiberto","So there's a bunch of stuff up there. We've talked about the most material development projects that are happening much smaller in scale than One Vanderbilt that sit up there. And obviously as these progress forward, we'll provide more detail, if we haven't done so already, because we're not in a position to at this point.","57 Day which is 185 Broadway, that's a big project downtown that we're working through, and 609 Fifth has now gone into that portfolio because we've vacated the property and that's slated for redevelopment. The other stuff in there largely development has been completed, and it\u2019s just in lease up at which point it comes out or a small like Tower 46 in 719 7th. Those are coming out.","There is nothing other than those two projects I just outlined that are really of a material nature in there and we\u2019ll come out with more detail on costs and returns and things like that when the time is appropriate.","Michael Lewis","A question I get a lot that want to pose to you guys, you're obviously buying back a lot of shares and you see value at a big discount to NAV. The question that I get is then about the insider interest in the stock. And obviously, Andrew owns a lot and then after that maybe not quite as much. And so you obviously have the high confidence to go out and repurchase the shares.","I was just wondering if you could comment at all on kind of \u2013 I guess maybe it's a personal question \u2013 your own kind of personal interest in the stock at these levels?","Marc Holliday","I could answer that. Andrew spends less money than I do widely, I think widely as the massive stockholder in terms of\u2026","Andrew Mathias","I'm a believer in the NAV.","Marc Holliday","I think we're - how about this, if you take your top two or three holders, I would hazard to say that it comprises anywhere at least for me and Andrew between 80% to 90% of our entire net worth in that range.","So I'd say that's real belief. I don't think we have any other institutional shareholders who put 80% or 90% of their fund holdings in our stock, although I wish they would and I would encourage them to. But we are all completely wed to the stock.","Our compensation these days is pretty much paid almost entirely in equity with vesting periods and no sale periods and all the things that have created strong alignment. We actually held their stock even before those requirements, so it's not that those requirements are absolutely necessary the way we look at things.","We love holding this currency. We take as I said almost all of our compensation in that currency. And it's quite a meaningful part of our net worth. So creating value in the stock as we do, not just in the repurchasing but also in developing acquisition, everything else we do is felt throughout this company.","People have options, people have stock, people have performance plans, incentives and for 17 out of 20 years roughly, that's been a great incentive and form of wealth creation and we are going to do everything possible to get it back in line with that prior performance for the benefit of all of us and therefore, all of our shareholders.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Vikram Malhotra","Matt, could you maybe give us a sense of the trajectory of same-store NOI growth relative to your midpoint of 6.5% where 1Q came in? It would suggest accelerating trajectory, but anything we should be aware of in any of the next three quarters?","Matthew DiLiberto","The expectations were to accelerate through the year because occupancy picks up throughout the course of the year. And if you look back at last year, obviously the first half of the year is a good benchmark to grow off of because we\u2019re starting to run into clearly second quarter. Big vacancies at 1552 and 45 in 2020 where tenants were rolling out those spaces or leased or being leased back up.","And so over the balance of the year, same store NOI picks up pretty significantly and that's why our goal was 6% to 7%.","Vikram Malhotra","And just two specific street retail questions, any update on 719 in terms of getting a tenant? And then, there have been some reports on McDonald\u2019s and Times Square relocating or possibly relocating, any thoughts there?","Matthew DiLiberto","The first part of the question, 719 no update there, continued lots of tours, lots of tenants kicking tires. There's been activity in Times Square, but no updates to share on the call. The second part of the question was?","Vikram Malhotra","On 1552 McDonald\u2019s?","Matthew DiLiberto","McDonald's we have a lease term left there with them. We've been working to get them relocated from the property to unlock a lot of space around it and that the lease that you saw announced was sort of a culmination of a four- to five-year effort to get them to relocate and free up some space at 1552. So, that\u2019s a very positive development for that asset.","Vikram Malhotra","And how much term is this?","Matthew DiLiberto","We have left - we probably have five to six years left with them.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Vincent Chao","I think most of my question has been answered, but just maybe a quick one on the investment markets, the pickup here in the first quarter. Past couple of calls, you've talked about sort of the ownership structure and how that's a limiting factor in the volumes. Just curious if the increase in activity here in the quarter, do you think that gets more sellers into the market and that sustains this volume pickup, or could this be sort of a catch-up for a couple of months of limited activity?","Marc Holliday","We see consistent activity out there right now through the second quarter. There's a lot - we've announced a lot of activity in the last couple of weeks, and there's a lot of other deals in the market that are getting significant interest. So, I wouldn't expect to see any tail-off in activity in the second quarter in terms of visibility the second half of the year. We'll have more on that, I would say, in the next quarterly call","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Steve Sakwa","I guess I just was hoping Steve could give a little bit more color on the 1.3 million square foot pipeline. How much of that is sort of new deals? How much of that is just kind of renewals of 2018 and maybe pull-forward of 2019 and 2020 renewals?","Steven Durels","Well, of the leases that are out, there's 31 separate transactions and then the balance of it which is pure term sheet which we think is a high probability of converting to leases, that's 25 different transactions. The majority of the deals are either filling vacancy or current near-term renewals. There's one or two deals that are sort of much more long dated early renewals but not a big part of the pipeline right now.","Steve Sakwa","And then I guess maybe on the DPE book, I'm just curious if Marc or Andrew could just maybe touch on kind of what you're seeing today in the marketplace kind of the risk reward profile of deals today that are coming through kind of the buy and how do you sort of feel about the activity level that's crossing your desk?","Marc Holliday","I\u2019ll have David answer the question just because he's here.","David Schonbraun","I think the markets continue to be very competitive. I'm not sure the risk profile has gone up a lot, I think spreads have compressed so I think we're just having to be much better with structuring and syndicating and using kind of our repo facilities to get the yields that we want.","But I don't think kind of the transactions in the market have changed that much per se. So I don't think there's a lot more risk. It's just there's a lot more capital that we're having to work a little harder to get the deal done at the yields that we want them as spreads compress.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jed Reagan with Green Street Advisors. Your line is now open.","Jed Reagan","Just thinking about the next chapters of Midtown East rezoning, are there specific SL Green assets that you're studying as good candidates for a potential rezoning and redevelopment and I guess just generally how hopeful are you guys of taking advantage of that rezoning again in the near future?","Matthew DiLiberto","Well, we're 96% occupied. So, one of the challenges is our properties are well leased. So, it's a good and bad thing. We definitely own a lot of properties obviously in the areas that were identified, but I would say none of them are sort of near-term candidates for demolition and rebuild.","So, One Vanderbilt is our focus now and I think over the long term, it could definitely - as rents continue to appreciate in the city, there could definitely be more opportunities within the midtown portfolio. But right now, it would be hard to identify to you a specific candidates sort of that's actionable in the next three to five years.","Jed Reagan","And then there's been articles floating around suggesting a pullback in EB-5 funding availability from Chinese investors. Does that line up with what you're seeing on the ground and could that have an impact on the goal of getting over $200 million and EB-5 funding for One Vanderbilt this year?","Matthew DiLiberto","We're not on the ground per se, so I can't give you that color. I mean we hear what I think a lot of people are hearing which is - that given the constraint on the capacity that probably 10,000 leases a year, so it's very small. And it's created some significant backlog in the highest-producing countries like China and elsewhere where the backlog can be 10 years plus.","So that the ability to raise large amounts to $250 million plus becomes more challenge and lengthy. And for us, we have a fully capitalized deal, so it was a way of improving the returns, really, or improving the IRR. And we're still looking at that.","But in addition to EB-5 which maybe would become a smaller component of the raise, we're also looking at other kind of interesting longer term financing strategies that can get us some incremental proceeds at very low cost which like EB-5 but not EB-5, and that's something that Rob Schiffer and others are working on pretty intensively.","So, I would look at the capital raise effort not specific to EB-5 as we laid out in December but more generically capital raising efforts that we're going to be working on and hopefully be able to come up with something that is accretive and is additive to our cost to capital as well as our partner by year-end.","Operator","I'm showing no further questions in queue at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to Mr. Holiday for any closing remarks.","Marc Holliday","Okay. Really nothing further. It was a great quarter. We look forward to speaking with everyone in three months. And I think we'll have hopefully some more good news to report like we just did.

Thank you.","I will now turn the call over to Marc Holliday. Please go ahead, Marc.","Marc Holliday","Okay, thank you and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to have the opportunity to give all of you our perspective on the state of the market now that we are nearly four months into the New Year. And I can sum up our excitement for SLG\u2019s year-to-date performance in essentially two words: leasing, velocity. As of today, we have concluded over 900,000 square feet of commercial leasing in over 60 individual lease transactions. Most notable among these by size are the leases to Bloomberg at 919 Third Avenue; Franklin Templeton, a new advisory at 280 Park Avenue; and WeWork at 315 West 36 Street, a balance of financial, media and technology uses. It seems likely that having completed this amount of transactions in less than 4 months, we are on track to exceed our full year leasing projections.","The Manhattan office and retail leasing teams are taking full advantage of vacancies in the growth portfolio and rolling up markets \u2013 rolling up Winston market in the stabilized portfolio and also by taking advantage of our deeply embedded mark-to-market in our retail portfolio. And by doing this, it should allow us to meet or exceed this year\u2019s goals while laying the foundation for a strong future growth in 2016 and beyond when these newly signed leases generally will kick in. Clearly, this market is benefiting from overall Midtown vacancy rates of under 9.5% on leasing activity that is on pace for between 35 million and 40 million square feet of new and renewal leasing this year.","From an employment perspective, the first quarter of 2015 was the strongest quarter since the year 2000. New York City added 16,400 office using jobs and the distribution of jobs among the three primary office using sectors: professional and business services; financial activities; and information were about equal. Usually, professional and business services accounts for most of the increase in office using jobs of late, but you could see now that\u2019s equally distributed between the three main office using sectors.","The good news for our shareholders is that the leasing pipeline also remains robust even after coming out of the gate strong in 2015. We now have over 500,000 square feet of lease documents that are either out for signature or are pending and being negotiated. That compares with about 575,000 square feet at the same time last quarter and to the fourth quarter. And you see how we were able to convert these opportunities into signed lease transactions and then some. These leasing achievements helped to drive a 3% same-store NOI increase in the first quarter that was actually ahead of our budget and is expected to be exceeded for the balance of the year, such that we feel on track to meet our goal of between 3.5% and 4% for the full year.","On the investments front, we were active closing out year end deals, like the additional ownership interest that were acquired in 800 Third Avenue and the closing of the Stonehenge residential portfolio, along with a successful disposition of 180 Maiden Lane and the net new origination of about $145 million of structured finance investments. This net investment activity, along with the un-encumbering of 711 Third Avenue enabled us to access the ATM and DRIP for modest amounts of equity, issuances that were completed to continue to improve our balance sheet. This steady improvement resulted in an upgrade in credit rating to investment grade for Moody\u2019s and an outlook upgrade from S&P. For the balance of the year we are expecting to rollout several assets for sale, which will be used in large measure to fund our pipeline of investments for the year without reliance on larger equity issuances.","Turning now to other main objectives for the second quarter and balance of the year, we continue to move forward through the approvals process in support of the Vanderbilt corridor rezoning and to obtain a special permit for the development of a new commercial tower at One Vanderbilt Avenue. The project has the support of the Borough President, Brewer, City Planning Commission and our partner organizations at the coalition for a better Grand Central. We are now before City Council, who is expected to vote upon the project in May at which point the land review process will be concluded. And we hope and expect that we will receive this special permit that we have been working on for some period of time now as most of you know.","Other company recognitions just to make note during the year \u2013 I am sorry during the first quarter. Actually, this was just in the past three months. SL Green was recently recognized by the U.S. EPA as a 2015 ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year on Monday, April 20, during its award ceremony in Washington, D.C. And we got that award for sustained excellence in energy efficiency and the development of market leading sustainability programs. So we are very proud of that, not only proud of the performance of the company, the balance sheet and then our stock price, but proud to be able to achieve all of that while doing it in a very responsible environmentally sustainable way, which has now been recognized at a federal level. Also as I think many or most of you know at this point, we were given admittance, if you will into the S&P 500, which I think is basically a confirmation of the strategies and direction that we have taken with this company over the period of years to grow and diversify, but diversify within our market and create a level of size, stability, performance and return that we think is now on par with some of the best and biggest public companies on the New York Stock Exchange. And for that, we are very pleased and proud.","So that is a quick snapshot of how we are looking at this market as its shaping up now. I would say it\u2019s basically on par or slightly better than our comments to you back in December at the investor conference, which you remember we have focused on basically 10 drivers of growth. I think those drivers of growth are evidencing themselves in significant degree. And I think we have called the market fairly correctly for our shareholders, which obviously we try to do because we look as much as we are in this market, we view that may be we only have maybe a 6 to 9 to 12 months advantage over people not as deep in this market. So we always want to be as transparent and as early with you on how we see market trends developing. And I think, as I said the first four months of the year, I think we have called it pretty well, so we are happy about that.","And with that, we will take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Nick Yulico with UBS. Your line is open.","Ross Nussbaum","Hi. It\u2019s Ross Nussbaum here with Nick we are going to tag-team you. At One Vanderbilt, are you guys contemplating doing a joint venture on that project ahead of putting shovel in the ground or can you talk a little bit about how you are thinking about the long-term capital stack for that asset?","Marc Holliday","Well, the answer is yes. We are considering JV alternatives for that asset. And I think the question will just be when shovel is in the ground already. I mean in terms of just starting some interior demolition. So the big money spend starts in probably 2017 and beyond. And by then, I think we will have determined our capitalization of the project with or without JV partner, but obviously, it\u2019s high consideration right now. We are just sitting here in early 2015, it\u2019s being financed right now out of cash flow and it\u2019s not something that needs to be in our opinion dealt with right now, nor should it necessarily be, because I think there is real value be created between now and call it the next 12 to 24 months.","Ross Nussbaum","Thanks. Yes, Steve, could you just give us a little bit of update on the leasing market in the city in the first quarter, not just your activity, but how you are thinking about the whole market. I mean, it seems like there is now some bigger trends in the market looking for space, small space trends seem pretty positive as well and maybe relate back to your portfolio, how you guys might benefit from that over the next year?","Steven Durels","Well, if you break apart the various submarkets, you have seen strength across the board, both on the small space type tenant, but also on the big tenants and on the high price point tenants. I would say from the tenant profile perspective, financial services seem to be more active today than anytime in the past couple of years. As we look at our leases that are out right now, 9 of our 10 largest leases that were negotiated are financial service related businesses. And there doesn\u2019t seem to be a pocket in town, where there is a dearth of activity. It\u2019s really guns blazing across all submarkets. And we have been pushing rents up sort of every 30, 45 days as far as where our taking rents are in most of our buildings. So, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unique to our portfolio. I hear the same thing back from the brokerage community, which I think is one of the big things to understand that the brokers are out there telling their clients that the balance is shifting towards the landlords that the market is rising and they don\u2019t see it slowing down in the near to intermediate future.","Ross Nussbaum","Just lastly on the 919 Third in the Bloomberg lease, can you give us some perspective on the rent mark-to-market there and is that replacing an expiration in coming years? Thanks.","Steven Durels","We are under pretty detailed confi with them on that. It replaced several tenants that draft, which is part of Interpublic, had rolled out of the building over a year ago. So, they took five of their floors and then we ended up three floors of tenants, whose leases will be expiring over the next immediate to year or so. So, it\u2019s a pre-let on that. So, it\u2019s a combination of floors.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from John Guinee of Stifel. Your line is open.","John Guinee","Great. Thank you very much. My two questions may expand a bit, so but very quick answers. Weighted average share count increased by 2 million shares, a little background information on that. Other assets also popped this quarter, any color on that? And third, can Andrew or David talk about why, how the underwriting for your structured finance investments has changed over the last 2 years as capital has become readily available in that part of the world?","Marc Holliday","Sure. Matt?","Matthew Diliberto","Yes, John, it\u2019s Matt. I guess the first two, so Mark alluded to in his commentary the use of our ATM and the DRIP plan to issue equity during the first quarter for some investment activity and repayment of the 711 Third Avenue mortgage. So, that was \u2013 that\u2019s the increase in share counts. As to other assets this quarter, we booked the popular FAS 141 adjustment for 388 Greenwich, an acquisition we did last year. As you know that bifurcates the real estate asset into real estate and then other. And so that\u2019s the increase in other assets.","Marc Holliday","On the structured finance side, I would say the underwriting parameters for subordinate financing have held pretty stable. We are benefited by the fact that a lot of the buildings that are being purchased are redevelopment type opportunities without a lot in place cash flows. So, where you have seen lending get a lot more aggressive is where the significant cash flow in place on assets, most of the assets that we are financing are lease up, lease to market, redevelopment type opportunities. We have been able to hold our underwriting standards pretty static from last year and the year before.","John Guinee","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tayo Okusanya of Jefferies. Your line is open.","Tayo Okusanya","Yes. Just a quick question on the suburban markets, again when you exclude Long Island, you still have fundamentals that seems to have weakened a little bit versus prior quarter. So, I was hoping you can expand on what you are seeing in the suburban markets?","Isaac Zion","Hi, this is Isaac. That was really driven by one particular lease. The year end was obviously very strong. The first quarter, we saw robust leasing activity of over 200,000 square feet. We are wobbly outperforming the market. Our occupancy is about 85% on signed deals in both Connecticut and Stanford. The overall vacancy is about 23%, 24%. So, that mark-to-market, if you exclude Jericho in that one particular deal, on commenced deals, it was actually positive 4.4% and on signed deals about 1%. So, fundamentals are still while not the city, they are still improving.","Tayo Okusanya","Yes, that\u2019s helpful. And then just another quick question on TIs and leasing commissions going forward, how should we be thinking about that for other development projects you are working on? Should we think of them as potentially being as high as 280 Park or there is something very unique to 280 Park?","Isaac Zion","Well, it\u2019s generally a function of direct more so than development or not. We could do a development deal downtown and we wouldn\u2019t be offering the kind of concession packages that you might offer at 10 East 53rd and 280 Park. So, I think you sort of have to look at it as we look at it and I am sure shareholders look at it on a net effective basis, the higher rent, the higher margin deals and the bigger deals were savvy tenants are going to traditionally carry higher TI levels, so Steve, at 280 and 10 East, where would you peg those kind of new TI deals.","Steven Durels","On the high side, they have been as much as $75 to $80 a foot, but typically, they are more in the $65 to $70. And to add to the logic of that, one it\u2019s a function of price points of big rents therefore support a bigger TI contribution, but also the profile of the tenant that\u2019s going into those high rent paying buildings have extraordinarily expensive build-outs. So, they will absorb a bigger rent, but they need some level of added support as far as TI contribution, because their build-outs aside from what the landlord maybe contributing, they could easily be putting another $100 a foot into the build-out on top of our contribution.","Marc Holliday","Yes, you have to look at lease term, obviously. I mean, some of those bigger deals are 15 years terms, so there is 50% more term, but there is clearly not 50% more TI associated with those deals. So, it\u2019s actually doing a $75, $80 deal on a 15-year basis is better than I guess a $60, $65 deal on a 10-year base. You have to adjust for term, you have to adjust for rent and rent margin. And construction costs are going up. I mean, you hear that from everybody in New York City. So, real TI is sort of holding flat to maybe contracting a bit, so real TIs are actually going down as construction costs go up.","Tayo Okusanya","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jamie Feldman of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Jamie Feldman","Great, thank you. I was hoping you could spend a minute on the Street retail business and just demand, I mean, we have got Westfield and Brookfield opening, their space up downtown. It sounds like Times Square will have some vacancy with Toys \"R\" Us and certainly with stronger dollar and tourism slowing a little bit. What are you guys seeing just in terms of tenant demand in the pipeline and which submarket seem to be standing out?","Marc Holliday","We are seeing very good demand in Times Square. I mean, we just had a smashing success with our space at 1515 Broadway with the leases to Skechers and Swatch. We are seeing very strong demand in Soho and we have a lot of active discussions on our vacant or available properties in Soho. We don\u2019t have any vacancies. We have some future availabilities, which we are talking to tenants about and prime Fifth Avenue and Madison continues to be strong as well. I mean, we did the Diesel lease at 625, which we spoke about in the last call. So, we really haven\u2019t seen any abatement of tenant demand due to stronger dollar or any impact on tourism. Thus far, there is still a lot of strong tenant activity.","Jamie Feldman","And then speaking with retail, what about on the underwriting side and capital flows and asset values, is that changing at all?","Marc Holliday","Continued strength, incredibly competitive to get sites, both leased and available sites anywhere and we would continue to see values escalate.","Jamie Feldman","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Vincent Chao","Hey, good afternoon everyone. Just curious if you could just comment on sort of capital flows you are seeing into New York, obviously the markets are strong, clearly still seeing some capital coming in, but just curious what your thoughts are over the balance of the year particularly from the foreign capital side, do you expect that to be higher than last year and in \u201915 and just thinking about that in relation to the dollar move things like that?","Marc Holliday","Well, we are continuing to have a very strong volume of incoming calls looking for opportunities. I would say the Chinese are very much making their presence belt. The purchases of 717 Fifth, the office portion of that tower which traded to a Chinese company, I would say was a real bellwether type transaction. And they are following that up with a lot of interest in other projects. There are voracious demand for residential and development type opportunities. And Isaac, I don\u2019t know if you have anything to add to that. I mean we have \u2013 it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if this year eclipses last year, given the amount of \u2013 there is a lot of deals on the market right now and there is an enormous amount of capital chasing and so usually that leads to record capital flows.","Isaac Zion","Yes. I would just echo it\u2019s the Chinese, I think the Koreans are looking at the market stronger than they were last year. There are more groups searching more conversations that we are having. The sovereign wealth funds from all over the world as well, particularly from Norway and the Middle East are also very, very active looking for yield and have lower cost of capital. So that\u2019s \u2013 they are going to be very, very aggressive. And this city is relatively cheap compared to other markets around the world.","Vincent Chao","Okay. Thanks for that. And then just one on the accounting side here, just other income looks like it\u2019s up from where it\u2019s been the last couple of quarters, just curious if you could provide some color on that?","Marc Holliday","It\u2019s really just the timing of fee income. We have recognized fee on one of our projects in the first quarter it was around $3 million. Otherwise, it\u2019s really recurring stuff, there is probably $1 million dollars of lease termination income in there as well.","Vincent Chao","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Goldfarb of Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.","Alex Goldfarb","Thank you. Good afternoon. Two questions, first Matt, on the exchangeables that are currently in the money, can you just give us an update, are these already reflected in the diluted share count or how should we be thinking about these, presumably the holders of these would convert them given how they are in the money?","Matthew Diliberto","So, to answer your first question, they are not in the diluted share count based on the nature of the instruments. They remain at their face value in debt. They accrete up to their face. They are slightly discounted to face on the balance sheet. They are convertible. At this point hey are convertible. Last quarter they are convertible. This quarter the view is people won\u2019t exchange those because ultimately you end up at equivalent yield in a more junior position to where they are today. All that said it\u2019s a 2017 maturity. We have been focused on attending to \u201817 maturities if we can early. So we are considering alternatives.","Alex Goldfarb","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. The second question is on the Street retail Page 47, in the prime retail section a number of the near-term maturity leases, the mark to market doesn\u2019t look to be too different to where \u2013 the in place doesn\u2019t look to be too different from where the market rent is, in contrast you go out further and there is definitely a meaningful mark. So are the near-term maturities in the prime JV Street retail portfolio, are those assets that are going to be repositioned so that the mark to market is actually higher or just surprised if there is really not much of a mark there. And again, this is on the JV Street retail, the near-term stuff?","Marc Holliday","Alex, I have got to go through the specific properties underlying those assumptions and come back to you with a more specific answer. Looking at the table, we don\u2019t give addresses. So I would have to go through and take a look specifically at that trend.","Alex Goldfarb","Okay. Well and then if I can just ask one more just to replace that, Matt was there anything in the first quarter operating margin why the margin was meaningfully higher than last year?","Matthew Diliberto","Obviously, we had seasonal expenses, first and third quarters are higher than second and fourth. And reimbursement revenues don\u2019t track proportionately to increased OpEx, so our OpEx was the high in the first quarter as it has traditionally been particularly high given New York had another cold, wet winter. The reimbursement revenues bleed in on a lag basis. And so I would say that\u2019s really the only trend there, nothing unusual in line with our expectations as Marc alluded to earlier, both on a same store and absolute basis in term of margins for this quarter.","Alex Goldfarb","Okay, thank you. And Andrew we can follow-up afterwards. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Steve Sakwa","Thanks. Good afternoon. Marc, at the Analyst Day you guys talked about I think releasing spreads of 10% to 12%, yet you don\u2019t have pretty successful New York City number at 17, I realized the suburban number is a little bit weak, but any thoughts as to kind of where that number may be. And is there anything in the leases that may be Steve is talking about today that would suggest there was some aberration in that 17 or that the ones currently being negotiated or lower or is that just likely to move higher throughout the year?","Steven Durels","I wouldn\u2019t \u2013 we just gave this guidance like 3.5 months ago. So in prep for today\u2019s call, we do not go back through all of the goals, if you will, to reassess. So I can\u2019t sit here now and say whether \u2013 you are saying its 12% was it \u2013 usually we give a range. So is that 10% to 12%. So is the 10% to 12%, as we sit here high, well, first quarter was I guess 17%, so that\u2019s clearly higher. I don\u2019t think we are projecting 17% as run rate. So clearly it sort of depends on what rolls when, some of the leases we are signing or we are signing for vacancy, not for replacement leases. So I think at this point, we are going to stay with 10% to 12%. It certainly seems like there could be upside to that number, based on the velocity and based on the first quarter\u2019s result. But other than just a hunch, I couldn\u2019t tell you that we have gone through each of the remaining 200 and some odd leases. We expect to sign for the remainder of the year and figured out, A, which one of those are in the mark to market pool and B, how it will affect the first quarter. So it certainly seems like there could be some upside there, but it would be premature of us to say that. And we will just \u2013 maybe by mid-year, Steve we will have like better feel for that. We start to forecast for the balance of the year. And I think we will have a better sense. But this early on, I would say if nothing else trending towards the higher end of that range.","Steve Sakwa","Okay. And then I guess your comment about asset sales, clearly the capital flows are extremely strong, I am just wondering what sort of dollar volume could that posses and where does the suburban portfolio sort of fit into that mix, does that need to see more leasing before you would think you can bring it to market or do you think buyers will be willing to in effect pay for some of that vacancy?","Steven Durels","Well. We gave some guidance in December. And I think Matt if I am not wrong, it was about $600 million for commercial office.","Matthew Diliberto","Correct.","Steven Durels","And we are talking about dispositions, right and $100 million for suburban. So I think we feel good with those numbers. That\u2019s we have several assets that are just now, one in the market, several more that we intend to introduce into the market. All extremely good assets, but again these are assets where we look at the sort of average growth trend in these assets over the next 5 years to 7 years to 10 years, 3 years to 5 years. And we compare it against some of the more opportunistic or value add opportunities that e are looking at. And in those instances, we try to cycle out of the more mature properties and into the less mature. It\u2019s hard to call any property mature in this market, because anything that\u2019s been sold over the last 2 years or 3 years likely is being sold today, certainly has the potential for significant appreciation in the next 3 years to 5 years. But maybe not at the same rate as the opportunities we are looking at. And that\u2019s how we are culling out the portfolio.","So on that basis, we will probably look to do some complete dispositions and\/or strategic JVs of assets that we think will get us up to or over the $600 million guidance for the year. I think our plan still is to meet or exceed that. And I would say the same for suburban. So, we didn\u2019t put those numbers out there without some forethought as to which assets we intended to try and dispose of and the timing that we thought would be the optimal timing to do so, because in some cases, we are trying to get some leasing done right at the wire before we introduce to the market. So, I think we are still on that kind of trajectory. And again, we can revisit mid-year once we have a better sense of the reception to the market that the prices will be at.","Steve Sakwa","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Bilerman of Citi. Your line is open.","Manny Korchman","Hey, guys. Manny Korchman here with Michael. If we look at the leases you have under negotiation or out for signature, could you just drill down on that a little bit for us? How much of that is existing vacancy pending \u201815 roll or the acceleration of future years and maybe how much is office versus retail?","Steven Durels","Look, on the \u2013 we have got \u2013 it\u2019s almost 50-50 between renewals and new leases. And of that, the dominant type of tenants is financial services and on the new leases, it\u2019s I would say the majority of the square footage under negotiation is filling space that\u2019s currently vacant as opposed to pre-leasing space for future vacancy.","Manny Korchman","And how much of that is retail?","Steven Durels","And retail is a small percentage of the square footage that\u2019s out right now.","Manny Korchman","Then Matt, given the big non-cash sort of jumps in 1Q, does any of that benefit FFO for the quarter that we should be thinking about on a run-rate basis?","Matthew Diliberto","In the first \u2013 I mean, for as much as comes on generally rolls off. So, we had an adjustment for the first quarter that has a little bit of 2014 in it for 388, but a few million dollars. Otherwise, for the balance of the year, I would expect it to be pretty close to what it has been historically. That\u2019s for our FAS141. On a straight line basis, the straight line adjustment will be higher this year. And that\u2019s simply a function of Citi\u2019s free rent at 388 Greenwich, which is going to be in the neighborhood of $80 million to $82 million a share.","Manny Korchman","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brendan Maiorana of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Brendan Maiorana","Thanks. Good afternoon. Steve, maybe just an update in terms of a couple of the office assets, where you have got leasing in the growth portfolio, Tower 46, 10 East 53rd? And then can you just provide an update at 280 Park or you had potentially put the bed there, I know in the supplemental, it\u2019s 65% occupied, but I think it\u2019s higher from a lease percentage basis?","Steven Durels","Yes. So, 10 East we have leases out on five floors right now. We have signed a couple of leases in the past quarter. At the end of last year, we have already done four floors of leases. The capital project there is 90% complete. The lobby will be 100% done in about two weeks. Elevator cabs will follow on over the next month or two after that. And the plazas will be done in about 45 days and all the infrastructure is already complete. So, we are rocking and rolling as far as leasing velocity and tour activity and active lease negotiations at that property. Tower 46, we have got a lease out covering a floor and a half and we are trading paper with another very large tenant that it\u2019s way early to handicap as to whether there is any life to that are not, but very strong tour activity. That\u2019s going to be one of those buildings we are going to take some time to build up some momentum, because it was kind of out of sight, out of mind for the brokerage community, even though it was a brand, newly constructed property, but it was off most brokerage radar. So, it\u2019s been a big effort to-date to reintroduce it back into the brokerage community and get everybody through the property, so they understand what it is that we are offering. And 280 Park Avenue is quite frankly is on fire right now. We have got several leases out at big, big rents and we will be down to \u2013 by the end of this year that building would be from a leasing perspective, it will hit stabilization.","Brendan Maiorana","Okay, great. And then probably for Matt although maybe someone else, just I am not sure if you can share any details on the WeWork lease, but \u2013 and I know they have got a lot of space with a number of other REITs that are out there. But just \u2013 are there a lot of capital dollars going into the space? And how do you guys get comfortable or how did you get comfortable with the credit and the dollars that go into the space with that lease?","Matthew Diliberto","Well, look I mean we are pretty excited about WeWork as a tenant and as a business. We have spent a lot of time with their principles and their people and at their facilities looking at their business model, which caters to this co-working community and the types of tenants out there that have high demand today, these TAMI-type and technology tenants. And their menu of kind of added, value-add services, we think differentiates them from a lot of other companies we see in that space. It\u2019s a unique offering. They have substantial amount of cash in the bank. They have substantial institutional backing. And we got comfortable that for this kind of building, where we think their community of people want to be in this building, it was a perfect fit. So, I think where this is a joint venture, we own probably a third or so of the equity and not just us, but our individual partners were all very excited about this lease both in terms of whatever capital is entailed by it and excited to have them in our stable of tenants. So, it\u2019s a good lease and great for us and we think WeWork is going to do great in the building.","Brendan Maiorana","Okay, great. Thanks for the time.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Burke of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Brad Burke","Hi, good afternoon guys. A follow-up on asset sales and sources of capital, should we think about those sales as completely funding your investment program for the rest of the year? And if it doesn\u2019t how are you looking to fund those between debt and equity?","Marc Holliday","Well, I think we generally match fund over the years. So, I think that\u2019s a good assumption. I can\u2019t say exactly, because we have a pipeline of many, many buildings and we are talking about selling a number of buildings. So, there is timing issues and everything else, but the goal is certainly to try and fund the new acquisitions predominantly with the net proceeds of sale on a tax efficient basis, doing 1031 where possible. And then either tweaking up or down with debt or equity if necessary based on the timing in the volume. So \u2013 but I mean, that\u2019s \u2013 I think that\u2019s the way we have always done it. So, there is no change in that front. Traditionally, we have been net growers, so it has required on a net basis some amount more of debt and equity, but in ratios that will now decidedly keep us in the range of the investment grade rating that we have obtained.","Brad Burke","Okay, but no clear preference at this point for debt and equity to fund the balance?","Marc Holliday","Well, I mean, it\u2019s not a question of preference per se. I would say, the plan is to fund the majority of it with asset sales and then depending on timing and volumes look to tweak up or down with debt and equity if necessary.","Brad Burke","Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful. And another follow-up actually on structured finance, I just wanted to get an update on how you are thinking about the outlook for income for that business? How much you would like to grow the book? How you are seeing competition shape up for the year? And also how you are thinking about origination yields at this point going forward?","Marc Holliday","Sure. I think in terms of the size of the portfolio, I think at the end of last year, we said we would be up about $250 million kind of year-over-year. I think that still holds. If anything, we are kind ahead of budget right now, but we know there is lot of repayments coming in the second half of the year. Yields have in the market generally, I think they continue to compress. We have been able to kind of outperform the expectations that we set at the beginning of the year and at the end of last year, but it\u2019s kind of too early to tell what the entire year is going to look like. There is a lot of competition out there, but through relationships and kind of the different approaches I have laid out at the end of the year, we have been able to kind of keep our volumes up and we are very bullish about the forecast for the rest of the year.","Brad Burke","Alright, I appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Vance Edelson of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Vance Edelson","Terrific, thanks. Back on the WeWork lease and let\u2019s throw in Bloomberg as well. Just given the overall shortage of large blocks in Manhattan, how much was the pricing on those leases reflective of that, was it demonstrably stronger, in other words are prospective tenants acutely aware that there is just not much out there?","Matthew Diliberto","Well, a couple of things. There are two different products as far as the building that Bloomberg signed at. But I can tell you is broadly speaking, the availability of large blocks of space and let\u2019s define that as being 250,000 square feet or more, you can count on one hand. And if you are looking for 0.5 million square feet, then maybe there is two of them in Midtown. So the big block premium that tenants are confronted with to pay from a rent perspective is definitely back in the market. And I would expect it to sort of excel as the year goes by because there is not going to be a lot of inventory coming online for a big block space. WeWork is building different animal side street and it sort of fell into the fringe area of Midtown South kind of the hotspot where TAMI type businesses want to be. And that\u2019s become look and feel that WeWork likes the associate themselves with. So I can\u2019t really comment specifically to the rents, but I would tell you that the rents that we got on the building were well in excess of underwriting when we bought the building and well in excess of what we would have budgeted 18 months ago.","Vance Edelson","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then I just wanted to give you a chance to comment on Betsy being added as a Director earlier this month, maybe just share with us why she is the right person and then what she brings to the table?","Marc Holliday","Well, we conducted a search to add a Board member kind of on heels of Andrew\u2019s ascension to the Board in order to keep what the governance committee felt was a proper balance between independents and insiders. So we wanted \u2013 that was one of the motivating forces to add a Board member and Betsy just sort of stood out to everybody on the Board as perfect for the role. She is seasoned. She has been involved with a lot of big company boards and brings a level of experience that\u2019s different from the traditional local finance and real estate experience that probably exists on the SL Green Board. She really comes out of the technology sector, if you will and venture capital sector. And given the amount of importance we put on those sectors in today\u2019s market from a tenancy perspective and nothing else, we think that she can add a lot of value in terms of her role as a corporate governance Board member, but also in terms of her knowledge and relationships and ability to access the kind of tenants in this market where we would like to have a bigger presence with. So on a whole number of fronts, she stood out as a great candidate and was appointed.","Vance Edelson","Okay, it sounds like a great addition. Thanks.","Marc Holliday","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ian Weissman of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Ian Weissman","Yes, good afternoon. Just a quick follow-up, Steve to a comment you made earlier about the strong demand at 280 Park, maybe if you can just talk a little bit about the retail demand there, I saw an article the other day about The Four Seasons Restaurant considering its options. I just wanted to get a sense what the demand is today, what you thought the lease up opportunities and the rents were?","Steven Durels","Well, let\u2019s put it in perspective, the retail on that building is not the driver of NOI. Part of our development plan was to create either one large or two medium-sized restaurant spaces. There are side street locations as part of the building. And we have had discussions with Four Seasons. They would have been a wonderful addition to the property if they were to come that way. But we are certainly not counting on them, coming over to the building. We are out in the market talking to a number of restaurateurs and now that the development work is essentially complete at the property and we are well down the road on the office lease up, we are turning our attentions to try and find the right restaurateur or restaurateurs to fill those two spaces. So we view it more as a element of the development plan to add the right look and feel and amenity to the building at street level as opposed to a typical retail addition to a property, which is a big NOI contributor.","Ian Weissman","And rents?","Steven Durels","It\u2019s quite frankly it\u2019s going to depend on the tenant. If we get a world class tenant that we think really adds to the \u2013 to what the building is all about, then we will skew the transaction to be more of a less base rent, more percentage rent type transaction. If we get a more mid-line type retailer that has still a high design with good look and feel, then we will expect more base rent. And I think the market value on this basis probably $100, $125 a foot.","Ian Weissman","Okay, thank you very much.","Steven Durels","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jed Reagan of Green Street Advisors. Your line is open.","Jed Reagan","Hi guys. I am wondering if you can share any pricing details on the transaction of 803rd in terms of cap rate or price per pound and maybe what the strategic thought process was about increasing that stick there?","Marc Holliday","Well, it\u2019s clearly \u2013 it\u2019s a core asset for us that we have a lot of success within leasing. Lease up there has been terrific. So it\u2019s an asset we wanted to consolidate additional interest in. We \u2013 the pricing on the new interest is around $700 a foot, for the asset. And post the acquisition, we own just over 60% of the building.","Jed Reagan","Okay. And where did that land in terms of cap rates, can you share that?","Marc Holliday","Yes. It\u2019s between 4.5% and 5%.","Jed Reagan","Okay. Thanks. And maybe a question for Steve, just curious what you are seeing in terms of rent growth momentum in Midtown so for this year, I mean are you pushing rents at a pace that\u2019s sort of consistent with your expectations as you kind of set out the year and then if there are any other submarkets that surprising you on the upside or the downside?","Steven Durels","Well, rents across the board are going up. And I always like to use the Graybar Building as sort of the great parameter of where the Midtown market is. Every lease that we are negotiating, where the negotiations started in the past call it 60 days, is in the low-$60s a square foot. And if you compare that to the height of the last, top of the last market cycle, Graybar got to a point where for a week or two weeks we did like a couple of deals like $61 a foot. And here now we are at the point where Graybar is \u2013 the typical deal is being signed, $61, $62, $63 starting rent. So I think that speaks volumes as to where the trend line is on rent growth.","Jed Reagan","Okay, thank you.","Steven Durels","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Mailman of KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Jordan Sadler","It\u2019s Jordan Sadler here with Craig. Just maybe a little bit of color on the investment opportunities you are seeing in front of you today, be it on the office side, retail, resi or sort of better opportunity today?","Marc Holliday","Well, I would say we are actively looking at all three of those sectors. I mean you have several large deals on the market in 11 Madison and the Trinity portfolio. Those are two big office deals in the market. There are smaller office deals as well. Retail, most of our focus continues to be on off market deals. We don\u2019t really chase and bid marketed deals much on the retail side and thus we think we have are very specific and unique angle on the deal. And then residential, generally, I would say we have been looking at structured type deals, similar type of off market deals, the market of retail deals are very difficult for us to compete on. But opportunities like 605 West 42nd Street, which we closed up the end of last year and the Stonehenge portfolio, which we closed up in the first quarter of this year are getting most of our attention. So we are sort of agnostic as to what sector we deploy that capital. And we look more in terms of risk return for any individual deal and match them up with each other. We are not willing to take lower returns really in any of the sectors. We are trying to get the highest return on the capital we deploy. So, wherever we can find those high returns across all the sectors plus structured finance is where we will focus the capital.","Jordan Sadler","And what about submarket or I would rather say borough, are you looking in Queens and Brooklyn still? Are there some good opportunities there? Would you go beyond Brooklyn or Queens?","Marc Holliday","We are definitely actively looking in Brooklyn and obviously Manhattan. We have not done much in Queens and not much has crossed our desk in terms of investment opportunities that pretty granular markets out there. But we are actually seeing some opportunities in Harlem, none that we are I would say actively pursuing, but that market is also picking up as usually the case when Manhattan gets hypercompetitive. You start to see demand push to some of the outer areas. So, I think Brooklyn and Manhattan are still our main focuses.","Jordan Sadler","Okay, thank you.","Marc Holliday","Okay, I think that concludes it for questions, operator. The queue is empty.","Operator","Yes, I am not showing any further questions in queue at this time.","Marc Holliday","Okay, thank you very much everyone calling in and we will speak to you soon.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This concludes today\u2019s program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day."],"19525":["SL Green Realty (NYSE:SLG) Q4 2011 Earnings Call January 31, 2012 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Heidi Gillette - Director of Investor Relations","Marc Holliday - Chief Executive Officer, Director and Member of Executive Committee","Matt DiLiberto - ","Steven M.

My name is Keisha, and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Heidi Gillette. Please proceed.","Heidi Gillette","Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining us. This conference call is being recorded.","At this time, the company would like to remind listeners that during the call, management may make forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ from the forward-looking statements that management may make today. Additional information regarding the factors that could cause such differences appear in the MD&A section of the company's Form 10-K and other reports filed by the company with SEC. Also during today's conference call, the company may discuss non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC Regulation G. The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to each non-GAAP financial measure discussed and the reconciliation of the differences between each non-GAAP financial measure and the comparable GAAP financial measure can be found on the company's website at www.slgreen.com by selecting the Press Release regarding the company's fourth quarter year-end earnings.","In December, executive management provided substantial commentary at its investor conference addressing both past performance as well as detailing the essence for 2011 -- 2012, sorry. Therefore, for today's call we will be utilizing an abbreviated format from that a quarter's past and initial commentary will come from -- only from Chief Executive Officer, Marc Holliday, then we will turn the call over immediately to Q&A. As a reminder, the Q&A Section, please limit your question to 2 per person. Thank you.","I will now turn the call over to Mark. Please go ahead.","Marc Holliday","Good morning, and welcome, everyone. We were very pleased with our quarterly results announced last night, to cap-off, very, very good year for the company. While those who had significant concerns at the New York Wall Street [ph] market, while those may have been surprised by these results. We certainly were not as the company's performance was well in line with the guidance we gave last month at our investor conference. Because of the, I guess, 3-hour presentation that was done in December and webcast and was available online, we're going to limit today's remarks coming only 7 or 8 weeks after that extensive dive, if you will, into the New York market in our portfolio and focus mostly on Q&A for the quarter. But I did want to just give you a few thoughts before we turn it over to Q&A.","First thing I think you'll note in the release is that we are seeing improved earnings velocity coming from 2 different avenues, improvement in same-store and contributions from recently acquired value added properties. Earnings and cash flow velocity will accelerate in 2012 as we lease up the acquired vacancy and the New York market continues to improve. Such improvements being fairly measurable in '10 and '11 but still nowhere close to peak performance years of 2006 and 2007. Recall in December, we highlighted about a dozen properties that are projected to contribute nearly $90 million of incremental EBITDA for the most part occurring over the next 3 years. Also we ended 2011 with peak leasing volume for the quarter of 662,000 square feet. While that is a very sizable number in and of itself, I would just want you to note that, that total would have been almost 900,000 square feet if we included in this total the condo unit that was sold instead of leased to Y&R 3 Columbus Circle. While that market activity in citywide maybe slowing somewhat as reported by several of the New York brokers, our portfolio activity remains quite high with over 115,000 square feet of space leased in our portfolio this month alone, first 30 days, first 31 days and another 1.2 million square feet on top of that, which is being actively negotiated.","An example of this recent performance occurring after year-end would be the lease signed last evening by Steve Durels and his leasing team at Jazz at Lincoln Center, is now also an occupant at 3 Columbus, leasing about 30,000 square feet, and bringing the total office left to lease at 3 Columbus to about 170,000 square feet. That building -- the building activity is accelerating on the heels of the Y&R announcement and I feel safe to say that we'll have less than 100,000 square feet to lease by year\u2019s end that property, well ahead of schedule. So we welcome Jazz as well as all the other tenants that were signed up as part of that 115,000 square feet at 3 Columbus.","The leasing market remains in equilibrium at an overall 9.1% vacancy rate, with Midtown being about 0.5 higher than that and we are expecting that number to improve modestly in 2012 with 24,000 private sector jobs estimated to be created in New York City in the coming year. Also the fact that sublease phase today is around 5 million square feet and that represents, if not a low, very near a low since the year 2000. So the sublease space and I think, that being something that people focus on, and rightfully focus on with the concerned with it if there was material glut of improved space on the market. That is right now at its lows and I think that emboldens us to a major projection we made back in December in the face of what people thought a softening  market when we projected an approximately 5% improvement in that effective rent in 2012 and we still are standing by that assessment.","We also increased our structured finance balances by 10% in the fourth quarter through 4 new originations that are typical of our New York century investment profile. This program continues to be an enormous source of earnings and opportunity. On the investment front -- on the asset investment front, values continue to appreciate, cap rates continue to fall as over $25 billion of sales were executed in 2011 with over half of that represented by office sales. And those are very significant volumes, not peak volumes, but quite sizable. We took advantage of that hot market as a buyer and a seller. As a seller, we announced 3 asset sales at the end of last year, and we intend to accelerate our sales in JV efforts to capitalize on significant value creation and also our desire to continue to demonstrate the vast under assessment of private market valuations by public market investors.","On the acquisition front, in 2011, as we had demonstrated in December, there were about 10 different transactions where we acquired property or substantial interest in properties totaling a transaction value of close to $4.5 billion in 2011. So you can see that on both sides of the Table, we were active, we continue to be so in 2012, notably 10 East 53rd Street, which was not discussed in December, is our latest acquisition. It fits right in with our core business line of acquiring, repositioning and redeveloping prime New York midtown Manhattan assets in prime location. And in that case, we subsequently brought in a foreign and institutional equity joint venture partner to both leverage our equity, enhance our returns and increase our opportunity set. So that deal was fairly profiled.","Also adding to our future growth is the DFR portfolio acquisition that is expected to close later today, which includes 402 residential units -- residential rental units in 2 Midtown East apartment buildings and extraordinary retail properties at 724 Fifth and 752 Madison Avenue.","So we'd like to congratulate the entire team here at SL Green for what was really a fabulous year in 2011. My hat is off to everyone including the operations and management group led by Ed, leasing led by Steve and investments led by David Schonbraun and Isaac Zion. Andrew will address you later on some of the specifics for these transactions but the legal team, Andy Neil and Jim and Matt, Heidi and everyone else, was a part of this enormous effort in 2011. Just want to say thank you.","And with that let's open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Alex Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Just a quick comment on the GAAP same-store NOI. The -- in the press release, you had the 2.9, which I'm guessing is a slightly different definition than what's in the supplemental. So on an apples-to-apples basis, what would fourth-quarter same-store NOI have been using the 2.9 definition that was in the press release?","Matt DiLiberto","It's Matt. If you use that same definition of what [ph] that includes 15, 15 and 521 in the calculation because we bought out partners during the course of the year that technically doesn't fit the same-store definition but the mathematics would, obviously, hold that. We don't know properties to control those properties, so that should be in there that tell you the 2.9. For the quarter that would be north of 3%, if done under same measure.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. So over 3% for the quarter.","Matt DiLiberto","Exactly. And that's how you get to 3% for the year as well.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","And then, just -- you guys sound like you're ramping-up the disposition program. As you think about new investments, certainly Midtown South, especially when you speak to the brokers, they're very excited by that submarket. Just wanted to get your take especially on the Chelsea flatiron, if you think that market truly has lags and now be -- now maybe much more acceptable for institutional investors to go down there especially if that's where sort of the next generation of new tenants and business is coming from.","Marc Holliday","While, I think, it certainly has lags from a leasing perspective. The challenge for investors is there's not lag institutional quality of inventory down there. So you're talking about the biggest buildings down there One Madison, which we own 626th and [indiscernible], which just traded this year. There are relatively few other buildings that are Park Avenue South buildings, which are primarily over-term and factory buildings, not a lot of institutional quality or institutional size product, it's lot of very small type properties. So while the leasing market does have lags, I'm not sure yet in terms of the institutional demand for smaller size 3 properties that make a lot of the inventory though.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","If a big institutional size asset were to come up, you guys, I'm assuming would be seriously interested, correct? Or not so much?","Marc Holliday","Sure, absolutely. We own One Madison. We had a great experience with them and we would absolutely look at others as we looked at the 620 and [indiscernible] last year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tony Paolone with JPMorgan.","Anthony Paolone - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","If financial services demand remains muted over the course of the year, do you think the other parts of the New York economy can make up the slack you can get to the rent growth projections you guys talked about?","Marc Holliday","Well, I think it has been. I think it's a little less projection, it's more just a synopsis of what taken us from down by about 300 basis points or so of vacancy. This quarter alone, it was tenants, like HF Global Healthcare and Bloomingdale's for office space, Y&R obviously a big deal, leading hotels, Viking Global Hedge Fund, A\u00e9ropostale, which was a tenant that we started with as a retail relationship in Times Square and was able to work with our suburban group and John Barnes at Broomnet tenant out for a sizable occupancy at Chubbway [ph] in New Jersey, and then you have some new media tenants like Amazon, who continues to grow at 1350 Sixth Avenue, I think, Steve, there's another lease last night to Amazon?","Steven M. Durels","Yes. It expanded by another 11,000 square feet.","Marc Holliday","So that was sound last night. And they continue to expand the footprint 1350, so I mean that's a sample and maybe Steve you can put in more?","Steven M. Durels","Well, I think to put it in perspective. Financial Services primarily is defined by the big investment banks and commercial banks. Actually has helped reduce the footprint that we had last year by couple of percentage points. Yet, last year was one of the biggest leasing years in the decade. It was driven primarily by new media and technology who leased 26%, 27% of all the inventory for last year. And we see those industries continue this year, to build during the pipeline are not necessarily financial related except we could always still see the hedge fund private equities, smaller type deals kicking about, but there's plenty of deals out there for advertising, technology, engineering, law firms and general service businesses. So, and I think that's the good news, that there's a big diversity of industries that are in the market and we saw last year, the leases last year was currently have a good leasing without financial services, we did and I think, we're going to see more of that this year.","Anthony Paolone - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, thanks and my second question is as relates to 600 Lexington and 125 Park both had occupancies within the quarter, just curious if you could refresh us on the plans there, how they're coming along and whether those were expected and when those occupancies might turn the corner.","Steven M. Durels","600 Lexington, actually both this buildings as you recall, we bought them. We then go into the investments that the good percentage of the tenants would be vacating the buildings. 125 Park it was Meredith Publishing Firm who had about 150,000 square feet. We knew there was no chance of them staying in the building. They had outgrown their space and there was nothing available to retain their occupancy, would've wanted to consolidate to a bigger footprint at an equal price. And at 600 Lexington, we did color on those tenants as well, we none of the tenants expiring between '11, '12 in early '13 would renew, the producers have a couple of them. 600 Lexington, we've seen the leasing there, kind of go up and down. We had a burst of activity early last year, went kind of quiet during the year and we're busy there today than anywhere else in the portfolio, 4, 5, full floor deals that are pending at rents that are significantly above the underwriting. We're seeing a lot of tenants that are -- who have been looking at Park Avenue upper Madison Avenue coming our way and price points that are kind of 65 on the base of $80 a square foot in the tower and at 1425 Park Avenue the space just went vacant on January 1. We've pre-let one of the full floors of 25,000 square feet and we're out hunting for full floor tenants over there. So that will take the balance of this year, I think, on getting any traction on that building, but that's in line with the business part.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nicholas Yulico with Macquarie.","Nicholas Yulico - Macquarie Research","For the New York City leases that were signed, I mean, now have in fourth quarter very strong renewals spreads, you had them in the third quarter as well. I'm wondering how much of that is a function of you guys pushing rents harder as opposed to now getting the benefit from some easier comps on renewals?","Marc Holliday","I don't -- I would say it's more a function of the market than anything. We've experienced relatively good growth in market rents beginning back in 2010 and continuing into '11 and received moderating a bit but positive in 2012, probably bringing us close to at least 20% over that 3-year period if not higher, if you include the tightening of the concessions that we've seen in free rents and TI. So, I think, what you're seeing primarily is sublets being taken off the market, vacancy rate that has declined by almost over 300 basis points, in equilibrium market of around 9% where we generally have competition for space that's not in same competition like it would be at 5% or 6%. But it's usually more than 1 tenant on a space that we can get. Those premium rents are very focused to try to get the rents are placed at least equal to or greater than in most cases where they will expire. It'll change from quarter-to-quarter as you may just have in normally a tenant in any given quarter may have a very high head rent and if it was signed at a peak time and it rolls onto market today. So we still have a number of tenants that are rolling down from market, are rolling down from the previous escalated to market but on average when we're leasing about a 0.5 million square feet or more per quarter, the preponderance of those are neutral to up and on average you saw they were up substantially in the fourth quarter and we'd given guidance in December at where we saw that mark-to-market for the full year 2012 and I think that guidance as I'm looking at is greater than 5% on average for the coming year. That's actually, it's very good consistent with our view but there's a lot of work to do. ","[Audio Gap] ","program to bring it solidly into the -- to compete with comparable Class A buildings and our rental assumptions there at the top of the building where we've unimpeded Central Park views are at premium to 600 Lexington, for sure. So, I think, locationally it's a premium and view-wise, it's a premium. It does have that same highly desirable boutique floor plate for a tenant can get a floor full identity which tenants will certainly pay premium for comparable 600 Lexington, but you have a location advantage and a big view advantage. So after the renovation we really feel this building compare with other boutique office buildings like it in the plaza district.","Nicholas Yulico - Macquarie Research","Just to be clear, the 40 million does that include tenant improvements or is that separate?","Marc Holliday","Separate.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Can you talk a little bit about the loan loss reserves and the","[Audio Gap] ","So as you think about what's to come for the rest of the year, what is the environment look like for more equity infusions","[Audio Gap] ","transactions that you guys were seeing from more recently like the Des Moines deal?","Marc Holliday","Sure. On the structure finance side, it was all New York-based deals, 3 of them were acquisition financing and one of them was a -- we acquired a senior position in a capital sect that we already hold a junior position in 5 Times Square. We continue to bring the investing environment for structured finance is very good, the yields are","[Audio Gap] ","historically a high level","[Audio Gap] ","gaps that are in our pipeline and certainly for those who don't want to expose more than property for marketing, they have tax issues or they want to stay in and continue to enjoy upside in their buildings, the recap route is a preferred route and I think, we're the first to launch those types of deals in New York, we've had so much success with them and we work successfully with so many other owners and operators as partners in New York.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then just one final follow-up, is the yield on the structured finance, is that sustainable? You think putting money the rest of that for the rest of the year?","Marc Holliday","Right now, the market conditions are holding, there are some new entrants to the space, we always have the risk that people start competing on yield, but for now the most recent deals that we've done are still consistent with the yields that we're making for the year, which is in the 10% or so range.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with ISI Group.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I guess really 2 questions. One, Marc, can you talk a little bit more about this apartment deal and Stonehenge relationship and I know that your partner has relatively lofty goals in terms of expanding the size of his portfolio and I'm just wondering how you sort of think about apartments, what percentage of that business you'd like it to represent? Or what kind of opportunities you see relative to structured finance and recaps from the office side?","Marc Holliday","Well, I think, some of it, Steve, to be determined because these initial acquisitions, I think, by the market assessment of these deals I think we've got 2 solid deals and I think our partners Stonehenge, it's a group run by Ofer Yardeni and Joel Seiden, 2 very talented professionals who have a large multifamily portfolio here in Manhattan and have successfully grown it from 0 over the years to where they are","[Audio Gap] ","that can be $300 million, $400 million, $500 million buildings or complexes. So I can't really give you any guidance as to investment targets, but I think, it's a fairly nice complement so far to our business where we achieved great inroads, maybe and understatement on the office front, and on the high-end retail front structured finance, I think, we're generally recognized as a market leader in this city and subordinate financing and I think, multifamily provides another avenue where we can capitalize on our relationships, on our tax advantage currency, and on our ability to take projects that don't have a lot of current return, but work on ways ourselves or with our partners to enhance NOI and improve and move rents up. So we like that business, it'll be dictated purely by profitability as we see great profitability that you'll see us do more. If the yields are below our thresholds, and we talked about our yield thresholds in the past, then I think, we'll do some but probably not a lot because we don't -- we're not looking to do low margin business, we're only looking to do business that fits into the spectrum of what we're making on our office retail and structure.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And then, I guess, second question as you think about sort of just the shifting landscape maybe away from financial services, you mentioned media and tech is taking almost 25% of the space in 2011 and perhaps those kind of tenants continuing to grow. Do you need to change kind of where the portfolio is located or types of buildings, that you own presumably a lot of these tenants don't want to be in the 50 story high-rise building on Park Avenue or Fifth Avenue or Sixth Avenue so how do you sort of think about that changing landscape given who's growing and shrinking in the city?","Marc Holliday","Let me just, the largest growing segment -- I want to dispel certain notions that I see, and while we're very excited about new media. The sizes tend to be small, it's made up of a lot of small companies that get moderately bigger, that's only -- not every one of these tendencies like Google and Amazon. They're a very important user, I think, for Downtown and Midtown South where there's space that's more in line with their targets in 40s, 50s and 60s and not 80s, 90s, and 100s. But the largest growing segment in New York City by far is professional business services, period. That's where 16,000 jobs were added in 2011 and that's where we see most of the growth coming. So for most media firms, Midtown is still considered not just acceptable but desired. And I think Y&R is a great example of that and the tenant that we had competing for that space, which was a multi-hundred thousand square foot tenant that was ultimately -- we didn't consummate with because we couldn't accommodate both [indiscernible] and the Y&R ideal. And Midtown is still -- sees highest rents that is most desired and we don't see many tenants in our portfolio migrating downtown. So I think, we've got kind of a developing and very healthy complementary markets for users that are looking for different types of space, at different price points throughout the city with Midtown being -- what's most in demand and achieves the highest price. We do a fair amount of lending in Midtown South. As Andrew said, we own One Madison, it's one of the premier institutional assets in Midtown South. As we said on prior conference calls we were actively looking at 1107 Broadway, which we bid for, but it went condo, so what I can tell you, one was residential but we were leading better for 1107 Broadway. We owned other assets in that market like 470 Park Avenue South, One Park Avenue, which we bought and sold, Clock tower. So it's a market we know well, I don't think it's a market that's got the highest asset appreciation potential changes we spoke to earlier, we still believe that to be the best Midtown assets with the highest rent appreciation, potential but with that said, we love that market, we're active in that market. I think that market is going to stay very tight because a lot of the inventory is being leased to tenants looking for affordable rents, but a lot of it is also being converted to residential. And you see that certainly supports to a large extent why you see such a low vacancy rate in that market. And downtown we spent probably, I don't know, a half-hour at our investor conference in December highlighting downtown our investments there in when we announced 180 Maiden. So I would sort of leave it at that but I just want to make sure that it's pretty clear when we're talking about the engine of growth in the city, it vacillates between financial services and professional business services and those are the 2 realism [ph] in the market that you will that drive the big block usage for the most part.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sheila McGrath with KBW.","Sheila McGrath - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Given that demand that you're seeing in the market today from larger users, do you think some of the shadow development pipeline on the west side or over by Penn Station may be pushed out further into the future than previously expected?","Marc Holliday","While you saw Silverstein's announcement that he was going to cap off, one of its World Trade Center buildings due to lack of demand so that there is some evidence of that in the market for sure and Hudson Yards, we continue to watch carefully they signed Coach for the first building but they still need commitments for around 1.2 million square feet there in order to get that building underway. And so we're watching carefully but certainly there is demand for space that's available now and in the short term and much harder to sign up tenants for longer-term development projects.","Sheila McGrath - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And the second question, you did outline the target goal of same-store NOI of greater than 4% in 2012. Fourth quarter was slightly negative. I was just wondering if you could discuss, if you think greater than 4% is still achievable and what would be the main drivers of that, is that occupancy pickup, rent spreads or new buildings in the mix?","Matt DiLiberto","It's Matt. So we targeted 3% or 4% on the cash NOI basis. Some of it had to do with what you mentioned, concessions we've seen kind of stabilizing and not so far as they were seen before, and  you'll also see the burn off of the larger concessions on a lot of leasing that we did over the last couple of years as well as straight-line of the new rents coming on board.","Marc Holliday","We have 3 million square feet of leasing 2 years ago, 2.4 or so last year and we targeted in the investor conference 1.7 this year. So as the portfolio continues to stabilize, portfolio continues to run along from the bottom of the market, we're going to have a growth in cash NOI that's going to exceed the cap NOI.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Knott with Greek Street Advisors.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Question for you, Marc, I know the answer to your question, but I've to ask you anyway, I happened to agree with your comments about the power market having undervalued your real estate especially during the fall when your stock got hit pretty hard, just curious again why didn't you make a move to buy back your stock during that time period because your conviction never waiver that values haven't really declined. Like the public market here and just curious why in '12 from disposition proceeds to that initiative as opposed buying private market assets at say, presumably fair market pricing?","Marc Holliday","Well, I think it's the last piece of what you just said, is probably the barometer. We're making fortunes on the assets that we purchased predominantly in the trough to middle innings of this recovery from 2009, end of 2009 both. I mean very, very sizable levered and unlevered gains well into the double digits. You can argue around the margins whether better or not, I bought in the stock but the opportunity set as I said in December, is about as good as we sought. We see 2012 clearly as the market is heated up the buying opportunities may moderate and maybe the late inning ones weren't quite the same as the early ones. But we had an extraordinary 2-, 2.5-year run where we made investments that I think, are going to prove to be the seeds of earnings in cash flow growth or net asset value appreciation over the coming 3 years that is going to be sizable, that are going to define this period of time for the company. So it's a marginal analysis, certainly not the same as if we didn't have very attractive uses for the proceeds along the way, including the structured finance business which you see is also a double-digit business with moderate risk associated with it. So I think, that has driven our actions to a large extent. And also part of the proceeds went to paying down leverage, which we de-leveraged fairly sizably from 2008, let's say, from where we stand today as measured by debt to EBITDA or debt to assets. So those 2 metrics we felt that it was prudent to bring that -- those metrics closer to in line with the re-community because of our goal of establishing an investment grade rating with S&P and hopefully with Moody's. And while buying back the stock may have been more opportunistic at the time than deleveraging, we think the deleveraging will have a long term structural benefit to us as we are able to access the unsecured markets as alternative to secured markets at very cheap rates. So I would ask Jim if he would like to answer that in a philosophy.","James E. Mead","The reality is the accounting for share repurchase gives you less than half of the capacity that you would have to go out and make acquisitions off the balance sheet. So the theory is good but so long as we've alternative uses of capital there, really highly accretive and it doesn't make sense for us to look at our stock.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","And then second question, I guess, more for Steve or Marc or whoever would like to comment, but I would just be curious if you can update us on your thoughts on high-end versus maybe mid-tier versus low-end of the market. I think, you commented before that the middle of the market was faring better than the very best part of the market and maybe just weave any comments that you feel appropriate in terms of submarkets Park Avenue or Fifth or Madison versus some of the more value oriented submarkets in midtown. That would be helpful.","James E. Mead","I think, that's still true today that the biggest activity that's out there is kind of the mid-price points type space and you can define that in a couple of different ways. There's the kind of 30-year-old buildings that are $45 to $65, maybe even $70 price points auction of in the middle of the market and I think, that's where a lot of the activities that could be a lot of the products we've around Grand Central, Third Avenue, but even if there were newer buildings that were downtown, the better quality new buildings downtown are mid- price points and are seeing a lot of activity. When you compare them against the same kind of product, whatever it went for in Midtown. So I think, a lot of the decision-makers out there are taking a very prudent perspective with regards to the real estate. They're looking to lock in long-term leases and they're shying away from that $120 price point. But that comes in waves, I would not be surprise if the economy continues to improve the people become more bullish to see that the high price point product pick up steam later this year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brendan Maiorana from Wells Fargo Securities.","Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just had a question about 711 Third Avenue and maybe the marketing of that project and what you guys are going to learn due the marketing process and how that compares to what you're looking to sell in 2012 where I think expectations are around $500 million or more of dispositions for this year?","Marc Holliday","I think there were issues specific to that marketing process maybe the bankruptcy of a 40,000 square foot tenant during the process, and also the fact that we signed up 3 other deals at prices well ahead of our expectations and sort of very fast timing that allowed us to take a step back really work on re-tenanting that bankruptcy with a tenant liquidated, and then reevaluate the building. So the market response to the building rates, the whole activity was great and frankly the indications of value we got were compelling, but we think we can do better bringing it back under our control and getting the vacant space leased up and then bring in a more civilized building to the market eventually what we when we decide to re-market.","Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And do you still feel like the buyers out there in terms of looking at projects with some longer-term upside are still underwriting at fairly optimistic scenarios in terms of value where it is today in relative to where they can get so couple of years?","Marc Holliday","Definitely. You saw the trade-off 575 Lex most recently where that building has a lot of vacancies so people are still aggressively chasing vacancy and taking optimistic use of rental growth and asset appreciation, which has continued to push values in the market.","Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then for Matt or Jim, I think, Marc mentioned the $85 million to $90 million of incremental EBITDA from the value add portfolio or the value add properties you guys have within the portfolio. How much of that do you think gets realized in your contemplated in 2012 guidance, how much of $85 million to $90 million incremental guidance that, how much is 2013 and beyond when you realize it?","James E. Mead","Actually there's a pretty good reference point for the Brendan's math. You can go to the investor conference are we actually laid out an incremental, call it, $90 million of EBITDA, was coming from notice from the stabilized years a lot of that is beyond 2012, some properties will contribute during 2012 but I think, incremental [Audio Gap] been in full way until 2013 and beyond.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman with Citi.","Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","It's Josh Attie with Michael. Just a follow-up on Steve's question on residential, would you now consider doing pure residential investments and is that a shift from the prior strategy, where it seemed to be more of a way to get the retail that you wanted? And would you also consider buying into the Stonehenge's portfolio?","Marc Holliday","Well, I can't speak to the latter, not our portfolio and I'm not going to speak about somebody else's portfolio, but as it relates to our interest, which is pure residential, which I think you mean standalone residential, I would say absolutely. We would not have purchased the 2 apartment buildings in connection with the retail properties if we didn't think that on the merits they wanted investment that was while it was a smaller portion of the overall. It was still a recollection close to a $100 million, well over $150 million of total value that was ascribed to those property so this was not an incidental investment, if you will.","James E. Mead","It was 40% of the investment.","Marc Holliday","So I mean, it wasn't the primary objective. The primary objective was Seventh, 24th, Fifth and Morrison Avenue and 752 and 760. But nor would I characterize those apartments as I said earlier incidental I would say that we thought each component of that transaction was very attractive and if we had the opportunity to do that on a stand-alone basis I think, we would give it a very serious look. But the only thing I said earlier, I think, it was in response was simply that you now, people tend to be generational owners of rental and so they don't perceive this type of quality buildings don't trade often, but when they do, I think, we're well positioned because we have a currency that can be utilized in a way that would be very attractive to sellers and tax efficient to sellers and flexible to sellers to treat different people differently as we've done time-to-time again. I think, we've done somewhere between 8 and 10 unit deals at least over time. So it's clearly a valuable tool in our arsenal and I would say that we're certainly -- we're evaluating or will evaluate those types of opportunities going forward.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","It's Michael Bilerman speaking. How you think about your competitive advantage relative to a lot of multifamily REITs same sort of currency benefit that you do in terms of offering units but also have significant operating platform with multifamily and a lot of them have been very active in New York. How do you sort of compete with that especially when the multifamily REITs, probably, lower cost of capital and have lower return thresholds than you do?","Marc Holliday","Let me say 2 things, Michael, I don't -- I would disagree with you anyone has got our kind of that currency that appeals to New York owners. When you say there's a lot of other multifamily REITs that have currency that would be as attractive, I don't know of any frankly that have what is viewed as a almost completely New York centric portfolio and operating portfolio like we have at SL Green. I've said it before, I always think that it's very difficult to get people to trade their New York bricks for out of New York paper, that's just my opinion. You could differ with that, others in different with it, it's been my opinion in experience that traditionally people are hesitant and very thoughtful about when and how they're going to trade hard assets that they control for securities that they don't control, the partnership interests that they don't control. And the way in which we've gotten people over than is through track record, management team and portfolio. When you line our portfolio up compared to others, there's a mindset where typically what I've seen is now your people want a New York portfolio. I think it's less an issue of property type per se because I think people view their buying into diversified portfolio. But I know people who just aren't going to trade a midtown rental property for a group of properties located in secondary markets in the U.S.","James E. Mead","So it's critical factor in the Franco portfolio as well.","Marc Holliday","So I mean that's my opinion but that's opinion developed through my experiences and with that in particular and when you talk about New York operating platforms, I look at our operating platform and would stack it up to many other out of town REITs operating platforms and the ability to manage and local vendors and invest capital and relationships. I view that as a competitive advantage, not disadvantage. The cost of capital I can't respond to, we have excellent cost of capital certainly through the private markets and then the public markets at times when we see that market opportunity. It's there at times, not at others, that I think goes to my statement earlier about what I perceived to be a vast under assessment of private market valuation of private market investors, but again all 3 of these things are just my opinion.","Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","What are your thoughts on the size, Times Square and the incremental investment that you made?","Marc Holliday","In fairness, we have a queue of others, I think, what we should do is we could pick this up off-line. As a residential, I said earlier in response to Steve I had no size parameters for targets and so I don't have any thoughts along those lines because we are driven by opportunity within this market. And I would say that the size of that opportunity will be dependent on a whole number of factors and we'll just see how it goes but we can certainly talk off-line and go through residential more but I would also just want to caution, if you went out there that in the pipeline you're looking at, it's a very small component of our pipeline and I wouldn't look to that to be a major driver of 2012 investment or results.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Louise Pitt from Goldman Sachs.","Louise Pitt - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just a quick question on unsecured financing opportunity, the wonder if you comment, given the existing low rates and the fact that you already simplified the corporate structure with the recent bank facility. I know that rating agencies have looked for you to unencumber some additional assets, so I'm just wondering if this would be a good opportunity.","Marc Holliday","Look, I think that as we move through the year we're going to be doing a number of cap raising activities as we talked about, Louise, including selling potentially some additional assets, more joint venture positions. So as we, for my vernacular as he reload our balance sheet I think we'll look at all sorts of opportunities including the potential for unencumbered additional assets to creating a different kind of capacity not just the mortgage side of the financing that we've done in part over the last couple of years. So that's still the direction that we are consistently on.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Just wanted to follow-up on 5 Times Square. Curious, was the legacy investment performing or is it performing and maybe the strategy surrounding the incremental investment there?","James E. Mead","There were a couple of new factors there. The property was marketed and ownership decided not to sell but the property was marketed, we've -- we got some data in terms of where the market and where the bits work for the assets when it was marketed. And a piece Senior to us in the capital structure, as I said before, did become available at a price that was attractive to us so we did pick it up. That piece is -- on accrual and a prior piece, which is a pay in kind piece, has been on nonaccrual. We're currently evaluating whether it should stay on not accrual or return to accruing status based on the outcome of that marketing although the building didn't trade.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","It's helpful. What else is ahead of you besides the CMBS and the stack?","Marc Holliday","Just the CMBS?","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Just the CMBS.","Marc Holliday","I mean, the piece that we bought the senior piece was current pay, it's not a pay in kind position.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And then separately, just more of a housekeeping item, on Pages 42 and 43 you used to have your asking rent disclosure which we found helpful over the years. Can you maybe just with that an oversight excluded or did you purposefully sort of eliminate it?","Marc Holliday","That was -- we couldn't put it back it was in -- it's not in. I found that there was some people who looked at it and sometimes confuse asking rent, taking rent with market rent and with other kinds. And we've got jumbled questions from time-to-time and they would point to the asking rents in a way that was inappropriately applied. It's easy for us to put in, we can put it back in, the problem is in asking rents, it's not equivalent in all cases to a taking rent. Sometimes it is, but more often is a natural negotiations that was on this market. And bear markets, the deviances could be more substantial in good markets it's relatively tied but we didn't know that -- we thought that was being misapplied in some cases and we also didn't know who would anyone really needed it trapped it, if there's a preponderance of people want to back in we can drop it back in easily in '12.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","From one man's perspective, we liked it directionally to see what you guys thought of market rents given your perspective.","Marc Holliday","I would agree with that. Directionally is the most useful application of that. I think, you can get directionally also from average escalated rent unsigned leases in the quarter but with that said, it's a little tough because we have different asset classes so if people.","Matt DiLiberto","We'll look at it -- we'll look at it later. We heard this from a couple different sources now, and we'll look at it. But again, it did cause in the last couple of quarters I'm really confused analysis from the investment communities. Now...","Marc Holliday","There some people who looked at it and several there's another 15%, 20%, 25% embedded market growth based on the asset rents. Now that's not really accurate and even though we like keeping that we want to be accurate and we didn't feel that was right. When I heard that comment that led me to say if that's what people are looking at this, pull it out. We can put it back in.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","The cynical view, right, not that I would be cynical, would be that somebody that you guys were pulling it out if that number were rolling over in terms of where the market rent no longer going up with the rent at it does i.e. second derivative.","James E. Mead","That's not what happened. That's how Steve [ph] operates the asking rents.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Gradually [indiscernible]","Matt DiLiberto","We actually did updated but it was up. The peak cynical...","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Do you have the number by chance?","James E. Mead","Jordan, it's a matter I'll call you later with that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jay Habermann with Goldman Sachs.","Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","If you think about ramping up the dispositions in the near term, should be think of that is as a growing appetite to actually see some acquisitions in the back half of the year, I guess, maybe Marc back to the comments you made earlier what sort of opportunities may be size of opportunities are you seeing. Are you seeing more of willingness of sellers to sell and Banks to move properties that create those opportunities?","Marc Holliday","Well, 10 East is a fresh brick. I think, that's within the past few weeks. That is a foreign pension fund owner, so owned the properties for a long period of time, wants to take some gain for whatever reason most, speculates has no reason if they want some liquidity at this point in time. And review there is upside potential in converting a building that hasn't had a lot of capital investment over the years into what Andrew stated earlier would be building competitive Class A buildings and that location. It\u2019s a great location. So that business for us is something we've been executing for 15 years prior to that for over 2 decades. That's not -- I don't want to -- there's nothing trend setting about it. It's another value-added opportunity that fits our profile. I hope we'll have more like that this year, no reason to expect we won't but as it relates to -- and the answer is yes, I think, we will see those from, you mentioned banks, I don't think we're going to see those from banks, because banks don't own those kind of properties. We're talking about bank-owned facilities that we're looking to shed in order to free up some capital. You may see some of that, but a lot of banks don't necessarily own this phase, there higher rents products, you may see data centers or back office properties being sold by banks to raise cash. But that I don't view as -- that's not the heart of our opportunities,  the heart of our opportunities set our owners that have owned buildings for 10, 20, 30 years that are deep in the money, that want to monetize gains and don't want to invest a lot of capital, where we see upside.","Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","At the Investor Day you didn't touch on your development side in Midtown, should we expect any sort of updates throughout the year uses an opportunities, I mean, maybe you're talking more about residential, when would you expect some sort of an update on that site?","Marc Holliday","Hard for me to speculate, not in the near-term so I can't tell you whether that's 2, 3 or 4 but it's not near-term. So certainly some time throughout the year, I guess, in the second half of the year we should have some kind of update, hopefully meaningful update for investors. I can't pinpoint it more specifically than second half of the year.","Operator","There are no further questions in queue at this time. I would now like to hand the conference back over to Marc Holliday for any closing remarks.","Marc Holliday","That's it. Want to thank everybody and look forward to speaking again in 3 months time.","Operator","Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation.

Please proceed, ma'am.","Heidi Gillette","Thank you, everybody for joining us, and welcome to SL Green Realty Corp.'s First Quarter 2012 Earnings Results Conference Call.

Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Marc Holliday. Please go ahead.","Marc Holliday","Okay. Thank you, Heidi, and welcome, everyone, to our earnings call today. Thank you for joining us. Normally, our Q1 is not quite as robust as what we have presented to you today, so I'm sure we have a lot of ground we will cover, both in some prepared remarks and our Q&A. But I would just like to focus in first on 1515 Broadway transaction that we announced last night. This was certainly what I believe to be a milestone event for this company. Lease extension was one of our top overall strategic priorities and having that behind us now affords us great flexibility and opportunity going forward that we'll certainly utilize to our advantage. ","I've heard a lot of Street commentary about eliminating overhang and derisking the rent roll, but this transaction, in my mind, has a much more profound effect than simply mitigating a future lease roll. We were completely focused on value creation and stabilization of one of our premier asset holdings throughout this transaction. Ultimately, our focus was on term, 15 years of term, not another 5- or even 10-year extension, which doesn't carry the same weight in the capital markets, but now with a 15-year extension beyond the 3 years remaining on the original lease. This asset, in our minds now, moves into elite core status in Manhattan and with an $80 million near-term NOI and applying a 5% cap rate, which I would believe to be conservative in this market, the result would be an asset value worth approximately $1.6 billion based on just those metrics. But that's only half the story as this now extremely valuable office tower sits on top of an extraordinary retail pedestal, which will provide for future rental growth and signage opportunities to further drive NOI.","I want to thank Viacom's leadership for having the confidence in us to make this additional 15-year commitment. And I especially want to thank our team that worked literally and exactly 24\/7 during a very compressed period of time to structure, negotiate and finalize a very large and complicated lease transaction. In fact, over 25 SL Green professionals covering every discipline of this firm were dedicated to this project over the last few weeks 100% of the time. I'd say without hesitation that the completion of this transaction was the proudest moment during my 14-year tenure at this company. ","But not to be overshadowed by the Viacom deal, I would also like to highlight the Random House lease renewal, which unto itself, tips the scales as one of the largest lease transactions in New York City in the past 6 months. The deal with Random House was truly one of those win-win situations, whereby Random House will be able to rightsize their space needs and achieve densification while remaining in their world-class headquarter building at 1745 Broadway. For us, the lease extension allowed us to put away for term the base of the building while maintaining the opportunity to lease the upper half of the building in 2018 and achieve the then market rents. I have some more commentary later on before Q&A, but right now, let me just turn it over to Andrew.","Andrew W. Mathias","Thanks, Marc. On the investment sales side, I would characterize the Midtown Manhattan market right now as a standoff between buyers and sellers, where there's tons of capital interested in looking for deals and sellers whose expectations are high, given their view that higher rents and tightening cap rates are on the horizon. That dynamic is contributing to a slow quarter of activity for core Midtown property. However, consistent with the leasing market, which is very hot in the Midtown South and Soho areas, we've seen a big pickup in sales activity in those areas, including our own sales of 141 Fifth Avenue and 379 West Broadway, which we announced yesterday at a sub-5% cap rate in each case. Also of note, 148 Lafayette, a building with no real retail, traded for about $850 a foot. That's on Lafayette, just a block north of Canal, not an area known for premium per-foot valuations. So there's a lot of investor interest in Midtown South and these surrounding areas corresponding with a tightening vacancy and a lot of leasing activity. ","In terms of our structured finance business, we continue to be very active, with net originations of around $70.5 million in the quarter at an average rate of 8.7%, which is skewed somewhat because the largest origination of the quarter was a first abridged first mortgage position, which obviously doesn't carry a mezzanine-type rate. We anticipate selling an A note in that mortgage position as we've done in other mortgage positions, and being left with a retained yield in the low teens, which is more consistent with our targets for the program. We continue to see good opportunities on the structured finance side. Although more capital is coming into that space and competing with us, we're relying on our superior origination teams to continue sourcing good product. And I would say our pipeline for the second quarter is looking very strong right now in the structured finance business. ","And then on the financing side, our big activity in the quarter was closing the 1515 financing, which actually predated their lease with Viacom, although we've built in certain pre-approvals that gave us flexibility to do a lease like the one we did with Viacom. This was a major balance sheet deal by Bank of China, who's been our strongest lending partner over the past 24 to 36 months. A 7-year term deal on this asset, giving us great prepayment flexibility, the ability to swap or keep it as a LIBOR floater and a lot of other unique features that a balance sheet lender brings to the table. So we thank again, Bank of China, for their confidence in us, and we appreciate the relationship and the amount of business we've been able to do with them. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Jim.","James E. Mead","Thanks, Andrew. We've been reporting over the last number of quarters a large volume of ads that we've taken advantage of, really unique market circumstance. And we've also said in the past that we have access to liquidity that few other companies do. And this quarter was no different as we, in the face of all that investment activity, we ended the quarter and today are sitting with more than $1 billion of immediately available funds. And again, this is demonstrating that access came in a number of ways. During the quarter we had over $1.1 billion of mortgage executions to partially finance our acquisition activity. And that included the $775 million mortgage that, on 1515 Broadway, that Andrew just mentioned. We also supplemented that with about $650 million of asset sales that included 292 Madison, retail condos at 141 Fifth and the in-contract sales of 379 West Broadway in One Court Square. And we finally and, I'll say, prudently tapped the common equity market through our ATM and DRIP programs for about $280 million. Using those programs, we achieved an average selling price of $77 a share in comparison to our volume-weighted average price during the quarter of about $75, so we executed a sales price about 3% above the volume-weighted average price for the quarter, which is a good metric to use as an example of the success we've had and, I'll say also, with very little offering expenses. So the way we've entered the equity market, I think, has been very intelligent and also very efficient for our shareholders.","With that, I'll turn it over to Matt for some comments.","Matt DiLiberto","Thanks, Jim. While our earnings results have seemed to fail in comparison to the other news we put out over the last 24 hours, there are a couple of meaningful things to take away from the very solid results we posted for many expected to be a ho-hum first quarter. Overall, our results were in-line with or slightly ahead of our expectations. Most notably our same-store portfolio, which grew by 7 properties in the first quarter, posted strong cash NOI growth year-over-year of 6.2%. The substantial improvement in this metric, which excluded  accounting noise of straight-line rents and FAS 141 adjustments, continues to be due in large part to our leasing efforts, which have driven occupancy increases in the same-store portfolio for 6 quarters in a row. 100 Church Street now stands at nearly 82% occupancy. We have increased occupancy at core holdings like Tower 45 and 1350 Avenue of the Americas. Along with leasing, containment of our variable operating costs continues to be a focus of our property management teams and only serves to enhance the portfolio's performance. Of note, these positive same-store results also come in spite of the inclusion of 125 Park in the same-store pool during the first quarter. Recall that we acquired this property in 2010 with the expectation that the 143,000 square feet occupied by Meredith will be vacated at the end of 2011. Their leaving took the occupancy of the property down to 70% from 94%. While we were able to temporarily fill some of this vacant space with employees from Y&R as they await their move to 3 Columbus, this did not offset all the lost Meredith income in the first quarter. We also saw continued income expansion in our debt and preferred equity portfolio. With opportunities for new investments continuing to present themselves, our portfolio has now grown to just under $1 billion on a book basis, with a very healthy average yield of around 9.7%, up from just over 8.25% at December 31.","Finally, significant onetimers were virtually nonexistent in the first quarter. Within other income along with the recurring income generated from third-party management fees, leasing commissions and lease cancellation income, we recognized approximately $2 million and other ancillary fees. With regard to our 2012 guidance, our activity in the -- just the first 4 months of 2012 has been brisk, including new investment activity, the issuance of $280 million of common equity, the refinancing of 1515 Broadway and an incredible amount of leasing. Taken as a whole, with the strong performance of our core portfolio, we are raising our FFO guidance range from $4.45 to $4.55 per share to $4.50 to $4.60 per share for 2012.","Turning to FAD. Among the other activity we need to take into consideration, some of the capital we have committed for the Viacom deal, all of which is considered second-generation capital, which was obviously not contemplated in our original guidance. As such, we are revising our FAD guidance from $2.70 to $2.80 per share to $2.50 to $2.60 per share. Given the magnitude and importance of this lease, this is some of the best capital the company will put to work in 2012. With that, I'll turn it back over to Marc.","Marc Holliday","Okay. Thanks. A few final comments, then we'll open it up to Q&A. First, as to the overall health of the New York City economy and leasing market, I would say that things from our perspective seem to be relatively on track and consistent with our expectations and our communications to the market back in December. Job growth continues to occur in areas like professional services, media, information and technology. And those jobs are offset in part, but not completely, by continuing the very modest job losses in the finance sector. This market backdrop enabled us to achieve our goals for Q1 as it related to increases in occupancy and mark-to-market rental increases on rollover. Furthermore, as it relates to where our balance sheet stands, you heard Jim talk about our equity funding program that we've been executing throughout much or all of 2011 and 2012. Combined with our asset sale program, which has allowed us to maintain a debt-to-total asset level of around 45%, which has been fairly consistent, and while debt to EBITDA is hovering somewhere in the 8.5x range, that is before factoring in approximately $1 per share of FFO, that we are projecting to realize from our transitional and recently acquired vacancy, which realization we expect to occur largely over the balance of this year, '13 and '14 and with order being realized by 2015. Notably, very proud of the fact that our current outstanding on the line of credit is $200 million and we pro forma that to be 0 throughout -- as we progress into the year. I think that is another notable milestone, if you will, one that we always believed and felt was completely manageable, outstanding and I think we did a very good job of over the past several years in chipping away strategically through asset sales, equity raises, term financings and strategically, but prudently, reducing that line of credit to pro forma 0 by the end of this year. And likely before, and I guess, to top everything off, to be doing all this activity, which is in our mind storing these chestnuts for future growth that will be realized largely in the future years and doing a significant amount of equitizing both through asset sales and equity raising, to be able to sit here today and raise our FFO guidance in light of all that, I think, is just a testament to the great work of all the employees of this firm. And we hope our shareholders are as excited about that as we are. So with that, I'd like to wrap this up and open up the phone now for some questions and answers.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Alex Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","On the Viacom deal, was there something that sort of prompted the whole -- the rush to get it done now given that, I think, the lease was through 2015? Was it the fear of them being courted by a developer to build -- whether Hudson Yards or something like that, where they might relocate? Or what sort of drove the rush to get it done right now?","Marc Holliday","Yes. I wouldn't use terms like fear and rush. I would say that it was just time. With a firm like Viacom, this was a very deliberate decision on their part. I think they had been evaluating their options for well over a year, if not years. But I think, they're the type of firm who has a little bit of cultural similarity to us. When your valuation's done and the decision is made, there's no reason to belabor extensive time-consuming negotiations and wasted resources. They knew what they wanted. We knew what we needed. And we've had a 10-year relationship with this firm at the highest levels, and we were able to, I would say, quickly and efficiently knock out a deal, which, I think, I would hope you would agree, is somewhat consistent with our pedigree. And I think Viacom, being a leading company in the media sector, as well as terrific M&A shop, and as well as with very deep financial capabilities, I just think you have 2 firms who don't believe in dragging out what's inevitable once the decision is made to move forward. So fear and rush I think is a little bit of a misnomer, I would just say, it was time to get it done and now it's time for each firm to kind of get on to other things because we each have big agendas.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","And then second question is, on the leasing front, just speaking to brokers hearing about like, let's say, Microsoft sort of looking in Midtown, as you guys see the tech and social media boom, especially emanating from Midtown South, are you seeing those tenants seriously consider expanding or relocating into Midtown? Or is your sense that most of those people are sort of just using the Midtown look around to try and retrade to get a deal in Midtown South or Chelsea or one of those submarkets?","James E. Mead","Well, you got to remember that the Midtown South-Chelsea market is actually a pretty small market, so there's no choice but those industries are only going to be able to find good space alternatives in Midtown, as much as we'd all like to have more product in Midtown South. Cool neighborhood, but it's too small to handle a very small industry.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Guinee with Stifel, Nicolaus.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just kind of some back-of-the envelope numbers, which I'm sure are very rough and very incorrect on Viacom: 1.75 million square-foot building, $80 -- $80 million of NOI, I think you mentioned is about $45 or $46 net. You come up with a value of $1.6 billion, $900 a foot. Can you give a little more color in terms of what the rental rates are on the office side of the equation? What the rental rates are in the retail side of the equation and how you come up with $80 million of NOI, kind of peel back the onion more out of curiosity than anything else?","Marc Holliday","Well, I don't know that we can componentize the entire $80 million on the phone. Although we are going to be putting up a little bit of a what I think what is called a microsite after this call, which is going to show quite exactly the NOI growth of this project from, I think, an inception of $35 million to $40 million when acquired in 2002, which we have doubled to, I think, what is $78 million for 2012. And we have some further bumps and escalation projected on to the future with that $80 million number that  I quoted you earlier being at stabilization as opposed to today because there's still some more bumps and other movement that'll get that 78 point something, up to 80% or more. But with that said, I encourage everyone -- at the end Heidi will give some guidance as to how people can access that microsite and when it will be available but certainly later today. As it relates to, which I quote, the mystery of the economics, we'll try and demystify this in very simple and basic terms. The rent, the total annual rent at Viacom we'll be paying is roughly equivalent or very, very similar to what they're currently paying today with $5 bumps out into $5 bumps every 5 years during their extension term. So that is roughly the economics of the office tower. The balance is from retail, and Andrew can shed a little more detail on the retail than I can.","Andrew W. Mathias","In terms of componentizing, I'm not sure how much aggregate NOI comes from the retail but we do -- the retailers -- the AIG Best Buy Theater, the Minskoff\/Nederlander Theater, where the Lion King is running, the A\u00e9ropostale flagship store. Viacom did renew their studio commitment for the 15 years through 2031 as part of the broader lease discussion. And then we have 3 stores, Billabong, Element and Oakley. Oakley has long-term lease. Billabong and Element are near term expirations. So there is some additional retail upside in the asset. And asset retail is a significant contributor to that NOI.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Great. And then a second question, Steve, can you drill down a little bit and talk about, besides all the activity in Midtown South, talk a little bit about which submarkets might be lagging and also talk about which price points are doing better than others. For example, as a big deal done at 1 New York Plaza was a low 40s, full-service price point. It sounds to me like Viacom was done in the mid-50s, so at just what price points are doing well and drill down some of the other submarkets besides the obvious ones.","Steven M. Durels","Well, what we're seeing across the portfolio is there's a lot of demand for kind of the classic value type of price points. That $45 to $65 pricing seems to be where a lot of deals are being transacted. We're seeing it in some of our buildings where there's Third Avenue or 485 Lexington or 521 Fifth, where we have pockets of space. The downtown stats, quite frankly, have been surprisingly good even though there have been some big deals done down there with moderate rents. But as far as the overall availability rates, it's a lot healthier than anybody would have projected a couple of years ago. Midtown South is as tight as a drum and Midtown, I think it's not so much the submarket, it's more the certain size ranges seem to be slower than other size ranges, kind of that 25,000-to-45,000-square-foot-type tenant seems to be slow demand right now. But counter that with sort of the small spaces, 5,000, 6,000 square-foot spaces, if it's nicely built, that stuff seems to be in very high demand. We're seeing at 600 Lexington Avenue continued very strong demand, probably the most activity that we've seen since we've owned the building. We've got 5 deals pending there right now, and we've got a bunch of pull-forward deals of this year. So I think it's very hard to say which of the submarkets is necessarily slow until you understand the size ranges that are slower, and that's not so much the area but more about specific sizes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sheila McGrath with KBW.","Sheila McGrath - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Now that you have the renewal metrics of Viacom and the capital required to get the tenant to renew, I was just wondering if you could walk us through how you view your pricing of your purchase of the 45% interest a year ago.","Marc Holliday","Well, the pricing, I believe, was about $1.2 billion. I mentioned earlier in the call where I thought NOI is or is soon to be ramping. And while I can't give you an exact value on how somebody would value that, you can apply whatever cap rates you want to that very stable NOI stream, and I think in most or all cases, you're going to come to a conclusion that it we're very pleased with the acquisition but, again, in fairness, it's a little bit of hindsight because when we purchased it, we uniquely took on the risk or opportunity, depending on your orientation in life, of having to make this critical lease deal or make the critical decision not to lease and then have to lease up in 2015, '16, '17. So that's not a -- it's not a small risk by any means or not a small opportunity. And I think the price a year ago or a year or more ago in a different market at a different time with that question unanswered versus what we believe the value to be today is obviously a little apples and oranges. But the question is, are we pleased with the overall performance of the building and both our original acquisition and our subsequent acquisition? And for that matter, our entire JV with SITQ has been a terrific partner of ours for probably a decade or so. This building, I think, is textbook case study, if you will, in value creation and good real estate execution.","Royal Shepard - S&P Equity Research","And my second question is on The Journal reported a number of tenants, Dewey Stockton [ph] and UBS, looking at putting sublease space on the market. I'm just wondering what your views of the trends in the sublease market are.","Steven M. Durels","The sublease availability is still pretty small right now. It's less than 3% of the availability rate overall. Those blocks that you're referring to, they were like $100,000 square feet a pop. So in the context of the overall supply, it's not that meaningful. We haven't seen a whole lot of new supply coming on and in conversing with brokers community, it's -- they're hard-pressed to really identify big blocks that are coming on. Doesn't mean it won't happen, but none that we've been able to identify to date.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rob Stevenson with Macquarie.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Steve, can you talk a little bit about what the latest is on 280 Park and what your leasing strategy is there and what the sort of timing looks like these days?","Steven M. Durels","We're deep in the development phase right now. We've completed the -- establishing our full scope of our developments. I think we're going to do a little bit of a presentation at NAREIT to really unveil it to everybody. But it it's going to be, and you've heard us said in the past, it is going to be transformative as far as what we're going to accomplish with the building. It's going to be unlike anything that's on Park Avenue right now. We're kind of lightly marketing it. It's a little premature until we get heavier into the construction phase, but shed and bridge went off this week. We're starting to work shortly on the fa\u00e7ade restoration. The heavy construction will start shortly thereafter. It'll be a 1.5-year project. Notwithstanding, the light marketing effort, I can tell you we've had a couple of very, very credible, significant expressions of interest from big tenants on the order of magnitude of 0.25 million square feet each. And we're conversing with those tenants. We're not suggesting that we're going to make a deal anytime soon because we think it's a little early in the market relative to our pricing expectations and what we have to present so far, but it's -- we're very excited about it and everybody that we have presented our development plan to have very quickly endorsed our thoughts.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then, can you guys also give us an update as to the newer retail assets that you guys have acquired and some of the assemblage that you need to do and tenanting and repositioning, where you are in the process there and how talks with potential tenants are going there?","Marc Holliday","Sure. 1552, 1560 as part of the purchase, we did give the selling tenant a year's occupancy there. So they are still in occupancy. That's TGI Friday's in Times Square, but we're actively marketing the site to a wide universe of interested retail, signage, and retail and signage tenants. Not clear how we're going to divide up the space, whether it will be one user or whether it will be multiple users for each of the different components, and those talks are going very well. I mean, there's a lot of interest in Times Square. There's not a lot of availability. And our product is very unique in terms of what we offer guys. Likewise, on 747 Madison, we've actually completed the series of transactions so that we can modify and offer higher ceiling height space within the box that we bought. One of the challenges was that a portion of the space was a bit ceiling-height challenged. We made a deal to buy out one of the apartments of the building above. We're going to be basically demolishing that apartment and offering it at higher ceiling height on the retail. We think that will be a hugely accretive purchase and one that we didn't underwrite when we bought the -- when we bought the condos. So we have ongoing discussion with several tenants on that space as well, so very strong in terms of the discussions and demand on the retail side.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Feldman with Bank of America.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I know there's a lot of discussion among the brokerage community that if Viacom had moved, it would really change your landscape of Times Square, that they're certainly looking downtown and even some of the developments on the West Side. I'm just curious, do you have a sense of why they did decide to stay beyond just the economic decision? And what is it about that area? And do you think this is a sign that maybe the pendulum will shift and you'll see more interest in Times Square?","Marc Holliday","Well, I think, we'd probably just be parroting some of the comments made by their CEO, Philippe Dauman, yesterday. But I think he views certainly a very strong connection to Times Square, where they've resided for over 20 years and have experienced almost unprecedented success for -- in becoming one of the world's leading media companies in that location. So I think created a certain bond and a certain recognition about corporate branding opportunities and corporate visibility and connection to Times Square and a connection to an area of town that is considered by many entertainment companies, not just Viacom, but Good Morning, America across the street. ESPN Zone was filming there for many years. And I think there's a recognition that it's just a -- it's an extraordinary opportunity now more than ever for them with signage, building-naming rights, LED signage cantilevering over Times Square. Their studio -- state-of-the art digital studio that was just rebuilt within the past few years, along with terraces overlooking Times Square. I mean, these are all major, major factors in addition to the building itself, which is in excess of 54 stories, 35,000 square-foot efficient floor plate center core, great lighting there on four sides. I mean, there was a lot to like there. I think the only thing I sensed they were considering was price in other areas. There were never an issue, I don't think, of location or building or anything like that and transportation to this area of town, subways, buses. It's -- you can point to other areas that are developing those kinds of transportation hubs, but nothing matches what's available like the bow tie of Times Square. I think that's a lot of what went into with but you'd have to get to them to get more specific on that point.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then back to the Midtown South kind of spillover question, what pockets of Midtown do you -- are you seeing benefits?","Marc Holliday","Pockets of Midtown?","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","What I mean in the submarkets within Midtown, where you're seeing the most interest from the tech or media tenants that would otherwise be in Midtown South but there's not enough space. Is it the Garment District? Is it around Grand Central?","Steven M. Durels","I don't think they're -- yes, I haven't seen them really coalesce around any one particular submarket.","Marc Holliday","Facebook is at 335 Madison. They would -- they certainly would have been a Midtown South tenant. Amazon is expanding aggressively in 1356 Avenue, our building.","Steven M. Durels","Yes, I mean, a perfect example is that 3 Columbus Circle, oddly enough, we leased it to Y&R, but the other competing tenant for that was Havas, so both creative advertising firms. We've had a couple of name-brand tech firms come very close to choosing the building, and we've had a couple of more funkier-type users, nontraditional type users consider the building as well. And in each case, those tenants have looked at that building relative to the Hudson Square, Midtown South, Flatiron neighborhoods. The tenants weren't coming from the more traditional kind of East-West across 57th Street, financial service, law-firm-type stuff. So I think to Andrew's point, it becomes very building specific. If it's something that the building has amenities that are unique or views that are unique or space that offers something where they can really create an environment for themselves, then that's where we're still seeing that kind of demand. And it will be great to see another neighborhood develop, but I don't know that that's happening.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Knott with Green Street Advisors.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Marc or Andrew, just curious if now that you've secured that and made it a elite core asset or whatever the terminology was you used, do you have any interest in potentially re-JV-ing  that asset again to sort of harvest some of that -- those gains?","Marc Holliday","We haven't decided yet. I mean, the ink is just drying on the lease. And it certainly sets up very well for a core JV, but it's also -- there's a lot of retail upside left in the building and that was part of what attracted us to make the buyout we did with SITQ. And that upside is yet to be realized. That's in the coming year. So we'll we look at it carefully. I mean, we've put the financing away for seven years, but it is floating rate so it gives us all the flexibility of a floating rate loan and the idea is to have -- to be able to unencumber it, encumber it. As a JV partner, ultimately, as sees fit, we wanted maximum flexibility with respect to the outside. I think that's the position we're in today.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","And then on the Random House lease site, I think they renewed for, call it, a little over half of their current space. Is that their permanent space going forward and so the other 40%, 45% is going to be on the market in a few years, is that right?","Steven M. Durels","They've -- they leased floors 2 through 13. So they took the more challenged portion of the building. That leaves us the Tower of the building, which it steps back a little bit a few floors up to some smaller floor plates with really spectacular views. They've already started to re-stack their occupancy and the balance of that space, they're going to go ahead and sublease that. They've already respect 3 floors -- 4 floors. They have another sublease pending with the 4th floor. We view those tenants as very good candidates for us to renew them in '18 at what will then be, we think, significantly higher rents than in today's world, and particularly given the fact that it's for the best part of the building.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","They took the low floors at $75 a foot, if I read supplemental right.","Steven M. Durels","Right.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Any guess on the upper floors today?","Steven M. Durels","Well, there's $75 on an essentially as-is deal with no free rent. So that's a pretty strong net effective rate. And I think the Tower is going to trade at a significant premium to that.","Marc Holliday","The Tower has some pretty spectacular views in that building.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo.","Blaine Heck - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Excluding the Random House lease, what was the releasing spread you guys saw this quarter in Manhattan?","Marc Holliday","1%.","Blaine Heck - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","1%. Okay. And then if I take a look at your consolidated same-store schedule in the supplemental, when I compare this quarter to last quarter, there seems to have been a significant move in the straight line revenue adjustments. I know you guys said there were 7 properties that moved into that, but was there any -- anything specific that drove that shift?","Matt DiLiberto","Yes. It's Matt, Blaine. It's 2 Herald Square and 885 Third. Those are our 2 fee deals, remember they had large straight line components, those were both added to the same-store pool this quarter. They were excluded after we had to buy out the 45% we didn't own in December 2010. So those are 2 of the 7 and the biggest driver of a straight line adjustment.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Attie with Citibank.","Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","What are your thoughts on the potential rezoning of Park Avenue that the Bloomberg administration has been pushing for? Do you think it's likely to occur? And how do you think it impacts the portfolio and the company in general?","Marc Holliday","Well, I think it's a little early to talk about impact until -- unless and until we have a better sense of what might occur under this current administration there. They are certainly seem to be going through the motions of looking at certain upzoning and\/or bonusable activities to spur some additional development in Midtown. I don't think it's limited to Park Avenue. And I think they're looking at a broader area of Midtown. But what ultimately comes of that, if it comes, when it comes, we'll have to see. But I think the basic fundamental underlying the exercise is a good one, which is, let's figure out ways to encourage and incentivize development in the areas of New York that have generally the highest rents and can economically support new development as an alternative to some of the other areas designated for development around the city, which rely on some element of subsidy to permit, if you will, below market rents for new construction, because the one constant that doesn't change from site to site generally is construction costs. That's somewhat of a constant. And Midtown and the prime areas of Midtown could support some new construction now or clearly in the future with some more rental growth and I think making sure that the city stays as competitive as possible, not just within the U.S. but around the world where other major world capitals are adding state-of-the-art new buildings to their commercial inventories. New York needs to keep pace with that. It's not a function necessarily of needing more space per se, because right now we seem to be at an equilibrium. We may in the future, but right now, we seem to be at an equilibrium, but it's just I think a natural objective to take, in some cases, older antiquated office inventory and convert it to state-of-the-art, brand-new office inventory and any kind of policies directed in that area we think are sound.","Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","[indiscernible] One quick follow-up on the Viacom, you talk a little bit about the signage and plazas and LED lighting and naming at the top of the building, is there any freed up opportunity for you to add and earn more income either by putting more signage or is that all effectively on Viacom and that's all embedded in their lease in terms of renewing at market or at their current rents?","Marc Holliday","This has been Andrew's baby from the outset with the sort of enhancing and maximizing these signage opportunities both in terms of what we've done and what we hope to do, so why don't you...","Andrew W. Mathias","On the 2 existing LED signs on the building, which are -- we added and lit up last year, those signs we entered into a partnership with Viacom on, so we'll enjoy a 50-50 ownership of those signs with Viacom. In terms of additional signage opportunities on the building, we retain the rights to those beyond the corporate branding that we committed to Viacom as part of the lease renewal. So there may be additional future signage opportunities at the building and we'll continue to explore those.","Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And effectively they get the signage at the top of the building but you retain everything else?","Andrew W. Mathias","They get certain corporate signage that was committed to specifically in the lease, but not the top of the building.","Steven M. Durels","The elements that they got would not have been practical to think that we could have developed them independent of Viacom because of the replacement and proximity to their window lines. So really everything else on the fa\u00e7ade is open for exploration.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","First and foremost, mea culpa. I was one of the ones that characterized the renewals as derisking, I guess. So...","Marc Holliday","Well, like I said, it's just a matter of perspective. It's not a wrong -- it's not a wrong point of view, just a different one.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Sure. The question I had is on 1515, did you mention the TI on the deal?","Marc Holliday","I don't know if we did or didn't, but, again, we certainly can. It's -- we had been modeling prior to this a 10-year renewal with TIs in the kind of $35 to $40 range. When the deal went to 15 years, we grossed that up pro rata and wound up at sort of a $55 TI, which is, our view, below to -- far below what a replacement tenant coming in without all the embedded infrastructure would naturally command in a market as opposed to a tenant like Viacom that still can utilize much of its infrastructure.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then on that lease, and I guess on Random House, I'm just curious on commencement. Did those new leases -- I guess more so on Random House given the uptick, does that new rate commence in 2020 from a cash flow perspective or from a GAAP perspective, rather? 2018.","Marc Holliday","Random House in 2018, yes. They and Viacom will pay their contractual rents through their existing lease maturities and then the new rates will kick in.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, and the structured finance pipeline, Andrew, you characterized it going into the second quarter as strong. I'm just curious given sort of the success in the capital markets continued sort of competition from lenders, I guess not as many mezz lenders, what do you see in -- and given the standoff you mentioned between buyers and sellers, what's causing it to be so strong?","Andrew W. Mathias","I think that standoff is leading a lot of guys to refinance as opposed to sell, and there is still sales activity out there and when it's properties that require real estate knowledge and expertise and they're not heavily leased and strongly cash flowing, we're oftentimes finding that gap in the capital structure between, call it, 50% and 70% and filling it with mezz or preferred equity.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","One more quick one in Random House. What was the impetus for the early renewal? 2018 was the expiration, did they come to you?","Steven M. Durels","It started off probably 1.5 years ago in early discussions. And we danced around a bit, but I think they came to conclusion that they wanted to restack and both sides, viewed it as a perfect opportunity to extend the lease as a result of that.","Marc Holliday","They wanted to spend capital as part of restacking and didn't -- really wanted some additional term in order to amortize that capital over a longer period.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just one quick clarification question. The mark-to-market for the quarter, excluding Random House, you said it's 1%, is that correct?","Marc Holliday","Yes. Unsigned, yes.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Unsigned. So what's the mark-to-market on the Random House piece then?","Marc Holliday","It's just under 50%.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And then the second question is, I know it's not a big part of your portfolio, but just can you talk a little about the Suburban portfolio and just opportunities within that either to sell assets or just to improve overall rent growth out of that portfolio?","Marc Holliday","There's still a pretty much of an overhang in that market. There's a lot of space that's available. I'd say the Stamford and Westchester markets are about 20% to 25% vacant. There's really no activity on the sales side. We continue to hold our own in a pretty challenging market, where our occupancy actually ticked up a bit to about 86.4%. So in terms of the ability to do sale, there doesn't seem to be a rather robust market there for both buyers and\/or sellers.","Marc Holliday","Right. Listen, people on the call who remain, unfortunately, we have a truncated call today. We intended to finish right now at 3:00. We have, as you can imagine, given things that are going ,on, we have a fairly substantial afternoon as it relates to some other things we continue to work on in rolling out this Viacom announcement. But we appreciate your questions today. We appreciate your continued support. We look forward to speaking with you again in 3 months' time. And one other thing I mentioned earlier, this microsite. It is live, I am told by Heidi. It is on our SL Green homepage, which I trust all of you know how to get to and it is...","Heidi Gillette","It's the 1515 logo towards the bottom of the page. You can click on that then it'll take you to the microsite.","Marc Holliday","Okay. So anyways, just a little -- some information and pictures and a little bit of chest thumping, chest more than anything else, on what we consider to be one of our profile achievements. So thank you, and we look forward to speaking with you soon. Operator?","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

This conference call is being recorded.","At this time, the company would like to remind our listeners that during the call, management may make forward-looking statements.

Thank you.","I will now turn the call over to Marc Holliday. Please go ahead, Marc.","Marc Holliday","Thank you. And, it's an absolutely glorious day here in New York City. The sun is shining and the stock is up, and we're glad you joined us for our first quarter earnings call. Andrew Mathias is back in the saddle and with us today after this surgery. And, we look forward to answering all of your questions. But, first a few comments on the quarter and the outlook for New York City market. Our Q1 results by any measure were outstanding and indicative of our company there is firing on all cylinders. But, in my count, we've done over 70 of these earnings calls since IPO and they were none that I can remember with the earnings results, we're so complete and so satisfying.","On this past December 7, we set out for ourselves a host of intentionally challenging and specific goals and objectives with the hope and expectation of meeting all of them in 2016. On January 27 of this year, against global market headwinds, we reaffirmed our guidance evidencing the confidence we have in our company, ourselves, our market to continuously deliver superior results on both in absolute and relative basis. This is because our discerning approach to investing in assets with significant growth opportunity and the constant recycling of our portfolio enables us to generate market leading earnings growth while also assembling the highest quality property portfolio in New York City.","These activities have resulted in a steadily increasing funds from operations from just a $1.70 per share in our first year of being listed on the stock exchange to a normalized amount of approximately $7 per share estimated for the 2016, a rate of growth that is unsurpassed in our industry sector. Overall, New York City remains extremely solid, notwithstanding the dislocations we saw in the financial sector in December, January and the first half of February, volatility that has since leveled off.","New York is often perceived to be heavily dependent upon the financial services sector for jobs and office space demand. The reality however is that New York is by far the most compelling, diversified and resilient commercial property market in the country, possibly the world's and continues to attract businesses, and investment capital notwithstanding where we are at any one point in time in the market cycle. Further New York City dependence on the financial services industry has been reduced as other industry segments have proliferated such as media, technology, education, and healthcare. In fact, the financial services industry's contribution to incremental leasing absorption, has fallen in recent years from 34% of square footage leased to 24% of square footage leased over the last five years, thereby, reducing the occupancy risk if that sector were shed jobs, though we have not witnessed any material shutting.","Population, tourism, and job growth continue in New York City, with industry profiles more diversified and less reliant on any one sector than ever before. The first quarter numbers coming out of the Bureau of Labor Statistics was surprisingly strong for the first quarter as New York City added net new 38,000 private sector jobs, 11,000 of which were in the office using sectors of business services, fire, the fire sector, and information, and that's just in the first three months.","Obviously, if that pace continues into the second quarter, the city would have to revisit its 2016 forecast, for a private sector job creation, which was reduced by then to a still healthy total of 50,000 net new jobs earlier in the year, when they \u2013 when they revised that number. But as I said earlier, almost all of that job creation has been experienced just in the three months. While the city estimate is lower than the record-setting growth rate for the last five years, millions of square feet of positive office space absorption are still expected, and we have come out of the gate strong in 2016, with 850,000 square feet of Manhattan office leases signed in the first quarter alone, at a remarkable 39% cash rent mark-to-market. Furthermore in the first 21 days of April, just three weeks, we have leased an additional 72,000 square feet of Manhattan office space and the near-term leasing pipeline is similarly growing with 1.3 million square feet of Manhattan leases in active leasing negotiations out for signature or advanced stages of term sheets.","We are also very pleased to see that asset values in New York continue to hold up from their record levels in 2015 and demand from both domestic and international equity investors and commercial lenders remained strong, as evidenced by recent activity which exceeds $6 billion so far, notwithstanding the market pause that we saw in January and February.","Investors will be more discerning this year and certain asset classes like residential condominium projects, hotel and land will see values fall as investors concentrate on well-located income producing assets with embedded growth opportunity, the kind of assets that dominate SL Green's portfolio. Non-core or transitional office assets may see some downward pricing pressure but as money continues to flow, the quality, Manhattan commercial assets, it is likely that their values will remain relatively steadfast.","From an overall investment capital perspective, we are seeing a continued flow of money from foreign investors, sectors that we'd highlighted over the past few months and on the last call, Japan, China, Korea, Germany, Canadian money and still money coming from Middle East. These are investors and nations that regard New York as the safest and most attractive place to invest and diversify their holdings. A number of overnight reports made reference to our Q1 results being evidenced of a solid New York City market, and certainly that is a major contributing factor, but the much bigger story in my opinion is the way, in which we have positioned SL Green to be dominant force with this market and sector and to drive earnings and increases in shareholder equity, while running an aggressive \u2013 investment grade portfolio and investment grade balance sheet that represents less than 40% loan to value on a consolidated basis.","We've strategically fortified our company by upgrading and diversify our portfolio through selective acquisitions and dispositions, expanding business lines, but within our market and by operating a portfolio with a focus on long-term leases, high occupancy levels, lower annual lease roll and high credit quality tenants.","Despite our many successes, one significant frustration that we share with all of our investors is a stock price that does not merely reflect those accomplishments, does not correspond to the current value of our underlying assets, and undervalues the substantial additional growth embedded in our portfolio. For our shareholders, we will work relentlessly to illuminate value, continue our earnings progression, invest opportunistically, manager our liabilities and build substantial liquidity.","I want to thank you, and we'll open it up it for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Manny Korchman with Citi. You may begin.","Manny Korchman","Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Marc, if we just look at the \u2013 the forecast and the actual job creation, do you think they were just sort of light on the forecast and maybe do you have any idea of why they would have been in light of the forecast early in the year, was it just scare because of volatility or were there other deeper trends going on and now you think that those have abated a little bit?","Marc Holliday","Well, I think that there's \u2013 the environment as it's played out was probably different than when the forecasts were being made and they might have been a little too conservative going into it. So, we'll see how it plays out, the year is only three months over. But I think, they were looking at downward estimates of GDP, they were looking at what the effect of the minimum, $15 minimum wage was going to have on jobs in the city.","And I think that they \u2013 you have to \u2013 remember at 50,000 jobs it's still by most accounts an extraordinary \u2013 extraordinarily high number. So, I don't think they were looking at it as being conservative or fearful or concerned. I think that was maybe misinterpreted on this call three months ago, that a 50,000 job creation number in the private sector, is somehow a number that is \u2013 has a negative connotation to it, the contrary it's a strong number.","Now, will the city exceed that, clearly if it stays on the path it's on, it will not just exceed it, it will blow it away. But these things have a seasonality profit to it, and you have to let more than three months past, to see exactly where things level off. But clearly sitting here, through what hopefully was \u2013 will be the worst part of the market for us, having seen that kind of robustness not only evidenced in the jobs numbers, but in the leasing statistics, gives us much better confidence as we sit here today.","Manny Korchman","And then maybe switching to One Vanderbilt, I was hoping if you could give us an update on where you are in discussions for both the JV on that project and construction financing and maybe a leasing update as well if you have anything?","Marc Holliday","Okay. Let's cover One Vanderbilt. So, we will bring in Steve and Andrew and others as part of the conversation, but I just want to lead it off by saying, in general I want everyone on the phone to understand this is a spectacular project that has been extraordinarily well received by lenders, brokers, perspective tenants and perspective JV partners. There is an intense amount of scrutiny for this one investment and understandably, because it's a large development but, I would say to you that, this is going to be the premier project, probably in the city, maybe the world, when this is completed. That's how we feel about this project, and that's the kind of feedback we've got in from every single player we have presented this to.","Now in terms of the financing, the financing is going exceedingly well, we still are on track for what we hope will be a closing in completion by the end of this summer, which is what we said on the last call. And then following that we will focus in on equity capitalizations from JV partners, understanding that we get called daily on this, we have a queue of potential interested investors that's not measured in the \u2013 that doesn't and its measured in the 50 to 100.","And it's a matter of us being very deliberate about -- going about this very long-term project and make sure we get it exactly right and the first order of business is the financing and completion of the demolition and the beginning of excavation, which starts this summer, the finalization of our marketing materials which are spectacular and which many of our investors will get to see in December and then getting out on the road and finding the right equity investor for us, we're committed to finding a partner for this project, I'm confident, we will have more than one party to choose from at the end of the day and we'll be basically just bidding terms for who we think brings the most of the table, beyond just capital at the end of the day.","So, with that, let me turn over to Steve on the leasing side, what do you \u2013 what's your update there?","Steven Durels","We are presenting the building on a very regular basis to tenants. It gets rave reviews at the end of every presentation. I don't think, we've ever been involved with the project, where the presentation to perspective tenants is so well received. Our single greatest challenges quite frankly is that, we're five years out as far as being able to deliver.","So, that's very early in the timeline for tenants to be able to make decisions, notwithstanding that, we've presented this building to significant size tenants, if not once a week, sometimes as many as two times to three times a week. The majority of those tenants are either financial service related type businesses or very high-end international headquarters type companies. And I think that as \u2013 as time will tell but we have three tenants or four tenants that are doing active diligence on the building and I feel personally very, very confident about where we stand in the lease of process.","Manny Korchman","Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from John Kim of BMO Capital Markets. You may begin.","John Kim","Thank you. You accomplished 43% of your full year Manhattan leasing target in the first quarter alone. I'm just wondering, if there was any particular tipping point in the market or change in your strategy that basically open the flood gate?","Marc Holliday","Well, any change in strategy, I don't think there was a change in strategy, I think that there were a number of things that came together for us in some cases early, in some cases accelerated in future years. Credit Suisse, exercising renewal options for 170,000 somewhat square feet at 11 Madison was unexpected and not modeled than a huge boost, I think a positive sentiment on the market, huge boost for the asset, and I think it really cements exactly the reason why we think 11 Madison is as great as it is. And we had a very significant pipeline going into the first quarter. You heard me say that on the last call and a lot of it converted. And see if I don't know at least \u2013 no change in strategy per say just pre-leasing.","Unidentified Participant","No. Not at all. I think that's the point. We had a very full pipeline of not just perspective tenants. But since the fourth quarter of last year, we've had a significant number of leases that have either been ready for execution or have been in advanced stage of negation. And the stars aligned and we ended up converting a bunch of those transactions over and the good news behind that is that even with those conversions we've been able to refill that pipeline.","John Kim","There were some local reports that asking rents had declined in certain buildings, does that help you cause at all?","Marc Holliday","I don't think that had anything to do with Q1. There are two buildings or three buildings where we had pushed rents extremely hard, Tower 46, 10 East 53rd, and in those projects, we probably brought those back to $10 or so. So, well ahead of underwriting, but you don't really know where the market settles unless you push and then if you find you pushed a little too far than you recalibrate. That is excellent activity on those two projects, but I don't think that had anything to do with Q1.","Unidentified Participant","Yeah. And just to clarify some of that, the \u2013 where we adjusted some rents on those spaces that we had pushed rates ahead of \u2013 arguably ahead of the market, those adjustments were done on a select handful of spaces on only a few buildings. So, it was not all buildings and not all spaces by any special imaginations, in fact at the same times we had that we moderated some, we'd actually increased the rents on some of our other space. So, it's certainly got \u2013 that back out lost in the mix.","John Kim","Got it. And my second question is on One Vanderbilt and if you've seen evidence of increase in construction cost, that seems like it's permeating throughout the city and if there is a risk that cost will elevate above a $1,000 per square foot that we put the....?","Marc Holliday","Where are you hearing increase in construction costs permeating throughout city?","John Kim","Various sources across all of asset types?","Marc Holliday","I would say to the contrary, our experience had been increased in construction costs leading up to let's say, middle or end of 2015. My expectation is, you're going to see a leveling off or in certain of the trades possibly a slight decrease in construction costs relative to what we had projected because anything for One Vanderbilt, we took kind of a trend line of increases, which was substantial and then like added 5% a year compounders on top of that and then significant contingency on top of that.","So I mean, no, we're kind of set for whatever the market may bring, but I think that the reality maybe that we may catch or break here along with others building during this time period and over the next few years of possibly pricing that we hope we'll be right on target and maybe we can bring it inside. So, no, we don't see that.","John, you have to remember, most of our vertical construction here is in 2018 and 2019, and I think if you sort of survey the trades now, there's a little bit of concern about how much of a backlog they're going to have for 2018 and 2019, whereas, they're very busy, very engaged now building out a lot of residential projects. There is some concern that on the backend to that, there may some excess capacity which we intent to take advantage of on pricing.","John Kim","Thanks.","Marc Holliday","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from David Toti with BB&T. You may begin.","David Toti","Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just broadly, can you walk us through the acceleration of the 388 Greenwich deal and why that was moved up early, was that really sort of the buyer driving that or was it more of a call on the forward market conditions?","Marc Holliday","Well, I would say that it was \u2013 the buyer probably had more of a desire than we did. From our perspective, the deal was inked, and whether it closed next year or this year and we collect the earnings now or over time. I think, we were somewhat indifferent. I think we had heard a message from certain shareholders that now better than later, the economics make sense. But I would say that we were equally happy or really to go along with the mid-year, end of year closer as scheduled. So I would say more or less there were certain advantages probably for the buyer in this case, which drove the transaction for us. It worked out [Technical Difficulty]","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, please remain on your line, your conference call will resume momentarily. Once again, please remain on your line, your conference call will resume momentarily. Thank you.","David Toti","Does this mean I get to ask an extra question?","Operator","Once again, ladies and gentlemen, please remain on your line, you conference call will resume momentarily. Once again, ladies and gentlemen, please remain on your line, you conference call will resume momentarily.","You may begin.","Marc Holliday","Okay. David, did we cover your question there or we've got dropped \u2013 the line dropped.","David Toti","You did. I was sort of hoping again an extra question though.","Marc Holliday","No. So, follow-up the question.","David Toti","Just one more actually, which is more of a strategic question for you Marc, and obviously you're still pretty bullish on Metro New York City and confident about the market fundamentals. If we were to go into a weaker market conditions and we can sort of leave that open ended. How would your capital recycling strategy changed in the context of maybe lower rent growth or less sort of investor demand, would we seek significant shifts in activity?","Marc Holliday","It's hard to say, Dave. I mean, we are the most active capital recyclers, right, by far. We sell, certainly, by number of properties more in a year than any of our re-peers. So, I guess the question is, if the market outlook worsens, how would that affect sale? I guess, to the extent, the market for sale is still there, but our outlook is worse than other investors, then you would continue to sell. I mean, that would be the natural inclination.","If everyone is on the same issue, then it becomes harder to sell, so your sales volume may take a pause until the margin gets better. So, we typically look at things when a property is ready for sale. We feel it's matured to a level that it's right to be harvested. It doesn't have any further strategic value for us or the ability to drive NOI over a five-year to 10-year period is below the average trend line for the portfolio. We will be much more readily desirous of either selling or JV-ing that asset, and we do that constantly. I mean, we do it annually and we do it inside.","So, I think if \u2013 we'll continue to do that. I guess the answer to your question would be, we'll continue to do it provided the market is there to do it, sometimes, the market isn't there. But right now, it's excellent. There's a lot of demand for New York assets. I'd say, as much demand is there was last year, the demand has just shifted as I said in my remarks. I think it's a little more discerning. I think it's really focused in highly on quality and income producing assets. It's in our sweet spot. So, we are actively pursuing sale and JV opportunities.","David Toti","Okay. Thanks for the detail today.","Marc Holliday","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Anthony Paolone with JPMorgan. You may begin.","Anthony Paolone","All right. Thanks. Good afternoon and nice quarter. First question is, with regards to the proceeds from the city sale, should we think about that as a permanent reduction in debt, as we start to think about 2017 estimates, now that this will have a full impact on next year or will these proceeds be used to make other investments. How do you think about it?","Matthew DiLiberto","Hey, Tony. It's Matt. So, we are going to use the proceeds from the sale for debt reduction unequivocally. In the interim, we are going to pay down our revolving credit facility and then in November, we are going to repay the $450 million mortgage on Lexington, which opens up for a repayment in November, that's a 5.6% debt position. So, it is going to use it for debt reduction.","Anthony Paolone","Okay. Thanks. And then I guess, second question for you. If I just look at your first quarter, the buck 85 times or 740 high and apples-to-apples, you've guided $7, I know relative to arm or you kind of beat us on almost every line item, like what roles are off in the next few quarters here?","Matthew DiLiberto","Yeah. In the first quarter Tony, we had $0.12 from write-off of that that was in the first quarter, that's not replicable in the second quarter, third quarter or fourth quarter, $0.07 from the repayment of the debt position. We would recognize that $0.07 over the course of the year, it was accelerated in the first quarter. We also had $0.05 of \u2013 one of our favorite topic says $1.41 income, of a 11 Madison that's attributable to 2015 that was in our guidance number, but again, it comes during the first quarter not for the remainder.","And as I look through other line items, lease termination income of $3.6 million is a couple of million dollars higher than you otherwise project for each coming quarter. So based on that, we said $0.05 given only three months of activity so far is a pretty healthy race and that's where we ended up.","Anthony Paolone","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. You may begin.","Alexander Goldfarb","Hey, good afternoon. Two questions, first Mark, in your opening comments, I think talked about you guys focused on relentlessly growing earnings at the same time closing the NAV gap. Given the demand in the market that you spoke about, what's your appetite for maybe sacrificing earnings growth in favor of selling or crystallizing some of that NAV discount?","Marc Holliday","Well, I think that's what you're seeing in this first quarter and probably for most of the second half of last year, was the continued illumination of value typically at prices that we see are well ahead of analysts and shareholder models, that bear out I think the NAVs that, I think are intuitive to people, we show it in December investor what the implied NAV looks like at market cap rates. You folks on the sell side have your own NAVs which average about a $135 per share. Through your models and many of our investors are at that level and higher.","So I think that we continue to illuminate that value through sales and we'll do that often. I think we've shown an extraordinary ability to one, recycle that capital into a very profitable undertakings and two, at this point in time, the recycling is less necessary because we have so much extraordinary embedded growth in the remainder of the growth portfolio in our retail portfolio and just through mark-to-market of our stabilized office portfolio. You don't need to do a lot of investing, if you are marking to market on a cash rent basis, well into the double-digit and you're leasing up retail assets like we did with Armani, like we did with McDonalds, like we did with Nordstrom at rents that are in X percent higher, their multiples higher 2 times, 3 times , 4 times what the expiring rent was.","So, we have that kind of embedded earnings velocity that will carry us through 2016 and 2017 and beyond without incremental investment, but obviously, we are \u2013 we do look for an incremental investments from time to time.","Alexander Goldfarb","Then Marc, if I understand you though. So, you are saying that if you guys accelerate disposition, the embedded growth in the mark-to-market in the growth portfolio is enough that you guys could still have positive FFO growth even if you sell more assets than you plan?","Marc Holliday","Yeah. I think the answer is generally yes because we've done it almost every year. But I don't want to make any statements now about 2017 because we don't have 2017 guidance out on the street. But I think you can sort of look back to the history of the company over last 19 years and draw your own conclusion from that. But we are not making now statements about 2017 or beyond, we'll do that later in the year.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. Second question is for Durels.","Marc Holliday","Okay. Go on.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. So, you guys leased about 850,000 square feet in the first quarter versus 2.5 all last year. The beginning of this year, the market sentiment was that everyone was on the sidelines pause given the volatility in the capital markets and yet obviously, leasing was very strong. So can you just help us understand the disconnect that sometimes we hear capital markets are upset and therefore tenants are on the sidelines not leasing space and yet clearly they were out leasing space in the midst of some pretty rough capital market activity?","Steven Durels","Well, I'm not certain there is a correlation between the capital markets and the fundamentals of the leasing market per se, but the \u2013 just to start with couple of data points. One is we've said for the last couple of quarters that we've had a very full pipeline of transactions. Two that pipeline had a great deal of diversity in the types of tenants that we were talking about. Three the feedback that we get from our tenants and perspective tenants as to how they view the health of their business and the hiring prospects and therefore, the rents \u2013 the space demands have really not moderated at all over the past year, even as we sit here today, which would explain why even in the face of doing 800,000 square feet we've been able to then replenish the pipeline.","So I sort of think that there is a \u2013 there was a lot of uncertainty in the market that people hadn't thought we're in the future health, but the reality is our tenants are still feeling very strong about where their business is, how it's performing, where their hiring is and therefore how much space they need.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. You may begin.","Steve Sakwa","Thanks. I guess first question to follow up on the leasing. Maybe Steve, could you talk a little bit about price points, and just where you're seeing the activity, my understanding is that the really, really high end of the market has really kind of taken a pause, maybe north of a $125 a foot. I'm just wondering if you could comment on kind of where your pipeline sits today in terms of price point, and have you experienced that \u2013 that same thing. And then I just I wanted to follow up on the mezz book, when you're finished?","Steven Durels","No, I really haven't seen any \u2013 any moderation on the deal volume on \u2013 on the high price point part of the market or any other part of the market quite frankly. And maybe the best example of that. Although I don't have a lot of products that have currently have a vacancy at a $125 or above, but I do have a plenty of product that's $80, $90, $100 kind of space, and maybe the two best examples of that, and where we're seeing transactional volumes, 10 East 53rd Street and Tower 46. 10 East 53rd Street, I'm \u2013 I'm enthusiastic as I said to Marc and Andrew yesterday. Yesterday alone, we converted five tenants over to leases out.","So all of a sudden that building, which is a $80 to $90 to a $100 kind of product is like on fire. And Tower 46, which is the Side Street, great quality product with side street location. Although, we haven't a signed a lot of deals there yet, we have a tremendous amount of perspective tenants coming through and are trading term sheets, with a number of very significant tenants at big rents in the mid $90 to a $100 price point. So we're feeling very bullish about the prospects for that building. And I think those are two very good parameters about the strength of the overall market, even at the very high price point.","Steve Sakwa","Okay. And I guess, I noticed that the mezz book did come down by several hundred million dollars. And I'm just wondering, is there a strategy at all to try and take that book down? I know there's been some investors that have been a big concerned about that. And well, I think it can be a lumpy quarter-to-quarter, but just kind of what your thoughts on making new investments there and how you think about payoffs and maybe shrinking that book?","Steven Durels","It's definitely, it's more quarter-to-quarter movements than any kind of strategy to reduce the book. To the contrary, we have a very active pipeline right now of investments. We did sell and syndicate a bunch of investments in the first quarter, so that brought it down and \u2013 but, not representative to any sort of a broader corporate strategy. We're still very dedicated to that business.","Steve Sakwa","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from John Guinee with Stifel. You may begin.","John Guinee","Great. Thank you. In 11 Madison Avenue, I think you bought that about a year ago, you had a while until it got to be stabilized. I think you've partitioned it into some candid and common positions, so that you may or may not be able to monetize a sellout a JV position? Where you are on 11 Madison?","Marc Holliday","Well, 11 is \u2013 we've owned it now, I think for about nine months. The Sony work is done and the tenant has moved in. I mentioned earlier, Credit Suisse exercised its renewals for the two floors that we could have got back, won't be getting back, that represented a very substantial mark-to-market. There is I think one space remaining about half a floor, if I'm correct, that we have significant activity on, and I would hoping in the next \u2013 in the near term, we'll go to lease on that vacant space, at which point the building will be basically fully leased at rents that average like $70 a foot in a market that is north $90 foot. So it's worked out excellent, it's got long-term debt in place. We will talk to investors that was something we had talked about setting up a JV for future years, stabilization of that meaning full rent paying is still about, I would say plus or minus 18 months to 24 months off.","So I think the maximum execution for something like that could be end of this year, maybe next year. In that regard, it's not part of our guidance, but it's there as a store house of cash and liquidities we can monetize, in the future to use for either for debt repayment or new acquisitions in the future. And by doing so, there is a little to no tax gain, the way we structured by selling that JV interest so that is one of those sort of well-structured deals and a deal that will be a little bit more opportunistic in our timing for generating those funds and redeploying those funds or for paying down debt.","John Guinee","Great. And then a follow-up question for Steve Durels, the headline is 39% rental rate increase $71 number. I guess, that means is coming off to $50 base. Can you give a little more color as to how, how sausage is made, what sort of a OpEx reset you'd have or base year reset you have? And what $71 would look like on a net basis? And then what sort of leasing commissions you should factor into that equation?","Steven Durels","So to just make sure we got the question, John. The question is on a $71 gross rent and just so I'm clear, where does the $71 come from? That's what...","Marc Holliday","Average starting rent.","Steven Durels","Average starting rent.","John Guinee","Average starting rate in place for the portfolio or no?","Steven Durels","No.","Marc Holliday","No.","Steven Durels","No. For the quarter.","John Guinee","For the quarter?","Steven Durels","Yeah.","John Guinee","Okay. And then of that $71, how much is \u2013 what kind of expenses and taxes go against that?","Andrew Mathias","Well, what's happening here is you're going from $51 full service to $71, your operating expenses are moving around in that equation. And I'm curious as to what the \u2013 is that rent is going from where to where and then also...","Matthew DiLiberto","Just \u2013 hey, John. Yeah, Andrew makes the point, the $51, we don't \u2013 other people quote like the nominal rent.","John Guinee","Yeah.","Matthew DiLiberto","We don't do that.","John Guinee","Okay.","Matthew DiLiberto","The $51 is as escalated.","John Guinee","Okay.","Matthew DiLiberto","So the $51 is base rent plus OpEx plus real estate tax. And when we say the rent is going from, I'm just using your numbers, can I have those in front of me, $51 to $71, that $20 increase is bottom-line. There is no expenses against the $20 because whatever Ops and taxes against it are in the $51, the $71 is the new rent, the cash mark-to-market is $20, that's all bottom-line stuff Matt, yes?","Andrew Mathias","Yes.","Marc Holliday","So that to be clear, we don't mark new rents to old base rents in which case you have to ask the question you just asked, this is better and more transparent, we're using fully escalated rents and then marking against that.","Matthew DiLiberto","And then the $71 generally comes with base year operating and taxes, starting roughly this year. So you pick up right where you left off in terms of escalate.","Marc Holliday","Right. So we're completely inflation protected on the $71 going forward.","John Guinee","Is it too much of a stretch to say going from 51 to 71 is a $20 increase in net rents or a $15 increase in net rents?","Matthew DiLiberto","I think, it's $20.","John Guinee","Fair enough. Thanks.","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jamey Feldman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may begin.","Jamie Feldman","Thank you. I'm hoping to just get more color on the transaction market. Mark, you had commented that pricings are holding firm. Can you just provide some more anecdotal evidence of what's going on out there in terms of deals we may see in the market in pricing or buyers that are lining up?","Marc Holliday","Sure. And I think, you saw 1285 sixth then the 787 Seventh close, so those were the two large transactions sort of from the end of fourth quarter. And then, there are a number of assets, an asset went to contract earlier this week on Wall Street that was market rate residential, that cap rate has a free handle on it, that's to the U.S opportunity fund. We've had a number of retail assets that are in the market that are drawing very strong bids, one of which on Fifth Avenue was reportedly under contract. So, that's not and I don't think, it's been publically announced yet.","Matthew DiLiberto","Yeah. There is probably in total about $6 billion to $8 billion worth of assets on the market now, some of those are going to be straight trades of office building, some large recaps both in midtown and downtown.","Marc Holliday","And then you saw in Brooklyn the watch tower portfolio go under contract, that's a large tract of land and an off commercial building, which is a complete redevelopment from sort of industrial space to office space as a plan, that drew very wide competition in pricing that pushed up to a level that I think exceeded the initial expectations in the market.","Matthew DiLiberto","Right.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. And then in terms of the buyers and their financing, is it still a more equity buyers, are you seeing leverage, what are the capital sources?","Marc Holliday","Well, I mean CMBS has come back and AAA spreads are in the $130s now from a wide of I'll call it $170s. So, I think CMBS is viable again. And there are a bunch of a CMBS deals are getting done currently in the city, but the bank market continues to be very active both syndicated loans, and bridge and bridge transitional loans. So it's a \u2013 it's a mix, I would say.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. And then my second question for Steve Durels, a couple of years ago you made the comment that there would be a premium for large blocks of the market, can you talk about what you're seeing today? And as we are seeing more blocks come in the market, just sensing your perspective on whether do you think that's a risk to the market or do you think that there is a still a premium for those kinds of space?","Steven Durels","I think there is a still a premium in all reality because if you're a tenant who goes out, looking for a couple of hundred thousand square feet and you need that space, relatively a reasonable timeline is the next 12 months to 18 months, 24 months. Your availabilities, your selections are pretty thin because not all of the blocks are created equal either because of geographic or space quality or price point or delivery timeline, whatever it maybe. So if you \u2013 if a tenant try to lease lot of these type of blocks as opposed to the landlord turnaround, saying I'm going to lease it floor by floor. I think \u2013 I think I would still expect to see a premium on the \u2013 on the bigger block.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. And then do you see heightened risk of sub-lease base going on the market here?","Steven Durels","No, I don't. And if you look statically, we're at the low end historically of sub-lease availability, even the most recent stats that have come out from various brokerage houses, I think it's like a 1.7% or something like that. It's \u2013 it's not very, very modest and quite frankly with the phenomenon of densification in the market, even if we were to hit a rocky point, where tenants laid off employees, it becomes very difficult for a tenant, they then put space on the sub-lease market because they've had so many people into their spaces. So I don't see it near term, and I'm \u2013 don't see any indictors to suggest that is an issue to worry about for the balance of this year.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Ross Nussbaum with UBS. You may begin.","Ross Nussbaum","Hey, good afternoon. [Indiscernible]. Marc, can you talk about one of your goals, or actually I think it was two of your goals from the Investor Day last December, were relating to acquisitions of both office and retail, and I think in total you had over a billion combined of office and retail acquisitions in the goal category for this year, now that we're almost four months through the year, how do you feel about that goal, I guess in relation to the current state affairs in New York and the volatility that we're seeing in the capital markets?","Marc Holliday","I didn't listen that last piece you said, given the volatility of the capital markets?","Ross Nussbaum","Yeah, I'm just curious of the state of affairs in the world over the last four months, have they shifted the goalposts for those original goals that you put out?","Marc Holliday","Got you. Okay. So, we just clarify one thing upfront on the acquisition targets, which we said on the last call and said in December Investor Day, I want to say it again now. Those goals that were originally set forth as we \u2013 as they always are when we put those goals forth, our growth targets. So, it doesn't account for deals we do in joint venture. So I can give you an example, there is a residential asset that we're looking at in pipeline, very good off market kind of situation, where we might be anywhere between call it roughly a third to half the asset, if that thing turns out and not \u2013 I remember \u2013 well, won't. That would be a gross value even though, A, our share, it would be for less and B, joint ventures tend to have secured debts, so the equity component of the JV of an asset tends to be quite small.","So when people hear a $1 billion, $1.5 billion of investment activity in equity and that's the wrong way to think. The equity component that a $1 billion, $1.5 billion is far, far less, that's A. B, I would say four months into the year, the office goal is probably something we'll reassess the year possibly downward because we certainly don't have a pipeline now that comes anywhere close to that number but the way these things go, the assets in New York are big, a deal could pop up second half of the year or towards the end of the year, that might be of a size to make some kind of dent nickel, but it's not \u2013 right now our focus has really been on the things we've talked about, which is consummation of the city deal that's done, certain sales in JV s that we are out there in the market, which then have made good progress with today and we'll continue to work on that through the balance of the year. There is a pipeline of some retail resi and office asset that could or could not come together between now and the end of the year. If we do, they will be deals that we think are going to be highly accretive to value in earnings in the future or else in a market like this, we would \u2013 we would be more discerning as our other investors. So we're only looking for deals that we think have high value-add for somebody like us in this market.","But I would say the office component is probably something that could come in less than originally budgeted. The retail, too early to say, it's only April, I won't even make any assessments there. Because the number for resi REIT I think was $500 million in total. So $500 million in total, if the $50 million JV, it's $250 million if delivered, that's a hundred and some odd million dollars of investment. You could do that like \u2013 you could do that in December. I couldn't sit here in April and predict it, but I can say there is nothing near-term in pipeline that would have us reaching those goals anytime in the next quarter.","Nick Yulico","Hi, hey, it's Nick. I just had a question on the Omnicom renewal. So I guess, there is still over 300,000 square feet that Omnicom did not renew. Could you remind us where in the building those floors are and what are your plans there, there was some talk I guess there was an article the other day about, how you're exploring selling a condo interest in that \u2013 in that space, could you just give us an update on what's going on there?","Marc Holliday","Sure, the article was a little premature, but the reality is that we're in very advanced discussions in negotiation of a transaction with a tenant for a leasehold condominium. So it's not a sale of a condominium perpetuity, it's a leasehold condominium which has a finite life toward of 30 years. And that transaction is expected to close in the next several months, it's really just subject to a couple of outstanding approvals. But that will take care of the lion share of the Omnicom space which is over 300,000 square feet.","I think the second thing to note about that is that \u2013 and it's a good segue into the following fact which is of that 300,000 square feet that will knock off a big chunk of our 2017 lease expirations of which we've already signed almost 460,000 square feet of leases for 2017 and have another 500,000 square feet including in this deal we just talked about in active negotiation. So we're way-way ahead as far as being able to knock down our 2017 expirations.","Nick Yulico","That's helpful. And just quickly I mean and understanding you may now want to give sort of full economics. But how do you \u2013 how do we sort of think about the sort of economic impact here?","Marc Holliday","Nick, we're going to have to move on from that question, we're not in a position to discuss more than what Steve just said on the phone. Unfortunately. But...","Nick Yulico","Okay. Thanks.","Marc Holliday","...hopefully by next quarter...","Nick Yulico","Soon enough.","Marc Holliday","...soon up. Yeah. Hopefully. Sorry.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jon Petersen with Jefferies. You may begin.","Jon Petersen","Great. Thank you. I'm just curious if you can talk about the \u2013 obviously the leasing in the quarter was very strong, 850,000 square feet. I believe at the \u2013 in our Investor Day guidance was for 2.2 million square feet for the rest of the year. So, I was just hoping to get a little more context on, I know you didn't update your full year leasing guidance, but how should we think about this quarter and kind of what it implies for the remaining three quarters of the year?","Matthew DiLiberto","Well, it was a very \u2013 is an excellent start to the year. Obviously, we're trending ahead. We'll reevaluate probably at the next call and if there is any cause for guidance shift. I think we'll evaluate then. We certainly don't do it quarter-to-quarter and we'll see how thing bare out, but obviously I did mention there is a $1.3 million of pipeline. So, if we have a great second quarter and convert very high ratio of that $1.3 million, then we may have to look at that stat for upward revision.","Jon Petersen","All right.","Matthew DiLiberto","The goal would be the \u2013 $2.0 million to be declared.","Jon Petersen","Oh, $2.0 million. Okay. Then you are even closer. So, and just one other question, I mean we touched a little bit on retail. I'm curious what your thoughts are on rent industry retail in Manhattan, especially in the major corridors, Fifth Avenue, Times Square. Just kind of what your thoughts are on the durability in the growth of those over the next couple of years?","Marc Holliday","What we're seeing and experiencing is durability for sure. I think growth in retail rent has moderated in certain submarket Fifth Avenue and I would say Time Square as well. That's after multiple, multiple years of very significant compounded growth in those rents.","So, they are sort of leveled off, I would say, in those submarket, but then there are other submarkets in the city, Soho and Downtown particularly where we continue to see increases in rents.","Jon Petersen","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank. You may begin.","Vincent Chao","Hey, good afternoon, everyone. I think last quarter when you're talking about the pipeline of leasing, you noted that the mark-to-markets were pretty strong. I was just curious so that you can comment on a little bit on the pipeline, in terms of what kind of rental rates you're seeing in that pipeline, as well as the composition by industry and between new and renewal?","Marc Holliday","All I would say is, it's very healthy mark-to-market for the pipeline rents, in excess of our guidance, which I think was around 15% thereabouts. I would say that, incrementally that pipeline exceeds that mark-to-market. I would also say, it's not 39%. So, something in between.","Vincent Chao","Got it. And in terms of the \u2013 and sort of between new and renewal?","Marc Holliday","I'm sorry.","Vincent Chao","The sort out between new and renewal?","Marc Holliday","I don't know.","Matthew DiLiberto","On the mark-to-market.","Marc Holliday","I've had it in the past, I don't have that today. I think we got to get back to you on that, no, not on mark-to-market, just on pipeline.","Vincent Chao","All right.","Marc Holliday","How much is renewed, how much new? Give us a minute, we'll get it, we do have it and we'll come back to you. Okay?","Vincent Chao","Okay. And just maybe one other one if I could. I mean, it's a little bit maybe an odds with the contrary earlier about the type of the investor demand that you're seeing this year versus last. But you've sold a couple of suburban assets recently and it seems like the fundamentals there, have done pretty well, or looked pretty good for the last couple of quarters? I'm just curious, if there's an opportunity to do something larger?","Marc Holliday","Well, I mean, there's opportunities to do something large. I don't know that it's a strategic goal of ours to do something larger. The market is good for the better suburban assets. We \u2013 the guys in white planes have done extraordinary job of bringing that portfolio to a level that's far in excess of the market. Those suburban markets are highly impaired generally in the Tristate area with 20% vacancy rates and our occupancy levels far better than that and our average rent levels far better than that.","So, I think it's better for us as a company to take those assets sort of one-by-one and optimize and sell, there's no pressure, there's no, I don't see any pressure to something, I think, we should hold up a large size unless, unless we made extraordinary sense, but we like having that portfolio there to create longer term value with and continue to monetize and harvest as time goes on. I think, we've done an excellent job of stewardship on that portfolio as have the guys up in planes, and I think, we're reaping the awards for that now on some of these sales which had been occurring in 2015 and 2016.","Matthew DiLiberto","I'll just \u2013 just answer the first question of leases that we already have out for either signature or that are in active negotiation. The 650,000 square feet of new leases in negotiation and a 160,000 square feet of renewals. And then, I don't have the breakdown on the term sheets.","Vincent Chao","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo. You may begin.","Blaine Heck","Great. Thanks. So just following up on 388-390, I think, around the time, the city lease renewal was announced in early 2014, you guys estimated a 9.7% levered IRR for your holding period assuming that purchase option was executed in the period establish, so, I was wondering if you guys have run the math again, whether this early purchase agreement had any significant effect on that IRR?","Matthew DiLiberto","Yeah. The answer is yes. The 9%, 7%, or whatever the number you recorded, that was actually what I'll call yield towards which was an exercise at the end of 2020, I guess [indiscernible].","Andrew Mathias","Sometime in 2020. So by \u2013 so the way the deal is going down with an early exercise and the other components of that deal, the total IRR over, I think it's a nine-year period. So it's a nine-year annual compounded IRR of 10.9%.","Blaine Heck","Okay. Great. And then can you just give any update with regards to 1745 Broadway, last quarter it seemed as if though you might have something to announce by now?","Matthew DiLiberto","No, I mean, I think the \u2013 we continue to entertain offers on the asset, but nothing to announce \u2013 nothing to announce at this time and it's one of a number of assets we're exploring selling, but we're trying to optimize in terms of what we want to transacting or not.","Blaine Heck","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question...","Marc Holliday","We're going to have to \u2013 operator, I think we'll go to 03:15 because usually, we try to keep these to an hour. It's a courtesy to our shareholders and analysts. So we'll take another maybe seven or eight minutes of questions.","Operator","Okay. Our next question is from Craig Mailman with KeyBanc Capital Markets. You may begin.","Craig Mailman","Hi, guys. Just curious Marc with the updated kind of first quarter numbers here, if your view of market rent growth in Manhattan has changed at all relative to kind of where you're trending on the 4Q call?","Marc Holliday","No. I think the call that I had last time, we had said the rent spike that people were putting 5%, 7%, 10%, we thought that the second half of the year you might see something more in the single digits. And I think I said something along the lines of 2%, 3%. And I think at least from a underwriting perspective that's what we're going to continue to use and broadcast just for the second half of this year. We have given no guidance for 2017 and beyond. I could see a scenario where is the market settles and this job growth continues a pace that you could get into growth rates higher than that beyond this year, sort of, I could see that definitely occurring, but we're not making that call now, I would say pretty much no change in guidance for a back half of the year in the kind of 2% and 3% up in rents.","So, good with the emphasis being on up. I think there was again a misinterpretation by some on the last call that we had said down, there is no down, there is only up in our guidance and the question is up by how much?","Craig Mailman","Okay. That's helpful. Then, just secondly, I noticed the lease term is obviously went up from the leases in the first quarter, but anything else driving the rise in TIs this quarter?","Marc Holliday","I think the lease term probably went up as a result of the Credit Suisse.","Matthew DiLiberto","Yeah. 20-year...","Marc Holliday","The Credit Suisse is a 20-year lease.","Matthew DiLiberto","Yeah.","Marc Holliday","It's a function of \u2013 the ratio of how many leases that we do that are for new. First generation tenant is coming in to the portfolio as opposed to renewal deals. And frequently whether those \u2013 the length of the lease as opposed to whether it's a 15-year deal, 10-year deal, 5-year deal, that can drive the concession. So, there is no shift as far as the market goes. It's more function of \u2013 its variables of those specific transactions.","Craig Mailman","But I guess we're just looking TIs, look like they spiked the renewals kind of where the lion's share here. So, I'm just trying to reconcile those...","Matthew DiLiberto","So, when you say spike, let's just use exact number. So...","Craig Mailman","Well, you guys were \u2013 you guys were in the 50s on TIs this quarter, I think you were $17 last quarter.","Matthew DiLiberto","Yeah.","Craig Mailman","So Matt, can we look at that 10 points in deals, which is the bulk of the 50?","Matthew DiLiberto","Yeah, both. And we were 50 a couple quarters ago and 50 before that, I mean, it varies quarter-to-quarter and it's dependent on what buildings, at what rents or what term we're leasing space, so I think that's a pretty consistent trend across.","If I look at one large \u2013 one large renewal that had a full package because it's a 20 year renewal is the CSP Eleven Madison. So, while it is considered a renewal because [indiscernible]","Craig Mailman","Okay.","Matthew DiLiberto","... 20 year, actually 21 year because that goes up to 2037, so they get a full package with that and that's 180,000 square feet.","Marc Holliday","Yeah. Just to be clear, that was pursuant to contractual option, not that \u2013 it was negotiated by us that way. Their renewal provides no downtime and a significant mark-to-market, but their option also provided for a TI package because it is a 20 year lease to somebody like Credit Suisse making a 20 year commitment to 180,000 feet is going to want to refresh this space, so I don't see that as a \u2013 it's not a shift in market trend because it was embedded within the lease document.","Craig Mailman","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Brad Burke with Goldman Sachs. You may begin.","Brad Burke","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. And I wanted to ask on the big run, mark-to-market for the quarter. At your Investor Day, you brought up the embedded rent for the Credit Suisse space at $42 and you thought to normalized market rate for that space would be $87, so as we look at your lease spreads for the quarter, is it fair to say that, that was the big driver of the outsized result that you had?","Marc Holliday","No, no. This was really broad based. Matt can probably give you few other besides that one.","Matthew DiLiberto","Yeah. So, in addition to the Eleven Madison, mark-to-market. The Omnicom renewal at 220 East 42nd Street, about 167,000 square feet, had a mark-to-market even higher than that, north of 70%. And we also did a renewal at 100 Park, with a material mark-to-market, north of 30% there as well. So, it was very broad based. And even without those deals, that was a \u2013 we would be at approaching 20% mark-to-market, even excluding those three big ones [indiscernible].","Marc Holliday","Yeah. I don't think we \u2013 I don't think we did more than 20,000 square feet or 30,000 square feet of deals out of that 800,000 square feet that had a negative mark-to-market. Every other of the 800,000 square feet, every other transaction was positive mark-to-market in many \u2013 in most cases, obviously very, very substantial.","Brad Burke","Okay. So...","Marc Holliday","So, I think \u2013 do you have anything else, Brad?","Brad Burke","Yeah. And I guess, just the second one on the guidance, you're increasing it $0.05 per portfolio NOI and interest expense savings and I would assume that the interest expense savings is going to be more than $0.05, just by virtue of what you're going to be paying down over the course of the year. So, I was just hoping for better clarity on your expectations for property NOI, specifically versus the original guidance you gave in December?","Marc Holliday","That is much more property NOI than interest expense, if you look at what we're paying down in the short-term that is probably our lowest cost of debt capital because we're going to take the proceeds from 388 and repay our revolving our credit facility. We won't be repaying the \u2013 more expensive debt, the mortgage at 45 Lex until November or December. So, that benefit will really reap it's rewards in 2017.","Brad Burke","Okay. Thank you.","Marc Holliday","Thanks. We'll take one more \u2013 one last question, operator.","Operator","Our last question is from Joe Reagan with Green Street Advisors. You may begin.","Joseph Reagan","Thanks guys. And I think you've talked about getting debt to EBITDA down to about 7.5 times, 7.6 times, I believe perform of the city sale. I'm just wondering if that's still the right betting line for at the end of this year. And then, can you talk about your longer term debt to EBITDA target as we look out to 2017 and 2018?","Marc Holliday","Yeah. So, we are still on track for 7.6 times by year end as your first question. And that I think, on the math we've run is about a 30% \u2013 somewhere between the 35% to 37% debt to value on a consolidated basis, low 40s on a combined basis. And right within the strike zone of all the rating agencies. So, I think we will probably wind up taking it down further just based on \u2013 just based on \u2013 just based on how we're modeling not just the year, but some of our long-term plans going into next year and beyond and application of funds and while still keeping our early momentum.","And I think it will allow us to reduce that further. Although I would say, when you get into that 7%, 7.5% range, we view the portfolio as a pretty much completely de-risked and de-levered, especially given the cap rate environment we operate at, which is typically between 3.5% and 4.5% cap rate environment. Debt to EBITDA, I think, is not the best model to use. I know you guys use it and that's the one you like.","But there is also a notion of equity or embedded equity, which is more of a loan to value concept. And I think because New York is a very liquid market with anywhere between $40 billion to $70 billion year of transactions, you can't get a pretty good handle on the NAV, I know you guys carry a pretty high NAV for the company relative to where the stock price is. And if you look at the debt on a \u2013 debt to, I'll call it your NAV as opposed to debt to EBITDA, I think we would be sort of right in the middle or possibly even below peer average.","Joseph Reagan","Okay, thanks. And Steve it sounds like you're seeing pretty good broad-based leasing demand out there today, but just wondering if there is any submarkets or industries or tenant sizes that really stand out and seeing particularly good amount of activity?","Steven Durels","Well, the TAMI sector whether it's in our portfolio or in the overall market continues to be a big driver. But Marc in his opening comments I think spoke a little bit about the diversity of tenants and if you break it down of the deals that we have in pipeline, it's composed of TAMI being the leader, healthcare being a big chunk of it, financial services being a significant player, legal services and then general business services and even government to a certain extent are the five or six major industries. But the top four being TAMI, healthcare, financial services and legal. And I don't think that's really different today than what we were seeing through most of last year, quite frankly. And I think we take a lot of comfort from seeing that kind of diversity.","Joseph Reagan","And any submarkets stand out as particularly strong or soft?","Steven Durels","No. I think there is a lot of questions that we get about the West side meaning Midtown West, meaning Sixth Avenue in particular. And like a couple of years ago when Sixth Avenue had a bunch of vacancy. Sixth Avenue right now has probably got some of the biggest deals that are in negotiation. One of the big headline deals that's over there is the $0.5 million square feet going to Major League Baseball. So Midtown proper is a very active part of the marketplace and I think it's active on both East and west in all parts of Midtown. So I think Midtown is more active than Downtown right now, quite frankly. So I mean \u2013 and we're certainly feeling it in our portfolio.","Joseph Reagan","Great. I appreciate the color guys.","Steven Durels","Thank you.","Marc Holliday","Okay. Thank you, everyone for whoever is left on the call and we're happy to have shared this great quarter with everybody and look forward to speaking again in three months\u2019 time.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference.

This conference call is being recorded.","At this time, the company would like to remind listeners that during the call management may make forward-looking statements.

Additional information regarding factors that could cause such differences appear in the MD&A section of the company\u2019s Form 10-K and other reports filed by the company with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Also during today\u2019s conference call, the company may discuss non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC Regulation G.

Thank you.","I will now turn the call over to Marc Holliday. Please go ahead, Marc.","Marc Holliday","Okay. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. The results for the third quarter were very consistent with our prior guidance and commentary throughout the year. The results are reflective of a healthy market, one in which a new supply has been met with increasing demand associated with private sector job growth that is already exceeded last year\u2019s totals.","The level of uninterrupted job growth is record-setting in New York City and is a major contributor to the tick up in the third quarter leasing activity that is keeping overall vacancy between 9% and 10%. Leasing market conditions strengthened in the third quarter as Midtown experienced its highest amount of quarterly leasing activity in the past two years.","The October leasing reports, which are just coming out show that the quarterly net absorption registered about 1.5 million square feet of net absorption on total leasing activity of approximately 5 million square feet in Midtown, that\u2019s reflective of a 19% increase in the trailing five-year quarterly averages, primarily this activity was driven by financial services leasing activity, and we see that within our own portfolio.","Total citywide year-to-date leasing activity has topped 21 million square feet and the pipeline for big lease transaction in the fourth quarter looks sizable. So taking that down a level two within our own portfolio, we\u2019ve been able to sign year-to-date nearly 1.2 million square feet of commercial office leases in the Manhattan office portfolio, 489,000 square feet of which was done in Q3 alone. And our same-store net operating income increase of 1.9% trended up from the prior two quarters of the year and we expect that trend to continue.","Our leasing pipeline remains strong at 840,000 square feet, of which leases out for signature and a negotiation account for over 350,000 such square feet, and we have about a 0.5 million square feet of deals in term sheet \u2013 credible term sheet beyond that, that would more or less be deals for Q1 of 2018. This pipeline, the 840,000 square feet is larger than it was in early September, I think, when we last spoke about our pipeline results and this is continuing to build.","The mark-to-market on the deals we hope to close in the fourth quarter is approximately 11%, which would be within the range of our guidance for the year and consistent volumetrically with the goal of 1.6 million square feet of total leases signed. And this notwithstanding that the 1.6 million square foot stretch goal, that volume was double the amount of square footage that we had expiring in all of 2017.","While mark-to-market compressed in the second-half of the year, we hope to see this trend reverse itself, as leasing volumes increase consistent with the demand that I spoke of that was evident in Q3 and availability is a new construction on the West Side is reduced as that space leases up.","I also want to mention that yesterday, we closed on our acquisition of a joint venture interest in Worldwide Plaza. It\u2019s a trophy asset with attractive going in returns and excellent tenant roster. The relatively low price per square foot and significant future upside due to average in-place rents that are well below market made this opportunity highly appealing to us. It was also obviously highly financeable given the sub-4% interest rate for a 10-year fixed rate financing that we closed simultaneously with the acquisition.","So we are very pleased to be partnering on this asset with our longtime friends and business partners at RXR and with NYRT with whom we\u2019ve been in dialogue for quite some time now. And I think the Worldwide Plaza venture that you saw us close yesterday is definitely an outgrowth of that continuous dialogue we had with management and with the Board of NYRT over that period of time.","The asset provides us with a greater presence in an area of town we have done quite well with as in other investments, such as 3 Columbus and 1745 Broadway, and we look forward to having Worldwide Plaza be a part of our portfolio. Additionally, on the investments front, we continue to use our investment capital to buy back shares of stock in the company, something we consider to be an extremely attractive investment proposition that will yield benefits to shareholders in the near and long-term.","We\u2019ve taken a disciplined approach to the stock repurchases by funding this activity with proceeds of asset sales and internal cash flow and not through debt. I believe we saw the markets appreciation of that approach last week when we issued $500 million of corporate bonds at a 0.75% interest rate for a five-year term.","Our return to the unsecured bond market is the culmination of many years of deliberate efforts to position ourselves within the bondholder community for ready access to the bond market at attractive and competitive rates.","Before opening this up to Q&A, I want to turn it over to Matt, who will spend a few minutes discussing our quarterly earnings results, results that were highly consistent with the guidance we\u2019ve given throughout the year and at the beginning of the year. But guidance that I think was characterized in some cases as of below what expectations were. And I think, Matt will go through in detail exactly where our earnings were, why we\u2019re on track and why some of the consensus numbers out there were probably just wrong.","Matthew DiLiberto","Thanks, Marc. And we do want to get to your questions, so rather than click through all of the income statement line items, I\u2019m just going to hit the high points. Last night, we reported FFO per share of $1.49, which as Marc said, was below the street estimates, but is actually ahead of our internal estimates for the quarter by about $0.02 a share. Obviously, we don\u2019t provide quarterly guidance and we don\u2019t have any plans to, so one would think there must have been something off from street\u2019s numbers.","Important to note that these results are net of a $0.04 write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs related to the refinancing of 280 Park at the non-recurring item. In NOI, from a GAAP perspective, our properties continue to perform on plan for the first nine months of the year.","Looking specifically at the third quarter, we saw a reduction in rental revenues of about $5 million relative to the second quarter, primarily from $1.9 million of percentage rent at 1515 Broadway, which is recognized only in the second quarter of the year, when it is received as per the lease.","We also recognized about $2 million of FAS 141 income at 187 Broadway in the second quarter upon the commencement of our redevelopment. We also sold Sanford Towers, which closed in the third quarter. That reduced rental revenues by about $2 million versus last quarter.","This telegraphed reduction in rental revenue quarter-over-quarter was coupled with the normal increase in operating expenses that we see in the third quarter of every year, as real estate taxes reset on July 1, and there is the customary seasonality of utility expenses, which tend to be the highest in the third quarter and increased by $5 million over the second quarter of this year.","From a cash NOI perspective, our same-store cash NOI performance improved as expected during the quarter, bringing us to a 1.3% increase for the first nine months, or 1.9% excluding lease termination income. The 20 years lease termination income has been a very reliable source of revenue. And as a result, we\u2019ve always provided same-store cash NOI guidance, including that revenue stream.","This year, unfortunately has been different. Against the projection of $8 million of lease terminations income for the year, that\u2019s our historical average, we\u2019ve recorded only $2.5 million so far and we don\u2019t see much of any terminations income coming in the fourth quarter. This potential $5.5 million shortfall is a good news, bad news story.","The good news is that the tenants are still in place and occupancy is maintained. The bad news is that the shortfall weighs on earnings and same-store results such that we do not expect to hit our 2% to 3% same-store cash NOI guidance. However, excluding the effect of lease termination income, the customary way companies look at same-store performance, we expect to be within that range.","So we\u2019re taking a serious look at whether we should provide guidance going forward, excluding lease termination income since it\u2019s previously reliable revenue stream can obviously be unpredictable, and we do not want it to mask the underlying performance of the portfolio.","In the debt and preferred equity portfolio, the $51.5 million of investment income we recorded in the third quarter, inclusive of the investment income that runs to the JV income statement puts us well on track to achieve our $200 million target, as the portfolio performs in line with our expectations.","Relative to the second quarter, investment income dropped as a result of the $9 million of previously unrecognized interest income we recorded in the second quarter on a preferred equity investment at 885 Third. There was also $4 million less income recorded on our investments in 2 Herald Square in the third quarter, as they were put on non-accrual status in early August. All in all, the debt business remains healthy and completely scalable as we continue to find opportunities to invest at attractive returns in New York City.","With regard to guidance, back on September 21, we issued an 8-K where we again reiterated our full-year FFO guidance of 640 to 650 per share, as well as highlighting the charge we\u2019re going to take on the 280 Park refinancing and the placement of 2 Herald on non-accrualstatus, still not sure that everyone saw that filing or adjusted their numbers as a result as I look at the first call numbers.","Nothing in our third quarter results or our view of the fourth quarter necessitates us adjusting our guidance range at this time. Certainly, we would like to wrap up the year at the upper-end of the range. And I guess, everybody would, but with a shortfall in termination income of over $5 million, and $5 million that we projected to receive upon the repayment of a debt investment after the sponsors sold the property, which is now on hold, while we are maintaining our guidance range, we would now expect to be closer to the midpoint of the range versus the upper-end.","With that, we can open it up to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Craig Mailman with KeyBanc.","Craig Mailman","Hey, guys. Just curious if you could give us an update maybe on the status of the 1515 Broadway sale, or any other deals you may have out in the market?","Andrew Mathias","Sure, it\u2019s Andrew. 1515, it continues to be in negotiation as we indicated on last call, sale of JV interests are a lot more complex than the sale of real estate. So I think you saw us close 16 Court Street and several suburban sales in the quarter, 1515 still on track, but taking its time based on the complexity of the transaction we\u2019re doing that.","Craig Mailman","That\u2019s helpful. And then, Marc, of the 350,000 square feet out for signature, I mean, is that what you guys are kind of anticipating could close by quarter-end at this point?","Marc Holliday","Well, I mean, in addition to that, there\u2019s about a 0.5 million square feet in term sheet and some of that term sheet will migrate to close deals also. So our goal is typically to always hope to close just about all that\u2019s negotiating lease documents out for signature plus some portion of that term sheet.","So that\u2019ll put us right around the 1.6, we could be 50 high, 50 low. But at least as it sits provided everything in that in the lease out category makes and traditionally that\u2019s got a pretty high percentage attached to it. It would be 350 plus some portion of the $0.5 million of term sheet deals so far in third quarter.","Craig Mailman","And could you comment if any of that includes One Vanderbilt?","Marc Holliday","No, I can\u2019t really go into any detail on the composition of deals that we\u2019re kind of negotiating and chasing whether it\u2019s One Vanderbilt or any other building. I mean, that\u2019s this is a competitive market. We sign 250 leases a year. I think, we like to keep sort of illumination around any of those deals with regards to any of the buildings under wraps until \u2013 and when and until leases are finalized.","Craig Mailman","Great. Thanks.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.","John Kim","Good afternoon. I was wondering on the 4% cash re-leasing spread achieved this quarter, it\u2019s below what you indicated as far as mark-to-market for the rest of the year. But I was curious what the vintage was of the leases that were expiring this quarter that led to be relatively low re-lease spreads this quarter?","Marc Holliday","I think, we have to look, as I\u2019m not sure, if you\u2019re talking about vintage like when were the leases signed relative to now that we\u2019re being replaced. I mean, our average lease term is 10 years, but that\u2019s not sufficient to say, well, they\u2019re probably 10-year deals. We have to, I guess, take a look. We don\u2019t necessarily look at it in that context, but we certainly can.","But I\u2019d say, in general, they\u2019re probably 10-year plus deals, but that are rolling off. In some cases, maybe five to seven, in other cases, maybe longer. But we have to pull that together, Matt. Do we have anything close to that?","Matthew DiLiberto","Not, not on my fingertips. I just want to make clear, I mean, the one quarter that\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s all based on the leasing activity in any one quarter. So we had said early in the year, we\u2019re well exceeding our expectations, but as the pipeline had mark-to-market that was lower. And we had maintained for the full-year our 11% to 14% mark-to-market objective. And we said at 11% through nine months and Marc highlighted that the fourth quarter deals that we expect to sign are in the 11s as well. So we\u2019re sticking to that a 11% to 14% for the full-year when focused too much on a 4% quarter.","Stephen Green","Let me just to add to it to give you a little bit of color on it. It was \u2013 if you look at all the deals that we\u2019ve signed across the portfolio the majority of the buildings had a mark-to-market that was in line or better than what our guidance was. And the weighted average was really skewed by just two buildings. So if you look whole portfolio, the mark-to-market was well above 4% well in line of where our 11 plus guidance was. If not for those two buildings where we had a couple of high rent deals that had burned off.","John Kim","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then also on One Vanderbilt, can you just discuss the leasing achieved this quarter with the German banks and whether or not that fell into your underwriting range of 130 to 150 per square foot?","Marc Holliday","Stephen?","Stephen Green","It was safely within our underwrite assumptions.","Marc Holliday","I think it exceeded it.","Stephen Green","It did exceed it.","Marc Holliday","I think it exceeded. It\u2019s slightly exceeded underwriting. It was \u2013 certainly, within all the parameters, it was early. So I mean, in that respect, we didn\u2019t expect to sign anything in 2017, but the opportunity rose and there were a terrific institution and banking organization with whom we\u2019re happy welcome to One Vanderbilt, and we welcome them ahead of our schedule and so we have underwrite.","John Kim","When you say exceeded, I mean, above that range or just exceeded relative to where the floors were \u2013 floors that was leased at?","Stephen Green","So, obviously, we have underwrite rents for different portions of the building. And we\u2019ve been at weighted average for the entire building. And for the floor that was leased, that lease exceeded the underwriting.","John Kim","Got it. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O\u2019Neill.","Alexander Goldfarb","Hi, good afternoon. The first question is on Worldwide Plaza, can you guys just sort of walk us through how you think about that investment from a return of yield perspective, if Cravath renews and if they don\u2019t, if they \u2013 meaning that, you have to go out and relet that space?","Marc Holliday","Well, I\u2019ll start David here you can sort of chime in. I mean, I think the going in cap rate in the deal was upwards of 4.7% \u2013 4.75% obviously got some very efficient financing that we put in place, so those yields are increased, it\u2019s lease now \u2013 the overall, because Nomura is way below market. The average rent overall for the building is well below market, but long dated.","We think Cravath is a terrific tenant and they occupy some of the primaries of that building and there will be opportunities down the road with those tenants and others to \u2013 we think be able to tap into the embedded rent opportunity to create a value, which will be evidenced with some kind of value creation maybe recapitalize event three to five years down the road.","Leverage return should be certainly in the position we\u2019re in, because we only took 25% of the deal and our returns are fee enhanced double-digit returns. I don\u2019t know, David, you want anything to add or.","David Schonbraun","I think, it\u2019s a high cash on cash going in yield. I think, Cravath has seven years of term left. Nomura has more. As Marc said, it\u2019s a below market transactions, so I think there\u2019s a lot of upside and we have a lot of time to kind of work with the tenants and optimize the deal.","Alexander Goldfarb","But I mean, David, if you have to go and if they don\u2019t \u2013 if they choose to go elsewhere, presumably they\u2019re going to give you a few years ahead in advance. So just curious what your yields would be if you have to go backfill that space, just curious the impact from your underwriting on the transaction?","Matthew DiLiberto","I think we\u2019re comfortable with the rents that are in place and the market, so they\u2019re consistent.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. And the next question is for Matt. Matt, on the \u2013 sorry to bug you on guidance, but it sort of of imply sort of like a 1.61 on the fourth quarter. Are there any particular areas where we\u2019re going to see, whether it\u2019s increase in either seasonal income or maybe any sort of one-time items or operating expense or something that\u2019s going to drive this sort of $0.12 increase from where we are at \u2013 in the third quarter?","Matthew DiLiberto","Sure. Two big things. First, there was a $0.04 charge in the third quarter, so you just add that right back. And then seasonality is another probably $5 million to $6 million just at the property level, and then you have another couple million dollars or so of leases kicking in at various properties. So it\u2019s primarily property-driven and then the $0.04 charge non-recurring that we took in the quarter, third quarter.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. Thank you.","Matthew DiLiberto","Sure.","Operator","The next question comes from Manny Korchman with Citi.","Michael Bilerman","It\u2019s Michael Bilerman here with Manny. Marc, I\u2019m curious how you think about the cadence you\u2019ll have going forward either on the acquisition front of either buildings or of your stock relative to disposition volumes and bringing those in line? And I recognize, you\u2019re still negotiating 1515 and 600 Lexington is on the market, I\u2019m sure some other things that you have teed up. But how should investors think about when those decisions would be announced to the market to when you have the confidence to go out and put additional capital to work before those are done?","Marc Holliday","Well, Michael, we\u2019ve been doing this for a long time. So I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any shift here in cadence or otherwise in terms of how we approach the business, which is typically harvesting gains and reinvesting in high-quality opportunities. I think, that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done. I think that\u2019s what we\u2019ll continue to do. We sold 16 Court closed on that deal, regenerated those proceeds into Worldwide Plaza. We think it\u2019s an uptick in returns and in asset quality, 16 Court is a very good building.","And hopefully, the guys will do well with the building, but it\u2019s always for us about trying to lift same-store NOI CAGR, trying to lift portfolio value, trying to lift total returns. And the way we do \u2013 have done it historically, I think, we\u2019ll continue to do that is through a very measured, balanced approach of selling assets and using those proceeds generally tax efficiently to make new acquisitions and, of late, also looking at our stock, as you know, one additional, but attractive opportunity, which also would get a lot of attention for use of investment proceeds.","So I think, you\u2019ll see, as I said on the last call, when the question was asked, we\u2019d be doing stock buybacks and asset acquisitions, when we think the opportunities sort of check all the boxes from our standpoint with compelling returns being a big component of that.","Michael Bilerman","Should we expect sales in the fourth quarter at this point in terms of proceeds generated?","Marc Holliday","Well, I think, Andrew just answered that question, one or two questions ago about somebody. I mean, if you\u2019re calling a sale, a partial interest sale, I thought Andrew said, we\u2019re on track to try and complete 1515 by year-end. So, if that\u2019s the case and I have to say, yes, that we would expect to close more in this quarter.","Michael Bilerman","Okay. And then just a comment, I would agree providing same-store NOI without and with lease term fees, or just breakout lease term fees would be something that, I think would be very good. And then I know you won\u2019t provide quarterly guidance. But I do think providing any one-time items, clearly the entire analytical community was significantly higher than what you reported. So calling out any one-timers that may impact the quarter, I think will help not get some of these negative reactions when the numbers come out?","Marc Holliday","Yes. I\u2019m not sure, I would agree with the characterization of lease term fees as one-timers. We probably have 20 years of history where the lease terminations fees were fairly well projectable and recurring to the extent that I think to refer to them as one-timers is \u2013 could be misleading as\u2026","Michael Bilerman","I wasn\u2019t referring to\u2026","Marc Holliday","I don\u2019t want to debate it. It\u2019s under. It\u2019s under review, we\u2019ll take a look at it, whether we put it in, take it out, instead of 8 million, it\u2019s 4 million, we\u2019ll talk about that in December.","But I think, when you look at our track record year-after-year-after-year of projecting guidance and meeting that guidance, it\u2019s as good as \u2013 well, I\u2019m going to say, it\u2019s better than almost anybody on the street in terms of meeting our goals. And in many years, we are able to move up, in many years, we\u2019re within, very few, if any, years that we\u2019re down. so I think we do a very good job there. But thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Lewis with SunTrust.","Michael Lewis","Thanks. I just wanted to come back to Worldwide Plaza. There\u2019s a pretty sizable capital reserve there and New York REIT apparently thinks that, that building could be much more valuable, call it, two years when they intend to sell the other half of it. Given that it\u2019s well leased on long-term leases. I mean, do you see the same kind of opportunity? And what kind of is that capital spend going to be, or what are you going to spend it on?","Marc Holliday","You know what, I don\u2019t want to \u2013 it\u2019s really \u2013 NYRT\u2019s approach to the asset, I think, you really have to ask them about it. We believe it\u2019s a great asset with a great return profile, with embedded rents that are below market, great tenant roster. And we think we\u2019ll be able to create value, because that\u2019s what we do, us and along with Scott, I think, we both have a track record of figuring out ways even when the assets been sort of well cared for in prior hands.","It\u2019s our job to step into the situation, improve the asset maybe physically, maybe in other ways, maybe through some strategic leasing objectives that we\u2019re going to develop together and roll out over the years. I can\u2019t \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t want to sit here right now and sort of get into their business plan, their whole period whether it\u2019s achievable or not. I mean, we just spent $108 million to close the transaction yesterday that we think will have significant upside. And I think, generally, we\u2019ve proven that to be true.","So, generally are always, I\u2019m going to say in terms of assets that we\u2019ve come full circle on and those that we hold in portfolio. So we\u2019re very excited to be working with Scott and with NYRT. We will certainly move heaven and earth to try and \u2013 in the near-term, they view it as two. I referenced earlier three to five. I think, that\u2019s semantics. The point is in the near-term, let\u2019s create some value and then let\u2019s try and capitalize on the value.","Michael Lewis","Okay, great. My second question is about the debt and preferred equity book. It was a little less active this quarter. And I was wondering if that was just a function of the opportunities you just had in the quarter, which is a small time period, or it looks like also maybe the size of that book has gotten up maybe towards your upper limit as you\u2019d like to see that as a percentage of asset. So just curious there if the activity is due to either of those two things?","David Schonbraun","It\u2019s Dave. Now, look, as we\u2019ve said, it\u2019s a scalable business, I think, we\u2019ve said we\u2019re going to keep it to certain levels and we\u2019re at those levels right now. We actually have a large pipeline, there are some assets we sold in the last quarter. But it\u2019s not for lack of a pipeline, we have a large pipeline for the fourth quarter. But obviously, without growing the book significantly either we have to syndicate a lot of it or either sell other positions or have payoffs, or you\u2019re going to see lower origination volumes, or at least growth in asset.","Michael Lewis","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Nick Yulico with UBS.","Nick Yulico","Thanks. I think there has been two focal points of negativity on the New York City office market of late. First, talk \u2013 the net effective rents are down by some amount over the past year because of higher concessions? And secondly, the investment sales market is down meaningfully year-over-year. So somehow, I think the question is, does this mean that the New York City office market is just not as attractive as it was in recent years? I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts on that?","Marc Holliday","Well, let\u2019s say \u2013 there\u2019s two questions there. One has to deal with leasing concessions, one investment sales. Why don\u2019t we hit investment sales first. Andrew?","Andrew Mathias","I should go first. I think the volumes, obviously, are down year-over-year. I think a lot of that is reflective of the attractiveness of financing markets. And I also think you\u2019ve seen a lot of velocity in the very recent past with our trade of 16 Court, the trade of 685 Third on Third Avenue, which was a very positive trade for the market with a Japanese buyer, and the trades, which were announced at the NYRT assets, the Twitter and Red Bull buildings and the 36 and 38 Street buildings, the West Side collection, all of which were done at very strong pricing.","So I think the pricing has not been impacted. The velocity has been impacted, because of the attractiveness of that financing market and obviously the volumes do reflect it. But there is there\u2019s a healthy amount of transaction activity in the market. So I think you\u2019re missing some of the very large [indiscernible] like or other bellwether trades of some of the last couple of years, but there\u2019s still a healthy amount of velocity out there.","Isaac Zion","And just to add on, I think last year was the second largest year in terms of volume in the last decade. And in the last month or so about $3 billion to $4 billion worth of assets have actually hit the marketplace. This is Isaac, by the way","Marc Holliday","And then Steve on net effect, so a net effect is, I think is a real concession [Multiple Speakers]","Stephen Green","So we measure net effect is obviously relative to our budget so specific to our portfolio. And how the net effect is returning to the rest of the market, I don\u2019t think is as important commentary. But I can tell you that the net effect is on the 1.15 million square feet on year-to-date are actually up over budgets. Yes, concessions are higher than originally budget, but offset by higher rents. So, and I think that\u2019s further evidenced to what we keep trying to reemphasize the people that the market is better than some people sentiment.","Marc Holliday","Yes, and I would just \u2013 you shouldn\u2019t look at TIs much differently than other forms of expenses or even revenues. They will rise over time generally just due to the natural results of cost of construction. I mean, that\u2019s ultimately what you\u2019re getting at is what is a cost to build out space to a level that\u2019s acceptable for a level of rent. Over the years, that those construction costs are rising, hence the TIs rise, hence we budget for that.","We\u2019re probably right on budget in terms of our TIs. You guys see the numbers, they were \u2013 they\u2019re pretty much in line with the prior quarter and really the entire year. So if the answer \u2013 if the question is, are they higher? Yes, materially no. Is it in line with our budget? yes, or maybe, we\u2019ll do a little better. And is it offset by higher rents, which we are also achieving? Yes, and net effect as I guess on portfolio-wide they\u2019re up for us.","So it\u2019s in very hot markets, you can drive those concessions down, and in bad markets, you may have to \u2013 you see them spike. But in general markets like we have now, which are relatively balanced, it\u2019s typically in amount required to deliver a certain level of finish that is acceptable and customary for the kinds of tenants that are renting at these levels.","Nick Yulico","Okay. It\u2019s helpful. Just one of the question, you talked about the mark-to-market on a lease signings. If I look at the mark-to-market on commenced leases of 2% in the quarter number seemed low since you\u2019ve been over double-digit in the past year. So I\u2019m just wondering if there was some \u2013 single lease that that drove that commenced number well? Thanks.","Matthew DiLiberto","Joe, it\u2019s Matt. It\u2019s all a matter of timing. So, yes, there\u2019s probably something in there that drove the lower and then there will be something in the future quarter that drives it back to a normalized level, but it\u2019s all timing.","Marc Holliday","It\u2019s still the same pool of leases. [Multiple Speakers]","Nick Yulico","Yes, it\u2019s a matter of when...","Marc Holliday","[Multiple Speakers] is just leasing commenced, but\u2026","Nick Yulico","Yes we know\u2026","Marc Holliday","That will \u2013 the commenced leases were previously announced signed leases and today signed leases will be showing up as commenced next year. So I don\u2019t know that there\u2019s any \u2013 shouldn\u2019t be any real difference. I mean it\u2019s the same pool of leases eventually.","Nick Yulico","Okay. Well\u2026.","Marc Holliday","Next question on.","Operator","Our next question comes from James Feldman with Bank of America.","James Feldman","Great, thank you. I know you talked about earlier a good pipeline of large financial leasing activity is scheduled for the fourth quarter. I guess, Steve, can you just give more color on kind of just the tone and sentiment in the leasing market coming out of the summer and now that we\u2019re squarely into fall and looking ahead to fourth quarter and into next year, what seems like you might be changing or is it more of the same?","Stephen Green","Well, I think if you look at many of the brokerage reports who are just hitting the street now, what you\u2019re seeing is, third quarter was a very strong year, we\u2019re on track for market wise to have a very strong year through third quarter of 2017 there\u2019s been 24.5 million square feet of leases signed, by comparison to 2016 where there was just under 30 million signed for the entire year. You could sort of extrapolate that and say, okay we\u2019re going to have a very good year by historical terms.","A lot of our leasing that we\u2019ve seen in the portfolio in third quarter were dominated by financial services, legal and TAMI. And in the deals that we\u2019re negotiating now, it\u2019s primarily financial and legal less TAMI and that\u2019s not a function of less TAMI demand, it\u2019s more a function of the product that we have available right now.","So we\u2019ve got a wide diversity of tenant demand across the portfolio. And I don\u2019t think there\u2019s been any real change from what we said about the overall depth of the market either in price point or product cost, it\u2019s more of the same from what we\u2019ve been saying all year other than where we think that we\u2019re in a safe place to meet our targets.","James Feldman","Okay thanks. And then can you guys talk about just foreign capital any shifts there? Who \u2013 which country seem to be stepping up, who is pulling back and what that means for that transaction that might be on the market?","Marc Holliday","I think European and Japanese stepping up, China clearly pausing pending some of the outcomes of the meeting they\u2019re having now. And still a lot of interest on the debt side from Korean capital, they\u2019re fueling a lot of the deals out there and steady interest from Canadians.","James Feldman","And any change in underwriting assumptions?","Marc Holliday","No, no, I think people are still that both the debt submissions we\u2019re getting and the indications we\u2019re getting from the brokers as the people are pretty static in terms of underwriting assumptions still underwriting similar growth et cetera.","James Feldman","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nick Stelzner with Morgan Stanley.","Nicholas Stelzner","Taking the questions, on same-store NOI growth you said that you expect to hit the 2% to 3% range if you exclude termination income. You got 1.9% today, so just curious what the big ticket items are there \u2013 that will get you there through the end of the year?","Matthew DiLiberto","Well, I mean to get the 2% you kind of just need to maintain the 1.9 we achieved for the quarter, although we do expect to be slightly better in the fourth due in part to some of things I highlighted earlier, the property portfolio, seasonality that happens in the third quarter, so fourth quarter is definitionally better. And you will have some leases kick in in the fourth quarter and then we expect that trajectory to continue beyond the fourth quarter.","Nicholas Stelzner","Okay, great. And then just one other one on One Vanderbilt, how you characterize the tenant activity there? Also I know it\u2019s early and you discussed the lease systems on already, but in your conversation with tenants at One Vanderbilt, how do the rents and lease terms compare to what you originally expected?","Stephen Green","We\u2019re seeing we\u2019re doing a lot of tenant presentations and we are seeing a good strong enthusiasm from both the brokerage and the tenants that we\u2019re presenting to. So that\u2019s why we think we\u2019re right on plan as far as expectations and the dialogue that we\u2019re having with prospective tenants.","Nicholas Stelzner","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI.","Steve Sakwa","Thanks, I know you guys are going to be hosting in Investor Day in a month or so, so I don\u2019t want to jump too far ahead to 2018. But when I look at page 46 and I look at the lease expiration schedule, it looks like I\u2019m assuming that your current sort of average asking rent per foot is an updated kind of thought process on where the market is today. You\u2019ve got almost a 20% uplift on the consolidated and a slightly larger roll down on the unconsolidated or JV asset. Can you just maybe talk about what\u2019s going on in both of those buckets?","Matthew DiLiberto","Yes Steve it\u2019s Matt, so important to think about that\u2019s schedule and it includes retail. So it\u2019s not just office there. I think on the consolidated side the 20% up is probably influenced by retail. On the JV side, I think we have a couple of leases similar to what we saw in the third quarter here, where you have some maybe older-vintage leases with escalations that have pumped up the in-place rents. But nothing \u2013 we\u2019ll obviously give you much more guidance when we come out on December 4 with a view of 2018, but \u2013 and we\u2019ll do a lot more leasing beyond what you see expiring in that schedule. But that\u2019s the gist of what\u2019s going on in those numbers at this point.","Steve Sakwa","Okay. And then I guess, Marc, just going back to kind of capital deployment. I mean, I can appreciate you trying to sort of play in all thee buckets: Acquisitions, the DPE business and share buybacks. Just when you think about kind of the returns, how do they sort of stack up to one another? And, I mean, is there a spread or a difference that you want in sort of an acquisition versus the hare buyback versus the DPE? I\u2019m just sort of thinking about how you guys sort of look at it mechanically?","Marc Holliday","Well, the answer is, there is, but their risk-adjusted returns, obviously, is not just line up the returns.","Andrew Mathias","There\u2019s also tax considerations.","Marc Holliday","And tax considerations as well, and there\u2019s also platform considerations. A purchase of a building might incrementally at a moment in time be, let\u2019s call it, a lower IRR than a stock buyback. But the ability to scale up the platform, control more tenants, have more options to do the creative deals we do, which are sometimes multi-tenant deals, in order to unlock embedded rent growth or other ways we use our presence and scale in the city and relationship with these tenants to our overall portfolio advantage. It\u2019s not just \u2013 you won\u2019t get that with a stock buyback.","That stock buyback is literally more of a financial exercise, if you will, if something is trading cheap enough and you own it, you want to own more of it. And that\u2019s pretty compelling, it\u2019s also pretty \u2013 not risky, because you already own the asset. There\u2019s a lot of economic and strategic reasons why we will look to increase our asset portfolio particularly in parts of the market, where we may be underrepresented and want to be \u2013 have a great representation. And on the DPE, it\u2019s kind of a funny situation. Some people look at that as a risky form of business. We look at it as the only form of the \u2013 the only one of those three buckets that had significant equity subordination.","So with DPE, you\u2019re not left without a risk. We typically have approximately a 30% equity cushion on average, because we\u2019re 70% less dollar and yet we\u2019re still making 9%, 9.5%, in that range, sometimes 10%. So on a risk-adjusted basis, you could argue, that\u2019s one of the champions for the three buckets because of that equity subordination.","However, it also doesn\u2019t necessarily provide the scale and presence in an equity sense unless you\u2019re able to consensually use that DPE bucket to create pipeline, which obviously, we\u2019ve done successfully in the past. So there are qualitative reasons. There are quantitative reasons, all of them are kind of double-digit exercises. So, I mean, that goes without saying. But among the three buckets, we usually pick opportunities as they relate to themselves, which are the best equity deals? And when do we feel is the best time to buy stock? And I think right now, we are deploying into those three buckets on a very rational basis. Thanks.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Jed Reagan with Green Street Advisors.","Jed Reagan","Good morning, guys. I think you guys had put an acquisition target of $650 million or more for the year. I\u2019m just curious if you expect to reach that number. And then I was just interested on the comment you made about other parts of the market, where you feel like, you might be underrepresented. So just curious if you can talk a little bit about what those areas might be and why you like them?","Marc Holliday","Well, on the $650 million, that\u2019s always a gross target, that\u2019s not net equity never has been. So my instinct is, we\u2019re somewhere between very close or in excess, as we said, I guess, 25% Worldwide, so that would.","Matthew DiLiberto","Of course. Yes.","Marc Holliday","It doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t have more in pipeline. So we\u2019re working on some active pipeline right now. And whether those deals are fourth quarter deals or beginning of 2018, that seems a little too early to tell right now. But we\u2019re pretty much where we want to be on the acquisition front and on the disposition front.","As it relates to other parts of the market, we are obviously very invested in and have a major presence in the East Midtown market in particular. And one of the areas, as an example, that we think has great supply and demand metrics, low availability, almost nonexistent to big lots is Midtown South.","So I\u2019d say that\u2019s one of our real preferred areas of acquisition. Our last big acquisition prior to Worldwide was the One Madison in that area. We own One Madison. We own 304 Park Avenue South and two buildings on on Sixth Ave. And we\u2019re constantly scouring for more in that area, because we think the demand profile there, the types of tenants and the types of opportunities, which are somewhat limited given the inventory down there are particularly appealing.","So we\u2019ll try and do deals like that, even extrapolating that a little further downtown to 110 Greene, which we did about year-and-a-half ago. Those kinds of deals, which that has a significant office component at 110 Greene Street is our attempt to gain exposure in high-quality buildings in those submarkets, where we think there\u2019s relatively good demand.","Jed Reagan","Okay, I appreciate that. And then just curious what you guys are seeing on the ground in terms of the street retail environment, fundamentals-wise and cap rate trends, any changes there? And do you kind of given that, do you feel comfortable with your current positioning in that space?","Marc Holliday","I think we feel comfortable with our current position, because we\u2019re generally very well leased across our portfolio. There is definitely submarkets, where there\u2019s quite a bit of vacancy right now given sort of a lack of tenant demand, some combination of lack of tenant demand and slowness to adjust to asking price on rents. So there are definitely some markets with vacancy that are sort of shaking out.","We\u2019ve seen that type of shakeout before in various markets, Upper Madison, specifically Other submarkets come to mind. We\u2019re somewhat insulated from that, again, because we\u2019re generally pretty well leased on the retail side and we have good remaining term on our leases. And I think we feel comfortable with our positioning in the submarkets we\u2019re in.","Jed Reagan","And do you have a view on where kind of where cap rates are today for sort of stabilized street retail product?","Andrew Mathias","It\u2019s tough to tell, because it\u2019s so asset specific. You have in-place rents below market, at market, above market, remaining lease term short, long, medium. So there haven\u2019t been a lot of retail trades this year that give a lot of visibility into where cap rates are.","So I\u2019d hesitate to \u2013 I think there\u2019s an asset on the market now in SoHo that is now a major lease, which is fairly long in term, be curious to see where that trade prints. 522 Fifth was on the market. That asset hasn\u2019t cleared, but that would be another sort of an indicative trade. So it\u2019s sort of tough to peg exactly where cap rates are right now on the retail side.","Jed Reagan","Okay, fair enough. Thanks for the color.","Andrew Mathias","Thank you.","Operator","And I\u2019m not showing any further question at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to our host.","Marc Holliday","Okay, great. Thank you for the questions today. We look forward to seeing everyone about a month-and-a-half on December 4 for the investor meeting, which is going to be starting at 9:00 AM as we did last year. We promise it will be informative, as it always is, but also lively spirited. And hopefully, we\u2019ll have a lot of good things to talk about for the upcoming year and beyond. So we look forward to seeing everybody. Thanks.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this dose conclude today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day."]}}
