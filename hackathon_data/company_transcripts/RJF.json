As always, we appreciate your time and interest in Raymond James Financial. After I read the following disclosure, I'll turn the call over to Paul Reilly, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jeff Julien, our Chief Financial Officer. Following the prepared remarks, they will ask the operator to open the line for questions.","Certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, information concerning future strategic objectives, business prospects, financial results, acquisitions, our ability to successfully recruit and integrate financial advisers, anticipated results of litigation and regulatory developments or general economic conditions.","In addition, words such as believes, expects, plans and future conditional verbs such as will, could and would, as well as any other statement that necessarily depends on future events, are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Please note that forward-looking statements are subject to risks, and there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. We urge you to consider the risks described in our most recent Form 10-K and subsequent forms 10-Q, which is available on our website.","During today's call, we'll also use certain non-GAAP financial measures to provide information pertinent to our management's view of ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP measures should be read in conjunction with and not as a replacement for the corresponding GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures may be found in the schedule accompanying our press release.","So with that, I'll turn the call over to Paul Reilly, Chairman and CEO of Raymond James Financial. Paul?","Paul Reilly","Thanks, Paul, and I'm going to start off with a brief summary of the third quarter and turn over to Jeff Julian for details, and then try to give you some outlook, I guess, without trying to use the words will, could and should, according to Paul Shoukry.","Just returned from last week from our Raymond James Associates employee channel development conference. We had about 2,000 attendees, and in Raymond James fashion, 600 kids.","So if you don't think we're focused on the next generation of advisers, we start them early here at Raymond James. It was a great mood, very upbeat even off a grid payment change to the advisers just a few weeks earlier. I think they understood the need with the DOL for some changes, and we'll talk about that a little bit in the outlook.","First, I'm very proud of kind of the results this quarter, and I'm glad you have high expectations of us and most of the analysts have said it looks okay. I know that everyone has high expectations, but I think they're really very, very good results for the quarter. For the firm, record quarterly net revenue of $1.62 billion, up 20% from last year's third quarter and 4% from the preceding quarter.","Record quarterly net income of $183.4 million, up 46% from last year's third quarter, and 63% from the preceding quarter. Now that quarter was impacted by a legal reserve for JP. EPS fully diluted of $1.24, up 43% from last year's third quarter and 61% again from that preceding quarter. So I think very, very good numbers.","If you look at the adjusted quarterly net income, $185.5 million, up 34% from a year ago's third quarter - last year's third quarter and down 2% from the preceding quarter, and Jeff will get into a little bit of those details. So we certainly have had great growth across the business over this last year.","We had record net quarterly net revenues in PCG segment, AMS segment, and I mean, Asset Management Segment and RJ Bank. We had record quarterly pretax income in both Private Client Group and Asset Management Segments. And if you really look at the forward drivers of our business, we had record assets under administration of $664.4 billion, up 24% from last year's third quarter and up 3% sequentially. And we had record quarterly assets under administration of $91 billion, up 27% from a year ago's third quarter and 6% sequentially.","Record number of financial advisers, up to 7,285 and record net loans from RJ Bank of $16.6 billion. So that resulted in a quarterly ROE of 13.8% and quarterly adjusted ROE of 14% in what was really conservative capital levels. So overall, I think we've performed very well against them with any benchmark.","For the first 9 months, net revenue was $4.7 billion, up 19% over the first 9 months of 2016. Net income, $443 million, up 24% over the first 9 months of last year. And adjusted net income of $551 million, up 47%, so the same time period. And this is amidst really a complex changing environment with DOL. It's a very busy, almost stressful time for the firm, both in support, technology as we adapt to all the rules for advisers.","We have to explain to client a lot of these DOL changes and a lot that don't seem to make sense, but they are the law. So it's been very, very busy. So I want to thank all the Associates here, and especially the advisers, your work and your client focus during this time of change.","The Private Client Group net revenues were $1.1 billion, up 25% from last year's quarter. Pretax income, $128 million, up 56% from last year's quarter. Recruiting and retention remained at great levels and I think industry-leading, and also this quarter was helped by not just recruiting and retention but the Alex Brown and RE\/MAX acquisitions.","Short-term interest rates also benefited the Private Client Group, because 2\/3 of the interest rate impact, whether they're in interest or fees, really hit the Private Client Group. Market appreciation, we started the quarter 8% higher than the preceding quarter, again, all adding to this quarter's results. And we've also had increased utilization of fee-based accounts. A lot of it driven by DOL and other regulatory things. And they're now 44% of Private Client Group assets.","Capital markets, the quarterly net revenue of $259 million, up 3% from a year ago and 1% sequentially. Pretax of $35 million, up 6% over last year and down 16% sequentially. If you really look at the quarter, a very good M&A quarter driving investment banking revenues. We had a soft tax credit results for the quarter, and basically, with the uncertainty in the tax rates of between the sellers and buyers of the tax credit, there's been a slowness in the market.","It's to be expected until there's more certainty on future tax rates. Low volatility has really hurt all institutional commissions, both in fixed income and - And fixed income, obviously even more impacted with a flattening yield curve, although I think they've outperformed if you look at other people's results, our competitors have done a good job in this tough market.","Asset management had record quarterly net revenues of $126 million, up 24% over last year's quarter and up 8% sequentially. Record quarterly pretax of $43 million, up 33% over last year's quarter and 14% sequentially. And this was really driven by growth in AUM with a record $91 billion.","And as a result a lot of organic growth, conversion to fee-based accounts, we've had market appreciation, the net recruiting certainly helps asset management and we've had some net inflows even in CTA, our formal Carillon Towers Associates. So again, good results across that sector.","RJ Bank record quarterly net revenue of $150 million, up 19% over last year's quarter and 6% sequentially. Quarterly pretax of $100 million, up 12% over last year and 9% sequentially. Record loans of $16.6 billion, and we saw the increase and really kind of our business related loans, the SBO, mortgages and tax exempt, which is partially driven by public finance, and a modest decline in C&I loans for the quarter.","We've had continued expansion in the back of our agency-backed securities portfolio. So they've increased to $1.9 billion at the end of June. So the bank's NIM is up 6 basis points to 314 bps. This is due to the increase in short term rates, but partially offset by our agency-backed investments, which have lower rates but with the leverage better earnings.","Most importantly, our credit quality remains very good to satisfactory, nonperforming loans as a percent of total assets declined to 23 basis points from 52 a year ago and 27% last quarter.","So overall, very pleased with the strong performance. We have a lot of tailwinds, again, behind us starting this fourth quarter, which I'll discuss after Jeff goes through some key results. So Jeff?","Jeff Julien","Thank you, Paul.","I'll start with the biggest variances from the consensus model here, which again we appreciate you providing us with those models. It enables us to focus on the areas of difference rather than talking about each line item.","Investment banking revenues, as Paul mentioned, outperformed the consensus, really strong M&A more than offsetting the weakness in tax credit on syndication fees, as Paul just mentioned. We underperformed versus year expectations on net interest income, and I will talk about that in a little bit, there are - there's a clear reason for that.","We underperformed on compensation expense, and I guess we'll have to take a little mea culpa on this one. In the prior quarter, when we took the $100 million charge for the Jay Peak legal case, what we failed to mention was that, that had the effect of dampening some profit-based accruals around the firm, some are department-specific, some are firm-wide. It just depends where the charge happens to fall.","But around that particular charge, it was a little over 15% variable comp accruals related to that. So comp was sort of depressed by about $15 million or $16 million last quarter, and that's what sort of led to the extremely low comp ratio, I'll call it extremely low, but lower than this quarter. Comp ratio in the preceding quarter, which we should've mentioned that on the call, and we apologize for that. I think that would have probably caused you to get pretty close to the actuals this time around.","The other expense, legal and consulting fees, really are the in some of the regulatory consulting work continues, et cetera. So there's still what we call maybe a little bit of an elevated level we'd like to think that at some point, this tails off. But for now, we're still at a fairly high run rate of compliance, some legal costs and some of the consulting fees that we are incurring trying to get in line with where we need to be.","And the only other item versus consensus that was, I'd say, materially off was the tax rate, and once again, it had to do with gains in our corporate-owned life insurance portfolio. And some of you maybe haven't heard how this works, and just for a really brief primer, our total corporate-owned life insurance is now about $385 million, and that basically supports or informally funds some of the corporate deferred compensation plans. And another chunk of it is actually people voluntarily deferring comp.","So it all supports deferred comp, some as company directed, some is employee directed. Of that $385 million portfolio, about 70% currently is allocated to equity oriented investments, mutual funds by and large. So the gain and loss that shows up in those underlying investments is not subject to the U.S. taxes.","So as a result, when the markets are going up, we have a gain in that portfolio. That generally helps our tax rate because it's non-taxable when the market's going down, just the reverse. It's a nondeductible loss.","You don't actually see that gain or loss on our financial statements. The actual - it's a balance sheet entry for GAAP purposes. The gain strictly it would basically offset it if there's a gain on compensation expense because it would obviously increase what we would owe under the deferred comp arrangements.","But those two things are basically netted. So what we end up doing is showing a gain or loss on the asset side of the balance sheet and the other side is a payable to the comp payable is adjusted accordingly. So it's only a balance sheet impact for GAAP presentation, but for taxes, their growth stops so you do get the impact of a gain or loss on the tax rate.","Just for rough math, with the $385 million portfolio, 70% is allocated to equity. That's about $270 million. The S&P was up 2.6% for the quarter, so that would imply a $7 million equity-based gain in that portfolio for the quarter. The actual gain was $11 million for the quarter. So we're not all in S&P 500 type objectives.","Obviously, there's international, there's small caps, there's a number of other types of investments, and there's some fixed income that bounces around a little bit as well. So the actual gain of $11 million, so it was not exactly a correlation to the S&P 500, but it does have that impact. So in times of market movements in the quarter, you ought to think about adjusting your tax rate somewhat for that phenomenon.","A couple other items I'd like to mention, we talked a little bit about the comp ratio. We ended up at 66.6% for the quarter and 66.75% for the year-to-date. So that's - it is under that 67% target that we sort of outlined at the analyst day, although last quarter because of the charge that I mentioned and the impact of variable comp accruals was even lower than these numbers.","On Page 10 of the press release, you can see a number of other statistics that you should take note of. The non-GAAP pretax margin was 17.1% for the quarter, and also 17.1% for the year-to-date. The adjusted non-GAAP ROE was 14% for the quarter, 14.1% for the year-to-date. Tax rate, because of what I mentioned for the quarter, was 33.3%, thank you to COLI; and for the year-to-date, it was even lower than that at 31.6%.","And the reason for that is if you recall in the December quarter each year, we get a fairly nice tax deduction for all the equity awards that vest. We typically award them after our fiscal year end. So in the December quarter, so when those vest, we now get a tax deduction for the appreciation in those awards, whereas before it went straight to equity.","So that started this past year, and that's why we had a low rate in the December quarter and should for each December quarter and it's growing as the stock price grows. Our capital ratios, all very strong, all higher than last quarter. We had a little higher equity level, of course, for earnings. Our balance sheet growth was largely in very low risk-weighted assets, obviously at the bank level, which I'll talk about in a second.","Getting back to net interest now, I would say the June quarter reflected most of the margin increase that we had. There's a little bit of a lag because of the bank loans that select 60- or 90-day LIBOR as their base. They don't generally reset until the anniversary of that 60- or 90-day period. So throughout the quarter, some of those continued to adjust.","And similarly, in June increase, those haven't adjusted and they will be adjusting in the quarter we're sitting in. The June quarter reflected actually very little of the June increase just because of the timing in late in the quarter, but our current estimate, and I think we talked about this at analyst day as well, is that the September quarter we'll probably realize somewhere in the $15 million type range. I'd give you a broader range.","A range around that number will benefit from that June rate increase, sort of split between interest and account and service fees. We have already raised rates to customers following the June increase, and we may do so again if competition for deposits heats up. But we're right now currently at or near the top of our benchmark group in virtually all the levels of client relationships. So we're pretty comfortable with where we are for the moment. But if the competition continues to move, we'll be following suit.","Our current spread - when I talk about spread, I'm really talking about what we earn on client domestic cash sweep balances, and those are now shown in this report on Page 10 at the very bottom of that chart at the lower part of the page. You can see we added clients' domestic cash sweep balances. That's a factor that you all follow very closely, as do we.","The unfortunate part of that, and this is what I think really caused the miss on interest earnings estimate, is that you could see we had a $2.5 billion decline over the June quarter and client cash sweep balances.","It's not really - it's not money leaving the firm. It's money generally either being deployed in the market or being deployed into other short-term or what I'll call almost cash equivalent type investments like short-term CDs or T-bills or even some money market funds that we don't sweep to. Just to seek a little bit higher yield for money they don't want to put to work for a period of time because it hasn't really, like I said, been money out the door from FAA's departing or anything else.","So that had a big impact, as you can imagine. But of that $43.3 billion that you see in that number at the end of June, about $38 billion of that is in our bank sweep program, by far, our largest and most popular program. Of that $38 billion, just a little under $16 billion was going to Raymond James Bank, and the other $22 billion was going to external banks.","And that fee that we earned from the external banks is what shows up in account and service fees. What goes to Raymond James Bank, obviously shows up in interest, and our spread on that really is reflected in their net interest margin, which we'll get to in a second.","And then the other $5 billion is split between our client interest program, which is interest earnings on our financial statements and some of the money market funds that we still do offer as a sweep, such as the government-fund and the tax-exempt fund.","But our spread, which I would start out this conversation with on these client cash sweep balances that are simply turned around and reinvested in other banks or in the client interest program, our spread on that is currently in excess of 110 basis points, which is very high by historical standards.","So I've talked to you in the past, our historic levels were closer to 70. I do think that, that will contract here somewhat over time. I don't think it will get all the way back to 70, as I mentioned in the analyst day. I think it'll probably level out in the 90s, somewhere.","So over time, whether it's just triggered by competitors or another fed move or whatever, I think that spread will eventually tighten further from where it is a little bit. So that's kind of where we are in interest, again - but we haven't really reflected the June increase in June. So we'll still see a pickup in the September quarter on a net basis.","On Page 11 of the press release are the RJ Bank statistics, you can see the bank grew $1 billion in the quarter. That was accounted for more than all of our balance sheet growth. It was about $635 million in loans and about $300 million in the securities portfolio. As Paul mentioned, the net interest margin grew six basis points, really kind of a combination of a number of impacts, obviously, the March increase got into that, net interest margin. There's a lag effect of loan pricings.","Growth of securities portfolio, the amount of cash they have on their balance sheet throughout the quarter, all those things, the securities portfolio and cash balances have negative impacts on that. I think we're still comfortable guiding you through the 3.10% to 3.20% range, which is what we had said at the analyst day.","But bear in mind, that's going to be on a much larger base if they're really going to grow $1 billion a quarter, which I don't necessarily think that will be the run rate. But if they're going to grow with the securities portfolio in all, yes, that's going to depress the net interest margin but it's going to be applied to a much larger base. So we should still see a nice growth in net interest earnings from that growth.","Bank capital ratios are consistent with the previous quarter. In fact, they're right on top of the previous quarter by the rounding that we put in here. But that was really basically their own earnings, offset by the asset growth that we mentioned, plus the dividend RJF. And I talked earlier about the holding company capital ratios in that the asset growth was really in the low risk-weighted assets.","And if you see the types of loans that Paul mentioned, that grew. Those are fairly low risk-weighted, the securities base loans and mortgages, et cetera, are much low much lower risk weighting than the C&I loans. And the securities portfolio as well as all agencies security. So that's very low risk weighting as well. So that's generally the reason the holding company capital ratios grew.","And lastly, on the bank, credit metrics are still pretty good. We did see an uptick in criticized loans at the very bottom of Page 11. Really, I'd say it's us getting ahead of what we think could happen, although we're pretty well protected on to some of our real estate specific loans and Steve can dive deeper into that if you want to get more details on that. But we also had some upgrades and some sales and things like that, that actually kept the overall provision for the quarter at a pretty normal level.","So last thing I'd like to do is touch on how we did versus some of the targets that my targets that I mentioned at the analyst day. I should qualify that. I told you I thought PCG could get to 12%. They're at 11.35%. So that one's not quite where we'd like to see it yet. And capital markets came in at 13.4% versus the 15% target, as you can - as you know, Tax Credit Funds had a - is having a little bit of a slow time, as well as fixed income with a flatter yield curve. But we still think 15% is a very realistic margin target for that segment.","We were thinking asset management even post the acquisition coming up ought to be over 30% and they were at 34.4%. And the RJ Bank net interest margin, we said 3.10% to 3.20%, and it was right almost in the middle of that at 3.14%. We still are trying to keep our comp ratio below 67%, which we did at 66.6%. We steered you toward IT, averaging or somewhere around $80 million per quarter and it was just under $78 million this quarter. So that's tracking as expected.","The overall pretax margin, we are hopeful to get 17%, and on the adjusted basis we're at 17.1%. Tax rate, I told you, it was kind of going to be down at the 35%, plus or minus COLI, 35% versus yield 36.5% to 37% because of the change in the equity award tax accounting. And obviously, COLI worked in our favor and knocked the rate down 33.3% for the quarter.","And lastly, the ROE, we're in a 14% to 15% range, we're at the very low and of that range at 14%. So for some of those that missed, maybe the PCG and the overall in the ROE we'd like to see a little higher et cetera, we missed a couple of those, but there are some additional positives going forward as Paul will discuss as I turn this back over to him.","Paul Reilly","Thanks, Jeff.","Just for looking forward a little bit. There are several really tailwinds heading into the quarter. First, in the Private Client Group, we are continuing strong recruiting and retention, which certainly should build. Assets on fee-based accounts, which are billed at the beginning of the quarter, up 6% as the start.","So we certainly have those billing tailwinds coming in. Short-term interest rates will continue to kind of a flow-through, as Jeff had mentioned. We also announced a comp change really due to DOL and the fact that we really haven't had outside of some structural changes almost in 2 decades was really a major comp change here. And that should drive another 1%. It's 1% decrease in the comp ratio for PCG, 100 basis points.","And that'll start the first quarter of 2018. Now there will be some DOL costs that'll help cover and there are some DOL transitions, we're still in negotiating with mutual funds DOL impacted payments and other things. But so that will continue.","There's lots of activity with DOL right now, and it was on-again, off-again, on-again and it might be delayed or off-again. So we're continuing down the road of the current law, but I think given the request of the SEC and DOL on an extension, I think it's very likely we see one. But we'll see what happens.","In the capital markets, still very optimistic on a strong M&A pipeline, and we know that can change on a dime in the markets but it looks very, very good going forward. Tax Credit Funds will continue to be challenged until there's tax certainty. Certainly banks need CRA credits and there'll be a market.","But as developers are kind of pricing on existing tax rates and the buyers are looking at an effective change, that's going to keep a challenge in that market until there's certainty, institutional commissions with lack of volatility would be soft unless there's a volatility event. Then certainly, fixed income with the flattening yield curve on top of that, will still see its challenges. Although again, I would say performed very well relative to the broader market.","Asset management, again, continues to benefit from recruiting and retention. Continued movement to fee-based accounts, really pushed by the DOL. Total fee-based assets are starting at 6% higher now, they don't bill all beginning of it, they bill through the quarter. But it's a good start, better to be up 6% than down 6% at the start.","Scout and Reams is still on track to add about the $67 billion of assets, when we first announced - it was $27 billion I'm sorry, in assets. We expect it still to close at the end of the calendar year and that last fourth quarter of the calendar year, all indications are we're still on track for that.","RJ Bank, our focus is still to maintain just disciplined loan growth if the market allows it. We're going to continue to expand our agency-backed securities portfolio, as we previously announced. So I think all businesses are performing well given the market environment. We know this equity market won't continue forever, but it's certainly been tailwinds over the last year. All of our fundamentals are strong from recruiting to assets. We are well positioned to continue this momentum.","So we see changes and we're going to continue our investment in tech and support, which we've continued to invest in both of those really to help our clients and our advisers. So maybe the one unusual item last quarter was the comp impact but on a positive to shareholders is our associates and management, everyone is impacted by profitability. So we have a lot of profit-based accounts and if we don't perform, the bonus pools are affected.","So with that, I thank you for joining us today and I'll open it up for questions. So Kathy?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura Instinet.","Steven Chubak","So just wanted to clarify a couple of items around the comp ratio, and recognizing that JPH did have a dampening effect last quarter but that seasonality in terms of the comp decline is usually quite strong that we see from the March quarter to the June quarter. And on top of that, you were supposed to have the benefit of Morgan Keegan roll-off, which albeit is somewhat modest, was supposed to help certainly this quarter. I'm just wondering whether that benefit was in fact reflected in the comp ratio this quarter and to what extent did the remixing towards independence versus Ray J advisers actually impact the number as well?","Paul Reilly","Obviously it had some impact, you can see the increase in advisers has been higher on the independent side than on the employee side lately. Whatever benefit we got from the Morgan Keegan roll-off, which was the smaller of the roll-off, the bigger 1 comes in two years from now when the Private Client Group 7-year arrangements start to roll off, but this was the smaller group of capital markets folks. That obviously did roll off. We typically replace programs with much lesser programs.","So there was a net benefit, but obviously, the comp ratio is being impacted pretty dramatically by all - we replaced it with Alex Brown related deferred comp, as well. So I mean I think again, we come out with that 67% target for a reason. There are whole lot of factors that play into what you're mentioning in some of them, but there are other ones as well.","And we had hope to impact it a little bit by the grid change that Paul's talked about. We have been adding a lot of people in the compliance area of the firm, our risk mentioned areas of the firm, which obviously has an impact on that as well. So we're still kind of comfortable in the 66.5% to 67% range. And we think that's pretty good result for the quarter and I think that, that's about where we project it to be going forward here.","Steven Chubak","And in thinking about the larger Morgan Keegan roll-off, which is slated to come a couple of years down the road, I know it's difficult to predict what the competitive dynamics will be like. But is it fair to expect that, that benefit would also accrete to the bottom line?","Paul Reilly","Yes, but let me mention one more factor just to show you how complicated it is. Just so when that rolls off in two years, we don't want that fairly sizable group of finance advisers to be there with zero handcuff, so to speak, on them.","So what we've done is started net this past quarter, we started putting them on the new deferred comp plan two years before the other one rolls off. So when those do roll off, they will actually have some deferred compensation in place. So that obviously had an impact on the ratio as well. That's our standard practice. We applied it to Morgan Keegan, but it's our standard practice for employees.","Jeff Julien","But that's at a much lower rate than you will see roll off so there's no question that in 2 years from now, there should be a benefit, again, depending on how large we are, it may not be as impactful as you might think it. It's about in the high teens per quarter now for the people that are still with us, as $17 million, $18 million per year. So it's not - it'll be a couple of million dollars, $4 million, $5 million a quarter. So it won't be a huge needle mover but definitely we should see the impact of it starting in the June 2020 quarter.","Steven Chubak","Just one final one from me, and maybe this is best for Steve. Looking at the pockets of bank growth, you did note that there - or was mentioned that it was in predominantly lower RWA intensive buckets, but CRE we did in fact see some very strong growth. I was hoping you could speak to your risk appetite and whether you thought that pace of growth was sustainable?","Steven Raney","Yes. I would say our risk appetite is very consistent and the approach in the underwriting that we're employing hasn't changed. It's opportunistic. The C&I market, the corporate market has been a little softer. It's a little bit more volatile. Probably too much money chasing too few deals in that sector. But we are very disciplined on the commercial real estate side.","And as you know, a lot of our real estate lending is focused on REITs that are highly diversified and many of them are investment-grade or would have an investment-grade rating if they were rated.","Paul Reilly","I should just correct myself. The effect of the Morgan Keegan roll-off will start in the June 2019, not 2020.","Operator","We'll go to the next question from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo.","Christopher Harris","Can you guys go over a little bit more the rationale for the change in the comp rate at PCG? I just wasn't quite following that exactly.","Jeff Julien","You mean this year --","Paul Reilly","You mean the grid change that was announced?","Christopher Harris","Yes, the grid change, the grid change, yes.","Paul Reilly","We've increased costs, our back office is up almost 1\/3 over 4 years. We've got DOL costs coming in. We've got - if you look at where our grids are, they're still very competitive after most firms. Some firms make tweaks to their grids every single year. We tend not to do that because we think it - and it shows up in industry adviser satisfaction surveys.","But when there's a reason to do it, we're very transparent. We roll it out. We explain it to advisers. At our conference they could get up to the microphones and ask direct questions, but I think this one was actually pretty well-received. So it was just - it was a grid change in order to cover some of the costs, the DOL and other costs that have been imposed on us by the regulatory environment.","Jeff Julien","That really is a grid change in the employee channel. I mean, it's somewhat the same in the independent contractor channel except with their - and some of their impetus is going to a product neutral type grid, which we did in the employee side a couple of years ago.","Paul Reilly","But the same result is almost 100 basis point change and the result - we're very transparent about that, with our branch owners in the independent channel.","Christopher Harris","No, that all makes perfect sense. Just the one clarifying follow-up, when that grid change takes effect, are you guys expecting incremental expenses off of the base today, which would offset the benefit of that, or no? Is the grid change versus the expense base today that's in a run rate currently due to DOL and the other elevated costs? In other words, is it going to be accretive or not I guess is what I'm asking?","Paul Reilly","Yes, I think it'll be accretive in the short term, certainly costs are elevated now we've continued to hire. So some of it is reflective of cost we've already incurred. And again, we've made some fairly significant hiring still to beef up these areas, so some of those costs will be coming through in the future.","So it's - I think partly accretive and to the existing base cost, but partly covering future cost, too. So DOL is just too hard. There's too many moving parts between revenue that's affected and costs that are required and the law, I think, being back up for review to really quantify it. If we could, we'd tell you. But so part of it is to cover existing costs we've already raised and part of it is to cover future costs.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.","James Mitchell","Maybe just a little bit of color on the environment for recruiting. You guys seemingly have had some a big success in the Northeast, maybe less so in the West Coast. Maybe just kind of talk about where you're seeing the most activity and where you think can you get sort of the recruiting in the West Coast side accelerating like you've done in the Northeast?","Paul Reilly","Yes, I think we just started when I came in. One of my platforms was growth in the Northeast and out West, and we just kind of hit it better in the Northeast and then also between Alex. Brown and Stuart Partners had the right kind of teams to help influence that, and we've got better momentum.","So we're now just as focused as we were few years ago in getting the West Coast going, in fact we moved our November board meeting to California to make a statement and start getting a really concerted effort both for clients and advisers to start gearing up to get better drive out west, which has been our slower area and the farthest geographically.","So we've made progress. We have recruited advisers, we've got a good pipeline. That's a big market and we've got a lot to do and it's a big opportunity for us. So if we can do it in the rest of the country, there's no reason why we can't to do it in the 3 Western states on the coast there.","James Mitchell","Right. So do you feel like the kind of the pace you had in terms of FA headcount growth that there's still plenty of runway to keep that at a pretty similar pace going forward?","Paul Reilly","Yes, I believe so. I think that we're just in the right place at the right time both in our offering in terms of technology and support and our position. And don't think it'll last forever. So our emphasis on training continues to increase as we put more and more people into our training programs for our next generation advisers. So I think we have to do both.","But if you look at our market share still in the Northeast and the West, if we could bring it to our market share on the other parts of the country, we've got a lot of potential for growth. Those are 2 very big markets. The other thing that's helped us in the Northeast that will help us in the West is that our Alex.","Brown joining us has really increased our ability to service ultra-high-net-worth clients, which might have been something that hurt us a little bit in recruiting the very high-end advisers. But I think today, we have our platforms filled out. So it's just about execution and everything would point to right now we still have plenty of running room.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities.","Devin Ryan","Just maybe to follow-up on that last question on recruiting, so clearly, you have still some really nice momentum. If we dig into the headcount, it sounds like it's more on the independent side. Is that brokerage, or is it pure RIA, independent RIAAs? And how has that been trending and then how do we think about the economic models of some of the different types of advisers, especially the assets you're seeing the acceleration in assets going to fee-based?","And so I'm just trying to think about the grids for that as more money goes fee-based as more advisers maybe are choosing kind of the pure RIA model and just kind of the profitability of client assets dollar in each bucket?","Paul Reilly","If you go back two years ago, the Private Client Group, independent employees, and these go back and forth, were pretty equal and then independents kind of pulled away, not massively, but it's been out recruiting. I think this quarter, you seem some anomalies both in some retirement, some terms. And there are some employees that have moved independent, which is part of our adviser choice program is that you can be wherever you want.","And so if you look at the numbers just for the quarter, I don't think that's a fair representation. Recruiting has been very good in the employee channel. So we try to be indifferent. The margins right now happen to be a little bit better in the independent side, but they go up and down just depending on business and mix and how many offices we're opening and all sorts of other things.","So you see the independent growth, they are independent advisers, some have their own RIA but if you look at those numbers, they are independent advisers versus our RIA channel even though we've had good success in recruiting RIAs and it's a - I call it the third leg of our adviser platform that we want to make sure that if people in here or outsiders want to join Raymond James, they have the RIA channel. You're seeing the growth really on the independent side is what's driving those numbers right now.","Devin Ryan","And then want to circle back to something that we talked about at the investor day and kind of the M&A appetite in private clients, and I think you mentioned there's a handful of firms that you're kind of always keeping an eye on and speaking with. It could be kind of a good cultural fit for Raymond James and it sounded like in the future, to the extent regulatory costs go up and the burden of technology goes up, maybe some of those firms may decide that being independent is not the best path. And so I'm just trying to think about that, you've had a lot of success with recent deals, Morgan Keegan, Alex. Brown.","They seem to be progressing well and so I'm curious if it maybe makes sense to be a little bit more proactive to kind of rather than wait for them to make that decision to incentivize them more because you've had success and you're clearly getting a lot out of both directly and indirectly the more recent deals you've done?","Paul Reilly","Yes. So our approach has been - hasn't really changed first. We don't want to be the only firm out there besides kind of the larger bank-owned firms. So we tend to be supportive of our - we're competitors, but we believe it's good that there are other firms out in the business. That we feel that those firms stay independent until they feel they have a reason not to be and that we're at a home like we've proven, whether it was Morgan Keegan, Alex.","Brown or 3Macs that if they want to come in and become part of our culture and family, and in fact, those firms have influenced us, trying to take the best of all, we'll be there and we let them know that we're here for them.","So we don't get into bidding wars, things - even if we love firms and they're too expensive, we don't do them and we find the best fit is when they're ready and the cultures fit, they know we respect them and that we are here and we're not a hostile firm. We feel that these integrations have worked well because we've had people that wanted to join us and we wanted them.","It wasn't one side or the other. They're hard work, they're really hard. I've told both our head of Alex. Brown and 3Macs when they joined us, they said, \"I'm glad that's over with.\" I said, \"Are you kidding me? This next year is going to be the hardest year you've ever had,\" and integrations are hard.","And if both sides don't want to do it, and aren't very active, they don't work. So I think for us, how we do it's the right way. I think what we've changed in the last maybe 5 years is we're very clear to those firms if they ever change, we think there's a home, but we're not going to try to push them or sway them or indirectly get them to join us.","And the advantage we have is, again, if you look at adviser count, since after the Morgan Keegan, it's up roughly about 3.4% compounded. It's 2.8% without these acquisitions. So we are doing a good job in organic growth and those are gravy for us. And I think forcing those or indirectly forcing, we wouldn't get the results we're getting today.","Devin Ryan","Just last one on the expenses, Paul, I just missed some of the commentary around the step-up in other expenses. But it sounded like that might be a little bit higher going forward. So I'm just trying to kind of parse through the step-up in the kind of core basis and then is it recurring items that will remain a little bit elevated or things that could roll off but they're just kind of still in the run rate? Just trying to think about how to model that.","Paul Reilly","Maybe a slightly bit elevated. But it's really the increase really relates to legal regulatory consulting fees, related - the latter related to regulatory matters that we have ongoing. It's probably a function of the regulatory environment if that eases up, it may drift down. But I'd continue to be conservative on that line if I were modeling, just for the sake of being conservative.","Paul Reilly","And we are investing significantly in a technology modernization around the supervision and compliance, not just for regulation, but really to help our advisers to get more proactive by giving them information. So we're investing in technology there, I guess, we're investing in technology everywhere. That's the world today.","Devin Ryan","So just to be clear, as a starting point, the $60 million from this quarter - obviously there's lumpy items and a lot of moving parts, but that's probably not a bad starting point to think about it?","Jeff Julien","Yes. I think that would be a conservative number to use.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Conor Fitzgerald from Goldman Sachs.","Conor Fitzgerald","Just wanted to circle back on the comp ratio, maybe just taking it from kind of a 9 months year-to-date perspective. But I think you've got revenues up $736 million and you've got comp up $461 million. So it kind of implies the incremental compensation margin is, call it 63%. Just wondering if that's a fair way to think about the growth of the business from here?","Jeff Julien","That's hard to say. Again, it comes from the independent contractor side, which has been the majority of our recruiting lately. It has a much higher comp level attached to it. But...","Paul Reilly","If it comes from interest rate, there's none.","Jeff Julien","Yes. If it comes from interest, even though it doesn't have a huge revenue impact but if it comes from interest, it has very little impact. It's nice - that's obviously what's taken the year-to-date ratio down below last year's. I don't know if that's going to be the situation going forward. We'd like to think that. Plus as these grid changes will have an impact going forward that Paul mentioned of some magnitude. So we think we're still probably pretty comfortable. We don't - it's hard to say what incremental revenues - it just depends where they are.","So if this contractor side continues to be a big driver, then it will probably stay about flat. But my guess is on a relative mix of revenues that we would anticipate growing that you will actually see it drift down, just a little bit, from where it is now.","Conor Fitzgerald","And sorry, I just wanted to clarify one part of your comment. If I can look at how much the interest rate revenue is up, it implies that the core business kind of had comp ratio go higher. Is that just because of the independent channel is that how we should think about kind of the pluses and minuses from here?","Jeff Julien","That's the biggest driver of the higher comp ratio, yes.","Paul Reilly","This is complexity why we just try to get targets because certainly the bank's growth and its comp ratio is low, interest rates are very low and independent contractors are high, just because the way we pay them, they per their own overhead costs. So it's such a blending, and it depends where the revenue growth you get capital markets that...","JeffJulien","Can be high.","Paul Reilly","Can be high but usually lower than independent contractors. You get fixed income, which tended to have lower in the core business. But in public finance it's more like Investment Banking comp. So it's just - it's a very, very complex number and these businesses move at different rates. But to the extent the bank and interest rates grow, you're on the low-end. To the extent that it's private client or even capital markets to the extent you're even higher.","Jeff Julien","And see, those are all revenue related comments. On the other hand, we can have a lot of overhead added. We have had a lot of overhead, and the reason I think you're seeing a little improvement is that, that's kind of tapered off with all of the hiring we did over the last 2 years in the risk management world that's already baked into the fixed comp type level. Now we're getting some revenue lift that's helping that.","Paul Reilly","And the other cost, Paul Shoukry reminded me, that's impacted on the higher side is the retention of Alex. Brown and 3Macs flowing through. So those retention payments, if you pull those out, you wouldn't see comp going up without the others. But you add those in, it's impacting positively comp, too.","Jeff Julien","That would make your year-to-date even lower.","Paul Reilly","Yes.","Conor Fitzgerald","And then more just a broader picture in terms of what you're seeing from clients year-to-date, you and a lot of your peers have seen a very active retail investor. What's kind of the attitude on the ground from your advisers? And then when your customers are buying into the market, just be curious what type of investments they're putting money to work in?","Paul Reilly","I think there's been a pick-up in equities and some in the higher net worth all still remain very popular. Again, you're talking about a couple of percentage points. So I wouldn't call it huge shifts. I think most of the advisers are still pushing hard diversity and I think you see some real entry - some reentry into the market. But as the equity markets are good, but these aren't huge cataclysmic shifts. There are a few hundred - there are a couple of hundred basis points shifts.","JeffJulien","And not 200 but couple of hundred basis points. And you're seeing a lot of it go, not to commission based type trades, you're seeing a lot of it going into the fee-based type products. So we put the fee-based assets in our press release so you can see that 6% sequential growth in that. So I mean, they're either letting managers do it or buying mutual funds typically.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of William Katz with Citi.","Benjamin Herbert","This is Ben Herbert on for Bill. Just wanted to ask MiFID II, if you're anticipating any impact from that next year?","Paul Reilly","Yes, I think there will be certainly on research payments, MiFID II, where it all settles out, I don't know. It was hard to say whether the U.S. was going to move with MiFID II. My guess is given the global nature of the business, more of the larger managers are going to go to MiFID II type payments just because it's too complex to wall them off.","So whether you're a winner or a loser depends overall on what kind of research you do. The good news is our research is pretty focused in small and mid-cap, and I think we can get paid for value. But overall, it's probably going to push and squeeze research payments overall. So I think most of the whole business is going to get some squeeze on it. So not our biggest revenue item.","So I wouldn't call MiFID II a positive. It's probably going to be a negative on overall payments but who knows what that'll look like. Research has been under pressure for many years, first in the form of commission payments and now as we go to MiFID and more direct payments, it's just asset managers lower their fees, they're lowering what they pass off. So I wouldn't call it a positive headwind or positive law. I don't know how significant it will really be given our revenue mix, but it's certainly not a positive.","Benjamin Herbert","And then maybe just a follow-up on advisory fees, are you seeing - what's the dynamic there around platform fees? Are you seeing any impact there?","Paul Reilly","There are two pieces. I think advisory fees themselves have held a very, very well. And we're seeing what advisers are getting from their clients holding up very, very well. So I think even for the firm, the fees that funds paid us have held up well even with the growth of ETFs and other low-cost funds, which don't pay us well.","But so far the overall revenue has held up well, and part of that is the market's grown, too, and the dollar volume is bigger. But I think there are certainly - in terms of what funds can pay there's pressure again as they lower fees, which will have an impact on us over time. The advisory part of the business seems to be holding up extremely well.","Operator","At this time, there no questions.","Paul Reilly","Well, great. I really appreciate you joining us and then some, I think we had a good quarter and sounds like the revenue - the comp communication we could have been a little clearer on. But I still think we're on track. We think we have good momentum in front of us, especially with the fee-based accounts and billings starting 6% up interest rates and good recruiting. So thanks for joining us, and we'll talk to you next quarter."],"18314":["Raymond James Financial Inc.

My name is John, and I\u2019ll be your conference facilitator today. This call is being recorded and will be available on the Company's website.","Now, I will turn it over to Paul Shoukry, Treasurer and Head-Investor Relations at Raymond James Financial.","Paul Shoukry","Thank you John. Good morning and thank you all for joining us on this call. We appreciate your time and interest in Raymond James Financial. After I read the following disclosure, I'll turn the call over to Paul Reilly, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jeff Julien, our Chief Financial Officer. Following the prepared remarks, they will ask the operator to open the line for questions.","Certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, information concerning future strategic objectives, business prospects, financial results, acquisitions, our ability to successfully recruit and integrate financial advisors, anticipated results of litigation and regulatory developments or general economic conditions.","In addition, words such as believes, expects, plans and future conditional verbs such as will, could and would, as well as any other statement that necessarily depends on future events are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Please note these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from those expressed in those statements. We urge you to consider the risks described in our most recent Form 10-K.","During the call, we will also use certain non-GAAP financial measures to provide information pertinent to our management's view of ongoing business performance. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures that may be found in the schedule accompanying our press release.","So with that, I'll turn the call over to Paul Reilly, Chairman and CEO of Raymond James Financial. Paul?","Paul Reilly","Great. Thanks, Paul, and good morning, everyone. I know you're having a lot of weather up there in the Midwest and Northeast, and I want you to know we're empathetic here. Our temperature has plunged from 80 yesterday to 70 today. So anyway, hopefully, it will rebound as the market did a little bit in January.","I'm going to go over the first quarter fiscal results and then I'm going to turn it over to Jeff who's going to give you some more detail, kind of color on the numbers and then I'll be back for a quick outlook. So overall, as we look at last quarter, we certainly had elevated volatility, market declines in December, market uncertainty. Given all that, I think we had a very strong quarter.","Now there are lots of moving parts, so I hope we can provide some clarity to you on the call. Overall, we had a record quarter net revenue of $1.93 billion up 12% over prior year\u2019s quarter and 2% over the preceding record quarter last quarter. We had broad-based growth in revenues. We had record quarterly revenues for the Private Client Group, the Asset Management Group and RJ Bank.","The quarterly net income of $249 million or $1.69 per diluted share was up 15% over last year\u2019s quarter, but down 5% over the preceding quarter. But if you recall, both the prior quarter and the proceeding quarter were impacted by adjustments including the Tax Act. So if you look at a more apples-to-apples, the adjusted net income of $264 million or $1.79 per diluted share for the quarter. This excludes the $15 million loss from the disposition of our European equity research business.","Given MiFID II and our scale, we just felt it was not a good investment for us. However, I want to note we're continuing our highly successful North American equity research sales in Europe, which we've done for decades successfully. This also has no impact on our growth and investment in our European Investment Banking operations.","But with that $15 million adjustment, we had adjusted net income was up 10% over last year's quarter adjusted net income quarter, and up 5% over the preceding quarter's adjusted net income.","On the capital front, with the decline in markets during the quarter, which was very punitive for financial stocks, that gave us a great window for repurchases. We repurchased 6.1 million shares of common stock or $458 million at an average price of $75.70. I know a lot of investors were sometimes frustrated believing that we worked return on equity, but I really think our patience and long-term view really pays off for shareholders and it should be a good return.","Additionally, not only on repurchases, but we focused on growing our business both organically and looking for strategic acquisitions. As we've stated, we've been searching in the market for acquisition opportunities but to stay true to our discipline and our priorities being a cultural fit, strategic fit, something we can integrate and last but not the least and maybe sometimes the hardest the price has to be a good return for shareholders.","Yesterday, we announced such an acquisition, Silver Lane. They're a boutique M&A firm with excellent expertise and relationships in both the Asset Management business and Wealth businesses and we expect to close by April 2019. Liz and her team are fantastic, and we welcome them to Raymond James.","Overall, we believe we gave an outstanding annualized return. We had a 15.9% return on total equity or a 16.9% on an adjusted basis on total equity, not on tangible equity. So, I think that compares very favorably to our industry.","Turning to the segments. Private Client Group record quarterly net revenues were $1.36 billion, a record quarterly pretax of a $164 million. Now for the quarter, most of our client, especially all of our client assets are billed quarterly in advance on the beginning balance that certainly helps us. And that more than offset decline in brokerage fees for the quarter.","Private Client Group is also helped by short term interest rates and higher cash balances due to the volatility in December. Also, Private Client Group increased its account and service fees to Raymond James Bank. What we charge the bank for cash deposits. And that benefited the Private Client Group by $16 million for the quarter, but decreased Raymond James' pretax by $16 million and Jeff will explain kind of that charge and how it's calculated.","Our domestic cash sweep balance was $46.8 billion, up 14% over last year's quarter and 6% over the preceding quarter. The decline of the equity markets negatively impacted our assets, our client assets under administration of $690.7 billion were basically flat with the year ago and down 9% sequentially.","Our Private Client Group assets and fee-based accounts of $338.8 billion were up 7% from a year ago and down 8% sequentially. And we'll talk about the impact going forward a little bit later.","The total number of advisors was 7,815 was up 278 over a year ago but only up 2% last quarter. Two advisors, I'm sorry, over the last quarter. Now recruiting was down a little bit off of last year's record pace, but still very robust and very strong pipelines. The real story for the quarter, as you always have some regrettable attrition and advisors that are asked to leave. But the real story for the quarter is we had 65 planned retirements, deaths or people that left the business which was elevated.","Now in those situations, we retain the books as the books are given to other advisors or sold to other advisors. So, they usually higher number of retirements, which generally occurs after September 30 because of our fiscal year-end and the incentives and payouts, people tending to leave in this quarter was higher than normal.","The pipeline though has stayed very strong for recruiting and we're still chasing our kind of 2019 records, but the pipeline is very, very good. Moreover, our retention remains, I think, extremely strong of our existing advisors.","On the Capital Markets side, net revenues were $253 million and quarterly pre-tax of $12 million. Now, that $12 million was impacted by the $15 million loss associated with the European equities business sale. M&A was very strong, less than last quarter's record, but still a very strong quarter, and market volatility certainly helped with institutional equity brokerage, which was up 27% sequentially.","Fixed income, like the rest of the industry, has remained very challenged due to the flat yield curve and low long-term rates. Brokerage revenue was down 23% over last year's quarter and 4% sequentially.","The Asset Management business with a record quarterly net revenue of $174 million matching last year's record pre-tax, last quarter's pre-tax of $64 million. Our financial assets under administration of $126.5 billion was down 3% over last year and 10% sequentially, again, largely due to the equity market declines in December.","Carillon Tower Associates did experience some net outflows primarily due to two large account cancellations, one, we knew about well in advance and one more recent. Asset Management though continued to experience inflows in the fee-based accounts in the Private Client Group and also really driven by recruiting.","Raymond James Bank net revenues of $203 million, was up 23% over last year's quarter and 4% sequentially, really driven by continued loan growth to the Private Client Group and Capital Markets segments, really across many segments and certainly helped by higher short-term interest rates.","The quarterly pre-tax income of $110 million was impacted by a higher loan loss provision and net increased fee I mentioned from the Private Client Group. Now, the loan loss provision was attributable really to loan growth and provision for certain downgrades in the quarter limited to a small number of credits across multiple industries.","There is no indication of overall credit quality we just try to stay ahead on the reserve for credit for loans. In fact, if you look at our criticized loans as a percentage of total loans they declined from 1.32% a year ago, 1.18% last quarter to 1.13% this quarter. So, you see a declining percentage of criticized loans.","So at this point, I'm going to turn it over to the longest serving S&P CFO in the country, Jeff Julien.","Jeff Julien","Thank you, Paul, I thank. First and foremost, this quarter was obviously this is being the first quarter, we presented in this new revenue format. So, for those of you who didn't have the benefit of the tutorial that we put on in December about this as well as the 8-K that we filed that sort of mapped the old line items to the new.","Let me just state real quickly, the asset management and related administrative fees line, about 80% of that line represents the Private Client Group portion of fees from fee-based accounts, which are billed quarterly in advance, used to be in the line item called securities commissions and fees and the other 20% of that line item is what used to be investment advisory fees, which relate to the assets under discretionary management about, of those about 55% are billed in advanced, 25% on average balances and about 20% on ending balances.","The line item brokerage revenues now, which consists of securities commissions and principal transactions includes the Private Client Group commission based activity, other than underwritings, which fall now into investment banking. Also includes the institutional commissions other than those related to our underwritings, which fall into investment banking. And also, includes a line item that was formerly there known as trading profits. All those are now caught up in what are called brokerage revenues.","And then the investment banking line item are what the investment banking fee revenues that were always in that line is now includes the commissions, both to Private Client Group and institutional on underwriting activity and change, we're now grossing up the expenses related to transactions as we used to net them and give you a net revenue number, now those are grossed up in this line item. They are also in the other professional fees expense, that was about $6 million this quarter.","A change in this line item tax credit fund revenues, that activity used to be in this line item. Now those revenues are now moved to other revenues. So, a lot of moving parts and partly because of that we thought it would be helpful, not just to you but to us to put in this segment P&Ls in the earnings release.","We've always included them in the SEC filings. But I think it's useful to look at those as much as it is the overall income statement now to see where the variances really came from, but based on the models that we've seen from those of you who cover us, I would say it looks, by and large like you understand and understand the changes and they were reflected for the most part properly I believe.","One other change I mentioned the professional fees, that's a new line item on the expense side. Other was getting a little bit large. So we found the largest line item in there that we could break out separately those professional fees include legal, outside legal fees, outside accounting fees, our auditing fees and non-IT related consulting fees, and we'll present that as a separate line item as to help provide some color for things that go into other.","All that in mind turning to a comparison to what we'll call the consensus model. Actually asset management related administrative fees were actually very close to your estimates for the quarter. Brokerage revenue actually came in a little behind, possible there's no question that the commissionable activity in the Private Client Group side of the business continues to decline as there continues to be a shift towards fee-based activity.","We did have a little bit of a spike in the quarter in the institutional equities side due to market volatility, but I'm suspicious that maybe some of the commissionable activity related to underwritings maybe in your models stayed in that line when in fact they are now to be included in the investment banking line.","Speaking of which, the investment banking came in well ahead of your consensus perhaps partly because of that commission location, but also because toward the end of the quarter, once again we had very strong M&A activity, mostly in the last couple of weeks of the quarter. I guess people trying to meet year-end, calendar year-end deadlines for their tax and other reasons.","The only other item on the revenue side that was \u2013 came in significantly ahead of projections was the net interest earnings. We did have a pretty significant surge in client cash balances, about $5.75 billion in the sweep balances for the quarter. That obviously fueled some of this net interest earnings. I will state that about, as of today, about $2 billion of that has turned around and gone back out through either fee billings for us or for redeployment into the market or into other higher yielding positional cash alternatives.","So it's been ebbing and flowing, but at that point in time, we had a significant inflow. Further, we passed through I think about 50% of the September Fed rate hike to clients, which is higher than most of the competition. We have yet to react to the December Fed rate increase, as is the case with most of the Street, but we're \u2013 so going into this quarter, we \u2013 our spread has increased as well as balances going into the March quarter. But we'll see how that plays out for the rest of the quarter. But our overall net revenues were just 1% ahead of the net consensus, so pretty accurate forecasting there.","On the expense side, communication \u2013 total comp expense came in at about 65.5% on a comp ratio about 100 basis points lower than our target. We're not really going to adjust our target at this time although we \u2013 as we typically only do it once a year, but that's a good result. So has a lot to do with the mix of revenues for the quarter with the net interest earnings kicking in and et cetera. So we'll talk a little bit more about that when we go talk about the going forward outlook.","Communication and info processing actually came in lower than you expected. But it's actually kind of in line with what we expected because lo and behold, we re-classed a $4 million a quarter item down to other expense, really \u2013 really a fee we paid to an outside party just for omnibus recordkeeping, which is important to us because omnibus fees that we get from mutual funds is a significant revenue item, but we actually pay a third-party to do all that omnibus recordkeeping for us.","And as like I said, it's about $4 million a quarter. So the guidance we gave you on the communication and info processing of averaging about $100 million will probably end up being something less than that for the year on average and certainly starting out low, we expect it to build throughout the year a little bit, but that $4 million a quarter item will now be down into the other lines.","I mentioned professional fees, that have been broken out, that also includes by the way that $6 million gross up of deal expenses that we mentioned that happened the first \u2013 for the first time this quarter. So that's \u2013 looks inflated but so is the revenue side.","Paul talked about the loan loss provision, I don't really have any more to add to that, we still feel that the overall credit situation is in very good shape at the Bank, a lot of these \u201cdowngrades\u201d they're still within the past category. We have a grid that has about nine levels within the past category, and as they climb up that grid, there is a higher provision taken even though that metrics are well within the past guidelines.","And then the other expense, it's still somewhat elevated, as I mentioned, we took the professional fees out, which was the biggest individual line. The other two line items that are of significance, if you remember, we used to have a line item called clearance and other costs for clearance and brokerage fees, that's in there, that's probably the largest line item. And then the other one is still our continued legal reserves or charges that we're taking as we go along and still have many items still in process. Kind of like the bank loan loss provision I'd say, and we're trying to stay ahead of that as best we can.","A list of other items I think are worthy of noting. Share repurchases clearly had some impact on EPS in the December quarter, you can see the decline of a couple of million shares and weighted average fully diluted shares for the quarter versus the preceding quarter and will have even a greater impact in the March quarter as a lot of those shares were purchased later in the quarter. The comp ratio I have mentioned.","But on a look-forward basis, I will caution that one of the things that happens seasonally every year is we get a FICA reset in the March quarter, that traditionally looks like \u2013 again this year we'll have something around a $7 million to $10 million impact on the March quarter versus the December quarter as all those that were over the FICA limit now are subject to it again for at least a period of time.","The tax rate actually came in very close to guidance and consensus, but that was actually the net effect of a couple of items. We did have some significant losses in our COLI portfolio, which normally would drive the tax rate up as those are nondeductible losses. But in the December quarter, we also have the benefit of the equity vesting of our \u2013 of a large number of equity awards, we traditionally award our retention and compensatory awards in the December quarter following our fiscal year-end. And they have three, four or five year vesting period.","So as those vest, we get the tax deduction on the appreciated value and that's \u2013 so as we've mentioned in prior calls, that's always the biggest in the December quarter. And that more or less offset the COLI loss impact for the quarter, so that 25%-ish rate still looks right on where we would be for the rest of the year, plus or minus future COLI impact.","Capital ratios actually declined for the first time, actually our capital declined, we're not used to seeing shareholders' equity lower than the previous quarter, but obviously the share repurchases were the reason for that and the capital ratios declined a little bit, but obviously still in a place where people would say we're very, very healthy.","The Bank net interest margin, there was a slight decline, but it's really due to holding the higher cash balance during the quarter. Because of the spread in cash balances that I mentioned earlier, we may get a temporary boost in the March quarter. But long-term, I think we're kind of in the same place in terms of guidance on the Bank's net interest margin around this level.","And I think that at least a couple of reports to focusing on the net interest income growth as opposed to the Bank's NIM, I think is important, sequentially the Bank's net interest earnings were up 4% quarter-over-quarter. So whether it's in a large number of \u2013 a larger balance of lower yielding assets are deployed into higher yielding loans and we're trying to maximize the net interest income growth.","Lastly, Paul mentioned this transfer charge between the Bank and Private Client Group for the sweep balances. Effectively, to say now at the Bank those are basically omnibus accounts. The Bank doesn't do any of the recordkeeping on those, it's all \u2013 it's all the raising of the money, supporting of the accounts, the omnibus accounting et cetera, et cetera, is all done at the broker-dealer. And there is a per account charge from the Bank back to the Private Client Group for the provision of those deposits.","And we based on \u2013 to reflect current economics, we adjusted that rate starting October 1. I mentioned this last call, and I told you it'd be around $60 million it looked like for the year. For this particular quarter, you can see this on the Private Client Group income statement, the fee from Raymond James Bank increased $16 million, about $14 million of that $16 million was due to this rate change and the balance was due to an increase in the number of accounts. So I think that is something that they have no consolidated effect as these eliminate, but certainly impacts the P&Ls of those two segments to some extent.","Little long-winded, I apologize, but a lot of changes going on in this particular quarter. With that, I'm going to turn it back to Paul for an outlook going forward.","Paul Reilly","Thanks Jeff. I'm sure everybody found that exciting. So don't apologize. A little bit outlook, given the market, it's kind of hard to give little bit \u2013 to give outlooks. But we can tell you what we know and what we think we see. So in the Private Client Group, certainly our fee-based assets are down 8% at the end of the quarter. So that's going to lower our starting fee billing. So that's certainly going to be a headwind in the Private Client Group.","However, the increase in cash balances and although $2 billion were redeployed, roughly half of that's in our fees that are paid out of cash usually to clients. There's also probably a lot of tax harvesting where people go out of the market and come back in at the end of the quarter and other deployments in the cash. We don't know what's going to happen with that net increase, but if you take that net increase and add it to the higher short-term interest rates, that could supplement \u2013 could replace that revenue, depends what the balances are going to be, we'll have to see during the year.","And a reminder, those cash balances aren't compensatory. So they do have a positive impact on the net. It's a better net revenue and it also will have a positive effect on lowering the comp ratio. So we'll just have to see where that balance comes out.","Financial recruiting pipeline is robust across all channels. And our retention, if people leave, they tend to leave at the end of the quarter and the fiscal year, just it's a cleaner time and there is no indication of anything, but retention continuing as we really focused on making this a great place for our advisors.","Capital Markets, the M&A pipeline still very strong. The big question is probably underwriting between the markets and the government shutdown at the SEC, who knows. So \u2013 but certainly the M&A pipeline looks good. Silver Lane, we're excited about that addition, but closing by April, that financial event will really impact more next quarter in terms of revenue and expenses, given closing if it closes before that.","Fixed income, like the rest of the industry, will be challenged I think. As long as the yield curve is flat and long-term rates are low, that's going to continue to be a tough business. I believe our people are doing a great job of managing the costs and managing inventories at a very good risk levels. So there I think they're doing everything they could \u2013 can do.","The asset management, the businesses are starting \u2013 financial assets under management are down 10% sequentially. So we're starting lower, we had some recovery in January. Jeff talked about how they are billed. So it's hard to predict. Certainly, they're going to start at a lower revenue base and the rest of the billings will depend on the markets. Flows for asset management should be helped by continued client recruiting. So given everything \u2013 the net \u2013 we should have net inflows with recruiting.","RJ Bank, we expect to continue loan growth, January was down a little bit, but I think if you look at the C&I markets and our Private Client Group markets, we see attractive loans at attractive margins. So my guess is, we'll see growth there and we're pleased with the credit quality and certainly rising interest rates as the portfolio reset should help too. So we think that'll be a tailwind for the Bank.","Capital deployment, so we'll continue our buyback philosophy of looking at managing dilution but also opportunistic buybacks and we will be patient, but we will act when we have an opportunity. The full impact, as Jeff mentioned, of stock repurchases in terms of fully diluted shares will be seen next quarter. So that should be a tailwind too for the numbers. And we continue to aggressively look for acquisitions, yet progressive on the looking, but very disciplined on pulling the trigger on those.","So Jeff also mentioned the first quarter market kind of headwinds on expenses, typically elevated especially like FICA and meeting fees, we have a big equity capital markets meeting in March which will hit this quarter. So I'm very optimistic really about our positioning. We are looking to manage our costs in these volatile markets, but still invest long-term in areas like technology and other areas that are important. So our recruiting is very attractive and we'll continue to look for acquisitions to deploy capital where they make sense. So with that\u2026","Jeff Julien","Let me add, if I can Paul, just two more quick comments for those doing modeling going forward. In the communication and info processing line, if you remember, there is a seasonal factor that I forgot to mention that in the March quarter, we always have our 1099 mailings and our year-end summary statements to clients and et cetera, et cetera. That generally adds about $2 million to that communication line in the March quarter.","Just as a reminder, and Paul mentioned the meetings in the business development line, we've kind of given guidance that it's going to be between 45 and 50 lower at the beginning of the year, higher at the end of the year. I think we came in right on that, it should build as the year goes as to later quarters of our fiscal year are more replete with trips and conferences than the early quarters. In fact, this quarter we had almost none of that. So we do expect that expense line item to build as we've given guidance before throughout the year.","Paul Reilly","Great. Okay. John, we're going to open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question is from the line of Devin Ryan from JMP Securities.","Devin Ryan","Hey, good morning, guys. How are you?","Paul Reilly","Good.","Devin Ryan","Okay, good. So first question just on capital. Obviously, we all saw the aggressive repurchases in the quarter and so trying to think about after that pace in that level, how you guys would frame the excess capital position of the company today, like how do you feel like your capitalized and then how much is excess? And then with the stock price where it is here, understanding it can move, how are you thinking about kind of toggling between repurchases or kind of building capital for M&A? And just the last piece of that question is, we all saw the [indiscernible] in the markets, I'm curious if that sparks more activity on the M&A side in wealth management?","Paul Reilly","So I would define our capital is less than it was a quarter ago as we've repurchased. Certainly, we have excess capital, we prefer to deploy it in acquisitions, and we are working hard on them. But I'll tell you that the pricing is important, we just don't, whether it's recruiting, a lot of firms have upped their front money and we just have not followed suit. So \u2013 and it's same in acquisitions. If we believe people are overpaying \u2013 I'm not referring to any particular acquisition, but we're going to hold back. So we're going to stay disciplined.","We felt the stock was at very attractive price and have we not run out of 10b-5, part of that during the blackout period, we might have had more, but we're just going to stay disciplined. I don't think you're going to see a big change. We're going to opportunistically buy when it's a good price and be aggressive than when it's not, we're not going to do it, just to do it. So our preference has always been acquisitions. We do look at a lot and then when we find them we pull the trigger. So I don't see a big change in our approach. We just hope we've demonstrated we are willing to do it when we have the opportunity.","Devin Ryan","Absolutely. Okay, a quick follow-up here just on the legal reserves that have been affecting results the last few quarters. Can you just \u2013 I know there's a methodology there in terms of the kind of the accrual, but can you just give us any sense of the magnitude. Has it been similar in recent quarters? Was it similar this quarter to last quarter? And I know there's this kind of list of things that you're accruing for.","Do you think we're in kind of a new normal of higher legal reserves and we're just kind of working through an existing list and ultimately what I'm getting is just trying to think about modeling kind of the other expense? I know that's lumpy, but kind of how we should be thinking about that taking into consideration the regulatory and the legal reserves.","Jeff Julien","Yes, we kind of \u2013 we have a methodology, when we have claims come in, depending on the size, we put an initial reserve, and like \u2013 just almost like a bank loan. And then as we get in more information, we evaluate it and say okay, given legal advice and everything else, what do we think has been appropriate reserve. And we don't \u2013 we'd rather \u2013 we'd rather have it adequately reserved than non-reserved, so we try to stay ahead of it and that's hard to do.","So, hopefully this is elevated, but I can't tell you it\u2019s not, but we try to stay ahead of the cases that we know about and you don't know what's around the corner. But hopefully, these last couple of quarters have been elevated and we think it will go down some, but \u2013","Devin Ryan","Okay. I don't know if it's possible to give any orders of magnitude or just given some guidance on the other expense just whether excluding legal or anything you can do to help us with that?","Paul Reilly","Now it's \u2013 we've said it's been elevated about $10 million and ish, so I don't know if that's a run rate means we'll get all $10 million or it's going to be $5 million or $6 million in the environment and our downturns in the industry tend to bring up more cases, so it's hard to model. But I think it's been running about $10 million higher than we thought, but I don't know if that \u2013 if I would credit the whole $10 million long-term, it's just too hard to tell.","Devin Ryan","Yes, I appreciate the color. Thanks, Paul.","Paul Reilly","Thanks, Devin.","Operator","Your next question is coming from the line of Christian Bolu from Bernstein. Your line is open.","Christian Bolu","Good morning, guys. Just firstly, question on the 65 \u2013 65 advisors that retired or I think died, you mentioned. Can you give us more detail on just the process and economics tied to those assets? Is Raymond James buying the book and allocate it back to advisors? How do the economics work? And if you've given the books back to the advisors, do they have a slightly different payout ratio given they're not the ones that built the book? Just trying to understand the whole process, economics et cetera.","Paul Reilly","So, on our firm clients own their books. So we don't \u2013 we don't. So typically on a planned retirement versus a death, which generally isn't planned, the advisor would sell their books or give their books to their team or to another advisor if they're selling their practice. So with those planned retirements, there's generally a succession and they're either \u2013 the succession has already started and the books are moving when the advisor officially retires or there is a sale and they get out of business.","So most advisors will transition over time, but when they drop their registration and out, they come off our list, so there's no real change in economics to us, the buying advisor or the recipient advisor may have different economics or maybe paying the successor advisor, but there is no difference to Raymond James and that's usually the same. Hopefully, not all advisors have a catastrophic plan if it's unexpected or a retirement plan filed with us and those again would go to the successor advisors, and the economics would be the same to the firm. So we're not \u2013 we're not buying them and then reselling them, they're really \u2013 the advisors are essentially doing that.","Christian Bolu","Got it. Very helpful. And then just to follow up on the earlier question around capital return. I guess parent capital and parent cash, I think used to be restriction here, so how much parent cash is left? And then Tier 1 leverage at the Bank, is 7% still the best way to think about the minimum \u2013 management minimum?","Paul Reilly","Cash has been more limiting than capital but we're \u2013 I think we have pretty good cash and if you look forward give outside of given a severe downturn, cash will continue to build and capital will continue to build, so we're cognizant of that, of both in our looks to deploy capital. So I don't \u2013 I can't really give you a number on excess capital \u2013","Jeff Julien","Let's not forget it's very material and we disclose that in the Qs. I mean, it's still in the neighborhood of $1 billion and which is kind of our target cash on hand at the parent level.","Christian Bolu","Got it. Okay. And then just a couple of clean-up questions here from me. On the European research business, any chance you can give us like the revenues and cost for that business to sort of figure out the financial impact, go forward? And then on Silver Lane, similar, any color on revenues, expenses or maybe historic growth rates of that business?","Paul Reilly","Yes. That business wasn't a large business and operated at a loss, but it wasn't a huge number. So I think you're \u2013 I couldn't tell you what they are off hand, but I don't really think they're big enough to impact your model.","Jeff Julien","I don't think you'll notice it.","Christian Bolu","Okay. Both of them, European research and Silver Lane?","Jeff Julien","On European, we don't think you'll notice European loan loss of that.","Christian Bolu","Okay, all right.","Paul Reilly","Silver Lane, we haven't disclosed anything yet so in terms of revenue or financials or\u2026","Christian Bolu","Just so I'm clear, which one was \u2013 what's one at a loss, European Research or Silver Lane?","Paul Reilly","European Research, European Equity Research was not a profitable business for us and we didn't have scale, especially in MiFID. The U.S. Research business in Europe is profitable, it's been there for decades. Again, not a huge number relative to the whole firm, but it's been a very good business and the European M&A businesses has been \u2013 is growing and hopefully we'll continue to grow that. So \u2013 but the European equities business, the part that we disposed of, was not a large number, and it wasn't profitable, but again not it numbers.","Jeff Julien","And we certainly hope you'll notice Silver Lane in the M&A line.","Christian Bolu","Well, yes.","Paul Reilly","We have high expectations that is a very good business and good deal.","Christian Bolu","Okay, any chance we get any sort of revenue expense numbers ahead of time just to give us a ballpark here?","Paul Reilly","Yes, we'll see what we'll disclose here. So we're still in closing phase with Silver Lane here.","Christian Bolu","All right. Thank you very much, guys.","Paul Reilly","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is coming from the line of Steven Chubak from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Steven Chubak","Hi, good morning.","Paul Reilly","Hey, Steve.","Steven Chubak","I wanted to start off with a question on the comp ratio. Jeff, I appreciate the fact that you're hesitant to adjust your comp target of 66.5 just given the time of year. Having said that, the reported comp continues to surprise positively, not just this quarter but four consecutive quarters of comp below 66 even when absorbing higher advisor recruitment which you cited as well as the FICA expense in the year-ago March quarter.","And I was hoping you could just provide some color on some of the drivers that you're seeing of those sustained comp surprises, whether we should expect to see a decline in the comp ratio versus 2018, which came in closer to 69 \u2013 65.9 I believe. Just given some of the positive momentum, it feels like you should be in a position given some of the tailwinds you cited to deliver some positive comp leverage.","Jeff Julien","Chris, I think this is simple thing is just interest. Steve, I'm sorry, it's just interest. Interest doesn't have a really a comp cost to us, so the surprises have been as that's become a bigger part of the revenue, it's positively impacted that ratio.","Paul Reilly","It could well come in at or below what last year fiscal year was. I mean, the biggest \u2013 a big swing factor in that is how much independent contractor production there is, we have that dynamic where there are more than 80% type payout level, which is distorting our comp ratio relative to peers, but if recruiting, which has been very good there, production is accelerating in the contractor side relative to the employee side, that distorts it to some extent as well as the mix of other revenues that come in.","Right now the mix is such that it's going to be trending downward, we'll have this FICA impact as I mentioned this next quarter, but when we revise our targets, which we typically only really do annually rather than every quarter, we're giving you an outlook, but we typically only formally at the Investor Analyst Day kind of revise our outlook for the coming 12 months. I mean, it may go \u2013 well go down at that time.","Steven Chubak","Got it. Maybe just a question on loan growth, continued on a healthy pace this quarter overall. But we did see a pretty decent decline in C&I, it was just a bit of a surprise given industry C&I lending in the Fed H8 data actually suggested broad-based strength, and I was hoping just given some of the light late cycle fears surrounding commercial loan risk, you have pretty heavy gearing to the asset class. I was hoping you could speak to your appetite to grow the loan book from here, especially in light of the higher provision build than some of the credit downgrades we saw in the quarter.","Steve Raney","Hey, Steve. This is Steve Raney. Good morning.","Steven Chubak","Good morning, Steve.","Steve Raney","Yes. So the C&I book, as you know, it's our biggest asset class. We do expect to grow it. Over time, I would expect it to grow at a slower rate than our private client banking assets, residential mortgages and SBL. We're just continuing to be very selective.","I would say that the C&I market has probably been and has continued to be more volatile than the rest of the sectors that we focus on, and just, we're going to be real disciplined relative to returns that we can generate in that business and really focused a lot on how we could be accretive to the rest of the firm, particularly investment banking clients, that we'll continue, we've got a big infrastructure, a lot of expertise around C&I lending and that will be continued to be a big focus for ours, growing at a probably a slower rate than the rest of the asset class.","Jeff Julien","It's not that we're not seeing C&I deal flow. It's just that, as Steve mentioned, we're just being really selective on which credits means spreads tightened during the quarter. They've since loosened again, but they tightened during the quarter, we\u2019re not \u2013 they don't meet our hurdle rates or they're too levered or they're in industries we're not fond of et cetera. We passed and we still declined a significant percentage of loans that are introduced to us.","Steven Chubak","Got it. And I'm sure speaking for other investors and some what we've been hearing, I think I'll appreciate that discipline, given where we are in the cycle. Just one more follow-up from me on the deposit outlook. Positive repricing trends have surprised positively, 50% beta is certainly better than what we had expected. And I was hoping you could provide some color just on how you're thinking about deposit pricing from here given the favorable beta trends and more specifically in an environment where the Fed actually pauses in 2019. Do you expect deposit pricing to continue to grind higher in that type of environment?","Paul Reilly","Again, we can give you every prediction. We've been wrong since we started predicting. We do know, we've raised, we're near the top of about most categories. So we haven't been aggressive on this last increase because, so we think we're treating clients fairly. Having said that, spreads are records and positional money market funds are paying higher rates and that's going to be a competitive pressure.","So we are going to react to the market, what we have to do to compete effectively and we've been surprised that the rate increases in the industry have been slower overall, but as you know for short-term cash if that's where clients want to put their money and we are not just going to raise rates to raise them, but I think we've been pretty disciplined.","You see that we're \u2013 I think we've \u2013 we always get in trouble when we say what we think versus how we react. I mean, we are trying to be competitive and fair, but we're not trying to be leaders to support everybody along, which I think everybody thought we were going there. So we'll continue to be as disciplined as we have been and my suspect is that in time there's wide spreads, over time they get narrowed. So \u2013 but we'll see. I mean, it's slower than we thought.","Jeff Julien","Since we have such a poor batting average, I'll give you my outlook. I would say if the Fed is really finished for now and short-term rates are where they are for the rest of this fiscal year, my guess is there will still be selective increases to client rates over the course of the year, which will bring spreads in a little bit from where they are today. Maybe not materially, but in a little bit.","Steven Chubak","Thanks for taking questions.","Paul Reilly","Hope Jeff is wrong again, but we'll see.","Jeff Julien","Yes, and I'd actually like to see one more increase, then we'll be where we need to be.","Steven Chubak","Thanks very much.","Jeff Julien","Thank you.","Operator","Next question is coming from the line of Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs.","Alex Blostein","Hey, guys, good morning. A question \u2013 first question just on that new asset trends. I know Paul, you mentioned what you're seeing in terms of the headcount growth in FAs for this quarter being slightly flattish. But I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about net new asset trends backing into it feels a little bit more subdued versus what we've seen in prior quarters. Is it essentially just market volatility? Or is there something else going on, and more importantly, if you guys could highlight what you've seen so far in January in terms of new assets and FA recruiting?","Paul Reilly","Yes, so FA recruiting, again, I think the pipelines are robust. I think we're coming off a record year. So I'm not going to say after we set an all-time record that we can match it. We hope we beat it. But we're a little behind last year, but we see no reason why we still don't have robust recruiting. So I don't think flows certainly times where we have less recruiting in a quarter. The asset built maybe a little slower, although it takes advisors a while to bring over all their assets. So I don't think you see anything outside of a month that was down for the reasons we said and market volatility where people are more cautious. I think it's more of a short-term trend, we expect recruiting to have a very good year, may not beat the record of last year, but we still think it would be a very good year","Alex Blostein","Got you. And then I guess on expense outlook. So, I heard you obviously about the commentary around the comp rate. But if we are in a bit of a choppier market backdrop and obviously the first quarter fees is starting off at a lower run rate, can you guys talk a little bit about the flexibility on the non-comp side and what are some of the things you could do to protect the margins for the business, if the markets are a little choppier from here?","Paul Reilly","Yes, so we've already \u2013 we can manage expenses just in a volatile market. We've kind of slowed down hiring of some positions. Although, we are still in a net add position which we have been already in this market, thus lowering the open positions and saying, what are we really need to drive the business long-term versus what's nice to have and we're going through that exercise. A big expense is IT and our position right now is where we are in the markets as those investments are going to be very positive to the future. So we want to do those. If the markets got much worse, we could delayed projects, certainly slow that down.","Certainly, our bonuses and most of the people in the firm, including advisors who are tied to their production are certainly variable. So if results come off because of the market, certainly both headcount replacement and bonuses will be different than they are in good year. So there is some build in expense adjustments and we are modifying kind of some of the builds, but we're not doing anything at this point that I'd call really getting and cutting things that we think are strategic or long term.","Jeff Julien","On the other line, where we've got some significant degree of flexibility is in the business development and we can in really bad times, obviously we took steps to delay trip served conferences and things like that, but there's also some branding expenses and image advertising and things like that that we could make decisions on in that line item, every year as well. So there is some discretionary spend there and in IT and certainly in the administrative comp lines.","Paul Reilly","I think also \u2013 we've also historically have performed very well in the downturn, so both and \u2013 I think our comp model is pretty variable and we're also fine because of our capitalization, have always found opportunities good prices. So we \u2013 it's more fun in the up times. But we're not afraid of managing through the down times. It's just not as much fun.","Alex Blostein","Yes, that makes sense. Just a clean-up question on the Bank side. Jeff, heard your comments around the deposit betas and I guess you're implying you're thinking there might be a little bit of pressure in the near term as kind of December hike catches up. On the assets side of the balance sheet, if we are going to start talking about lower interest rates, what's the appetite to maybe extend duration a little bit to lock in slightly better rates today versus I guess waiting to just kind of see what happens with the curve?","Jeff Julien","I know you mentioned that. We had that conversation yesterday in the Bank's ALCO meeting. I think that while there may be, first of all, we got to believe we're getting paid to do it. And right now, you go out an extra year or two, you're really not picking up much in the way of yield. But secondarily, we're low to go out for anything that has a lot of extension risk. So, while the securities portfolio weighted average life may tick up a little bit, we don't want the extension risk to tick up much because we could be wrong about rates just as we have been so far. So we're not really out to take much more duration risk than we already are in the company. It's not just our way to bet on rates one way or the other. So we will probably continue in my guess our fairly short-term ladder, we're certainly not going out long.","Paul Reilly","But we are continuing to grow the securities portfolio, as we've been doing. We're going to continue on that path, but probably not doing it via going out a little bit longer on the curve as Jeff just mentioned.","Jeff Julien","We just don't get paid to do it, I mean, there is a risk that rates keep going. I mean \u2013 someday I think may go \u2013 now rates may long \u2013 short rates may go to 5% or 6%, we don't know.","Paul Reilly","If we find the spread and opportunity, I would think it's a reasonable risk, we will, but we see no reason to do it. I think that our view right now being really aggressive is just borrowing against long-term earnings than moving them up short term, because you're taking the risk certainly as rates move up. So they will someday have idea but \u2013 and we're just \u2013 we just try to manage the business as neutral as we can.","Alex Blostein","Yes, it all makes sense, great, thanks guys.","Paul Reilly","Yes.","Operator","Your next question is coming from the line of Jim Mitchell from Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","Jim Mitchell","Hey, good morning. And Paul, thanks for rubbing the 70-degree weather in our face \u2013 just maybe going to the Bank, I appreciate the commentary on cash balances coming down a couple of billion, how do we think about the Bank as you try to grow deposits and securities portfolio, if I look at the period end balance sheet, it was up $2 billion, average balances were up $1 billion. So should we, given your desire to keep growing that, should we assume that some pretty good momentum from an average balance perspective into 1Q or if you've seen deposit runoff there, I guess is the first question?","And secondly on the deposits and the growth in the securities portfolio, how much do you have left in that sort of targeted $6 billion growth number or has that changed?","Jeff Julien","Well, I'll answer the last one first. We're about halfway to the $6 billion and again that we can accelerate or decelerate that as opportunities arise. But there's not, and no real magic to the timeframe or even the $6 billion amount if the opportunities present themselves to do something different. In terms of balance sheet growth, I think the cash balance swings around as client cash balances come into the firm and on balance sheet or go off balance sheet or out of the firm.","It really has to do \u2013 the main driver of our total balance sheet growth has been net loan growth, which is projected to be maybe in the 8% to 9% per year in the \u2013 on the Bank's balance sheet, so $1.5 billion to $2 billion a year. And that's really where the growth is going to be, like I said, cash is in and out, it happens to be high at the end of December, but that's really going to be the driver right now of the overall firm's balance sheet growth.","Jim Mitchell","So \u2013 but have you seen any of that cash come back down after the spike in December in the Bank as well?","Jeff Julien","Yes. I mentioned that earlier. We have the $5.75 billion that came in the December quarter, we had about $2 billion up through today flow back out, hardly\u2026","Jim Mitchell","Split between the sweep accounts and the Bank?","Steve Raney","Jim, we control that \u2013 the amount that comes to Raymond James Bank with the third-party banks receiving the difference. So we to certain extent control as Jeff was just alluding to the growth rate of the loans portfolio as well as securities we want to be able to fund those assets as well as keep an ample amount of liquidity and we can control that level that comes to our institution.","Paul Reilly","We anticipate we're going to fund the Bank's growth unless there's a major downturn in cash.","Jeff Julien","But typically, the swings have been kind of both at the same time, but until we do a rebalancing.","Jim Mitchell","Great. Got it. And then maybe follow-up on expenses, if recruiting after record year it's sort of flat even maybe even down a little from a record year, how much of it positive or lack of a negative is that for expenses or do you still have sort of follow-on growth in recruiting expenses or should we expect recruiting expenses to turn flat this year versus last year?","Jeff Julien","I think you saw a little bit of that in the December quarter when you saw the business development expense line down below where we had guided at the 45 to 50 range. But because there's less movement in ACAT fees and headhunter fees and all the fees associated with that, it's \u2013 but it's only a only a minor setback, and there still was pretty good recruiting on the top line, it was just the retirements etcetera on the back side going out. So, but if it did truly slow down, you'd see a modest impact on that business development line, but that's not as big a factor in that line item as trips and conferences and some of the other bigger expenditures.","Jim Mitchell","And I guess you don't see much change in the amortization right away?","Paul Reilly","Not up to the run.","Jim Mitchell","Right, okay.","Paul Reilly","John, hello?","Operator","Your next question is coming from the line of Chris Harris from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Chris Harris","Thanks. Hi guys.","Paul Reilly","Chris?","Chris Harris","With respect to that PCG brokerage revenues, we know customer cash balances went up a lot in the quarter. And presumably that was customers moving out of the market. Why wouldn't that have a bigger benefit on that line item?","Paul Reilly","So it's not brokerage accounts, lot of it are fee-based accounts just going to cash too, so we're still in fee-based accounts. And so there is no brokerage commission on that, it's just kind of reduction in the fees that we're paying. So just as more \u2013 as more and more gets into fee-based accounts, the activities getting fee-based and you just don't see it.","Chris Harris","Right, as you, I you follow that I mean, is this reallocation within a fee-based account, so the revenue still is impacted in the asset management fee line currently.","Jeff Julien","You got to remember also within brokerage revenues, Chris, it's not all transactional, the mutual funds are variable, annuities are market-based too, so the trailing commissions are negatively impacted in down equity markets.","Chris Harris","Yes. Okay, understood. And then just one quick follow-up, in Capital Markets, good to hear that the backlog in M&A is still robust. Based on the size of that backlog, do you guys think you can still have growth in I banking revenues this year. If the government shutdown persists for some period of time?","Paul Reilly","I think we can have growth with M&A, whether we have growth in underwritings and the government stays shut down, that would be hard to do. Now we don't have a \u2013 with now that we're coming off a huge number from last year, wasn't the best year for underwriting anyway , so \u2013 but certainly if it stays shut down, it's going to have an impact. There will be probably some catch-up with the markets reasonable that opens up but you know it's hard without the SEC not too many people are going to issue with them close.","Chris Harris","Okay, thanks guys.","Paul Reilly","All right.","Jeff Julien","Thanks, Chris.","Operator","Your next question is coming from the line of Bill Katz from Citigroup. Your line is open.","Bill Katz","Okay, thank you very much for taking the questions, just a couple of cleanups for me at this point, if you look at the advisory yield on those assets, that ratio seems to be blending lower on a pretty persistent basis. Obviously a lot of market volatility in the last quarter or so, how do you think about the direction of that ratio between asset gathering and the yield just given mix or business conditions or pricing, just trying to get a sense of how to think about that line item going forward?","Jeff Julien","Well, if you get a choppy market like this, you will see probably higher allocations to fixed income. So you're going to see probably a little lower fees plus the addition of the Scout Reams which is largely institutional fixed income as that becomes a bigger part of our assets under management. I think that's been a big reason for the lower trend to this point. And as \u2013 it depends on people's risk-on risk-off appetites for the most part and where we focused \u2013 where we're focusing our business, it's always historically has been a small mid cap equity operation for us and it's now certainly a bigger percentage fixed income.","Bill Katz","Yeah, maybe I wasn't clear in my question, I apologize, I was just sort of thinking maybe on the within the Private Client business, if you look at the split between the advisory assets and brokerage assets, they looked related revenues. I think that ratio has been blending down on the advisory side, so I was just sort of wondering is there something about the incremental assets that are coming in, that are just priced more thinly to Ray Jay or is it just \u2013 just the impact of a volatile choppy market and the ins and outs of assets and client activity.","Jeff Julien","I think over time what we've been recruiting larger and larger financial advisors and also have larger and larger clients and so on average in the fee-based accounts, if you have a larger account, it's going to have a lower yield. Now the absolute dollars are obviously higher, but the yield for larger accounts in fee-based are going to be on average higher than smaller accounts. I think that's a trend you've seen over time. And then the yields also impacted by the shift to cash as well. There is a billing mechanism that adjusts for certain levels of cash in fee-based accounts.","Bill Katz","Great, thank you.","Jeff Julien","Any other questions, John?","Operator","We have no further questions at this time. You may continue.","Paul Reilly","Great. Okay. We know there is a lot of moving parts here, but I believe we have a strong quarter \u2013 we had a very good quarter in. Although there are choppy markets, I think we're in good position and we appreciate you joining in the call and we're going to get back to work. Thank you, John.","Operator","Thank you.

My name is Raquel and I will be your conference facilitator today. This call is being recorded and will be available on the Company's website. Now I will turn the call over to Paul Shoukry, Head of Investor Relations at Raymond James Financial. Sir you may begin.","Paul Shoukry","Good morning. Thank all of you for joining us on the call. As always, we appreciate your time and interest in Raymond James Financial. After I read the following disclosure I'll turn the call over to Paul Reilly, our Chief Executive Officer and Jeff Julien, our Chief Financial Officer. Following the prepared remarks they will ask the operator to open the line for questions. Certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements.","Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, information concerning future strategic objectives, business prospects, anticipated savings, financial results, industry or market conditions, demand for our products, acquisitions, our ability to successful hire, integrate financial advisors, anticipate a results of litigation and regulatory developments, our liquidity and funding sources or general economic conditions.

During today's call we'll also use certain non-GAAP financial measures to provide information pertinent to our management's view on ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered replacements for and should be read in conjunction with, the corresponding GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures may be found in the schedule accompanying our press release.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Paul Reilly, CEO of Raymond James Financial. Paul?","Paul Reilly","Great. Thanks Paul and good morning everyone. I feel like it's kind of boring after watching the Republican Convention the last few days. We hit our 114th quarter of consecutive profitability which wasn't, I guess, a huge surprise. But the great thing about Raymond James, I think, we're very steady. As I look at the quarter I think the first reaction, I mean, it's just a very solid quarter in a very volatile environment this last quarter. If you look from the big picture, all the strategic drivers of our business look in good shape.","Record net revenues of $1.36 billion, up 3% over last year's quarter and 4% sequentially, record client assets under administration of $534.5 billion, up 7% over last year's quarter and 4% sequentially. Record number of financial advisors, up 327 over last year and 69 sequentially. Record net loans of $14.8 billion, up 23% over last year's quarter and 3% sequentially and record financial assets under administration of $71.7 billion, up 2% over last year's quarter and 4% sequentially. And these are the drivers that you really look for in the forward going business. As many companies have struggled to grow revenue, we've continue to grow revenue which I think is a good long term indicator and all these records are really driven by organic growth and the market.","So these are without some of the acquisitions that we announced that are coming up. Speaking of those acquisitions, as you know, as we're not a very acquisitive Company, but we look at opportunities where there's a culture fit, they drive our strategy, we believe they can be implementable and a good price we believe for shareholders. And we're going to be closing hopefully a couple during this quarter. The first one we've talked about is the acquisition of the U.S. Private Client Service unit at Deutsche Bank or our Alex Brown Division as we will call them, closing. We're on track for our September closing. 92% of the advisors are signed and it's quite -- in reviving the name of the 200-plus year old brand, is very exciting to us.","We closed on Mummert and Company which expands our M&A practice in Europe which we think is a very positive strategic development. And we just got a vote from the shareholders of 3Macs, MacDougall McDougall MacTier in Canada where 100% of the shareholders and 100% of the advisors signed on to join us. And that should close some time in the September-ish timeframe. That's a 175-year-old partnership, again sharing our culture that has decided to join Raymond James. So we're excited about it and we welcome all these groups to the Raymond James family. First I'm going to turn to the financial results. We had record consolidated quarterly net revenue of $1.36 billion, up 3% over last year's quarter and 4% sequentially.","Our net income of $125.5 million is down 6% over last year, but if you exclude the acquisition-related expenses, adjusted net income of $134 million was slightly flat, slightly up from last year's quarter and up 3% sequentially, fully diluted EPS of $0.87 and on an adjusted basis $0.93, up 3% sequentially. All four of our core businesses contributed to growth. And the Private Client Group, the Asset Management and the Bank all had record quarterly net revenue. And Capital Markets only missed a record quarterly net revenue by $9 million. We continued with disciplined expense management. And even with that, in the numbers, we have been affected by a number of expenses, $13.4 million of acquisition-related expenses. We had elevated legal and regulatory expense. The biggest part of that was the settlement with the State of Vermont which was essentially related to the historic FINRA-related AML issue issue that we accrued in the previous quarter.","We believe we've been in good shape on that. We've brought on a few quarters ago a new chief AML Officer. We've installed Mantas, one of the leading AML systems and according to the vendor, really in record time and have it up and running. And we've added 50 additional associates. Simultaneously in our expense numbers we've been working heavily on the DOL and they're all within our -- all of those activities are within our current expense numbers as shown. So I believe we've shown good expense management with this revenue growth. If I turn to the segments, the Private Client Group first, record quarterly net revenues of $900.5 million, up 1% over a year ago and 2% sequentially. And those were driven by the market and assets, but also very strong recruiting, retention and growth in fee-based assets. Our fee-based assets now represent over 40% of the client assets.","Pretax income of $81.9 million, down 5% over last year and down 2% sequentially, driven by a number of things. First, very muted transactional fees which I think you've seen throughout the industry during this quarter as the markets have been very, very uncertain. And also, as previously discussed, impacted by regulatory and litigation costs. Recruiting remains robust. And retention is keeping with our high historic levels. In fact, I've seen the industry reports saying that recruiting was down 40%. We certainly don't see that here at Raymond James. Turning to the Capital Market segment, net revenue of $251.6 million was up 8% over last year and 6% sequentially. Pretax profits, $32.8 million, up 79% over last year's quarter and 17% sequentially. ","Again, not against a very strong benchmark quarter, if you look at the contributors to that, there's really an outstanding quarter for our fixed income including public finance, given the marketplace. Brexit volatility, flight to safety, we believe all contributed volumes and record trading profits which we don't estimate will sustain this level of quarter profits into next quarter. ECM continued to struggle, really through the first five calendar months of the year, as everyone did in June. Volume activity picked up significantly, both in M&A and underwriting it, making the quarter better than the last quarter, but certainly overall not a benchmark quarter. Backlog for ECM's continues to be constructive for the next quarter.","So with a reasonable market we have a positive outlook for the Equity Capital Markets. And Asset Management, record quarterly net revenues of $100.9 million, up 2% over last year's quarter and 4% sequentially, with pretax of $32.5 million, up 3% over last year's quarter and 4% sequentially. And record assets under management of $71.7 billion, again driven by market appreciation, increased managed account utilization and a very robust recruiting. Those in-flows and growth more than offset some institutional outflows for Eagle Asset Management. RJ Bank, another strong quarter, record net revenues of $126.6 million, up 22% over last year's quarter, 1% sequentially. Record pretax of $88.9 million, up 14% over last year's quarter, 4% sequentially. Our loans hit a record of $14.8 million, another good forward-looking quarter. We've had resilient net interest margin which I'm sure Jeff will touch on and our loan-loss provision of only $3.5 million, this credit quality remains good.","So with that I'll give some guidance later, but I'm going to turn it over to Jeff to give it some more line item details. Jeff?","Jeff Julien","Thanks, Paul. The consensus model for the quarter was fairly accurate. The majority of the line items were within 1% or 2% of actuals. Not a lot of line items to focus on here, but I will touch on a few. On the revenue side, pretty close percentage-wise, but a big absolute number, about $16 million ahead of the consensus model. And again PCT driven by the higher asset fees and the volatility that we had in June with the uncertainties surrounding the Fed move and the Brexit vote actually helped institutional commissions, both equity and fixed income. So we had a pretty good June in that regard.","And similarly in Investment Banking we had somewhat of an underwriting recovery in June, although the run rate for the quarter is still low by historical measures. But we did kind of recover somewhat in June to a reasonable number. And that somewhat surprised, I guess, some of the models a little bit in the Investment Banking side as M&A was fairly flat and jumping all the way down to trading profits, paul's talked on that. This was, I think, sort of an outlier good quarter for us in trading profits. I'd like to think not. Maybe we'll get better, but I certainly think that all the stars were in line here for us to hit a number like that in trading profit. So it was a pleasant surprise, even for us, to see the magnitude of that by the end of the quarter and a lot of it again happening in June, and then the other revenues that's driven, as you can see in the detail in the press release, largely by Private Equity valuation gains of $13 million this quarter. More than half of that, by the way, goes to a non-controlling interest down below.","So it's not all ours. In the expense side, numerically again the biggest absolute is comp. But that's generally tied to the revenue growth that we had in the quarter. Communications, info processing was a little higher than our $70 million a quarter type run rate that we've been guiding towards. But I still think that the $70 million-ish number is still probably pretty good. Going forward, this quarter happened to be slightly elevated, but it's been right around that number all year. So I still think that's the right place to be. And more than offsetting that overage, business development continued to be lower than it has historically, recently at least. And even though it's down to $36.5 million for the quarter, we still think the high $30 millions or $40 million-ish is probably a good run rate level for that, for now at least.","The Bank loan-loss provision was a lot lower than people expected. We did have $450 million of net loan growth in the quarter. But interestingly more than half of that was retail-related banking which is securities-based loans and mortgages which carry much lower provisions then C&I and commercial real estate loans. So that caused a lower provision than you might otherwise think with that much loan growth for the quarter. And we had some minor movement up and down in some of the credits, but they generally netted against one another. And then the other expense, Paul's already talked about some of the legal regulatory things. Just to be clear on what he said, we had accrued the AML situation defined from last quarter. That was all accrued as of March, but this newer case, the Vermont situation which is public information out there now, all came up in this current quarter.","So when you look at all those factors and the various regulatory matters, I guess we've sort of say that legal regulatory was elevated by around something by $10 million. Again, similar to what we had told you for the December quarter early in the year. The tax rate for the quarter is still below 37%, as equity markets continue to rise. And actually we got the fixed income market help as well this particular quarter. We continue to get the benefit from our corporate on life insurance investments as those gains are non-taxable. So a little bit of that help keep the rate down below 37%. ","Let me just address a couple of the ratios that we follow. The comp ratio for the quarter was 66.9% which is certainly good relative to our 68% target. And that really, as I say, had to do mostly this quarter with revenue mix as you get trading profits, interest earnings, PE gains and some of those things that don't have huge amounts of variable comp associated with them. That sort of helps the comp ratio. And even on the year-to-date basis now we're at 67.5%. So we feel pretty comfortable with that relative to our 68% target. The pretax margin for the quarter on a non-GAAP basis was 15.6% and year to date, 14.8%.","So that number -- I think that we're kind of thinking that we should have a 16% target now in this environment. And again, we would've been close to that potentially without some of these abnormal expenses in legal and regulatory. But we had some help in some other areas. So that margin probably is about accurate for the quarter. We're still optimistic that we can head towards 16% pretax margin as we head to the end of the year and then we'll readdress that target as we get into our FY17 budgeting. In the ROE, again on non-GAAP, basis for the quarter was 11.4% and 10.7% for the year to date. That kind of versus our 11% to 12% range target. We're kind of right in the middle of that and hopefully again we can start trending toward the higher end of that range as we go to the end of this year and look at our budgeting for next year.","Capital ratios were all in the press release. I don't need to talk about those. I think you know there multiples of minimum regulatory requirements. I do want to make a couple of other points before I turn it back to Paul. One is on the acquisition expenses; we've been guiding or thinking we would have, somewhere between $25 million and $30 million related to the Alex Brown acquisition or Deutsche Bank acquisition soon to be Alex Brown. We actually are incurring higher IT costs, higher legal costs than we thought. Actually we still have 5 or 6 side agreements that are still being worked on that will be part of the closing process with Deutsche Bank which is running up some legal bills and we has some real estate costs and some other things. ","So by the time we get done, we actually think that unfortunately that number's probably going to be in the high $30 millions rather than the $25 million to $30 million. I know that doesn't impact our non-GAAP results, but it's real money to us. It's shareholder money that's being spent. So we do watch very closely. Another point to make is that you saw the average share count actually decline this quarter versus the preceding quarter. And that's just shows you the result of the share buybacks in January and February earlier this year which more than bought back in control dilution for the quarter. And then lastly, we did have our note offering in July. I think all of you are aware we did close on $500 million 10 years at 3.625% and $300 million 30 years at 4.95%.","So we replenish the liquidity that we used for retiring the debt in April of $250 million that we will be using for the Alex Brown transaction which is about somewhere in the $500 million range. And then we will be back at our, what we'll call a conservative level of liquidity which will put us in a position to take advantage of opportunities, whether it's our own stock price or whether it's acquisitions are other things that come up at that time. But that will, as I think Paul mentioned, have a depressed net interest earnings, obviously for the quarter we're in and the foreseeable couple of quarters as that's added $8.25 million per quarter of interest costs going forward. ","With those remarks, I'm going to turn it back over to Paul for a little bit of a forward look.","Paul Reilly","All right. Thanks, Jeff. First just let me address the segments and I'll give you an overall. In the Private Client Group, certainly you know with record assets it's a good tailwind for us. And Private Client Group, recruiting continues to be robust and we're keeping our historic retention levels. So the trend, certainly from the revenue standpoint, looks very good there. We will likely close on Alex Brown and 3Macs sometime in September. Timeframe, they could slip, but that's the target. Now, those will impact revenue, but you know in our acquisition strategies we don't go slashing costs right away. That our goal is to integrate, keep advisors around, make sure they're stable and then we right-size costs.","So that may have -- they're smaller acquisitions, but it may have some margin impact, certainly not short term margin expansion, but we believe they're both two very good investments. We also have some potential upside it transactional revenues pick up, both through syndicate and Equity Capital Markets and just the equity markets in general. Again can't predict markets. In the Capital Markets side, fixed income and public finance backlogs and the business look good and we continue to think they'll look good, but the $30 million trading profit number is a record and unlikely to continue and hopefully the markets don't gyrate so much that it makes that easy, so looking forward.","The other side, the Equity Capital Markets, the underwriting and M&A backlog look promising. Certainly underwriting calendar looks better than it has in a while. But we all know those markets can turn also. But where there may be some headwinds on public finance, there may be some -- versus this quarter, some tailwinds in Equity Capital Markets. Asset Management, given a reasonable market should continue to grow, given the strong recruiting. And if markets continue to hold, RJ Bank is well positioned. The credit quality still looks good. The Bank is about 34% of our equity target, right about where we target. So we expect loan growth to be more in near corporate growth rates going forward, but it's in good shape.","I know you're going to ask me a lot of questions on the DOL even after I say this and I'll happy to address them. But still, there isn't a lot of clarity on it. We've had teams working very, very hard with a leading outside law firm and consulting firm. The law is very complex. We've generated lots of options, but we're waiting, really, for some DOL guidance that was provided this summer on some of the specifics. We're now working with talking to fund families and others. So next quarter on this call we should have much more specifics or at least directional. Again, we need to make sure that we understand the rule as much as it can be, because it's long and it's guidance based, before we can really give you any solid answers. But I'm confident our team is all over this and we will deal with it.","So if you look this quarter going into next quarter, the headwinds are trading profits. We've had good solid trading profits, but to repeat last quarter would be difficult. We did have some private equity gains that are typical in this quarter that aren't typical next quarter. And the interest expense with the bonds is a new additional expense that we haven't had this quarter or traditionally. But we also have some tailwinds. There are some ups with record assets under administration, record assets under management, record loan levels that should portend well for revenue coming into this next quarter.","We would guess, given where we're, that Equity Capital Markets should pick up, but again that's market dependent. And hopefully, legal and regulatory isn't a recurring expense at the level it has been for the last two quarters. So before I close I just want to thank our associates. We have a lot going on here. We've had a very successful Mantas integration which our vendor has told us has been in record time. We've been working on the Alex Brown close and I think we're in good shape there. We've been working heavily at the DOL well. So we've had a lot going on. And I want to give a special thank you, really, to our advisors who have stayed very focused on shepherding their clients through a very volatile time.","With that, I think Jeff has one more remark and then we'll turn it over to questions. Jeff?","Jeff Julien","Yes. On the acquisition expenses when I guided up now to the high $30 millions, that's really just for the Deutsche Bank Alex Brown transaction. The 3Macs transaction in Canada will also have some acquisition-related costs. A lot of that's contract termination and severance and things like that. So, but that total for that transaction's estimated to be a little less than $10 million and that will hit some in the September quarter and some in the December quarter.","We're hopeful, because we're not big proponents of non-GAAP presentations, we're hopeful that we can get all of these costs either incurred or accrued by the end of the calendar year. They may slip into March a little bit, but hopefully we can get most of them done by the end of the calendar year so we don't have to continue with that presentation going forward from that point.","Paul Reilly","Great. Thanks, Jeff. And now we'll open up for questions. Raquel?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse. Christian, your line is open.","Christian Bolu","So just firstly on litigation expenses, I guess a couple quarters now of these outsized litigation costs. I don't know, just longer term should we think of issues here as maybe driving structural higher expenses for the firm? And are there any parts of your business model that maybe needs to be modified or changed in some way to satisfy regulators? And specifically on AML, I mean, best you know are we done here? Or are you having discussions with other states?","Paul Reilly","No. So first, these two weren't totally unrelated. So, one of the AML issues was related to the case and it was a specific case and a specific issue in the State of Vermont with a specific group of investors. So we don't think those are happening all over. Now, you ask if they're structural? I think there is in our industry structural regulatory expenses and certainly a more aggressive stance by regulators. Fines are up in the industry. However, certainly not at this level. I think hopefully they unusual levels. But there will be some fines. And the 50 people in headcount and AML additions is just one example of the increasing regulatory costs, but those are in the numbers today. There is a structural elevated costs in regulatory.","Jeff Julien","And for us they show up largely in compensation expense and systems. The only thing that's showing up in this other expense, really, are external litigations and fines and things like that. The structural element that's going to be ongoing is embedded in the comp and systems lines.","Christian Bolu","And then just on mutual funds, I believe in the release you spoke to a pickup in mutual funds service fees in the quarter. Can you give some more color around this, just because there seems to be more of a trend to what passes generally industry-wide? So was the quarter rise more higher asset levels or if you see just greater uptick on your mutual fund products?","Paul Reilly","I thing is just asset based, both through recruiting and growth. It's just a rise in the level of assets has caused the growth in that number for the quarter.","Christian Bolu","And then just some quick modeling questions, I don't know if you could give us like the total client cash balances. How much of that were in the deposit sweep programs. And then what kind of rates you're getting on that third-party sweep?","Jeff Julien","Not really much change from where it's been, Christian. It's still hovering around $38 billion. I think probably $32 billion of that is in the bank sweep program, but $13 billion of that $32 billion is going to our own Bank. So there again, these numbers are not much different than they were a quarter ago. Post the Deutsche Bank Alex Brown transaction we will have different numbers, as there's somewhere between $5 billion and $6 billion of cash balances that will be coming onto our books in that transaction and the spreads really haven't changed much either, by the way.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities.","Devin Ryan","Maybe just a follow-up here on kind of thinking about the DOL, I mean, you mentioned Paul talking to fund families or starting to. I'm just curious if the negotiations around things like revenue share have already started? I guess first question then, client focus has always been a big deal for Raymond James and you guys already aren't selling many products that are viewed as more lucrative by the industry. So I'm curious if you see any changes or expecting any changes to the types or even the number of products that you're selling in a post-DOL world?","Paul Reilly","Yes, Devin. I mean, it's too early to answer that. I think what my contention has always been is that you have fund families that want us to work with them. We've got to make sure clients are charged appropriately. And that over time there'd be some equitable redistribution that would impact, some may impact clients because it's regulatory. We certainly don't want them to carry the burden. Some of the broker-dealer may impact advisors in the fund family.","I would say we don't have an ask, so I don't think there's negotiation. I do think there's a willingness and an understanding that they will contribute to this. And I don't think there's a resistance to it. It's just how and how do you structure it? How you keep it level for the firm, the client, the advisor, to meet kind of the DOL requirements? So it's complex. I don't see resistance. But I can't say we all have asked yet. We got to know what we're going to do before we have a solid ask.","Devin Ryan","And then in Private Client, I mean, it just seems a persistent theme here is subdued client engagement. Historically that doesn't correspond with record high markets. Maybe not seeing quite as much in your results because of the recruiting strength, but I'm just curious what you guys think is different this time and what may change the skepticism? I know macro uncertainty is high. I'm just curious if you kind of feel like there's just more of a lasting impairment, just with the financial crisis still relatively fresh?","Paul Reilly","Part of it, there is a number of elements to it. So first, certainly equity syndicate being down is an impact. So you almost have to move that as a separate piece. There's also movement to fee-based accounts. So that certainly takes it out. But we're kind of digging into that number too and trying to figure out if this is systemic or market-oriented. I think most individual clients have been afraid of the market. And with all this volatility, it's hard to blame them. And we teach long term investment anyway. So whether you could say there's a structural change or this is a market one, I don't know if it's been a long enough run. But we're certainly, like everyone else in the industry, looking very hard at that right now.","Devin Ryan","Last quick one here just on the bank for Steve. I'm not sure if I missed this, but the NIM outlook just with the flattening of the curve here? And then provision. Understood the commentary, you still seemed a little bit light. I don't know if you can kind of hash out some of the moving parts. I know last quarter you highlighted the qualified reserves was maybe a little bit high, especially with some interest rate related companies. So not sure if that played any part as well. Thank you.","Steve Raney","Yes, we would expect, at least over the last couple of quarters as we sit here today, for the spreads in our loan portfolio to be pretty stable. And as Paul alluded to earlier, part of the contribution to the reduced provision expense relative to the gross loan increases was the loan mix and the fact that we really grew our private client banking assets, securities based lending and mortgage loan assets more rapidly than our corporate loans.","And we also net\/net, you may have seen we had a reduced level of criticized loans in the quarter which reduced reserves on those particular loans that were either payoffs or in one case we did have one upgrade of a loan from criticized status, but the bulk of it was just paydowns in criticized loans that contributed to that reduction in that asset category.","Devin Ryan","Good. So you didn't do anything to the qualified reserve, just with the--","Steve Raney","Qualitative reserves, there is no--","Devin Ryan","I assume you call it qualitative reserve?","Steve Raney","Exactly.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Conor Fitzgerald with Goldman Sachs.","Conor Fitzgerald","I guess just the first one on that net new asset inflows which seem like there were pretty strong this quarter, I guess. Can you give us a little color on where exactly the growth is coming from?","Jeff Julien","Yes. The growth is, I think, if you look at the assets in general, market certainly helped. We thought the number would be different than -- the last week certainly changed our outlook of the number in June. If you remember the market then and recruiting, and so we've had, as you can see by the results, very strong recruiting, a very strong pipeline and you add those two together, they really drove the client asset number.","Conor Fitzgerald","And just any more color on specifically where you're having the most recruiting success?","Paul Reilly","The independent channel has been the strongest this year. And that comes and goes. Certainly when you add Alex Brown and 3Macs to that it's going to catch up. But they seem to go in fits and starts. The recruiting in Raymond James Associates, employee is above last year and that was a very good year. But the independent channel particularly has had a very, very strong year. So we're happy with both of them. But the independent's stronger right now.","Jeff Julien","No real concentration of where they're coming from.","Conor Fitzgerald","And then maybe switching over to the loan book, several banks have kind of talked about increased regulatory scrutiny on commercial real estate. I guess two questions. One, are you having any change in dialogue with kind of your regulators on CRE? And maybe more applicable to you, but if other banks are kind of pulling back and that creates an opportunity that spreads wide in that space, is that an opportunity for you to kind of grow your loan book there?","Paul Reilly","Kind of we're clearly in the middle of that dialogue and getting direction at various regulatory meetings that were in on the focus on commercial real estate. Our balance sheet compositional, although we've grown our commercial real estate book, is a little bit different. Some of the banks that have significant concentrations, their multiples of their commercial real estate exposure as it relates to their percentage of total loans relative to ours.","Ours is still pretty small. And I think you know about half of our commercial real estate are loans to REITs that tend to be a lot more diversified. And the regulators would acknowledge those have historically been less problematic than the project finance real estate. So our real estate concentration and percentage of total assets and total loans is relatively low compared to other institutions. There could be some opportunities, to your point that as others are pulling back. But we're going to continue to be very cautious and not change our underwriting standards on commercial real estate, so.","Conor Fitzgerald","And then just last one from me would be more on a longer term philosophical one. But you guys mentioned higher costs kind of in closing some of the M&A transactions than you would've thought. Something we obviously hear from a lot of companies these days. I'm just wondering, knowing that was kind of the benefit of hindsight, how does this impact your propensity to do deals in the future?","Paul Reilly","First, I think we've been very good about predicting our closing costs and net\/net Alex Brown was just more complex. The 3Macs or the Morgan Keegan, we brought the broker-dealer and knew what we had and controlled both ends of a transition. And the Alex Brown business, both by part of the reason we're in it is for the ultra-high net worth access and the technology standpoint, the connections, the systems, were just more complicated. And the agreements with Deutsche Bank are more complicated. ","So the agreements drove the legal costs. And the sophistication and complexity drove the technology cost. So yes, we underestimated it. And Alex Brown was very strategic for us and their growth. But it wasn't 100% down the fairway, what you'd call Morgan Keegan and 3Macs. It was a little stretch in some areas for us on purpose and we were just a little shy. So I think we've done a good job estimating generally conservatively on those costs and we weren't perfect on this one, but $10 million out of $500 million investment isn't going to sway our ROE analysis too much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Harris with Wells Fargo.","Chris Harris","Like to come back to the discussion on commissions at PCG, is there anything that you guys are doing internally that might be having an impact on that number? And one of the things I was just thinking about is if perhaps you've raised the bar for sales of higher commission products. And if that is happening, whether that is having an impact on that number?","Paul Reilly","We've always had a pretty high bar on those and always have been cautious. If anything, with high commissions going way, way back. And Tom's in the room and he beats that drum all the time. So I don't think that's changed. There's been continual growth to fee-based. So that's part of it. And again, you'd have to segment out the syndicate business which has been almost dead which certainly a part of it. And part of is there's been less transactions. So I don't think there's been a change in philosophy or a push to do something that's caused it. I think the natural migration to fee-based along with the muted equity markets have just contributed to that.","Chris Harris","Any financial statistics you guys might be able to share with us as it relates to 3Macs? Maybe revenue and perhaps pretax margin, if you can provide that?","Paul Reilly","Yes, I don't think we've written that up to provide it in some kind of format, but we have disclosed they're 70 advisors and they're about on our average $6 billion of assets in Canada. Our Canadian margins have been near our Private Client Group margins in the U.S. and we'd expect the same thing. That business has been lower margin, really because of back-office costs relative to the size. And we think over time, in that first year that we'll be able to drive a lot of those costs and achieve the margin. But again, we're sensitive both to the people, the culture, making sure we get it right before we're just going to slash cost cutting there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Katz with Citi.","Bill Katz","Just sticking with the DOL theme for a moment, behaviorally what are you hearing from the financial advisors as everybody starts to distill the implications of fiduciary form? And I guess the core question is, are you seeing any kind of pickup in migration to advisory platforms versus more of a historic brokerage model?","Paul Reilly","A little bit. Maybe a little bit. We told the advisors to wait for an answer. I think that some people have come out of the box with a solution have had to backtrack. And I think our message has been very clear to our advisors. They know we're sincere about it. We want a solution that's good for clients, keeps as much advisor flexibility as we can and fair to the firm. That's the way we've always approached everything. Until we know what we're going to do, the worst thing you do is go to clients, tell them one thing and then you change it again and then you changed it again when the law is finalized or understood the product.","So there's plenty of time to make those changes. In April, implementation is to go to your clients and change either commission accounts or fee-based. There's plenty of time to do that. So the key is to get it right. Luckily I think we have a lot of trust with our advisors and clients. And our long term history has been to do the right thing. So I think in the most part, they're nervous because they hear stuff but they realize that it's the right track. So far it's been business as usual.","Bill Katz","Okay. And just a point of clarification, you've mentioned 92% of the advisors have signed off on Deutsche Bank. Can you give us an update on where the related assets might be associated with those?","Paul Reilly","Well, the percentage of assets is very similar. I can't tell you what the total assets were. We will find out soon on the closing. But we don't get weekly or monthly reports.","Jeff Julien","Somewhere between $45 billion and $50 billion for the 92%.","Bill Katz","And then just finally, thank for taking the questions. Stepping back, I think a number of your somewhat close peers have been increasingly embracing sort of technology and Robo-Advisors and you've been sort of pretty clear in your strategy of not doing that. Any shift in your thinking in terms of leveraging any online platforms for client acquisition or servicing in the Private Client Group?","Paul Reilly","We've been very clear that we aren't going to have a separate robo-advisor that just intermediates our advisors. We have never said that we were not going to enable technology that could let clients use that channel. We have an investment central today that manages small accounts for advisors. We've always had in the plans since our plan of the future to take what we already do in asset management and make it more of a direct portal to clients and make it an automated system.","The question for robo-advice was there any real advantage under the DOL rules to put another system in temporarily or intermittently to help with that? I think that's probably no, but unclear. But I would say at first a lot of people ran to that because of it. We will have a client FA-oriented solution, but it isn't a solution that takes it away from the advisor and is a competing channel.","So we're not saying no robo-advisor-like platform. We're in the advisory business. We will have technology that will help them gather and manage assets easier, as all of our technologies really associated with. So it's really a nuance on robo-advisors. When Scott Curtis spoke at his conference, he had two titles, Raymond James Considering Robo-Advisors.","The same interview was, Raymond James Will Never Have A Robo-Advisor. I think it's caught up in the terminology. We will, I believe, have the technology. I just don't think it's going to be a robo direct away from the advisor type of technology.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Hugh Miller with Macquarie.","Hugh Miller","So just, I guess, a follow-up on the DOL. We've been hearing a little bit about the potential for the industry to kind of standardized transactional-based commissions across certain product lines for retirement accounts. I wanted to get your thoughts as to whether or not, I guess, you view that as a viable solution for the DOL's fiduciary standard and what potential of limitation challenges there could be if things kind of go that direction?","Paul Reilly","There so many alternatives. Again, I know you guys want an answer. I'd love to give you one. I think it's unclear. You can do anything within the BIC if you wanted to. But I'm not sure that's smart or good. And we're just looking at all the analysis. I know people have looked at, can you standardize fees in mutual funds on fee-based platforms.","Can you standardize commissions, there are a lot of possible things, but we're not at the point where ready to say what's the right solution for our clients, advisors and us yet. We're just not ready. So we're certainly in dialogue with the industry. So we know generally the options of what people are thinking. We're dialogue with our advisors and we have a big group here that's working on it full time and analyzing the alternatives. And we're systematically starting to make the basis of decisions, what I call them the macro decisions. But we've got a long way before we nail it down or give you a detailed answer like that. It's possible. But we're not there.","Hugh Miller","Okay. I definitely appreciate the insight and just another question following up on kind of the sluggish retail dynamics that you guys had referenced. I understand the syndicate calendar certainly plays a factor there. We have kind of seen, if you look at some of the retail investor sentiment indexes, a pickup over the last four quarters kind of more towards a four-month high, kind of nearing back towards historical norms. It sounds like from your dialogue that you're not really seeing any change in that retail engagement in July relative to what we may have saw in June. Is that accurate?","Paul Reilly","Yes. July is early. We're in the middle of July. We're not reporting on that. I would say we see certainly muted activity this calendar year compared to historic norms. I'm not sure we're ready to call that a structural change, but we're in the middle of analyzing it and make sure we understand the components. And when people are slower into the market we can theorize all sorts of things. We're trying to get as objective as we can on it. So we see the trend. We see it in the industry. We're not immune from it. And so we're looking at it. But certainly the retail investor has been nervous in this market and you can't blame them. We've had a lot of ups and downs this last year.","Hugh Miller","And then last for me. You guys just referenced seeing a little bit more success in the independent channel, obviously mentioning with Deutsche Alex Brown deal and the 3Macs that would kind of change that. But from just kind an organic recruiting environment, is there just more of a willingness for independents to change firms or are you seeing a mix shift where you are seeing kind of in-house advisors at other firms that are adopting the independent channel and coming over to Raymond James in the independent channel?","Paul Reilly","There are a couple of dynamics. First, last year we said was our second-best recruiting year ever. So first, the employee channel's doing better than last year. They are not having a bad year. They are having a very good recruiting year. The independent channel's just having an amazing year and part of that is position of competitors.","So I think we're getting more than our fair share. The report said that recruiting was down 40% in the industry. We're certainly not seeing that. I think we're just in the right place at the right time and the platform's right. So the independent channel I think has been just a bigger share gain. We're getting to see more and more joining, but the employee channel's up over last year. So, even though it certainly isn't lackluster and we're I think at a pace that we can bring advisors on and successfully. ","And frankly if it got too much higher we might even have some concerns about onboarding. But right now we're in good shape. And you get these relative swings. So I wouldn't -- and these swings may last couple years. But it doesn't mean they last forever. So we've watched it go back and forth for a long period of time.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura.","Sharon Leung","This is actually Sharon Leung for Steven this morning. My first question is, Steve, you'd alluded to the possibility at Investor Day of deploying some of your excess capital in securing the securities book, at least marginally. Given the recent pressure at the long end of the yield curve, in your view does this still represent like an attractive opportunity moving forward?","Steve Raney","Yes. Actually, we're still analyzing that. Obviously the rate environment has changed that dynamic a little bit. Jeff mentioned the cash balances, the total client cash balances, the bulk of which are at third-party banks. Those are pretty stable right now, but he also mentioned that were getting ready to get this influx of cash from the Alex Brown clients. So that analysis still continues. We don't want to take a lot of duration risk.","We're not interested in really going out too far in the yield curve to just try to pick up more yield. So anything we would do would be relatively short in duration. But we do think that dynamic where we could move some additional cash to the Bank and have a little bit larger securities portfolio without taking any credit risk, we would do things that would be in the agency and very high-grade munis perhaps, but primarily agency-oriented mortgage-backed securities. That analysis probably is still valid and we're still continuing to pursue that. As you see, we haven't implemented that yet. But we're continuing to analyze it.","Jeff Julien","And it would require nominal additional capital.","Sharon Leung","And then just a follow-up on provision, so provision expenses came in below expectations in the quarter, like you noted. In the past you've guided to provision in the range of 125 to 150 basis points of loan growth per quarter. I guess provision came in below that guidance range this quarter. I was wondering if that guidance still held moving forward?","Steve Raney","Yes. Actually, it's really going to be based on the types of loans that we're growing. When we add securities-based loans and residential mortgage loans, the provision expense and the associated loan loss allowance is lower than our corporate loans. So each quarter that had that new asset composition and the new growth tends to be different. Our corporate growth this last quarter was muted which drove that reduced provision expense percentage. When we have a quarter where corporate loan growth is higher than the other asset categories, then that mix will be different the next quarter, so.","Jeff Julien","And of course in any given quarter we could have credit issues in either direction and we could have qualitative reserve impacts. So those are hard to predict, obviously going forward. But on the growth side I think Steve's comments are correct.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. There are no further questions.","Paul Reilly","Thank you, Raquel. We appreciate you all joining the call. I'm very proud of our results. I think growing assets and revenue in this kind of market is really the long term indicator of success. We certainly had some unusual expense items and certainly environment has -- between technology and regulatory, it's certainly a challenging environment from an expense standpoint. But we're doing a good job of managing it. With the acquisitions coming onboard this year and I think our positioning. I'm very confident that we will do well, given the market any market environment. So, I'm proud of the team. We know we have to earn it every quarter and I appreciate you attending the call this morning. So, thank you.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

We have, in the full text of the press release, done a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP results. For those of you don't have the full press release, it's available either through EDGAR on the 8-K we filed or on our own corporate website, so you can see that reconciliation if you'd like.","Paul C. Reilly","Great. Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, this is Paul Reilly. I want to start off saying we're actually pleased with the quarterly results, and I know it's difficult kind of following given the combination. And it's very difficult actually separating the legacy Morgan Keegan businesses and the legacy Raymond James business because we went through in the process of combining especially in ECM and in fixed income, so the numbers aren't always apples to apples.","I think -- first, to put the quarter in prospect, you have to remember we've been very consistent. Our long-term goal has been to keep as much revenue as we can, is to make sure the environment for producers was a positive environment, that the transition was a positive experience, and that our cost synergies would come later.","And although we did have some severance at the beginning of the quarter in ECM and in fixed income kind of mid-quarter, those costs haven't really flown through. And all the operating costs in terms of dual systems and support are still in place. We told you we would eliminate those redundancies over time, but our focus has been to keep service levels high to retain our producers. And I think you have to put that, so the cost savings will come, but there -- we've purposely not executed on those at this time. We've focused on them, we know they're coming, we know the areas, but they are to come after we get through the integration and make sure that the support levels keep very, very high.","This also was not a positive economic environment for our businesses. If you look at the Private Client business, the S&P was down 3.3%, and our assets under administration combined were down about 1.5%, but that's in keeping with our normal Private Client Group ratio when you see the market fall. And yet, PCG had a good quarter and combine had near a high 9-ish kind of margins.","The bank had a record quarter, had strong loan growth, which hits the reserve as we book loans. And also, from our SNC exam, we did have an additional charge of about $4 million. But as you know, our policy is we always take the lower of the SNC exams for our ratings, and when the SNCs -- when we get a SNC exam that writes up loans, we don't write them up. So the bank, it's been a very solid quarter.","ECM, been a tough market. You can look at our competitor's release, everyone is having a difficult time in this equity capital market environment. And if you look at our investment banking business, we had a very tough April, a reasonable May, a very good June, but July slowed back down. So if you look at Equity Capital Markets' business, our revenues were kind of flat, with additional costs from Morgan Keegan analysts and people we've brought in, which has impacted the equity capital market kind of results for the quarter.","In Fixed Income, we had a reasonable quarter, but you have to remember we also had a number of factors that impacted, I think, profitability. Trading profits were down from our usual run rate because we had a flight to quality. We hedged our munis with treasuries, we used treasuries to hedge. And when it's applied to quality, it impacts our trading profits. Also, the Fixed Income business is a business that does well when there's good spreads, when interest rates are higher and there's a lot of volatility, 3 factors we didn't -- that didn't go our way in this quarter. But given that, we had good results. Maybe a little off from historic, but given the environments, especially with the treasury market phenomena, decent results.","Our Asset Management business continued to perform. Even with this market and down market, we had net inflows. So with all of that, we retained revenue with a down market draft, so our revenue retention is above our estimates and expectations, which is our goal. And even in a tough market, we had flat sequential non-GAAP EPS after the acquisition expenses.","And had the market been flat to up, my guess is it would have -- you would've seen some accretion. But in a down market, we did what we told you we would do, we're focused on those types of expenses. But the expense synergies will come. In terms of the integration, we are on track. Our attention is strong, the mood is great. We've had our summer development conferences with our Private Client Groups, with Morgan Keegan people attending, very, very positive on the firm and the integration. Our systems are on track for consolidation with our fixed income consolidation looking toward the end of this calendar year and the PCG into next -- the first half of the next calendar year. Things are going well.","So we will look at the -- right now, we're running redundant systems with 2 broker-dealers, and we will see cost savings once we consolidate those. So the cost synergies will come. Our focus is in keeping the people.","So with that, I think that's kind of an overview. When you look at the numbers, we know they're moving around. We will, as we projected -- we think if we keep the revenue that the -- this will be a very synergistic combination, which we expect to realize, start seeing the results of it next year.","So with that overview, I'm going to turn it over to Jeff. And I know you're going to have a lot of questions on the pieces given that it's a little more complicated quarter. Jeff?","Jeffrey Paul Julien","Yes,let me add a couple of higher level comments myself, some a little bit redundant with what Paul just said. We did do better, as we said, in the press release text. We did do a little better in revenue retention than we had forecast. That was our primary mission. We, as he mentioned, are running redundant systems at 2 different broker-dealers system. There's actually still 2 systems in the fixed income side until we get fully integrated. And obviously, we have some of the attendant costs of people that are running that, and people that we haven't -- we haven't totally rightsized departments as we haven't fully integrated yet.","So just to take you back to our comments from prior quarters, we anticipated somewhat minimal accretion from this transaction for the first year or so because of this dynamic, and I'd say that's more or less coming to pass, Morgan Keegan is performing as expected or slightly better, and we are incurring the incremental costs that we expected at the corporate level with additional interest for the debt that we issued. We also have some amortization of RSUs and other retention dollars on a quarterly basis now that were part of the deal, that are incremental expenses at the corporate level. And when you net those things, like we said, we're going to -- we expect somewhat minimal accretion until we get through the complete integration at which time we'll see some better realization of expense reductions.","With respect to the actual results for the quarter, I mean, walking through by segment -- and I'm kind of going to respond to some of the comments I've already read in several of the reports that have come out since we released earnings last night. It really is much more appropriate to look at it by segment, to which most all of you do now, as opposed to by line item, within the P&L. It just gets a little hard to track what's coming from where in these line items.","But within the Private Client Group, as Paul mentioned, we had a very good quarter. We're at about $685 million in revenues for that group for the quarter and a 9.4% margin. That's fairly acceptable results. And given the market backdrop for the quarter, obviously, most of the incremental revenues were from adding the 940-or-so Morgan Keegan brokers to the sales force.","Asset Management was about as expected. It moves around with the market that we are remember, an equity-heavy shop there. Not a lot of movement for the quarter versus the prior quarter. The bank, as Paul mentioned, another -- a second consecutive record quarter. Not only did we realize a full quarter of the Canadian loan portfolio that we purchased in February, but we continued to organically add quite a few loans about -- just under $400 million net for the June quarter, and we have had growth organically up until then to which we realized the interest benefits from.","So despite the slightly higher loan loss provision of $9 million in change versus $5 million in change the prior quarter, virtually all due to the SNC charge, we were back ahead of record levels for the bank. The one I skipped over, which really is the one that looks odd when you do the margin calculations, et cetera is the Capital Markets segment. Really a couple of things at work here. It's a little hard, as again Paul mentioned for us, to tell exactly what legacy Morgan Keegan did versus legacy Raymond James as the Equity Capital Markets was fully integrated right after the transaction in early April. And fixed income throughout the quarters was migrating inventory positions and traders and people from one company to the other.","So we're -- I can't really tell legacy to legacy what happened exactly, but for the entire segment, which I'll subsegment into equity and fixed income for a moment, the Equity Capital Markets segment was roughly flat in revenues quarter to prior quarter, but had poorer results than the preceding quarter. Those results were down in Canada, in Equity Capital Markets. And domestically, we added several of the Morgan Keegan people to our platform here in Equity Capital Markets in some of the business units that they cover that we didn't. So we actually had a pretty, not a significant, but a reasonable increase in headcount in Equity Capital Markets for the quarter. And we didn't -- we only had comparable revenues with higher expenses, so we did worse than the preceding quarter in Equity Capital Markets, against a tough market environment, as I'm sure you're seeing in other people's results as well. In the fixed income side of that segment, we did see a nice boost in revenues, a flight to quality. And for those of you new to the story, we have basically, in my mind at least, we were on 4 different categories of inventory. We run municipals, corporates, mortgage backed and then government and agency. When there's a flight to quality, people are fleeing into the government agency. Legacy Raymond James, that was an area we didn't have a big focus on. And when there's flight to quality generally caused either a decline in value or at best flat values in all the other types of securities while government securities are increasing in value.","We use short governments -- short treasuries, typically to hedge part of our municipal bond inventories. We're hedging interest rate risk. We're not hedging credit risk. So when there's flight to quality, in the past, legacy Raymond James has been -- lost value on both the long and the short side, and those have been our worst trading periods. While we had a little -- mini version of that here in this past quarter, thanks to Europe, as the treasury yields on the tenure touched 1.5% in the month of May, and now of course they've gone through that. But offsetting that to some extent is the fact that Morgan Keegan does have a government agency concentration, and now we do, collectively, which -- and those trading profits continue unabated or even pick up in times of this flight to quality. So that enabled us to show an increase in trading profits despite the fact that we had this flight to quality during the quarter. But net-net, probably still below what we would expect as an ongoing run rate in that category absent this flight to quality.","The only other segment I'll mention is we had a revenue boost here from Proprietary Capital as we had a fairly significant revaluation of the last holding in our merchant banking fund, which we do consolidate. So we're picking up 100% of the revaluation, but not very much of that actually finds its way to our bottom line. Plus we had some revaluations of some others that went the other way and others that went the same way. So net-net-net the pretax line and the Proprietary Capital segment didn't move very much from the preceding quarter, but we did have a big revenue boost, so that helped us on the revenue beat that some of you are -- have referred to in your comments.","A couple other factors I'd like to mention. Book value per share ended at $23.29 in the release, by my calc's tangible book value per share is about $21.71.","I do want to talk about comp ratio for moment. It went down about 0.7% on net revenues. We sort of expected it to go down once -- certainly once Morgan Keegan is fully integrated as we're adding a bunch of employees, FAs and businesses where -- with comp ratios lower than our historic corporate ratio. It didn't go down much in this first quarter. While we did add those people, we also had these incremental amortization of comp expenses. Plus, as Paul mentioned, we've only, throughout part of the quarter, started rightsizing some of these departments and still have a little more work to do in that regard. So we haven't -- the comp ratio hasn't gotten, hopefully, all the way down to where it may once this is fully integrated.","On the net interest line, it was actually flat with last quarter, and I sort of consider that sort of expected but sort of a victory. There are really 3 pieces to that. We added $300 million to $400 million of Morgan Keegan margin balances, which added about $3 million of interest earnings to the Private Client segment. We, at the bank, we've mentioned we had higher loan balances in the full quarter of the Canadian loan portfolio, et cetera, which added about $6 million in net interest in that particular segment. That was roughly offset by about $9 million of additional interest at the corporate level for the debt that we issued in the March quarter to consummate the acquisition. So net-net, about awash and about as expected in net interest.","I guess, lastly, what I would say is we've sliced and diced this quarter a lot of different ways. There is a lot of noise. We think we've got everything that came on board from Morgan Keegan classified in the right line items in the right segments to be comparable and to set a baseline here for going forward. But again, it was a solid quarter for Private Client Group, Asset Management. And in Raymond James Bank, we're very pleased with those results. And then, the capital markets against some tough market environments, we -- I'd say we did okay, but that's not at the historic margins that we'd like to get back to.","So those are my comments. Back to my accretion comment earlier, you can see on a GAAP basis we actually were up a couple of pennies from the preceding quarter. We're trying to be pretty judicious about what we put in the nonrecurring charges line. We certainly are not following the kitchen sink mentality on this. We're -- and in fact, they're probably -- if anything, we're going the other way a little bit. There are some things that one could certainly argue are attributable to the integration of the 2 operations. But if there are people costs and things like that, we're not trying to allocate people's time, et cetera. We're really putting in there external, identifiable hard costs in that line item. So that's where the $20 million a quarter has come from so far. This particular quarter, that line item was dominated by severance expenses. In the preceding quarter, it was dominated more by transaction-related expenses in preparing to close the deal.","On a non-GAAP basis, we were flat with the preceding quarter. Again, I think that's probably pretty much as expected given that the Morgan Keegan additive results were somewhat offset by these increased corporate expenses I talked about with the additional interest and the amortization of some of the retention money.","So net-net, I think we came out pretty close to where we thought, not too far away from where the Street thought as well. So I'll turn it back over to Paul.","Paul C. Reilly","Yes. And just again, the highlight is that in a quarter, I think most people in our business showed revenue down. Our revenue is up. We've kept the retention in a market -- in a downdraft market by retaining people. That's been our goal as we've told you from the very beginning, is that we knew we were going to run cost heavy. I think you know us as a shop that manages costs, but we are going to be a little bit heavy through this integration and realize these cost savings as we integrate. And net-net, with a down kind of capital markets and a down S&P this last quarter, I think we had a very reasonable quarter and I think we're very well positioned. Got a lot of work to do on the integration still. It's on schedule. So far we've hit all of our benchmarks, but we've got a lot of work to do. So with that, we'll go ahead and open it up for questions. Brooke?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Hugh Miller with Sidoti Capital.","Hugh M. Miller - Sidoti & Company, LLC","I was wondering -- you commented in the press release about the trend in home office visits. Was wondering if you could just help us to quantify what you're seeing there relative to maybe this time last year and the interest for candidate advisors?","Paul C. Reilly","I don't have the exact statistics, Hugh, but we are -- visits are way up as opposed to last year, and especially in the employee side. And I think the -- I know what was reported by our guys yesterday, but I don't have the numbers in front of me to quote it, so I'm not going to. But it's driven really by, I think, a number -- a couple of the wire houses where retentions worn off, people didn't like how they transitioned to them. And the interesting thing is they're very large advisors, typically multimillion dollar kind of advisers or teams. So it's -- home office visits are only step one, but I had some concern that the combination would make people wonder a little bit about what the environment is going to be like. And I actually think it had the reverse effect, where people realized that we're becoming a stronger and stronger player, and so we're -- those visits are up.","Jeffrey Paul Julien","I think another factor is that prior to this transaction, the Morgan Keegan offices really weren't in a recruiting mode at all. And they certainly now have the ability to recruit to the future Raymond James platform, so they're in some areas where we haven't even been geographically. So that has expanded our universe of recruiters, so to speak.","Hugh M. Miller - Sidoti & Company, LLC","And I guess as a follow-up, given the dynamic that they are large producers, that they've just went through a period and the retention that they're -- they have is kind of running lower, do you get the feeling that there's -- is there any difference in what they're looking for? Is this going to be an environment where it's very price competitive, with upfront money, or do you think that the outlook is really, \"I want to find a home that I'm comfortable working in?\" What are you seeing there?","Paul C. Reilly","That's a tale of 2 cities there. There are certainly companies that are writing bigger checks than we are. There always has been. We've never been the top kind of retention payer. And the people we get are the people that believe that longer term, not only are they going to, through their earnings, do well here over time, but want to be in an environment that's ours. So we do lose some people to the bigger check, and we get a lot of people who want the environment. And once they're here, I can't tell you how many times people say, \"I wish I had done this 10 years ago.\" So we'll lose people to the check, we will. Some people have to recapitalize or they'll get seduced by the size of the checks, which can be pretty big, and there are still people in the market doing that. So I think you're going to see both, but we're not going to do on that economic deals, and we continue to kind of hold our ground.","Jeffrey Paul Julien","But there just -- there seems to be more movement, whether it's for check or for dissatisfaction. There just seems to be more movement out there right now than there has been the last year or so.","Hugh M. Miller - Sidoti & Company, LLC","Okay. And in the Capital Markets segment, obviously, with going out there and talking with institutional clients following the acquisition and the combined franchise, how are those discussions going with regards to the voting process and how much business do you anticipate that you may lose just given that you're combining the offering and you may have some people that will pay you less than they would for each franchise separately.","Paul C. Reilly","Yes. I think that in the Equity Capital Markets side, we didn't assume a lot of synergy on sales and trading outside of the areas where we picked up coverage, we didn't have it before. So we had big overlap there, almost 85% of the names. So even in our own model, we didn't assume a big revenue synergy or really any revenue synergy on the commission side that we felt that we got some good bankers and we've got some good analysts, and that would help, but there certainly was overlap. And we kind of took most of that revenue out of our model. Clients responded very positively. I think they like the combined platform. They liked the parent because they know who we are, and a lot of those clients were the same, both in the Fixed Income and Equity Capital Markets side.","Hugh M. Miller - Sidoti & Company, LLC","And a couple of questions at the bank. I did notice quite a bit of an uptick in criticized loans. I know that the other asset quality trends continue to look like they were improving. But I was wondering if you could make some comments on kind of what was driving that increase in criticized loans and maybe color on why you weren't a little bit more active on the reserve additions given that rise?","Steven M. Raney","Hugh, it's Steve Raney. During the course of every quarter, we probably have 25 to 30 loans that are being upgraded, downgraded based on their operating performance, loans where we're adding to, and in some cases loans that we're not participating and the refinancer being repaid obviously, so there's a lot of activity that goes on. This quarter, what contributed significantly to that increase in criticized assets was the result of the Shared National Credit exam. We actually thought that the results turned out very favorable, and when I say that, there were no directed charge-offs, there were no loans that were put on nonaccrual as a result of that. However, there were about 5 loans that were -- went from pass rating to criticized via the Shared National Credit exam that contributed to the increasing criticized loans. There was not an increase in -- actually a reduction in nonaccruals and in OREO and more problematic asset categories, but we did have an increase in criticized loans via the Shared National Credit exam. And we already discussed the provision expense impact that was -- that came as a result of that.","Hugh M. Miller - Sidoti & Company, LLC","Yes. And was there anything specific to a type of loan categorization within those 5 loans that went criticized?","Steven M. Raney","They were across -- broad industry spectrum. So...","Hugh M. Miller - Sidoti & Company, LLC","Okay. And then the last question at the bank was just with regards to expectations for future loan portfolio expansion. Obviously, I would suspect that the pace was slow, but what are your thoughts there and what are you seeing?","Steven M. Raney","Yes. I mean, you were trying to manage a loan -- the loan portfolio growth in the 7% to 8% range kind of out for the -- on an annualized basis for the next few years. It can be lumpier than that. Obviously, we had a very strong quarter this last quarter. That would translate to loan growth kind of in the $150 million to $200 million per quarter looking out over the next few quarters. The reality is it will, once again, it will be lumpier than that. We may have some quarters that will be short of that and some other quarters that may be higher. I would mention that we did close last week on the purchase of the securities-based loans from Regions Bank that were secured with the Morgan Keegan brokerage accounts, that was $185 million. So that purchase did close. We're now around $300 million in securities-based loans. So that's a category and a product that we're actively growing and working very closely with our Private Client Group financial advisers on.","Hugh M. Miller - Sidoti & Company, LLC","And what was the closing date of that?","Steven M. Raney","The 20th of July, this quarter.","Hugh M. Miller - Sidoti & Company, LLC","Okay. And the last question was just with regard to expectations for kind of severance and the timing and the additions as we look out over the next quarter or 2. Can you give us any color and clarity? Do you have a sense there on the timing of some of those expenses?","Jeffrey Paul Julien","We have some natural attrition actually on the -- from the back office side of Morgan Keegan, but our goal is to keep most of that in place. We will have some trimming, but our focus is to get the systems integrated. So I think you're really looking not for big numbers in this fiscal year, but really into next fiscal year, where you'll see more of that.","Operator","Your next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So maybe just to follow up on the very last question. Can you give us a little bit more sense just in dollar terms how much of a benefit you could see from severance or I guess from lower comp as people kind of leave, bringing you guys to a trim headcount? As well as the technology integration?","Paul C. Reilly","I don't think we've quantified the severance. I don't think we've quantified actually, the savings but we think they're -- from today's run rate, what do we say on the beginning of the...","Jeffrey Paul Julien","Total savings $60 million, $60 million to $80 million.","Paul C. Reilly","$60 million, total.","Jeffrey Paul Julien","Including people costs and systems costs and et cetera, et cetera that we expect, but that's upon full integration. I mean, we didn't -- we haven't quantified the comp associated with the relevant severance at this particular point, but it's also scattered throughout all the segments, predominantly Capital Markets, but some in other areas like ops and IT.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. So $60 million to $80 million on an annualized basis from the current expense run rate, is that the way [indiscernible]?","Jeffrey Paul Julien","That's upon full integration, that's when we finish integrating the Private Client Group early next calendar year.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. So by early next calendar year, that should be in the run rate -- okay, got you. And then maybe flipping this into a similar question, just kind of spinning it a little bit differently. If you look in your -- if you look at your operating margin, you guys are running again this quarter with 14%, I guess, 14.6%. Again, once everything is said and done, how do you think that's going to shake out for the overall business?","Jeffrey Paul Julien","Where -- it depends on a whole bunch of things, what the markets going to do, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. But I think that the preceding quarter, which I know you referenced in your comments, wasn't a bad measure. If we could add all those and maybe improve a little bit on that. It also depends which businesses become dominant because our businesses have very different margins. But we certainly expect margin, we expect -- have expected margin improvement from adding the scale of Morgan Keegan once the businesses are fully integrated, particularly because they have such an emphasis in the fixed income space, which is a higher margin business than some of the businesses that dominate in our P&L like the Private Client Group.","Paul C. Reilly","The numbers that we kind of put out as benchmarks were $20 million to $25 million operational costs savings and the rest were in severance and people costs, in the operating businesses, so we have no reason to believe those are a lot different. And again, it depends on revenue and how the business is doing. So again, our focus has been, we can bring costs down now. And I think a lot of companies would have done that. And it's not that we're oblivious to costs or we don't watch them very closely, we do. But we're running 2 broker dealers with 2 services and we want to keep service levels high, client service high. And we're confident we'll get to the costs. So as we said when we announced this is that people have to be a little patient. We'll get to them, but we're going to make sure the integration happens first. That hasn't changed a bit.","Jeffrey Paul Julien","We said that the majority of the accretion will be realized starting in fiscal '14, and that's still the case because that'll be the first full fiscal year that the full integration is completed.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then my second question is around -- you guys obviously highlighted there's strong retention on the revenue side. Can you quantify some of the things from the FA perspective, something like, I don't know, percentage of FAs that -- for Morgan Keegan that you've been able to retain versus your prior guidance or your prior thoughts? And maybe some measure of productivity of Morgan Keegan's FAs versus Ray Jay's FAs and where they could potentially go to.","Paul C. Reilly","Yes, we've talked about some of these things pre-merger. I guess you -- maybe you weren't covering us then, Alex, maybe. The Morgan Keegan, we have had retention to high 90s percent of those who we made retention offers to, but that was about 560 FAs in the Morgan Keegan system. Obviously, some 400 or so in addition have stayed with us that were at production levels below that, and some may have gone on to other places. But the retention rate of those that we wanted is extraordinarily high. In terms of average production, when we -- prior to the acquisition, we had quantified their average production the same way be calculate it and they were 12% lower than RJA, which we kind of view this somewhat as an opportunity as we presented them with a little more complete suite of products and services that they could expand their practice.","And we haven't -- that gap will have to work the close, but we're putting a number of our products on their platform right now, but we're not going to be able to really move heavily against that number until they're on the same operating -- on the back-office platform. So we are introducing process -- products, asset management products, other things, research to them, giving them tools, but we won't get the full benefit and allow that to migrate significantly until we get them on our operating.","Jeffrey Paul Julien","Right, like to our CMA account platform, for example.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then just a couple of numbers questions. Can you quantify the prop capital boost that you mentioned in your prepared remarks, how much of that contributed to revenues this quarter? And then, how much of the, I guess, minority interest is associated with that kind of gain this quarter? Is it an entire thing? Or is it a little lower, a little higher?","Jeffrey Paul Julien","Well, the majority of the revenues were related to that one -- the vast majority was related to that one company that was revalued that I mentioned in the merchant banking space. We have a very small TP interest in that and we have about a 13% or 15% limited partnership interest in that. But the rest, all would be in the noncontrolling interest category. There are other revaluations as well. There's a company we own 100% of that was revalued negatively for the quarter. And then, this is also the quarter, as somebody mentioned in their comments, that we get the audited statements from all the outside venture capital funds that we have investments in, primarily for investment banking relationship purposes, not a lot of money in them, but at least we do have that investment. And those are all revalued based on their audited statements, which added a little over $1 million write-up from those. So the net-net of all those things turned out to not be a very big number to the pretax line relative to the revenues.","Paul C. Reilly","I think as people looked through, and I understand the questions too, I want to remind people on our kind of our approach to integration cost. A lot of firms would put in retention as an integration cost, we don't. We have a significant increase in overtime from our ops and technology groups, and it's all to support the integration, we expense it all. We only -- our capital -- we're only putting in that category direct identifiable contracts. So if we hire a consultant to help us, an IT consulting company to help us with the transfer, we charge it. If we'd do it, something for Raymond James so that we can free people to work on it, we don't put it in that category. So we're going to run cost heavy during this process until we get the integration because we're not trying to throw everything in there. We're only using a very, I think, conservative direct allocation of cost, and we're going to continue -- that's just been our nature.","Jeffrey Paul Julien","And that goes towards your margin question as well.","Paul C. Reilly","And we are definitely -- if you just look up the overtime report, I just looked at it. We're -- I mean, our costs are up to support this integration, to get through it and get systems combined, and they will be for a little bit and -- but we'll get them in line.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Sorry to follow up on this, but since you guys went there, so on this overtime comment, is that -- when you talk about the $60 million to $80 million of expenses going away, does that include the kind of normalization of the extra time that people put in, et cetera? Or is that might be on top of the $60 million to $80 million? Because it sounds like $60 million to $80 million is just technology and maybe the extra folks that you still have working on your platform.","Paul C. Reilly","Yes, $60 million to $80 million on the prerelease was our determination of cost savings for the back office and...","Jeffrey Paul Julien","People and systems.","Paul C. Reilly","And people and system, and in people, right? All this other stuff that we're carrying, overtime and things like that will go away. Now the $60 million to $80 million is a much big number overtime. But I'm just giving you an example of costs that we are incurring during this integration that we will continue to until the systems are. We're -- we want to make sure that people are supported. Our people are also integrating the Morgan Keegan people, also report to people at Raymond James, and they're streaming those systems and spending a lot of time. So there is a lot of effort during the integration and cost the we are incurring. And I'm sure I don't know what the plane travel is between here and Memphis, but Delta likes us, during this integration time. And we're going to -- we're just going to run heavy for a little bit to our traditional numbers. And I think if you had seen a flat S&P versus one down 3.3% in the quarter, you would've seen, my guess is a little bit of accretion. The market was down a little bit. I think we did well, and the costs are the costs, so -- but don't think we're ignoring them, we're just sticking to our plan.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. All right. Last one for me. At the bank, net interest margin up nicely quarter-over-quarter, 3.69% versus 3.55%. I guess some of those are mix shifts you guys did pick up a little bit of loans. Given the rate dynamic and balancing that with your prospects for future loan growth, how should we think about that shaking out in the next few quarters?","Paul C. Reilly","Yes, I mean, I think that the margins were actually relatively stable, but actually I think down just slightly if I'm not mistaken.","Jeffrey Paul Julien","[indiscernible]","Paul C. Reilly","And I guess the full realization at Canada for the quarter, right? So what we're seeing right now on the new business has been relatively stable, but we do continue to have some resets in our mortgage portfolio from the fixed rate period to the adjusted period. So we're seeing some reduction in our mortgage portfolio in terms of margins. That's been a profitable business for us for the last 18 months though, the new business, in terms of the loans that we are selling to Fannie Mae, the margins have been good in that business. You don't see that in the net interest margin, but you see that in our bottom line. Our commercial business, I would say, over the last couple of quarters has been relatively stable. We had enjoyed a period of wider margins, we saw compression, but I would say over the last couple of quarters has been relatively stable. We're very selective. There's kind of a sweet spot that we play in. There's obviously credits that are below our return objectives, and then there are riskier credits at much wider spreads that we could plan, but we have stayed away from that. So I think that in terms of providing you some guidance going forward, our margin should be relatively stable within 10 basis points of what the run rate has been in the last couple of quarters.","Jeffrey Paul Julien","Yes. We have been guiding people to 3.40% to 3.50% roughly, Alex, and just based on the portfolio that's in place.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. So 3.70-ish now, down to 3.40, 3.50.","Jeffrey Paul Julien","You can -- in any given quarter though, you can have some loan payoffs the way we recognize a bunch of fees that do get into this line item that distort. And on the other hand, we can have excessive amounts of cash that depress the rate.","Steven M. Raney","Its relatively small right now in terms of our overall loan portfolio. The securities-based loans that we're making have a margin of around 300 basis points, so it reduces our margin but it's a very low-risk asset. Once again, it's small, the impact of that is small right now.","Jeffrey Paul Julien","But I think our guidance would stand going forward for the near term.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo Securities.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I just want to come back to the costs again really quickly. The $60 million to $80 million in savings we're expecting here. You mentioned kind of the beginning of calendar 2013 for the majority of that. Should we expect the savings to be more back-end loaded, in other words, savings really need to be mostly realized then rather than kind of incremental improvement over the next couple of quarters?","Paul C. Reilly","Yes, you got things going couple of ways. You'll see some incremental savings like when we did the rightsizing of the fixed income that was mid quarter, so some of that comp adjustment will get through. And again, the size of the operation there -- has gotten somewhat smaller, but most of it you're going to see after the system integration, after we get both systems combined and we could combine back offices is when we're going to be able to execute on that. So those savings, we're pretty comfortable about getting out of the business. And as you know, we also have extra costs. We have the interest costs on our bonds and we have amortization expense that'll come through on RSUs and things like that. But in terms of getting the hard dollar cost out of the business, we will. But I think we have to look -- once we move the system over, and have it complete, stable and running, we'll get a lot of those costs out.","Jeffrey Paul Julien","And there's going to be some real estate cost savings as well as we combine some of the institutional offices in the big cities, as we've done already in New York and other places that once we get those offices combined and either sublease or take a charge or whatever we do for the space that we've abandoned. Yes, there'll be ongoing occupancy expense savings there.","Paul C. Reilly","I would keep you on our original guidance. I see no reasons to think the game plan has changed.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Great. And then in capital markets, I don't think it really surprised anybody that it is a tough environment and revenues clearly aren't around where you guys would like to see them. Trying to get a sense of the magnitude of the change. And I know it's hard because we're now looking at the combined business versus legacy Raymond James in the prior quarter, but can you give us some sense as to the percent decline if you're looking at, like, an apples-to-apples basis, the revenue decline in the quarter in Capital Markets?","Paul C. Reilly","In total Capital Markets or in equity Capital Markets?","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","In total Capital Markets, well, maybe both if you could provide it.","Paul C. Reilly","They're such 2 different businesses, that one is hard.","Jeffrey Paul Julien","As I mentioned in my comments, equity capital markets was roughly flat quarter-to-quarter. We had some added business with some of the Morgan Keegan units that covered areas we didn't cover. But in any given quarter you've got, within that segment, you've got a mixture of M&A, new issue, business and over-the-desk secondary commissions. And the secondary commissions business has been really tough business. The overall pie has shrunk somewhat going forward here, so now -- and then M&A is lumpy as you know, so -- and as -- but for us, with the added horsepower from some of the Morgan Keegan units, we ended up staying flat quarter-to-quarter. Fixed income, which is one of the strengths that they brought to the table here obviously had a significant increase in revenues, virtually all the increase in the segment was related to the Fixed Income business that they brought to the table, but there were redundancies, et cetera, in that area as well that -- such as a municipal fixed income business and things like that. So you don't necessarily see all the benefits of those synergies in this first quarter.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","It sounds pretty good to me, given the environment. I mean, I think some of your peers reporting double-digit percent declines in capital markets revenue. So to the extent you were able to do flat in ECM, I mean, I think that's pretty good. Overall, the organization did about $257 million in total Capital Markets revenues. In a normal environment, where do you think that number could go?","Jeffrey Paul Julien","What's normal?","Steven M. Raney","Yes.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Last quarter?","Paul C. Reilly","That's so hard to say because the Equity Capital Markets pick up and strong equity markets and fixed income historically tends to go down and vice versa. So I would say that neither of those businesses -- certainly, equity Capital Markets wasn't firing on half its cylinders, but fixed income did okay. I mean, it was not a great quarter, not a bad quarter. We're very happy with the sales folks, the throughput, the inventory turn, the inventory management. All the things we thought we are acquiring in Morgan Keegan, we did. We have very good people. So it's a good business. Quarter was down trading profit wise, as we've explained, as treasuries came in, cost of some trading profits net, but it's a good business. So if the market gets really volatile and bad, I mean, the fixed income business will probably do really well if...","Jeffrey Paul Julien","If you look at the overall margin in that business for the quarter of under 11%, that is substandard to what we would expect on a go forward basis. And the revenues -- I don't see why they would -- this was not a blowout good revenue quarter, so I don't see that, that -- that there's certainly some room for upside in the -- on the revenue side as well. But the margin isn't where it needs to be yet.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Mid-teens, Jeff, on the margin is what you'd like to kind of shoot for?","Jeffrey Paul Julien","I think that's achievable with the mix of Fixed Income and Equity Capital Markets that we have.","Operator","Your next question comes from Devin Ryan with Sandler O'Neill.","Devin Ryan - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","The majority of my questions have already been asked, but maybe just get some flavor on the progression of just retail sentiment throughout last quarter. So essentially, did things deteriorate further kind of the back half of the quarter after Facebook and the markets deteriorated a bit more as well. So I just want to get a sense if the things kind of deteriorated as the quarter progressed and if you're seeing or hearing any changes in retail sentiment that's worth noting?","Paul C. Reilly","Yes. I think investor's sentiment certainly is -- if we look at our own index, the number of people thinking the economy is going to get better went down fairly dramatically. I think you had Facebook, you had the equity capital markets in Europe, I think as people see the election now, you can't feel too great. I'm not sure about anything. So the investor's sentiment is negative, but if you look at the movement, a lot of it's been from international and to domestic, we haven't seen a big flight in our system out of equities. There's certainly some high historic cash balances in fixed income. So I think we haven't seen the investors kind of abandon the markets, but they're all cautious. And they're going to stay cautious until they get other signs, so that hasn't changed really.","Devin Ryan - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay, great. And then just to beat a dead horse just a little bit more here. I just want to make sure I'm clear. Is none of that $60 million to $80 million in annual expense run rate production for Morgan Keegan reflected yet in expenses?","Jeffrey Paul Julien","Some of it is, in the areas where we've let people go such as Equity Capital Markets and places like that where we've actually have started to rightsize the business.","Paul C. Reilly","And in the Fixed Income, where we went through that reduction mid-quarter, part of that payroll will be through, but part of that revenue is through too. Some of that is a loss of revenue. We do get to keep a lot of the accounts, but some of it is...","Jeffrey Paul Julien","Equity Capital Markets isn't made up of all producers. There are a lot of financial analysts and research analysts and other people that don't necessarily have revenue tied to them that we would put in that expense savings category.","Paul C. Reilly","We'll get the costs out. And if the markets got really tough, we would move on costs a little quicker just as you would in any business. But right now, the focus is getting a good, smooth transition, and it's been excellent. So the numbers are there, I just think it's going to -- we got to get to them.","Operator","Your next question comes from Douglas Sipkin with Susquehanna.","Douglas Sipkin - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Just had a couple of questions. First, with respect to maybe the SNC and the credit quality stuff. I'm just curious, I mean, it just seems like it's a little bit of a divergence from sort of some of the metrics that you guys are reporting. And maybe it doesn't tie in as much because of the residential, but it looked like the residential finally should have realized improvements. So I'm just wondering, was there any sort of specific nuance to this quarter? It just seems like the SNC -- the impact was a bit of a surprise, considering the way things have been trending.","Steven M. Raney","I guess, like I was just -- going back to my comment, we move loans every quarter up and down, and so -- and I know that each -- last 4 or 5 years, we've had some impact from the Shared National Credit exam. We have 360 borrowers, the vast majority of them are subject to the Shared National Credit exam. So it's been a relatively small number of loans that the Shared National Credit exam were different than how we had things rated. That said, I think the regulators are taking a harsh look at anything that has any leverage to it, even if the cash flows are very strong and the operations and even a growth may be there. Anything that has some leverage to it, even if there's plenty of liquidity and access to capital, they're -- in some cases, once again this is somewhat isolated, moved a loan to a criticized status. Once again, in every situation that impacted this in terms of our provision expense, we feel comfortable with the credits that we're in. And actually, it's kind of funny, a couple of them have announced -- one of them has a planned offering to raise more equity, and another company is refinancing entirely and will probably exit the credit. So none of these were moved to a status that -- where we felt like there was an accrual issue or anything along those lines. So we feel actually pretty comfortable with those downgrades.","Paul C. Reilly","And I just want to say you've tracked us for a long time and we tend to be conservative, we do not think that the credit quality has deteriorated at all this quarter.","Douglas Sipkin - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. Then maybe shifting gears a little bit. Any sort of update on the Asset Management business? I know you guys have been looking to expand there and leadership there sort of indicated that there may be something happening this time, maybe something happening this year, any more color around Asset Management growth plans?","Paul C. Reilly","We are very methodically still looking for a large cap manager, either a firm or a lift out. We have been talking to people. It's a very entrepreneurial business, so often people get interested and cold feet and interested and cold -- it's a cycle. And we still want to do that. We're focused on doing it. We continue to meet with people. And if we can strike the right deal with a manager we like that fits into our culture, we will. And those efforts are ongoing. So we haven't lost the focus on it even during this integration, but we don't have anything to announce.","Douglas Sipkin - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. And -- so historically -- and I know, I mean, this is going back a bit, but Tom James sort of indicated there are certain levels -- buyback was never part of your guide strategy. But at certain levels, certain multiples of book, I forget, it was 1 2, 1 3, you would consider it. I mean, has that changed given sort of the increased leverage on the model, on the sort of buybacks out basically? Just because obviously, you guys are comfortable with the coverage -- while you do in fact have more debt. Or if it gets to sort of some multiple of book, maybe that would be something you would consider again?","Paul C. Reilly","We -- our policy has not changed at all. I do think that depending on where we are in a credit or economic cycle, we look at it and make decisions. Right now, we like our liquidity and our position and have no real need -- interest to buy back stock. We're staying very liquid through this period of time. Who knows where the economy is going to go. And so we've announced no buyback plans, but our philosophy hasn't changed. In '08 and '09, we had a lot of opportunity, but we didn't buy back because given the liquidity in the markets, we didn't use our capital. So it's all situational, the philosophy is intact.","Douglas Sipkin - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Got you. And then just last question. Obviously, you guys look to be having a lot of success on the employee side, you're hiring recently, and clearly some are bigger producers. Any plans to maybe get a little bit more aggressive on the independent side because that also looks like it's becoming a really nice channel as more and more brokers break away and sort of look to go on their own. I mean, is there -- is that a focus for you guys? Do you maybe spend -- plan on spending a little bit more money to continue to upgrade infrastructure or -- just curious, what your thoughts are there because that also looks like it's a hot place with some recruiting now.","Paul C. Reilly","Yes, we've actually hired more recruiters. We're focused on it. We've never abandoned the independent channel. I think that some of our competitors, numbers wise, have done better, but we kind of have producer minimums. We're not in the technology roll-up or product sales game. So our focus has been on the high-end producers. We want to add advisers that meet some certain size and quality. So we're still in it, we're still recruiting, we've combined our recruiting efforts actually to try get a more focused penetration, but we have not given up on the independent channel. I think what you see is in great equity capital markets, the independent channel gets very popular with people. In these markets, people become a little more conservative. So it's a little more safe environment, but they're both -- we're recruiting in both, just the -- as a percentage, the employee side has just been busier recently, but we're still focused on both.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Alim Shaikh with KBW.","Alim Shaikh - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","In terms of investment banking, what was the breakdown between equity and debt underwriting in advisory?","Jeffrey Paul Julien","We do, well, we don't do much -- we do municipal debt underwriting, we don't do -- we're not really into corporate debt underwriting in any meaningful way.","Paul C. Reilly","It's small enough, we don't even focus on the number.","Jeffrey Paul Julien","In that $70 million line item, is that what it is?","Alim Shaikh - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Yes.","Jeffrey Paul Julien","It's about $17 million, $18 million M&A. At $23 million plus $5 million, so $28 million in what you'd call traditional underwriting business, new issue business. About $16 million in public finance debt, and then there's about $8 million in our -- in that line item related to our tax credit fund origination business.","Alim Shaikh - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Great. And what was the period end share count?","Jeffrey Paul Julien","About 137 million.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Stelmach with FBR.","Steve Stelmach - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","On the Private Client Group, on the operating margin, you guys mentioned the 9% this quarter. When I look back over the past 10 years of that business, it's averaged right around 9%, yet we're in a pretty lackluster environment. You got a lot more skill today than you have in the past. Where can we expect that number to go to? Or in a better world, I mean, you sort of guided to mid-teens of institutional business. Is that pretty analogous with what you expect to see in PCG or could it go higher?","Paul C. Reilly","No, we've focused on kind of 10%.","Jeffrey Paul Julien","We have said in the past, Steve, that in a really good market environment that if we got on our mix of contractors, employees including the operations we have in Canada, and the U.K., et cetera, when all that is blended together, we got to 12%, that would be like a good next step.","Steve Stelmach - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Yes, Okay. So I mean still, you got a little leverage there, but more so probably coming out in the institutional business in sort of the operating margins?","Paul C. Reilly","I'd say today, that's accurate.","Steve Stelmach - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay, great. And in terms of interest rate sensitivities still for this similar opportunity there, if and when rates ever get so high?","Paul C. Reilly","We quit mentioning when short term rates go up.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions. Gentlemen, do you have any closing remarks?","Paul C. Reilly","Thank you, Brooke. Just to say, I appreciate the complexity for those who have been following us a long time and the couple that have initiated coverage. This is an unusual quarter in terms of numbers moving around. But we gave you initial guidance on what we thought this could do for us. We also said we thought it could be accretive, it would be more accretive than a positive market. The first quarter was a little more positive, so we got a little running room, but this last quarter certainly wasn't, the first quarter, the combination. So we're sticking to our strategy of just focusing on revenue retention, which I think we've been very successful at, and we don't take for granted that it's over. The integration is going according to plan. The cost savings, as we gave original guidance, we think are there, but we said we would take them later, not earlier, and we're still focused on that. So, so far, so good. We have a lot of work to do and appreciate your questions. And I think when we look back on this, if we continue this -- if we're able to continue executing as we have been, we'll look back a year to 2 from now and say this was great combination, but that's all up to the execution and retention. So thanks for your time.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes the conference. You may now disconnect."],"18430":["Raymond James Financial, Inc.

After I read the following disclosure, I'll turn the call over to Paul Reilly, our Chief Executive Officer; and Jeff Julien, our Chief Financial Officer.

We urge you to carefully consider the risks described in our most recent Form 10-K, which is available on the SEC's Web site at sec.gov.","So with that, I'll turn the call over to Paul Reilly, CEO of Raymond James Financial. Paul?","Paul Reilly","Thanks, Paul, and good morning. I\u2019ve got little cold here, you have to excuse my voice. While we\u2019re here in St. Petersburg focused on recruiting, we can watch the world leaders focused on solving the world\u2019s problems. But it\u2019s a little bit warmer in St. Petersburg [indiscernible].","I'd like to start by saying first it\u2019s a solid start to our fiscal year, especially considering the volatility uncertainty in the whole capital market segment. Quarterly net revenue of $1.25 billion is up 6% over prior year, and down from the 3% from the preceding quarter. Part of that is based on an adjustment we\u2019ll talk about. And we\u2019re also comparing it to last quarter, which was an exceptional investment banking quarter.","Pretax income of $203 million, which is up 16.2% of pretax on net revenue, net income of $126 million or $0.87 per diluted share. Our ROE annualized is 12% on a conservative and somewhat argue prudent capital base, given the state of the economy and particularly 12% given the rate environment we believe is very good on our capital base.","Most importantly our key drivers of our business are up record quarterly AUA of $483 billion, down from last month, but a quarter of record. Record quarterly assets under management of $66.7 billion, net loans of $11.8 billion and maybe most importantly which drives those other factors is that a net 71 addition of financial advisors in the quarter alone.","Going to the Private Client Group, quarterly net revenues of $845 million, up 8%, but down 2% from the previous quarter, 8% over last year and $19 million of that revenue -- Jeff will address the $10.5 million kind of mutual fund adjustment, which adjusted in this quarter, but could have spread over the last five years and 6% plus in some syndicate and insurance and other conditional products that was down in the quarter. Pretax income was $93 million, which is 30% over last year\u2019s quarter and 11% pretax margin to net revenue. So a strong performance by the Private Client Group keeps marching on.","Retention; keeping our good advisors is job one, and we had good results in the quarter, and recruiting is job two, with a 158 additional advisors over last year\u2019s quarter and 71 over the sequential quarter. The pipeline of our HOV which are Home Office Visits is very robust and we look forward to a good recruiting season. Client assets under administration are $459 billion. 38% of that is in fee based accounts. In fact or total recruiting revenues in the Private Client Group segment are getting about 75%. Capital markets, quarterly net revenue of $232 million, down 3% from last year and 11% sequentially, but again last quarter we had a record investment banking revenue year. ","M&A stayed really good at $47 million, but other investment banking revenue was down. And the number of deals in the U.S. were essentially flat. We had a few less lead deals in that quarter and our fee per deal and our revenue per deal that we participated in was down. And this was compounded by very weak conditions in the Canadian Capital Markets, an energy based economy which has been tough going. Our tax credit funds are also down about $6 million due to timing, not the run rate, just when we closed deals. So they all impacted the quarter.","Volatility helped our institutional commissions, up 10% sequentially in equities and 12% in fixed income. Our trading profits were down, but again some unusual factors. $2 million of that was due to fixed income, softer previous quarter. The $3 million was really a write down in Canada due to an energy related deal and a brought deal that we were right lead on. So those impacted trading profits. ","Asset management is kind of humming along, record quarterly assets of $56.7 billion, 10% over the private year, both by market appreciation and net flows, about 800 million of net flows by managed accounts for the last quarter. Record net revenue, a $99.6 million benefited from a $5 million performance fee. We had a record pretax of 39.8% -- pretax was $39.8 million which gave us a 40% margin, but that\u2019s due to those factors and we expect that to move more towards that 30% margin target.","RJ Bank record net loans up $850 million sequentially, part of that driven by an acquisition of the $207 million residential portfolio. Record quarterly net revenues of $100.5 million, pretax of $66.4 million, up 20% over last year\u2019s quarter, NIM improved two basis points over last quarter, essentially flat with last year. The loan loss increases were almost entirely due to loan growth, not credit issues. In fact our credit metrics continue to improve. If you looked at non-performing assets as a percent of total loans that declined from 60 bips from 69 bips a year-ago included size loans were down also. ","So with that, I'm going turn it over to Jeff, who will go into some more detailed numbers. Jeff?","Jeff Julien","Thanks Paul. Paul touched on several line items, so I'll try to just hit the ones that he did not touch on. When you compare this quarter to last year\u2019s quarter in general, most of the revenue and expense line items are pretty self-explanatory. Commissions and fees are up obviously, largely PCG and just our general size with more advisors, more assets et cetera. He touched on advisory fee. We did have a performance fee last December as well, in fact about twice the size of the one this year. So that\u2019s an even more impressive gain in advisory fees over the prior year. Interest is up on revenue side and that\u2019s just merely as a result of the bank's growth. Finally all that loan growth we had is kicking into net interest.","Account and service fees is going to continue to grow just as our general size grows. I know we -- I said last quarter maybe a 108 was the right run rate and that\u2019s kind where everyone had modeled it, but the fact is between all the various types of fees that go in there with IRA fees, transaction fees and some fee accounts, all kinds of fees that are assessed around the organization, that are actually the fees we get from other banks and our bank suite program -- remember that\u2019s not interest, that's fees us, and all those things fall into that line. So that\u2019s going to continue to grow as our overall asset base grows. ","Paul has touched on trading profits and the factors there. Other is down pretty significantly from last year, but last year we had a bigger private equity gain in the quarter than we did this year and we also had $5.5 million gain from ARS redemptions that we did not have this year. On the expense side, just a couple of things that deserve mention. One is versus last year first quarter communication and information processing is down pretty significantly, also down just slightly from last quarter, preceding quarter and certainly versus your estimates and I know that\u2019s because of our guidance toward a bigger number. While we have a -- you might think this is a fairly easy line item for us to budget, but the fact is while it\u2019s not difficult to budget total spend, it\u2019s a little bit tough for us to judge when and how things will be capitalized versus expensed when things are completed along the way, and it\u2019s also difficult as other examples in various projects, if we use employees to do the project, whether it\u2019s a maintenance project or whatever, it could be an expense item. And if we hire outside consultants to do it, it falls in the IT expense line item. So it\u2019s a little difficult for us to get the P&L impact on that line item. Although, we certainly talk about total spend at the budget meetings quite a bit.","Business development is going to continue to increase, largely due to recruiting efforts, estimated advisory, sub advisory fees obviously growth in assets where we're the advisor and we sub advise in some of our programs to unaffiliated managers. The bank loan loss provision is up pretty dramatically from both last year and last quarter and that\u2019s -- I don\u2019t think $9.4 million provision expense should really shock anyone in light of $846 million in net loan growth in the quarter. That\u2019s not all corporate loan growth. It\u2019s in the various categories.","So I know through November I think we\u2019d only had $300 million of net loan growth from the September. So obviously we had a very, very active December in loan growth at the bank and that's including a full purchase of residential loans and that led to the bigger production and the bigger provision for the quarter.","And then the other expense, so that\u2019s another item that\u2019s going to get bigger just as we get bigger. There are a number of individual small items that go into that particular line item. Versus the preceding quarter, the securities commissions and fees they had -- Paul mentioned they were up nicely on the capital markets side but down sequentially in the private client group side. And that decline of about $19 million was about half of that, or a little more than half of that was made up by this mutual fund adjustment, which relates to our going back five years, related to share classes used in retirement accounts. We\u2019ve heard that this was going out to other firms. So we voluntarily went back five year period and that\u2019s the kind of a systematically generated worst case type number. I think when we scrub it we may have some positive adjustments to that going forward. But for now it\u2019s about a $10.5 million type item that we\u2019ve chosen to reverse out of commissions. Again it covers over a five year period looking back. And then appropriately we took the corresponding reverse loan expense, commission expense related to that.","Investment banking, we had a huge September quarter, record quarter for us in September. So obviously you would expect a good decline there. Again Paul mentioned as pretty active, just the economics per transaction were a lot lower than they were in the preceding quarter. We talked about investment advisory fees. They're obviously tracking assets and we had the performance fee this time. Interest is still generated at the bank predominantly in terms of the increase. The other revenues are actually up nicely. We had little more PE gains and we also had -- in this particular corridor we had a sale of an OREO property at the bank for a profit which kicked in there.","On occupancy and equipment, it may look odd that that would decline. If you remember it was a little bit high in the preceding quarter. We talked about a couple of factors in terms of some maintenance work that was being done at one of our facilities in south field and some things like that, that made a little bit higher than the run rate last quarter. So it\u2019s really kind of on track. And then the other expense -- one other item I\u2019ll mention, that's kind of rationing of other expense. We actually have several of our tax credit fund deals that have been purchased by our own bank as part of their CRA program and it\u2019s a good after tax return to the bank. The accounting has been changed on those such that if you buy them from a third party, the tax effect of what would have been a pretax loss all gets netted down below in the tax line. However, since we\u2019re buying it from an affiliated party, on a consolidated basis we end up showing that as a loss, a pretax loss, on our statement. And then correspondingly we get a tax benefit. So, not a huge factor. We only have I think three transactions that we own at the bank. But just one more nuance that's going to impacts us.","Let me just talk about three other things. Our pretax margin obviously came in well above our 15% target for the quarter at 16.2% and perhaps our internal target may ratchet up over time here, given the state of our businesses and the fact that we\u2019re seeing the leverage from the increased revenues in these businesses that we\u2019ve talked about over the years.","Comp ratio was down to 67.2% but remember we had a couple of adjustments. We had some -- this mutual fund, the expense side of that was reversed in there. We also in every December reverse whatever over accruals we had from the prior year in incentive compensation pool. That\u2019s a factor every year. We try to keep it under 10 million, but it's there every December quarter for us to some extent. Without those things it would have been high 67, and again 68 is an annual number, annual target for us, not necessarily to happen every quarter, just once because of the incentive comp reversal is typically a little lower and then next quarter would be a little higher with FICA restarting another things that we talked about a year-ago.","Lastly the tax rate was 37.8%, a higher than was projected and I guess I would say we try to every quarter look at what our annual tax rate is going to be based on what we know for the year-to-date. We don\u2019t know whole lot by the end of December for the whole fiscal year but one of the things we do know is what the quarterly gain or loss is and it was a nice gain for the quarter. It was about $6 million gain for the quarter. So we assume for the balance of the year that it\u2019s not going to change. We don\u2019t assume that that\u2019s going to be $6 million per quarter. So, on a bigger pretax income base we have less affect from that. And we sort of somewhat conservatively I think estimate all of the annual impacts, just because we don\u2019t want a negative surprises, but the minimize the negative surprises through the end of the year in terms of the tax rate, but for those modeling forward, if you assume a flat market rate environment or flat -- that 37.5 type tax rate probably is still a pretty good estimate to year going forward. Paul?","Paul Reilly","I'll give you kind of a little bit of a floored look. Again once our key to good -- the areas is the key drivers of our business, which is related to the private client group are all very positive. So assets under administration and since we bill quarterly in advance, we get some tailwinds from that. Perhaps that\u2019s under management or up. Net loans with the provision this quarter but those loans should be producing next quarter. Recruiting remains robust and this is the peak recruiting season this next quarter, so in terms of visits. So takes a while between a visit and a sign on but that's been going very good. In private client group productivity of the advisors continues to go up. So we should have a tailwind in that area. This also impacts the asset management in the bank. So for us the key is our culture, is I think one of the reasons that our net additions are so good is that we're focused on making this a very friendly place to work, and that\u2019s our number one. It allows us to keep people. It allows us to offer less transition assistance than other firms do to bring people in, because people want to be here. ","We continue to invest heavily in our tax spend, so when it gets down, I think the annual run rate we still hold to. I believe we're becoming a leader really in the FA desktop technology. Asset management continues to grow with net flows driven by PCG recruitment. Again the 40% margin I think was a blip, that 30% margins were a normal run rate for it. Bank growth is always tougher to predict. As Jeff, said last quarter wasn\u2019t really big through November and then we had a great December, and a little slower start in January. So it\u2019s always hard to predict what\u2019s going to happen there. The NIM increased to two basis points. I think it spells hopefully that spreads are widening a little bit but.","Jeff Julien","But on that I think we are still comfortable with the mid-teens guidance in overall net loan growth for the year, and I think we're still comfortable with 3%ish net interest margin for the year, even though we've seen some gradual improvement there?","Paul Reilly","And then Canada will have some impact next quarter. The 25 decrease does affect our variable rate loans in Canada. It's got a $600 million book. So all-in-all I think we're in good shape from those businesses. Capital markets is a tough one. Volatility increases certainly helped institutional commissions, but volatility sometimes makes it harder to go to market, depending if it's volatile, trending up or trending down but -- so that has some questions and we do have a very good oil and gas midstream energy practice. One of our biggest practices certainly in terms of financings could impact the short-term if oil prices stay down. Certainly M&A aspect, which we do a fair amount of also would be up. And the Canadian business is certainly impacted because its commodity based practice. But even within that we're growing platform, we added a consumer team last quarter, this quarter added a life sciences team and new head of M&A in Canada. ","Public finance coming off a great year, still a tough market. We went from actually 10 to number 8 in the league tables, for full credit to lead on negotiated issues. For the first time hit over $10 billion last year but still a tough market. Fixed income trading profits were more difficult as we get a flatter yield curve. Institutional commissions certainly have increased. There's been a lot of questions I guess for everyone in general on energy exposure. So I'll talk a little bit about ours. If you look at our loan book, about 3.4% of our loans are broadly in the energy sector. We only have one loan to an E&P company and it an investment grade rated facility. And that we do have some sort of servicers, small exposures but most of them are midstream kind of companies and we feel pretty comfortable with our loan exposure. We have been discussing it don\u2019t feel -- unless oil prices stay down for a very long time that will have a negative impact. So we like our credit exposure. Certainly I think oil prices are good for consumers' long term. So we have a big consumer based business here. So it may show up in other parts of our business and short term could have an impact on our investment banking financing part of our business, but creates an M&A opportunity.","The next quarter in some ways is a tougher quarter for us. It\u2019s -- sometimes when the lot of deals close by year end you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen in the first quarter in banking. Certainly our comp ratio will be higher for a number of reasons, not just the reversal going away but FICA hits us in this quarter. As you remember, if you go past it\u2019s one of the increased costs. We also send out lots of statements at the end of the quarter and there's a $2 million impact on that that hits us in this quarter for annual reports and client statements.","So with that the basics of the business are really strong. I like being here at Raymond James with our position in terms of growing assets capital and advisors. Short term, it\u2019s hard to tell in this type of environment with both the global economy and what\u2019s happening in the U.S. We feel very, very comfortable in our position for the year but it\u2019s hard to predict what\u2019s going to happen next quarter.","So with that, Felicia, I guess we\u2019ll turn -- open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities.","Devin Ryan","So, I just want to dig in a little bit on the NIM in the bank. And I guess, the puts and takes there too. I know there's a long moving parts with clearly some rate pressure here. But then the loan growth has been still upsized and not all of that has been reflected yet. So, I guess the question is does it go up structurally with the loans that you brought on? And then the kind of the offset is the mortgage and rate pressure is going to go off. But I'm just trying to think through kind of some of the moving parts to how you say 3% or it may even go up a little bit from here?","Steve Raney","Devin, good morning, it\u2019s Steve Raney. As Jeff alluded to, the 3% it\u2019s kind of a good target I think for the balance of the year. I would say right now we\u2019re seeing actually maybe a slight widening in corporate credit spreads. Residential spreads have probably pulled in a little bit. But things are relatively stable right now. So we\u2019re pretty confident that that number is going to be pretty flat for the balance of the year on when you blend it all together.","Devin Ryan","Okay, got it. Thanks. And then just looking at the\u2026","Steve Raney","I am sorry Devin. I was just going to remind to everybody that majority of our loans are floating rate LIBOR based loans. Both our corporate loans as well as our growing securities based loans where we\u2019re making loans to Raymond James clients secured with their Raymond James brokerage account. So those two loan components are almost exclusively LIBOR based floating rate loans.","Devin Ryan","Got it, thanks Steve. And then with respect to the debt underwriting business, I know there was some pressure this quarter as you alluded to. But I guess the revenues just look pretty soft given that you\u2019ve had some pretty nice improvement there the past few quarters. So just little more color there would be helpful. Was there seasonal factors, or was it related to just kind of the macro backdrop and the outlook for that business specifically, just given that kind of we took a descent step back in this quarter.","Paul Reilly","I can tell you our pipeline is strong. We\u2019ve moved up in market share. It\u2019s just the macro market. So when it increases we\u2019ll do well. We\u2019re well positioned. We have a good team. We\u2019re continuing to expand the team actually and grow in the market. So there is nothing. It\u2019s hard to tell. The backlog is very good in the business. But it\u2019s just new issues are down across the board.","Devin Ryan","Got it, okay. Fair enough. And then just lastly here, with respect to the, just a clean-up item, the commission adjustment that occurred, the corresponding expense, what was that in the independent channel or the traditional channel? Just trying to kind of get a sense, because I know that can have a big impact in terms of what the commission rate is that was netted again? So I'm just trying to get a better sense of the actual earnings impact?","Paul Reilly","We just made a broad assumption at this point of half and half and they\u2019re [indiscernible] about 60% charge for our payout rate.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Christ Allen with Evercore.","Christ Allen","Just wanted to talk a little bit about the communication information processing line. You guys provided some color there. In the last quarter there was -- you talked about being on a big of hiatus in terms of capital projects. We\u2019re just trying to think about how that line should look going forward, just kind of a good run rate right now or should that start to creep back up again?","Jeff Julien","I think it will start to creep back up. Remember Paul mentioned that next quarter -- it\u2019s not just IT. It\u2019s really all we call all communication. So we've put some of these mailing costs and things like that in there as well which are seasonally high in the March quarter, with 1099 year-end statements and shareholder information. That\u2019s over a $2 million charge just because of that, and to the extent that we kept up our spend rate, which we know we are still investing heavily in technology to stay current here. Some of the things that we have been working on will start to amortize. Some of that will be taken in. So I would certainly expect it to creep back up toward where we have been guiding previously, which was the low-to-mid-60s, but again it\u2019s a little hard -- bit of a hard number to put our thumb on. So I can emphasize for your situation.","Christ Allen","Got it. And then I appreciate the color, just in terms of the energy exposure in the loan book, just wondering how big of a component the capital markets business\u2019s energy been historically? It sounds like stuff [ph] in the account is a little bit weak right now, and you provided disclosure on the Canadian overall revenue. Just wondering within the bank because, I am sorry, within the capital markets piece how big energy is?","Paul Reilly","It depends when? Last year was 15%, it goes up and down. Real-estate is our biggest practice followed by Energy. But it depends how those cycles are doing. ","Jeff Julien","And of that 15% a good portion of that was advisory base as well. So it wasn\u2019t all underwriting 15%, 20%. ","Christ Allen","I would imagine, this current pullback is going to create opportunity longer term within that business. So not all bad, near-term obviously a challenge. And then I just one other question, just within the bank, it looks like other income, that was about $4 billion roughly, $3.5 million to $4 million. I was wondering is there is anything one-timer in there or is it because it was a big jump what we calculated last quarter?","Paul Reilly","Yes, Chris, one of the things that we alluded to earlier was the sale of a oil property, property that we had foreclosed on, where we sold it for more than we had written it down to. That was about a $550,000 contribution. There is a bunch of other items that are comprised in there, foreign exchange. We mentioned in the September quarter that we don\u2019t have any other foreign exchange. We moved the loans, the Canadians denominated loans to the Canadian finance company. So there we are really fully hedged now. So we don\u2019t have that volatility in the bank\u2019s earnings going forward. So those were the contributing factors. ","Jeff Julien","And there was a loss negative in the September quarter. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Christian Onwugbolu with Credit Suisse. ","Q \u2013 Christian Onwugbolu ","Just a follow-up on the tax spend, but a bit of a broader question. You've done a very good job in terms of improving solutions for advisors, but I'd like to get your latest thoughts on what areas you're targeting for future investments. And also any thoughts around any additional investments needed for things like data security?","Paul Reilly","First -- I will take them in reverse. We data security very, very seriously and we've had both our auditors and other consultant kind of review our security, and we get high marks for our size. We have Bella and her team and the person that heads our data security have done a great job. As you all know in this environment we think we're safe as you can be, but nobody is bullet proof. So we're active in it with active monitoring. So it\u2019s in a focused area, and I guess the bad guys get better and we continue to spend more, but we feel like we are as state of the art as anyone in this area, certainly can\u2019t spend what the biggest firms spend but nor do we have a broad global exposure.","In technology we continue to -- we've focused a lot on the FA desktop and reporting. We're spending more time now on cash movement, whether it\u2019s taking a picture of a check and depositing or making it easy to journal or make our trading systems easier, integrating a lot of our data platform so that we can do more data mining and on the underlying systems and able to add to new modules. So it\u2019s pretty broad based. We started out with the plan -- a five year plan. We're half way through it. We are right on every place we are and we continue to improve and get better. So it's certainly just helping quality of the system all the way across the make our advisor life easier and be able to manage the business better.","Q \u2013 Christian Onwugbolu ","And then on the fixed income business, I appreciate it\u2019s very hard to forecast. But your results have held in pretty well here. If the environment stays as it is today, just love to get your latest thoughts on how you see, kind of the revenue trajectory there, what would be the next [indiscernible]?","Paul Reilly","Gosh, I would have been wrong calling the bottoms for a while. So, I guess the worst case scenario is that short-terms rates go up a couple of hundreds bips and we have a flat yield curve through the tenure and for fixed income. However we're voting for it. It will be very good for Raymond James consolidated. So certainly volatility help in trading, but the flatter the yield curve the harder it is on trading profits and on -- and even on commission volumes long term. So a low flat curve is the worst case and if you had to project it looks like we\u2019re moving closer to that and farther from it right now. So we like volatility and a steeper yield curve. So you\u2019re going to have to make some predictions on that business. So we got a great team and great distribution. They're very active with the clients. And so you\u2019re right. We\u2019ve done better than most. But I can\u2019t tell you what the macro trends are. I can\u2019t say anything short term it\u2019s going to make the business look a lot better. And as I tell our people internally, we believe that we have an A-team in the D market and still double digit margins and with a terrible market. So I don\u2019t see short term really, but we\u2019ve got a good team.","Q \u2013 Christian Onwugbolu ","Okay, thanks for the color there. And then just lastly from me, Jeff, just remind us some potential [ph] client cash, how much client cash you have on the platform. How much of that is being swept to third parties and then what kind of yields you\u2019re getting on that sweep?","Jeff Julien","We\u2019re up to about $32.5 billion. It\u2019s actually increased as we brought on new clients and new financial advisors from the September. We have probably $28 billion of that $32.5 billion sitting in our bank suite program, $10.5 billion of that roughly going to our own bank and balance to unaffiliated banks. You know what the spread is in our own bank because we\u2019ve talked about the NIM. The spread from outside banks, pretty big range but we\u2019re seeing some upticks in that. There is more demand from outside banks. We\u2019ve seen an increase. We\u2019re over 30 basis points now on average. And we\u2019re seeing all the new contracts that come up for renewal and the new banks that were bringing on are at higher rates than the ones that are running off. So we\u2019ve seen a little turnaround there really started about six to nine months ago where banks actually now want deposits again. They aren\u2019t quite as easy to come by as they were in the past.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Katz with Citigroup.","Neil Stratton","This is actually Neil Stratton filling in for Bill this morning. I just want to ask the question about the Private Client Group. You mentioned the robust recruiting trends. So the two part question is A, where is the growth coming from and then B, how does the productivity compare of the incoming recruits versus the overall platform? Thanks.","Jeff Julien","Couple of things. First the growth in general comes from warehouses, for people who are I would say from acquired firms. The deals build off and they are seeking kind of the cultures they grew up in. So, that\u2019s general. But also we\u2019ve had -- we focused on opening up the West and North East. It\u2019s a big focus of ours, started couple of years ago and it\u2019s starting to pay off. So a third of our recruiting growth has come just in the West Coast and North East. And it happened to be amongst the biggest markets. So we have very low penetration. So we see huge opportunity there and assigned some large teams and continue to have a lot of interest in the West and North East.","And if you look at our platform, we have national advertising, national servicing, call centers. So the marginal cost -- we\u2019re already incurring the costs and not getting the leverage on a lot of those areas. So we think there is a very, very big opportunity there. It\u2019s coming across all of our platforms, employee, independent and our RIA channel, which we've kind of reinvigorated. It\u2019s picking up in its backlog of recruits too. So it\u2019s really across the board. And we see that if you measure it by home office visits, which are -- people are serious enough to come kick the tires here in St. Pete and us also interview them, that's us. So it continues to increase. So we think the backlog is very-very good.","In terms of productivity at higher, and maybe 20% higher on average and we\u2019ve also seen for us million dollar team should be big. In last quarter I think we had three teams over $5 million join us just within six weeks alone. So we tend to get bigger teams. It doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t get smaller producers that are high quality and on their way up. We\u2019re just as interested in them. But the average is certainly up. So it helps move up our productivity numbers.","Neil Stratton","Okay, thank you. And then my second question is just the outlook for the top to net revenue ratio. I think in your prepared remarks you mentioned the 68% ratio. Is that still the -- so the target for fiscal \u201915 and how would that sort of move sort of quarter-to-quarter, if you could provide any color there? Thanks.","Steve Raney","I think that\u2019s probably still a good run rate to use for this year, for the entire year. What will happen to improve that over time and it may improve slightly over that this year is as revenue growth continues eventually you get some economies of scale in the infrastructure you have here as opposed. So it\u2019s not all variable comp. There are some fixed comp elements to that. So it really is going to come with scale over time as revenues grow. And like I said, it may happen this year if revenues continue to increase from the prior year.","Paul Reilly","But our most challenged quarter is usually next quarter, when FICA across the Board, and that usually burns off in the third quarter, part way through the third quarter. So, typically the pressure on that ratio, getting steady business across is in the next quarter. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura.","Q \u2013 Steven Chubak","So I just had a follow-up question on the fixed business. Just given how [ph] is shape of the yield curve and the rate pressure that had persisted on the long end, whether we should be thinking about $10 million as the run rate for net trading profit, at least in the near to intermediate term, assuming a static curve, which I know is a big if. ","Paul Reilly","The front end, really for couple of years, that run rate is probably reasonable. I can\u2019t tell you it's been -- it hasn\u2019t been an increasing net profit. I think trading profit. This quarter was challenged and we had an unusual situation for the Canada that impacted trading profit. In Canada everything in equity capital markets is a brought deal, and you got five days of exposure versus an overnight exposure. And we got in on a deal which was an energy credit where we was on all place. We weren\u2019t the lead left but we were the lead right and oil prices went down or caught in the position. So that\u2019s kind of a one off thing. That happens every few years, will end up in a position on a deal. They do great job there but with oil coming in we got caught on that one. That\u2019s an unusual item. The rest of it I think is kind of steady. ","Jeff Julien","If we had to pick a range I would say that -- that will be the low end of the range. So if you want to be real conservative I guess you could use that number. ","Q \u2013 Steven Chubak","And then just, I guess the follow-up to a question earlier on the communications expense. I just want to make sure that we are modeling it appropriately. Should we be thinking about low to mid-60s as the annualized $250 million or so, given that it came in about 10 million less than we had anticipated, should we assume that an incremental 3 million gets tacked on say normalized rate or should we just assume somewhere in the low-60s going forward, at least over the next three fiscal quarters?","Paul Reilly","For all the reasons I enumerated earlier, it's a little bit tough for us to tell. I think low-60s for going forward is probably a reasonable estimate at this point.","Q \u2013 Steven Chubak","And then just one final one for me, maybe for Steve at the bank, thinking about the provision trajectory, it did increase consistent with the guidance you guys have given in last quarter. Should we assume that this is a reasonable run rate expectation given some of the guidance you have given on loan growth for at least a reminder of the year?","Paul Reilly","Well, we're forecasting loan growth to be slower for the balance of this year relative to the December quarter, and we would expect provisioning to be aligned with that loan growth.","Q \u2013 Steven Chubak","Does the 130 basis points to 140 basis point provision expectation still hold, or is there any remixing issues that we need to consider?","Paul Reilly","No, that\u2019s right. The blend of the business is it does impact that. Our residential provisioning is lower than our corporate lending provisioning, as is our security type lending is lower as well. So I would say that\u2019s kind of a good 125 basis points - 140 basis point provisioning on loan growth. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Hugh Miller with Macquarie.","Q \u2013 Hugh Miller","So I guess starting with the couple of questions for Steve. I appreciate the color you gave on the NIM and kind of the widening of credit spreads and how that\u2019s been helpful to offset some of the pressure on the yield curve. I wanted to get your take on kind of deposit pricing competition, when we start to get into an eventual rising rate environment. It seems to be I guess [indiscernible] that we have been hearing where some people are expecting that banks will kind of use that increase as a means to kind of lift their NIMs and not really compete as much on deposit pricing, where others are expecting some of the larger banks to have to compete actively because of their liquidity coverage ratios. I was wondering how you anticipate things might shake out when we do see rates rising and how competitive deposit pricing competition is likely to be.","Paul Reilly","There is a lot of unknowns given that this is totally uncharted waters for all institutions given the regulatory framework that you just referenced. And the rate setting that takes place that impacts us is really kind of a firm-wide discussion. We will certainly be looking at what the competitors are doing. I think that there is some sentiment that as rates rise, when we get back to maybe more normalized rate environment that not all of that will go the depositors, but that\u2019s yet to be determined in terms of what the competition is doing. We want to do what\u2019s fair for our clients first and foremost. But we do take rising rates on the short end. They probably would help our net interest margins around the firm, not only at the bank but the fees -- the spread on the other cash that Jeff referenced. But we only have about $10.5 billion of the $32 plus billion of client cash balances same deployed in the bank currently.","Q \u2013 Hugh Miller","Great.","Steve Raney","Even if it gets more competitive, I think the assumption that we\u2019re operating under, we've already sort of taken that into account because I\u2019ve not heard anybody be as conservative as we are in terms of client sharing of a rise in rates at this point.","Q \u2013 Hugh Miller","Jeff, I appreciate the additional color you guys have given, it\u2019s very helpful. And then some questions on the capital market side. I noticed the hiring that you guys made with the director up in Canada for M&A. And I was wondering if you could talk about the opportunities you\u2019re seeing up there? And historically, how much business you guys have produced for capital markets in the Canadian region?","Paul Reilly","Certainly, the mix was Canada did better than us in \u201908 and \u201909. \u201911 was a very strong year for them and it\u2019s been slower since because its commodity based. So, the one thing we do know is in Canada too much has been on financings and we haven\u2019t really had an active M&A business. So our M&A work, where it's half our revenue here less roughly in the U.S., it\u2019s been episodic in Canada, and there is no reason for that. There is plenty of business. So we\u2019ve been looking either for a firm or a leader now for a couple of years and finally I was able to recruit someone after a couple of years' effort. And we think we have the right person to build out an M&A business.","So we think that will certainly help smooth out the Canadian capital markets business. And I don\u2019t know if we were projecting. He's just on board Monday. So we\u2019re not predicting any short term impact on that. But he's a quite strong person and then a good player and we\u2019ll build the steam around it. And I think that will help us and smooth out the Canadian business, which very simply it\u2019s just a financing business right now.","Q \u2013 Hugh Miller","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the risks and opportunities with energy related capital markets in both underwriting and M&A. I guess we\u2019ve been seeing a little bit a pickup in some secondary issuings in energy. People are showing off their balance sheets, and there is just some discussion about a potential near term lull in amounts and activity as people are kind of hoarding capital levels at this point. But longer term expectations are pretty strong. I was wondering what your view is and what you are hearing with discussions with [indiscernible] and how concerned they are relative to their expectation to be opportunistic?","Paul Reilly","I think that our view is kind of reflective of that, that first we\u2019re very well positioned in the downstream energy business in particular. And debt financing maybe off a little bit here. But M&A activity will pick up and when that is, I don\u2019t know. Now a big deal was announced yesterday, right. So who knows? But we\u2019re in the mix and certainly clients with cash are looking at these prices and looking for opportunities. And producers that are more leveraged are worried about it. So there is certainly interest on both sides. When you get a deal or how long companies feel like they can hold out, or when people think the bottom is who knows. But I do think that if oil prices stay in the 50ish level for some period of time, then M&A activity will pick up significantly. So and we\u2019re lowering that now but we think M&A is a good opportunity and that potentially financings will come back too. But I can\u2019t predict when that will happen.","Q \u2013 Hugh Miller","Okay, I appreciate that insight. And then last question from me is could you just give us a little a bit more color or insight onto kind of the economics per transaction that were a little less than what we\u2019ve seen before? And is it just kind of a function of where things shook out in certain sectors where maybe you don\u2019t have that dominant position in or was there anything in particular you guys noticed that would cause that to be the case this quarter?","Paul Reilly","It\u2019s just in the positioning and where it shakes out. And you have used an extreme example. Last quarter Alibaba went out everyone you would get a teeny piece, but at a pretty free. So if you are in the syndicate at any level, and something that size, people do well and the smaller sizes are if you're not lead with multiple lead book runners and smaller co-manager positions. If you were in that co-manager position on smaller deals, you're getting a lot less fee per deal. And in the September quarter we were on -- we get more lead deals and a lot bigger transactions and in this quarter got the same number of transactions. I think we\u2019re at three or four less lead positions. But the deals were smaller. So I don\u2019t think its endemic of anything. It\u2019s just when the transactions hit and the sectors they hit in.","Q \u2013 Hugh Miller","Okay. And I guess just one quick follow up. As we think about the backlog from a non-energy related standpoint, are there certain sectors that you guys are seeing more interest in activity and relative to others?","Paul Reilly","I think the interest is still there. So I don\u2019t know where people across the board in our businesses -- real estate is our biggest practice, but I think if you look at transactions across the board [indiscernible]. So the other thing that some people kind of ignore, which is a descent sized business versus tax credit deal. And it\u2019s doing really well. And we had a bad quarter in terms of closing. We recognized our fees on partnership closing and they are lumpy. We had a very good September quarter and this quarter was off just because partnerships didn\u2019t close, but the backlog is very, very good. So that also -- that in Canada exacerbated what was a weaker quarter. Those two made it look a lot weaker than I think it really was. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joel Jeffrey with KBW.","Q \u2013 Joel Jeffrey ","Certainly appreciate some of the color you gave on the bank's exposure to the energy sector. Just wondering if I could dig into the little bit deeper. This may be a bit too specific for you guys, if you're willing to answer. But when you think about sort of the provision levels that you got on these loans, would it be essentially relatively higher than what you're seeing on the average of the portfolio or could you give us any more specifics on kind of how you think about provisioning for these?","Jeff Julien","Joel we have 38 borrowers in the energy space. So it comprises the exposure of we have -- there is $403 million of outstanding loan balances and there is 38 borrowers at the end of December. Two of the 38 are in criticized categories. So we have substantially higher reserves on those two names. It goes without saying we've been very diligent here in the last several months reviewing name-by-name, credit-by-credit and also certainly gathering intelligence from our investment banking colleagues and the equity research colleagues that have a lot of expertise in this business. So we did downgrade even in the past category a few names. So I would say on average that portfolio has higher provision -- have higher reserves associated with it than our other sectors as a result of the recent commodity price pressure. So that\u2019s kind of the process and we're watching these names very closely for sure.","Paul Reilly","But not again and again. We're not -- sure you're concerned given prices, but we're not -- we think the names are well -- have good balance sheets and well financed and certainly prolonged downturn put pressure on everybody. ","Jeff Julien","Yes, 75% of the exposure, as Paul mentioned to midstream names that typically don\u2019t have as much commodity risk associated with them but continue watch those as well. ","Q \u2013 Joel Jeffrey ","And then just Jeff, if you could give a little bit more color, I want to make sure I understand the commission adjustment. Did you say you guys -- you could have taken pieces of these charge over the past year or so and kind of why is now the appropriate time to do it?","A \u2013 Jeff Julien","We didn\u2019t know -- we weren\u2019t aware of the issue until we heard about it at other firms, that it relates to five years' worth of activity. This adjustment relates to any potential issues going back five years. And again it was a systematically produced number for all potential transactions that might fall in this particular category. So it is five years' worth of activity. We weren\u2019t aware of the issue until just recently and that\u2019s why it\u2019s kind of a -- it looks like a bigger number than it should be and related to one quarter it'd be almost nothing. ","Paul Reilly","Its small number going over time compared to our total commissions. It's just when we found it we took -- we recognized it and we just found it and estimated it and so it hits this quarter but we will amortize that over five years, particularly small number and very small part of our commission. ","A \u2013 Jeff Julien","Just -- what we are trying to give color to those of you trying to do run rates and things like that, that $10 million figure certainly should be a one-time hit to that line item. ","Q \u2013 Joel Jeffrey ","And what exactly was the specific issue, that addressing?","A \u2013 Jeff Julien","I don\u2019t want to go into a lot of the specifics because, it\u2019s still very early in the process, but it has to do with which share class of mutual funds were used for certain accounts. ","Q \u2013 Joel Jeffrey ","And then just lastly for me, in terms of the performance fees in the asset management business, I apologize if I missed this before, what generated that?","A \u2013 Jeff Julien","We have two accounts that we're still getting performance fees on, and I guess both outperformed their benchmarks for the year. It\u2019s not based on the calendar year performance which is why it hits in the December quarter each year, but less -- less than last year. It was over $10 million last year, roughly 10 million last year. It was about $5.5 million this year, related to two accounts that have a performance fee associated with them, and one that has non-controlling interest associated with it. But then I'll follow the bottom-line for us. Most of it does. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Harris, Wells Fargo Securities. ","Q \u2013 Chris Harris","Hey another question on the NIM. The guidance you guys are giving here, flat for the year, it's clearly I think a very good outcome given how much the yield curve has flattened. And guess we're saying some of that is being supported by higher loan spreads. So I'm wondering, in an environment where loan spreads come back in, do all a sudden you have kind of a risk to that NIM guidance and really trying to figure out whether that 270s NIM number we had talked about a couple of quarters ago would come into the play under that scenario?","Paul Reilly","Chris, our adjusting book is floating. So the impact really isn\u2019t there. The question is what happens on new loans and new production and what spread we're willing to invest money in the bank in. So certainly if we continue to invest and decided to make -- we thought the return versus risk was worth it and you continued in a decreasing spread environment, it would impact NIM negatively. If it stayed flat [indiscernible] we are, if rates went up it should -- spreads widen and go the other way. But it wouldn\u2019t immediate impact the business. That would depend on the new production and what you brought in. And how much you participate","A \u2013 Jeff Julien","We pass on deals all the time because it will take the return is adequate for the risk we\u2019re taking. So\u2026","Steve Raney","And just because the 10 years yield is down, it doesn\u2019t it\u2019s going to compress. And in fact usually the 10 year yield comes down when its economic problems and people are fleeing to safety. So that actually can widen corporate spread, which is kind of what we\u2019ve seen here recently. So, I wouldn\u2019t tie corporate spreads to 10 year and expect maybe inversely.","Q \u2013 Chris Harris","Right, but I was just wondering if loan spreads came back down, whether we'd get into that 270 zone.","A \u2013 Jeff Julien","It would if we participated and over time we'd have to run off what\u2019s in the portfolio and replace it with the lower spread.","Q \u2013 Chris Harris","Right, so will be some time for having a bigger impact. Follow up question on the recruiting. Great quarter for you guys. It sounds like the pipeline is really good. I'm just wondering was there anything that happened this quarter to create such a large number, the 70 plus advisors that you added. Or might this be kind of a descent run rate for you going forward, given how good the pipeline looks?","Paul Reilly","No, if you look at it, it\u2019s been lumpy. Last quarter wasn\u2019t as big and two quarters was big. So it\u2019s just when they show up. And we\u2019re only partially in control of that. They have to slightly come over. And so that is certainly -- if you'd tell me we could repeat this quarter three more times, I'd take it. I'd sign for it right now. So it was an exceptional quarter. But I\u2019ll tell you the pipeline is very good and we think that we\u2019re going to -- our target ought to do more than we did last year and last year was our second best year and so far we're on our targets. But it could stop tomorrow, it could go up and a lot of that not just dependent on us. It\u2019s dependent on the markets and frankly a lot of it is dependent on what competitors the larger banks do, because that has more impact on investors -- on advisors leaving than what we do. ","Q \u2013 Chris Harris","When these advisors come on, do you guys get all the assets right away and so in other words all that assets come over, is there a lag effect that happens so on advisor?","Paul Reilly","There is a lag. And for the larger advisors we say we get 70%ish in the first year and then the rest comes on after that and they typically are growing their business because they\u2019re good advisors. So it doesn\u2019t all come over day one.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alex Blostein","I wanted to pick your brains in the capital management strategy. I know it comes up every once in a while. But plenty of capital you guys deployed at the bank prudently, but the share count continues to creep up slightly. So any updated thoughts on I guess A, at what point would you consider deploying some capital into the buyback as the multiple, at least in the earnings basis is not egregious? And I guess secondarily maybe an update on as you bring all these new FAs in, does that partially impact the creeping share account? And maybe just kind of what is the annual creep in the share count from RSUs and things like that?","Paul Reilly","Our increase in share count is pretty steady. I'll let Jeff address that. It really has more to do with year-end comps than Fas per se, but if you look at capital we are deploying a good chunk lately in bank growth and Fas, bringing up days on. So if you look at free cash, it\u2019s between bonuses and bringing people on, it's down a bit. We still have capital to employ. We\u2019re still looking at acquisitions. We\u2019re very disciplined. As I said before, we looked at a lot of them and if we can\u2019t -- they're not a complete set. And certainly first culture, secondly strategic and third is price and we\u2019ve had a number of conversations where price doesn\u2019t work. So we still think we can deploy capital, but we\u2019re very, very disciplined which people should feel happy with. And if we think we truly effect such capital we can\u2019t use, we\u2019ll look at alternatives of deploying it. At this state, we think we can use our capital wisely.","A \u2013 Jeff Julien","And in terms of share count, we typically have been -- we had been and between 1% to 1.5% a year type dilution really almost exclusively all the equity we issue has been retention oriented. We use both incentive and non-qualified options as well as restricted stock units and we use them for producers. We use them for our management people. We use them for highly compensated people, whatever category they fall in as a portion of their comp E [ph] shares and shares. So it\u2019s really meant to keep people in their seats long term, which has been a successful program for us because you know certainly in the FA world, you know our turnover statistics are lower by far than the industry averages.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.","Jim Mitchell","Just maybe just a question on flows and what you\u2019re seeing in your retail customer base. It seems if we kind of try to back into what the net flows were, it seems like over the last two quarters they\u2019ve slowed from the first half. And just trying to -- is that just simply a function of market volatility or anything else? Just any insight you have on sort of what your customer flow dynamic is right now and how you see that developing ahead or accelerate the recruitment effort? Thanks.","Paul Reilly","I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve seen any slowing. A lot of our net flows are dependent on our recruiting which is going well. And so when you get good quarters with lots of people, as they bring on our assets it will pick back up some. So I can\u2019t see anything overall that says our expected net flows should change.","A \u2013 Jeff Julien","Jim one thing you sort of have to be careful with when you project flows using maybe one index -- one stock market index and our clients have a diversified portfolio of fixed income cash and equities and even within equity, that's not all represented by the S&P 500, there is international, there is small cap et cetera. So sometimes our analysis could be skewed if you\u2019re using just S&P 500 to track flow -- to estimate flows in PCGs is what I would tell you.","Jim Mitchell","That\u2019s fair. So you could resolve that by just giving us the numbers.","Paul Reilly","If we knew them we would tell you.","A \u2013 Jeff Julien","We track those very closely in asset management for assets under management. We track outflows but we don\u2019t we haven\u2019t tracked it as closely on the overall. If a lot of the FAs affiliate with us in this last quarter their assets may come over largely in this next quarter. So there is a lag effect to that as well.","Paul Reilly","I put that in -- we know the best -- we think the trends are there but when people say what\u2019s the spend you\u2019re going to do and I always say if I knew that I wouldn\u2019t be working. So, who knows?","Jim Mitchell","Right, and I guess any major shift in how your clients allocating over the last quarter or two? Is it more equities, less equities, just curious?","Paul Reilly","Equity inflows have been okay, some [ph] actually. So it\u2019s not huge but it\u2019s not\u2026","A \u2013 Jeff Julien","Overall mix hasn\u2019t changed much in the last two quarters. And really in the last year. Most of the mix change has been more for market appreciation. We have a financial planning orientation here. So our base doesn\u2019t tend to follow equities or fixed income to the extent that some other trading firms do with more stable asset mix. ","Operator","Your next question is a follow-up from the line of Bill Katz with Citigroup. ","Q \u2013 Neil Stratton","This is Neil again from Citi. Just had a quick question. Given the NIM guidance you have given for the bank, do you have an outlook for the NIM for RJF when you include all the interest saving assets to the firm? ","Paul Reilly","We don\u2019t think of it NIM terms.","A \u2013 Jeff Julien","Yes, we really don\u2019t. Again, that\u2019s a difficult calculation Neil, because a lot of the cash balances shift from on balance sheet to off balance sheet and once they shift off balance sheet to other banks and that doesn\u2019t show up in interest income that shows up as fee income. So it\u2019s a little bit of a difficult calculation just based on the mix of whether that cash is being deployed on balance sheet or off balance sheet. ","Paul Reilly","We focus a lot on total net interest earnings at the holding company level. We don\u2019t really focus much as much. That\u2019s impacted by inventory level. How much of inventory we finance. A lot of other factors that I think would render a NIM at the holding company a little less meaningful than it does at the bank. ","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time. ","Paul Reilly","I think we ran up in a very good start for the year. And I know the frustration is predicting a lot of this is around capital markets and both globally and domestically that\u2019s just difficult to predict what the economy is going to do. But again I start by saying that shorter-term it's always hard to look at numbers and this next quarter tends to have some elevated expense just by the nature of our business. So longer-term if you look at the growth in assets, the growth in loans, the growth in advisors, those are the things that drive a vast majority of our business and there are all very positive. So I feel good about our positioning for the long-term, certainly for the year. Next quarter it's just -- the rest of the business is variable and transaction oriented and hard to predict. I wish we could give you better guidance. If we had a strong feel, we'd know but it\u2019s just hard to predict in this economy. So with that we appreciate your time. We look forward to the next quarter and we're going to go back to work. Thank you, Felicia.","Operator","Thank you. And this concludes today\u2019s conference call.

My name is Darla, and will be your conference facilitator today. This call is being recorded and will be available on the company's website. ","Now I'll turn it over to Paul Shoukry, Head of Investor Relations at Raymond James Financial. ","Paul Shoukry","Thank you, Darla. Good morning and thank you all for joining us on this call. We appreciate your time and interest in Raymond James Financial. After I read the following disclosure, I will turn the call over to Paul Reilly, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jeff Julien, our Chief Financial Officer. Following the prepared remarks, they will ask the operator to open the line for questions.","Certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements.

A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures may be found in the schedule accompanying our press release.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Paul Reilly, Chairman and CEO of Raymond James Financial. Paul?","Paul Reilly","Thanks, Paul, and thanks for that inspiring opening, and we appreciate you all joining the call. We know there are a lot of releases out today both in our industry and certainly the biggest company. So I wanted to spend a second reflecting. If you had told me a year ago this September that Trump would be President, the market is up 25%; deposit betas would be at an all-time low; of course, I\u2019m not sure to known what deposit beta was a year ago; then we would have these financial results and the Cubs would win the world series. I don\u2019t know what I would to believe more. If you really look back, it\u2019s been really an outstanding year certainly due to the work of our advisers and our associates with our clients and honestly the help from the markets and the interest rate environment. We had record net revenue at $6.3 billion, up 18% over the previous year; record net income of $636 million, up 20% over the previous year; and an adjusted record net income of $768 million, up 35% over the previous year. Even in more impressively images all four of our core operating segments record net revenues and record pretax income for the year. We finished the year with a 12.2% ROE and an adjusted ROE of 14.5%, which is really pretty amazing giving our conservative leverage and capital ratios.","More importantly, we made huge investments due to the, I guess, a new word that everyone is using in our advisor technology. We had robust recruiting and still great momentum. We integrated Alex. Brown, 3Macs and Mummert, which is ongoing, and with the DOL and other regulatory initiatives, we still got all these things done. So I really want to thank our associates really for all they did this year.","I may divert a little because I think one of the most important things that\u2019s enabled our recruiting and retention has been our culture and we talked about it a lot. But this year we reinforced \u2013 continue to reinforce our core values and it really showed up during the hurricanes this year. And I want to use an example in the Hurricane Irma, where we flew 175 associates, their families and their pets to Memphis, where we actually operated for a number of days as our headquarters as part of our BCP plan, not only a way to keep the \u2013 we kept service levels up and we\u2019re able to operate seamlessly. To thank our employees, we gave our employees a $300 pretax kind of adjust bonus or that help them with their shelter and their evacuation plans. The firm committed to donations over $1 million. Our associates contributed over $0.5 million for the friends of Raymond James to help associates who are impacted. Ands in Canada, they contributed $100,000 for the floods that really happened in BC and Quebec. So it really speak volumes about the firm, why we are able to keep the retention and our focus on associates and never focused on the firm.","Let me talk about fourth quarter results. We had record quarterly net revenues of $1.69 billion, up 16% from the previous year\u2019s fourth quarter and 4% from the preceding quarter; record quarterly net income $193.5 million, which resulted in a $1.31 fully diluted share, up 13% from the last year\u2019s fourth quarter and 5% over the preceding quarter. Our adjusted quarterly net income was $217.3 million or $1.47 fully diluted share adjusted, which is up 12% from the last year\u2019s fourth quarter and 17% from the preceding quarter. We had record quarterly net revenue and pretax income in Private Client Group, Asset Management and RJ Bank, also the quarter record success for capital markets which compared to a record year ago.","We had a quarterly ROE of 14.1% and a non-GAAP adjusted of 15.8%. So it really was a spectacular quarter. Maybe more importantly looking forward is where we ended the quarter with record client assets under administration of $692.9 billion, financial assets under management of $96.4 billion, record loans at RJ Bank at $17 billion and a record number advisors of 7,346, so really great results. I just touched on the segments. Private Client Group, as I said has record net revenue and free cash to the quarter. We also had great recruiting and retention. We\u2019re keeping the levels up with a substantial backlog, with substantial growth in fee-based accounts, certainly helped by the market growth and the interest rate environment, entering that time we had the integration of Alex. Brown and 3Macs.","We continued in Private Client Group and across the firm make a substantial investment in our technology, including our advisor\u2019s desktops, the work we had to do for DOL or out our just beta test of connected advisor, which is our answer to robo \u2013 not robo but digitally connecting our advisors with their clients and rolling out efficiency initiatives like client on-boarding.","In the Capital Markets segment, net revenue was up 3% sequentially but down 7% from last year\u2019s fourth quarter, which is a previous record, and the quarterly pretax was up 27% sequentially but down 17% from a record quarter, last year\u2019s fourth quarter. These results were mainly M&A-driven and really a product of the investments we have made over the last three years in our M&A business. And if you remember, we did the acquisition of Mummert & Company and we\u2019ve already seen the fruits of those cross order successes from Mel Mummert and his team in the very early days. Equity underwriting was down for the quarter but up 34% this year over last year. This business does have headwinds as institutional equity commission continues under structural pressures that has for years and compounded with a low volatility environment. Fixed income both in commissions and trading profits again was impacted for the same low volatility market in a flattening yield curve and tax credit funds was negatively impacted really due by the uncertain tax laws as developers and banks try to figure out what the real after-tax yield is going to be as all those tax rates discussion goes on. ","Asset management had a record about everything. Financial assets under management was $96.4 billion certainly due to net advisor growth and market appreciation and increased use of fee-based accounts. All the factors help the flow into this segment. And we even had a small positive net inflow into our Eagle Carillon Towers Group. We're still on track to close in the Scout and Reams acquisition this quarter. We expect that to add about $28 billion of assets under management, and we need -- that's going to significant broaden our fixed income platform but also the fees in that type of business or lower than the equity business as we look forward. RJ Bank, record net revenue and pretax for the quarter and for the year; net loans of $17 billion, up 12% year-over-year. Interesting is that C&I portfolio was actually down 1% as we have been concerned a little bit about pricing and risk of the new deals. The growth was really driven by private client group SPLs and mortgages and as well as our taxes debt loans from our public finance business. ","Net interest margins came in at from 314 bps to 311 and I think there is some really some misunderstanding on that. They would actually be up if it wasn't for the excess cash and securities that we have been investing. Our cash increase in balances impacted that 4 bps, alone took is down, as well as our securities portfolio. So if you really were to look at the bottom line there, our net interest is up $11 million quarter-over-quarter 8% or 23% year-over-year. So a lot of people keep focusing on that NIM, but that includes the cash and securities we keep investing in. Actually the loan NIM would have been up not down on an apples-on-apples basis. So we continue to invest with using little capital to increase our net interest earnings in the firms. ","And more importantly, total non-performing loans of $44 million are down 49% year-over-year and 8% sequentially, and total credit-sized loans of $265 million down 12% year-over-year or 2% sequentially. So all-in-all good shape. So I'm going to turn it over to Jeff who can give you some line items and some more details and talk a little bit about the outlook of these segments. Jeff?","Jeff Julien ","Thanks, Paul. As usual, I try to compare our actual to the consensus model just to see where we didn't achieve the results expected by the Street. In this case, most of our line items were fairly close. So I only have a few to talk about today. Commission fee revenues on absolute dollar amount, we actually came in slightly under expectations. But it's really is attributable to the decline in the institutional commissions as you can see in the press release detailed. PCG was pretty much right and there is 1% under, so not a huge miss. ","The biggest beat would be in the investment banking line, and you can see in the press release the detail of particularly the strength of M&A fees, up 34% from the preceding quarter and up 54% year-over-year. And a lot of that happened kind of late in the quarter, so we weren't able to give you a lot of color on that throughout the quarter. Except for those two items, all the rest are within $2 million to $3 million of expectations 4 or 5 ahead of consensus. The only other thing I'll point out in the revenues side is that net interest income was actually a several million ahead of expectations and accountant service fees is the one that came in below. I think that combined basis they\u2019re very, very close and that really has to do with us moving more of their client cash balances on to our balance sheet out of the external banks as we continue to fund the bank\u2019s growth on a combined base. So it\u2019s very close.","Several items to talk about on the expense side, first I will talk about communication and information processing. It took a little bit of a jump from the preceding quarter, but for the year-to-date on average for the year it was right on top of our guidance for the year, which was in the high 70s for quarter.","Going forward though and this was a conscious decision on our part to continue and complete all the initiatives that we have got under way right now. A lot of those are in process to enhance the competitive position of the FA desktop that\u2019ll make it easier for clients to come on board with us et cetera. We also have some enhanced supervising compliance systems and the several other projects underway and we are going to make the conscious decision at least at this point to continue with all those and some of the ones that were on the drawing board. So right now I guess our guidance for next year would probably be in the high 80s per quarter as oppose to the high 70s past year. Obviously that\u2019s something we can control to some extent and if the market decides not to cooperate and we could hold that a little bit on that, but given where we are today, that is our current plan going forward.","Plant fitting equipment line also took a little jump from the preceding quarter. There were some what I\u2019d called kind of one-off items in there for the quarter, but on an ongoing basis, this is just a natural consequence of growth. As we bring on more people, we have to have a place form to sit. We have to have furniture form to sit on at PC formed up et cetera, et cetera. So not only are we increasing the branch footprint in our private client group system we actually are increasing some of the actual branches we currently own as they become all and expand. And we have also, as we talked about on our previous call, expanded our headquarters footprint by about 300,000 square feet at the end of last calendar year. And we have been doing some renovation work and are getting ready to occupy about another 100,000 square feet of that space. So a lot underway, but again that one we don\u2019t have as much control over we do needed to place for people to work. So our guidance for next year would actually be sort of about what we ran at this current quarter. It\u2019s not this quarter. You know there were some one-offs, so I think that\u2019s really more indicative of our run rate going forward.","For bank loan loss provision was I am sure a bit of a surprise that we did grow loans about $376 million in the quarter. But if you look at the nature of the growth, which is also in the press release and the bank details on Page 11, where you can see that a lot of growth came in what you would call a lower risk or lower reserve type of loan which should be mortgages and SBLs. So coupled with the fact that we sold some loans at decrease and criticized asset, I think some of those represents sale that we were able to take advantage of favorable secondary market conditions and exit some of the loans that were trending poorly, and we actually managed to get prices above where we had in reserves. So even though it\u2019s an actual loss and doesn\u2019t make me happy, it did have the anomalous effect of releasing some reserves and slightly more than the actual new provision put on for the loan growth, the latter being about $2 million only for the quarter given the mix of loans.","The other expense I just mentioned, it came in really close to consensus, but I did want to just pointed out what Paul was talking about with all these hurricane-related expenses. We did not try to \u2013 did not non-GAAP this item, but we did incur something very close to $2 million of incremental cost related to separation for the hurricane that never hit us directly here in St. Petersburg. So between the payment to employees to help with their repairs and\/or evacuation costs and our own deployment of people to alternative locations and things like that, it was a about a $2 million number.","And then lastly, on the expense side, a line item that always seems to deserve mention lately is income taxes. Once again, I wanted a little Coley dissertation on previous call that when the markets are ahead enough, we\u2019re going to get the tax benefit. We\u2019ve got over $300 million of Coley on the balance sheet. So when that is trending up, it\u2019s probably a little more than \u2013 it\u2019s about a 2\/3 equity something like that and a lot of it\u2019s elected by participants, not our choice. So if the equity markets are favorable, we\u2019re going to get a tax benefit, and when they\u2019re unfavorable, we\u2019re going to have a higher tax rate. So that continues to be a big factor that needs to be considered each quarter.","The other thing we got now on an ongoing basis, our bank has its own CRA requirements and it invests in some of the low-income housing tax credit projects that our own tax credit funds group originates -- 5 or 6 on the bank\u2019s books now. So we\u2019re starting to get a fairly good size amount of credits from that. And then there are other smaller things that happen throughout the year. The biggest item that\u2019s new, which didn\u2019t happened in the fourth quarter but it happens a little bit every quarter is what I talked about last year, which is the guidance for reflecting the appreciation of equity awards in the tax provision now. In the past, it was a straight credit to the equity section, now it\u2019s actually flowing through the tax provision. Based on where the stock price is today, that looks like, I gave guidance a year ago there will be about $11 million and $12 million a year, at where the stock price is today, it\u2019s about $16 million a year. Straight tax benefit that most of which probably 80% to 90% of which will hit in the December quarter for us because that\u2019s after the end of our fiscal year is when most of those awards are granted and they have several divesting days on the anniversary. So the December rate going forward will probably continue to be abnormally low. Even in 30-ish or sub 30-ish, it was this past December because of that factor. But on an annual basis, I guess our overall guidance, given all these factors, would sort of be in the 35% type range combined state and federal plus or minus whatever Coley does, given all the things that we've got in the magnitude that they're on our books for. So that's sort of the story on taxes.","Some other items I'd like to mention, the margins by business, where I stuck my neck out maybe more than it should have at the analyst\/investor day, Tony, what I talked we could accomplish for the second six months of the year, happy to say they were all surpassed. And I've given 12% margin guidance for PCG. They came in for this quarter at 12.2%. They came in only at 11.4% for the year because they had a rough start that\u2019s a non-GAAP number by the way, adjusted number. Capital markets came in at 16.5% for the quarter versus the 15%. That\u2019s I have mentioned at the meeting. We continue to try to be an excess of 30% in asset management, which came in at 37.1% for the quarter and 35.2% for the quarter. And Paul already talked about the factors that are supporting the asset management growth right now. So for the total firm, we're on a non-GAAP basis, we had talked about perhaps the 17% type overall firm margin. It actually came in at 18.7% for the quarter and 17.6% for the year as we had a very favorable equity market and obviously continued interest rate. ","So the compensation ratio came in at 65.3% for the quarter and it sort to have a normally low, some of that boosted by the surge and some of the M&A fees and other things. For the year-to-date it fell with 66.4% and we're actually pretty happy with that year-to-date number. We do definitely want to continue to keep it below 67, but kind of our target in the minds is sort of 66.5% or better kind of where we finish this year if things stay like they are in terms of the environment. So that's I don't think we're not calling 65.3% our new target because we achieved it here in this one quarter. ","So the return on equity, as Paul mentioned, on an adjusted basis for the year was 14.5%. We're still comfortable right now with the 14% to 15% range. While a lot of variables will go into that of course, 15.8% for the quarter is an exceptionally good quarter for the ROE. ","Capital ratios, which are on Page 10 of the press release, I won't go through them all, but just suffice it to say they all improved a little bit with the exceptional leverage ratio which was down just a little bit. They're all less because of the balance sheet growth that we had during the quarter was in the low-risk assets and so our increased capital and was more than offset the risk weighting of the assets that we're added predominantly the cash higher cash balances on our balance sheet plus some SPLs and other low-risk weighted type assets. ","Paul mentioned the NIM at the bank, I just like to repeat it here just for a second, because they've got a lot of mentioned in a lot of comments I saw last night. To me where the rubber meets the road on net interest at the bank, it really is at top Page 11, which is the net interest income that the bank generated. As Paul mentioned, we're not spending very much additional capital to expand the securities portfolio or add more cash on the balance sheet of the bank, but it\u2019s having a lot to our net interest earnings. The NIM, we gave 310 or 320 guidance that would have been right in the middle of that range that we not had cash growth during the quarter at the bank almost $0.5 billion on average, and then it\u2019s further exacerbate a little bit by the securities portfolio, but that\u2019s sort of I think to account in our guidance range. Candidly, if we cash happened to grow and loans happen to shrink because the risk reward trade off is not appropriate in our opinion and that NIM shrink in the low 3s, 3.05 or 3.06 or 3.07 or 3.08 or whatever, that would not bother us as long as we are continuing to grow the net interest earnings at the bank in a prudent fashion. So to me, the overall net interest earnings is a more important measure in the actual NIM although the NIM certainly factors into that.","We shrink because of the general discussion on deposit beta, which once again may get a lot of questions about, we are currently spread of in excess of 110 basis points, which is historically very, very high on client cash balances. We are starting to see some deposit competition. You are starting probably to see the same stories we are about people getting more aggressive to compete for deposits. So hard for me is to predict where this is going. If there is increased competition, we could see a little spread compression. If they raise rates faster than people can raise rates or the clients or faster than people want to raise rates to clients, we can actually be that widen, but it\u2019s really hard to say right now. My best guess, and again had a good track record on this, but my best guess is that there will be some compression in that spread through deposit competition over the course of the year. We have not seen it manifest itself yet, but it seems very likely that that may happen over the course of the year some time.","So all in all, I read the comments last night and I kind of was a little surprised that had almost a negative tone to it when in fact I look at the core operating results of our four primary segments and they all have good fundamentals working for them right now, and there is a lot favor at one exception would probably be at still not that good an environment for the fixed income division within capital markets. But all of our other major businesses are doing very well. So we have I would not say this quarter is going to be easily replicated but because M&A had a really, really strong quarter, but a lot of the factors are in place at least for the very short term.","And with that, I'll turn it back over to Paul to give you a little more detail on the outlook.","Paul Reilly","And I agree with Jeff. I thought it was an exceptionally good fourth quarter and I\u2019m sticking to the story because I just look at how the operations and the growth and the fundamentals that I think it was very, very good. So I know people have high expectations of us, we have high expectations also. That\u2019s okay. There are several tailwinds as we enter 2018. If look at the Private Client Group, our advisor headcount and recruiting pipeline continue to grow. I think we have about $80 million in commits already for this next year and most of those will show up and we\u2019re continuing to recruit. So in terms of the fundamentals and what\u2019s really been driving our Private Client Group business is retained our great advisors and bringing more in. Our start of fee-based accounts billings will be up 6% starting this quarter versus last quarter. So again, a positive.","We\u2019ll some decrease in advisory payout. Now we have told you before and we had cut our grids 100 basis points, but some of that was eaten up in two ways, one is a progressive grid in our employee division and the markets keep going up at each to that 100 basis points. So it\u2019s a smaller number and then the independent division some of that grid change was phased in. We had to make the product neutral grid to comply with DOL. So we make it half of that or less this year, depending if markets continue decline. So we\u2019ll get some, but we certainly won\u2019t get all the pickup. And it\u2019s not all bad news because it\u2019s a higher market.","The capital markets area is a little tougher. ECM is coming off a record kind of M&A and it have good backlog, but we\u2019re setting a high bars for 2018, continue to be optimistic and the M&A business looks good. But I can remember calls where everybody was asking what M&A was going to come back, so it is \u2013 and it does not last forever. But that part was good. On the tailwinds \u2013 on the headwinds section is certainly tax credit funds has a largest syndicator of tax credits. This tax uncertainty is just affecting the market where buyers and sellers are having a hard time pricing and there is a gap. So until and unless tax law is changed, I assume, when we have certainty that business will pick up until we had -- and if we don\u2019t get certainty, I think it\u2019s going to be sluggish. Institutional equity and fixed income is commissioned if we remain challenged. I think structurally on the equity side, we have low volatility. We\u2019re going to have some impact from this too. Ironically, here we are months away from implementation and we have very little guidance. As I\u2019ve said I don\u2019t expected to be a positive, a negative, but it is a big part of our business either. Fixed income on the commissions and trading profits have held up relatively well compared to all of our competitor spot. With the flag yield curve and low volatility, they will remain depressed. And John Carson, who oversees the whole fixed income public finance area, once told me the worst thing it can happen to the firm is that we have great fixed income years because that mean the equity markets are performing. So there is some of an offset. They\u2019ve done a good job in a tough market. That\u2019s certainly a headwind in that business.","Asset management, the AUM is starting 6% higher. So again, good start \u2013 range. So we expect to close that some time this quarter, which will certainly help, but it will be slightly accretive. But you have to remember because of the fixed income nature of that business, it does have lower margins in the rest of our business, so it will have some margin impact, but should be slightly accretive of overall, plus it will have related intangibles that will start probably at least the next quarter.","On the bank, we\u2019ve had very good growth. Recently we\u2019ve been cautious of the C&I loan growth. Just pricing and risk haven\u2019t made sense to it. But I remind people this quarter it was off, but that\u2019s the business that turned on and off. So when you shut it down and we don\u2019t like the risk price metrics and when it\u2019s good and their good credits will make loans. I think the that the Private Client Group that related loans will continue to grow. We had a good quarter and they're look in good shape. We continue to plan to expand as we've announced in the past our agency-backed securities because it's an attractive risk adjusted rate of return that increases liquidity and stable funding ratio which is important to our rating agencies. It will generate more net income, but it will compress NIM because there are lower rate securities. But they're additive interest rates, they are subtracting. So I know there is some confusion over that. I think all of you are pushing us to add the securities portfolio leverage the bank a little bit now that we do. I think we got to separate the loan NIM from the NIM that would be additional interest we generate by putting cash in securities in the bank.","So the first quarter is showing tailwinds, and as Jeff says, we will also have a tax benefit for the equities. So the first quarter of 2018, if things hold up, should look pretty good, but the real question is the rest of 2018 and the big question Mark is the stock market: what it going to do? Some people says overvalued and it\u2019s going to come in other people say it\u2019s go a ways to run. We can't make that call from here. Jeff talked about deposit beta that came in 20 bps, I'd say you may improve tax. If we got another rate expansion and the pressure is so far on rates it\u2019s been on the high end and not on the low end, maybe it will hold up for a while, But eventually I do think that has to come in. So as we get into the next calendar year, it's little harder just because of the markets to really give you a lot of insight. We have increased spend in technology and really it's just essential to our business that not only will that create efficiencies over time but the cornerstone of our business has really been helping advisors serve their clients. And these technology tools connected advisor, which is now embedded testing that electronically help with next generation advisors and smaller accounts to more efficiently connect them and give them better connection are all extremely important to attract and retain our advisors, and I believe that those types of technologies are table state. So although we are a bet, I think it's a good debt. And the investment we made over the last few years has certainly significantly helped our recruiting and retention and we're making the bet that we need to be a leader in those areas where we choose to compete to continue the momentum that we have. I believe we're extremely well positioned. It shows up in our recruiting pipeline. We have good momentum. We have great people. And we're in an industry that may be always has uncertain markets. But certainly with the equity hives that we're and the deposit beta, that's really the question mark. But our focus right now is long term to continue to invest so that our firm is better in the future. ","So with that I'm going to turn it back to Darla for questions. Darla?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We have a question from Steven Chubak with Numora. ","Steven Chubak","Hi, good morning. So I wanted to start up with a question on the AFS book and may you guys have spend some time highlighting the opportunity there and the fact that it is accretive to NII regardless of the adapting NIM effect, so certainly appreciate that dynamic. But we did see the patient growth slow a little bit this quarter. And I'm sorry if I missed this. I jumped on a little late in the prepared remarks. So I'm just wondering if there is any change in terms of your strategy and long term growth targets for the securities book. I think you have talked about $6 billion in the past, and I am wondering giving the case of capital build that we\u2019ve seen whether you would be inclined to actually growth beyond that target?","Paul Reill","Steve, I think that\u2019s still our target and may think that\u2019s a little longer to get there than we had originally forecast. The reason is that pace of growth slowed down, if you remember, we had a pretty good size decline in cash balances from the end of March to the end of June. We talked about that last quarter, about $2.5 billion decline in cash balances, client cash balances, and we\u2019ve got -- so we had a hard time or it would have been a little awkward with some of our bank relationships to ship that much dollars out of some of the other banks over to our own bank quickly. So we chose to do it on a more possible basis and we slowed the growth for securities portfolio intentionally in the quarter coupled with the fact that it became a higher and higher probability of yet another rate hike, which by given other short term and buying some of these fixed rate securities in the phase of rate hikes is something that you can be cautious about and base with the next rate hike is now all priced in. So we sort of resumed and also as you can see on the cash balances by the end of the quarter we have sort of fixed that. So the second half of the quarter we had a significant amount of cash balances on the bank\u2019s balance sheet, but it started out the quarter very slow. But we are also being \u2013 we have very pretty tight parameters on what we\u2019ll buy. Now at our core meeting yesterday, there is a fairly narrow band of the securities that really fill of our parameters in terms of extension risk and yield and being in the agency back where also you are taking any credit risk and the back to duration and things like that. So it\u2019s kind of business starts a little bit on that. It\u2019s not to going to I think to invest a fixed dollar amount every week or something like that. But the reason that it was slow was really because of at the beginning of the quarter the cash balances were \u2013 have not recovered until later in the quarter.","Jeff Julien","So there has been no change in the strategy, it\u2019s just look to kind of little delay this quarter were still on course.","Steven Chubak","Got it. And as you think about the risk reward potential from steepening more into the bank, there has been some speculation that where the said balance sheet online, you could in fact see term premier arise. If you do in fact see some steepening as a curve, and that will penetrate your fixed trading businesses certainly, but as we start to think about tire and deploy some of that excess cash, could we see you guys exceed that $6 billion target in an effort to drive some higher returns.","Paul Reill","I think for now right now that\u2019s our goal where we get closer, but no, these securities turn over too. So as rates rise, they will turn. We have made $400 million a year in run off right now.","Jeff Julien","Yeah, they\u2019ve amortized about 25% a year, so it\u2019s pretty quick turnover. I actually think that steepening yield curve may actually help banks loan spreads throughout it, but that remains to be seen.","Steven Chubak","Right. And just one last question from me on how we should be thinking about the pretax margin outlook for our 2018? You guys certainly gave some very helpful color thinking about the comp dynamics, some incremental non-comps as relates for communication expense. But just giving some of the tailwinds exiting the year both in terms of asset growth that we seen as well as growth of the bank, what's the reason why expectation for margin expansion if we continue to have relatively healthy market and maybe even some helps and that\u2019s having in the form of the rate hikes?","Jeff Julien","Hey guys, it\u2019s not just the rate hikes through the spreads that make a difference to us. I mean, if we could repeat a 17%-plus margin for next year, I think on an expanded revenue base, we would be pretty contemned with that in light of the expense growth that we have talked about that we have planned.","Steven Chubak","Understood. That\u2019s it from me, and congrats on a strong quarter.","Jeff Julien","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo.","Christopher Harris","Thanks, guys. I wanted to ask you about the outlook for the comp ratio. If we think about 2018, you got a couple things growing on. You\u2019ve got a full year benefit of the rate hikes that have happened. There is a PCG payout grid change that you talked about. You\u2019ve got Scott coming on. And so all those things, I think, are tailwinds to the comp ratio. So I guess where am I missing as to why it shouldn\u2019t be much better than the 66.5% that we\u2019re talking about this morning.","Paul Reill","So there is an awful lot of that\u2019s mixed. So right now if you looked at our balance is growing of the PCG segments, it\u2019s been the independent segment which has a much higher payout. So if that continues, I mean, they both are doing well and they come and go, but that\u2019s going to skew payouts up. If this quarter we\u2019re held by really big M&A volume, which is lower than our average payout, so that brought them down. There is so much delta in the mix that it\u2019s really hard to come out with any other number. And we do have increasing comps with compliance and other things we continue to grow overhead\u2026","Jeff Julien","And we also had a full of all the compliance AML, risk management people that we have brought up for this year and we\u2019re going to continue into that in terms of compliance of supervision staff.","Paul Reill","So in a really constructive market we do better absolutely, but we\u2019re not planning on -- I didn\u2019t plan on a 25% increase market this year. We\u2019re not planning on it next year. But if it happens, we\u2019ll certainly get the benefit of it.","Christopher Harris","Okay, guys. Thanks for clearing.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The next question is from Devin Ryan, JMP Securities.","Devin Ryan","Good morning, guys. How are you?","Paul Reill","Hi, Devin","Devin Ryan","Maybe just one on the outlook for some of the fixed income businesses and a lot of moving parts in there between what\u2019s going on with municipalities and taxes relative to yield curve. And we saw marginal uptick in kind of the yield curve kind of towards the end of the quarter. So I\u2019m just curious kind of that you\u2019ve kind of put it all together, if it feels like we kind of how had low bar year for the fixed income trading, underwriting tax credits kind of all in aggregate heading into fiscal \u201918?","Paul Reill","That\u2019s correct. I think the question is certainly, yes, it is raised, caused some trading increases. But how long did they lap. I think the curve is still flat if they raise short-term rates while the tenure follow, I mean there is just a lot of questions. I think that business has done really well with double digit margins in a really tough environment. It\u2019s down less than its competitors. It\u2019s a great agency business, a big segment of the fixed income business as well as other financial institutions. And so, certainly that has its own dynamics of their own securities buying. So I don\u2019t see an enough moment in the market to say that\u2019s going to really bounce back, on the other hand when their down equities usually stay constructive. So if you had a really volatile fixed income market, I'm not sure the equity markets wouldn't be any give it back so for us. So that's the challenge, Devin.","Devin Ryan","Got it, okay. That's helpful. And then just a follow up here around the outlook for some of the fees from product manufacturers and sponsorship revenues, et cetera. Some firms are removing manufacturers that are not willing pay for distribution. And then I'm just curious if there is obviously a lot of moving parts in here with the DOL and I think renegotiations there but also I think -- on wind up people on the platform with the free launching. So I'm just curious kind of where you guys are in that conversation with your third party manufacturers and kind a what the outlook is more broadly if you see maybe some firms being removed because of that dynamic?","Paul Reill","So for our mutual fund partners we've taken two steps. The first step is to make sure review all compliant. So we've renegotiated across the platform to make sure that we are complaint with DOL and I think we'll do that pretty much under revenue-neutral basis. So as we close them on the end of the year. And what we hold on the Step 2 that we would strategically look next year at what we're doing with the overall platform. I know it\u2019s coming from the jump right into it. We feel that wasn\u2019t fair to our partners and it really didn\u2019t give us adequate time for advisors to do their planning. So we are finishing up with the negotiations with the contract to make sure we're compliant by year end during the transition period. Even if it's delayed we'll be in good shape. And which we expect the DOL to be delayed, but we will still be in compliant. And then step two, as we're looking to the overall who is paying what's their requirements and how we price it. That's going to be something we're looking at next year and the focus of our executive committee and board off sight actually.","Devin Ryan","Got it, okay. Maybe there\u2019s a last quick one here. Paul, this has been addressed, but in some of the conversation around that the tax tap on 401k contributions and hopefully that doesn't happen but not sure how we should think about the considerations for Raymond James if that were to happen and I believe in your administrator. But if we can think about what the implication of that could be just on the business?","Paul Reilly","Yeah. So my philosophical answer is it's not good policy that we need more savings. And they even they means cluster or whatever, I think eliminate the 401k deduction is not good policy. From a firm standpoint, it\u2019s not a big part of our business.

My name is Stephanie and I will be your conference facilitator today. This call is being recorded and will be available on the company's website.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Paul Shoukry, Vice President of Finance and Head of Investor Relations at Raymond James Financial. Please go ahead.","Paul Shoukry","Thank you, Stephanie, good morning, and thank you all for joining the call this morning. As always, we appreciate your time and interest in Raymond James Financial. After I read the following disclosure, I'll turn the call over to Paul Reilly, our Chief Executive Officer; and Jeff Julien, our Chief Financial Officer. Following their prepared remarks, they will ask the operator to open the line for questions.","Certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, information concerning future strategic objectives, business prospects, anticipated savings, financial results, industry or market conditions, demand for our products, acquisitions, our ability to successfully hire and integrate financial advisors, anticipated results of litigation and regulatory developments, our liquidity and funding sources, or general economic conditions.","Words such as believes, expects, anticipates, projects, forecasts and future conditional verbs, as well as any other statement that necessarily depends on future events, are intended to identify forward-looking statements. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from those expressed in those forward-looking statements. We urge you to carefully consider the risks described in our most recent Form 10-K, which is available on the SEC's website at sec.gov.","During today's call, we will also use certain non-GAAP financial measures to provide information pertinent to our management view on ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered replacements for and should be read in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures may be found in the schedule accompanying our press release.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Paul Reilly, CEO of Raymond James Financial. Paul?","Paul Reilly","Great. Thanks, Paul, and good morning, everyone. I guess you guys know the drill now. I am going to go start and give some overview numbers and turn it over to Jeff little more detail, make some comments before we turn it over for Q&A.","Considering all of the challenges this industry is facing, the competition, markets, the regulatory environments, the rising cost of people and healthcare, I have to say, I am pretty pleased with our results for the quarter. As you know at RJ, we don't get overly excited about a good or bad quarter. I don't know if that's because Jeff and I are CPAs by background, but I think it's more that we really do take a long-term focus and I think as I go through what we've achieved, you are going to see that we have good long-term metrics here.","Revenues for the first half of the year were up 2% over our record start of last fiscal year. So we're off to a good start. I don't really want to take credit for that. We can't forget it\u2019s our advisors and people and managers in the field that really make that happen. The net income for the first six months of $232 million were adjusted $237 million, is just $3 million less than our record start for last fiscal year at the same time period, so that delta is really, most of that was in the technology spend. In the loan loss provision, which a lot of that was driven by growth and some extra reserves and the energy portfolio, which I'm sure we\u2019ll talk about.","And I think we've also seen some very solid discretionary expense management, so I want to give kudos to our managers who have worked hard on that. Maybe one of the most important metrics for us is the growth in our FAs. We hit 6,765, up 381 from a year ago, and up another 78 over last quarter. And again, we like to talk about the fantastic recruiting results, but I think the real result, we should be proud about, is the retention, as advisors choose to stay and work with us here at Raymond James.","That all resulted in record assets under administration of $513.7 billion, up 4% year-over-year while the markets were actually slightly down for the same period, and I think that's really kind of the best-in-class results as we look across the market. We had record net loans at Raymond James Bank of $14.3 billion, that's a 19% increase year-over-year with very strong credit quality, non-performing assets actually went down 15% year-over-year, and again we will talk about the energy portfolio which is one of the areas that that we watch closely.","And we\u2019re on track with our acquisition of the U.S. Private Client Services Group at Deutsche Bank as we call that soon to be formed Alex Brown with over 90% of the advisors who have signed on now. We don't think that's ever a done deal. In fact, we don't think actually when people are here we have a lot of work to do. And I can tell you from everything we know everything is on track, and we're very proud of that result as we've had virtually almost 100% of the advisors here in St. Pete. And the more we meet, the more I am convinced this is a great fit for Raymond James, but also a great fit for those advisors. This will be a mutually beneficial combination.","So, overall, pleased with the results. On a consolidated basis net revenues of $1.31 billion or up 2% year-over-year, 3% sequentially. Net income of $125.8 million, up 11% year-over-year and 18% sequentially. Non-GAAP adjusted net income of $129.7 million, up 14% and 21% sequentially. And non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.90, 17% year-over-year and 23% sequentially. Now, a lot of that has been result of hard work, but we've also been helped by the rise of short-term interest rates last December both in the bank, NIM [ph] on our client cash balances and discipline on managing the growth and discretionary spend in our business.","Let me hit the segments really quickly as an overview. Our Private Client Group at $880 million net revenues in the quarter is up 1% year-over-year and one as compared to last year's quarter and 1% sequentially. We entered the quarter with a higher fee-based asset and the reason that growth wasn't higher as commissions are down and a lot of that is just the equity markets. Our syndication and activity was low and investor activity was low for the quarter. We also had lower mutual fund balances as the market was down during the timeframe, so you know that dragged net revenues there. Account and service fees were driven by the higher interest rates.","Pre-tax of $83 million is up 10% year-over-year and 20% sequentially. The one area that probably has up and down results is our capital market. Net revenues of $237 million was up 1% year-over-year, 5% sequentially and pre-tax profits of $28.1 million was up 35% year-over-year and 12% sequentially. Now, there are a lot of moving parts in that. The fixed income division has formed superbly in this market and has done very, very well. Institutional commissions of $80 million are up 7% year-over-year and up 12% sequentially. So, they continue to perform very, very well and kudos to them.","In the equity capital markets area, it\u2019s still challenging. As you know, during the first quarter, the IPO market, especially in January and February, very, very quiet, it was better in March. So business was very difficult. So that was a challenging quarter for them. And our tax credit business had a great quarter with syndication fees up 80%, which I wouldn't view that as a run rate, but their deals are lumpy as a spiky quarter, but they are still on projection to have a record year.","In Asset Management, the assets under management at $68.8 billion is down 1% year-over-year and up 1% sequentially. We've had tailwinds in the Asset Management group supported by great recruiting and when advisors come over often bring over balances to our managed platform, but the tailwind has been \u2013 the headwind has been the outflows in our Eagle Asset Management business. So net it's been a slower growth quarter. Revenues are $96.8 million, up 3% year-over-year and down 3% sequentially, and pre-tax income of $31.1 million, flat year-over-year, and down 7% sequentially.","Raymond James Bank was the star and I hate to see Steve sitting across from me and smiling a little bit. Record results top and bottom line and in loans, net revenues of $125 million, up 22% year-over-year and 16% sequentially. Pre-tax $85 million, up 1% year-over-year and 29% sequentially. Driven a lot really by our loan growth, we hit a record of $14.3 billion, up 1% year-over-year, 19% \u2013 I'm sorry \u2013 year-over-year. NIM in the Bank because of interest rate rise in December went from 290 basis points to 309, so certainly that short-term rate hike helped results. And good credit management, and again we will discuss energy, which continues, I think, to be a challenge, but we believe we\u2019re addressing it appropriately.","So with that, I\u2019m going to turn it over to Jeff to go over some of the detail line items. Jeffrey.","Jeff Julien","Thanks, Paul. Looking at some of the specific P&L line items, we generally, by the way around here talk about things in terms of segments. We don't actually focus as heavily on the line items, but it's helpful to see how the segment results translate into these various line items, which is how we report in the P&L.","The commission line was relatively flat. The 10th page of the press release give you some good detail and you can see the flat Private Client Group commission sequentially, which Paul just talked about, the factors influencing that, and then we had some good institutional fixed income commissions offsetting a slight decline in equity commissions. Similarly on the same page as a good breakdown of the investment banking line item, and again it reflects most of the things Paul talked about.","Underwritings are down, underwriting revenues are down from last year and last quarter, even the last quarter was fairly slow. It was down further, but that other primary factors in that line item all saw increases. The M&A fee, fixed income, our public finance revenues and tax credit funds, as he mentioned, had a very strong quarter. So, as a result, the overall segment and that line item showed an increase from the preceding quarter.","Investment advisory fees, I think we mentioned on the call a quarter ago that Eagle had seen some significant institutional accounts leave and that is weighing on that investment advisory line at the moment. Coupled within the December quarter, we had a $3.5 million performance fee that only hits in the December quarter each year. So that distorts it even a little further. Interest is one of the factors that that probably was throwing the models off the most this quarter. Its interest and its account and service fees, which is where some of those revenues go when we talk about the spread that we would earn from rising rates.","The fact is that we did last quarter steer you toward $8 million to $10 million a quarter from the first 25 basis point increase, but that was without any knowledge on what the rest of the world would do with respect to passing rates through to clients to where we need to \u2013 we want to stay close to the forefront if not in the lead and being competitive there. The fact is no one has done much of anything. So, as a result, we're realizing more benefit from that first 25 basis point rise than we expected to.","So instead if things stay as they are, we'll see somewhere close to double that amount from this first 25 basis point rate increase but bear in mind any of those factors can change, the Fed may move again, the world may get more competitive with clients, but based on where things are today, it looks like the amount is going to be more like twice per quarter what we thought it would on this first 25 which means it will be less on one of the future rate increases.","Account and service fees, I talked about, it is almost entirely, that there a lot number of things in there but the biggest factor by far is the bank's sweep program where we get fees from the client cash balance swept to other banks which is part of what was driven by the rate increase. There are other things in there like mutual fund fees et cetera, but they didn't change much quarter-to-quarter.","Net trading profits were down slightly from a very large profitable December quarter. And other revenues, there were some P\/E model on press release page 10 also there were some modest private equity valuation gains this quarter versus almost none last quarter which kicked in, which helped a little bit in that particular line item and there was a whole bunch of other lesser factors that played into that line item not all of which will be recurring either.","So, at the end of the day the net revenues \u2013 I'm sorry, net revenues for the quarter were \u2013 for that quarter were up 3% sequentially and 2% over the prior year, so a pretty good result.","In the expense side, actually one of the misses I guess I would say we had was a little bit was in comp. Even though our comp ratio came in at 67.7, which is below our target, it was a little bit above your models. I think some of that was driven by an under appreciation of the impact of January affect for us which is really twofold.","One is all the raises kick-in for all the salaries around the firm. And secondly we have a reset of the FICA which we talked about last year in this quarter. And the sequential affect the FICA resetting for all the financial advisors and everyone else that was over the limit throughout the year, it was about a $6 million increase in the March quarter over the December quarter. And then there was some additional comp with revenues being higher than projected.","On the other side of the ledger, a positive impact versus your models was communications and data processing. I would say that really that line item and business development both of which were substantially below consensus models really had to do with something that Paul talked about last time, which was really a little stricter discretionary cost management.","We were concerned about heading into a choppy or downward revenue cycle, and clearly revenues are not up dramatically. So we had taken a number of steps to limit the discretionary spends like travel and number of conferences and things like that. And one of those things is some of the long list of IT projects that people had requested, some of those have been deferred. So that's predominantly what you are seeing in there and some of those resources have been allocated over to the Alex. Brown acquisition at this point in time.","Not a lot of change in the other expenses until we get down to \u2013 finish on communications. For the year \u2013 year-to-date it's 140 million which is kind of right on top of the 70 million a quarter that we guided to and I think that's probably still good guidance for the balance of the year. It's a little lumpy there as things start amortizing or stop amortizing and things like that, but I think that we would not really alter that guidance at this point.","In the terms of the business development line, I think this one is probably a little aberrationally low. We probably would still be in high 30 million to 40 million per quarter on that particular line item. There's a little bit of lumpiness there in terms of timing of some of conferences and things like that.","The bank loan loss provision was substantially higher than last quarter, but pretty much in line with where you all thought it would be. Number of factors in that, but it's mainly driven by growth as well as some of the bolstering of some of the energy names and Steve will \u2013 can provide more detail on exact provisions there four, five moving parts in there including the SNC exam and other things that happened during the quarter that we can go into. But really the main theme there is net loan growth of $615 million for the quarter, coupled with us putting some more reserves on the energy portfolio which now stands \u2013 reserve there now stands at 7% of outstandings I think.","Acquisition related only was about $6 million this quarter. We know we guided you toward $25 million to $30 million for the year, and I think that's probably still a good estimate based on people's projection of the timeline and when expenses will be incurred we should see that accelerate as we get closer to the closing date.","You know, so we think that $25 million or $30 million estimate for the overall acquisition and integration is probably still a pretty good number. Not much change in other expense, and the tax rate was in line. We got a little help from COLI but not much.","On page 12 of the press release just a couple of other things I want to make sure get on the record here. The record assets under administration of $513.7 billion, a record high. A record high for financial advisors at 6,765 on that page also.","Shareholders equity was actually down slightly, really just simply driven by the $144.5 million share repurchase during the quarter about 3.2 million shares. That actually helped EPS by a penny as well, but it kept our capital level relatively flat for the quarter.","As a result, the ROE, non-GAAP ROE was 11.2% for the quarter, 10.3% year-to-date so we're over that 11% hurdle but we should start creeping up as we start to get some interest help.","On the pre-tax margin side, we did achieve over 15%. But I would tell you that capital markets is lumpy. We've not had good capital markets, we have had good fixed income. We had a really good quarter in tax credit funds, so that bounces around somewhat. But the 12% margin or 11.7% actually that they turned in this quarter as a blend is probably okay, acceptable. But we would like to see some improvement there in the equity capital markets side for sure.","Private Client Group came in at 9.4% which is a nice improvement from the December quarter, but still not on double-digits that we would expect particularly with some of the help from the rise in interest rates. And again they are some of the ones that are penalized and helped by some of these costs that we've talked about.","The real factor in this particular quarter even though it went up a lot, it would've gone up more, they had not a lot of revenue growth in this segment. And we expect to \u2013 I would think we would have a good shot at hitting those double-digit margins for the balance of the year if the markets continue to cooperate.","Our capital ratio is actually declined slightly. And that's really just a result of continued balance sheet growth, particularly in the loan portfolio where we didn't have any capital growth because of the share buybacks so you saw. Equity flat on a higher balance sheet which drove the capital ratio, now it is just under 22% total capital ratio now.","And the last point I'd like to make is on April 15 as it came due we did retire $250 million of corporate debt that were five-year notes at 4.25 that we issued in 2011. We have not refinanced those. We simply paid them off. So as of today our liquidity has been reduced accordingly. But we're still in very good shape both in capital and liquidity at this point in time.","With that I'll turn to Paul for some forward-looking information.","Paul Reilly","Thanks Jeff. As we look forward I think first, record number of that days thanks to the great retention and recruiting, it's going to help drive given a cooperative market at the Private Client Group and certainly for successful on the to be formed Alex. Brown division where so far our signs have been over 90%. That should be a great driver for us.","And the Capital Markets area, fixed income has been very consistent and performing very well in this market as is public finance, I think on the year end rankings we are eight, total credit to lead nationally.","So, from this a lot of this is driven by our combination with Morgan Keegan which has really been four years ago now believe it or not it has really put us at fixed income public finance business a major player.","Tax credit funds had a great quarter but it's a spiky quarter even though we look at them having their best year if you look at the backlog, but it was still a good outlook for the tax credit funds and equity capital markets was the question that\u2019s certainly been better and March and April have been better than March, but I wouldn\u2019t call it robust and especially with energy markets we're going to have to see what happens. So, although it is improved, I would say that's the one business where we see potential headwind still.","The asset Management, again our internal platforms will benefit from our strong recruiting as they have been. The Eagle net sales have been very heavy, but we still have experienced net outflows in challenging market.","RJ Bank who has had very, very strong growth as you can see, we're looking more for a kind of 10% target looking forward in that growth rate and you know that adding loans, net loans is spiky due to loan payoffs and production, so we expect continued growth.","Our energy reserves were now 7% to our total outstanding, so we think our reserves are underlying, but certainly continued low oil prices over time will have to probably revisit that now to price to stay low. I'm sure you will have some questions for Jeff.","We've achieved these results while investing heavily in our advisors and client facing platforms. Cyber security, our regulatory systems as expectations continue to increase, it's nice to see that we have this scale to be able to do all of these things kind of simultaneously.","It's certainly a challenge and the market is achieving that balance. Since someone may on the off chance asked me about the Department of Labor rule, I will try to comment a little bit ahead of time here.","First, this was 1000 page rule, which I would describe as a guideline almost more than a rule. It's very hard to interpret. If you want to oversimplify it in most areas it allows you to do about anything under a bid, but you are up to later suits.","And so what you do and how you do it is the thing of considerable thought. Our approach has been to say how can we best serve the clients and keep the flexibility of our advisors to serve our clients and that is a dynamic process.","I think if you really talk to anyone in the industry, we have one of the leading law firms, consulting firms who are involved in the trade groups no one really understands the full impact yet.","And I'm sure there will be rising costs. We can't give you a number but the other hand there's only so much we can do at the time, and we will just have to reallocate resources and probably move some other projects that we have scheduled in Tech and Ops a little bit later, because as you make changes to one system, it impacts the other systems, so it\u2019s very hard to do it simultaneously. So I cannot really give you a number, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll ask again, but again we\u2019re dealing with it. We will comply, we will be in process and it won\u2019t be free. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be earth shattering numbers, but it\u2019s still early at this time.","I want to end again by with thanking our advisors in these choppy markets, it\u2019s easy to get distracted and our advisors have done a great job focusing and helping our clients and that\u2019s really why we are in business. And also I don\u2019t do this very often, but thanking the management team in this environment to be able to control costs and grow the business is really quite a feat and I really give them credit.","So with that, let\u2019s open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities.","Devin Ryan","Hey, good morning everyone.","Paul Reilly","Hey, Devin.","Devin Ryan","Clearly another great quarter here on the financial advisor recruiting front. I\u2019d just love a little more perspective around the outlook and window and anything you can give us on home office visits. And also just kind of layering in around the DOL, as well I\u2019m just curious if you anticipate any change in trajectory or may be a slowdown on the independent side just as these folks are trying to figure out or they\u2019re trying to figure out what the actual real changes in the business will be going forward. So, I\u2019m curious if you think that will create a little bit of an air pocket just in people in motion just trying to figure out what the DOL actually means for their business?","Paul Reilly","So, I would say, Devin, right now as recruiting is off home offices up because these are up everything is up. And just for many, many factors, in fact, the one that\u2019s up the most is the independent contractor channel. So, I would say from mobility of it from advisors wanting to move, it hasn\u2019t slowed down at all. Joins and commits are up and very solid pipeline as good of a pipeline as we\u2019ve ever had. So, we don\u2019t see the slowdown in movement will it get to a point where advisor say well do I want to wait a couple months, this might have to repay for DOL and repay to move, might I wait a little bit? Maybe. But we don\u2019t see that indication now.","We certainly are focused when we recruit, I\u2019m looking at books to see how much is IRAs and maybe subject to some change and not, but right now the pipelines look great and all the forward indicators are up, overlapping.","Devin Ryan","Got it. Okay, that\u2019s great color. And then just one around capital management thought process, you guys have been doing kind of a line on all fronts obviously, Alex. Brown, the recent debt retirement for share buybacks, I\u2019m just curious one, how do you think about excess liquidity capital today? Then two, what are the priorities and are you still looking at thinking about doing acquisitions and how does the pipeline look there?","Paul Reilly","Yes I would say that first we do have the Alex. Brown transaction coming up and we will look at our capital structure and make decisions on how we finance or pay for that. We do have plenty of opportunities in the market. So I would say from a corporate development it\u2019s very positive.","We also have a lot on our plate. So we are trying to choose our opportunities very, say sparingly right now because we have a lot of things to deliver and focusing on the DOL impact of just not hurting the business impact and talking about just the process of change anytime you have that you\u2019re going to spend focus on it. So I don\u2019t think our capital structure or guidance has really changed from what we\u2019ve told you before we\u2019ve been pretty consistent on it. We think we can deploy capital certainly in Alex. Brown, we will.","And in these markets we always focus on liquidity. Where we think we have good liquidity right now but if we do Alex. Brown and others that gets tighter in liquidity and we\u2019ll make arrangements for that.","Devin Ryan","Okay. Got it. And just a quick modeling thing, so I appreciate the strength in NII and some of the commentary around the first rate hike has all of the benefit of that flow-through at this point? Were there any corporate loan fees in NII I know this can be lumpy. And then just separately just also thinking about modeling, on commissions on a go-forward basis, I\u2019m assuming that the trails should have a pretty nice step up all of equal because of the recovery in markets kind of point-to-point, so just a few of those things I would appreciate it?","Paul Reilly","On your point about corporate loan fees Devin, in the NIM which increased nicely 19 basis points over the prior quarter. And virtually all of that net was driven by the rate hike. There were higher corporate loan fees from the very low December quarter which had a positive impact, but there was also a negative impact that just about offset that from the bank having higher than projected cash balances throughout the middle of the quarter. Not at the beginning or the end, but at the middle of the quarter they \u2013 we saw a big influx and flying cash balances that swept through our Bank and they don\u2019t earn very much on cash balances as you know. So that actually dragged down the NIM to sort of offsetting the corporate loan fee increase. So net the increase really was because of the rate hike.","Devin Ryan","Got it. And is that all in \u2013 so that fully flow \u2013 the full results including the account and service fees?","Paul Reilly","Yes, I would say virtually all the first rate hike is in this quarter, may be a little bit more would come on in the second calendar quarter. But I think from the bank perspective where most of the interest earnings are showing up, I think we guide to a little higher NIM somewhere around this level for the rest of the year.","All the factors that I mentioned and they can change, so they can get excess cash, they could have loan fees go up or down, the Fed could move on gross rates again or we could end up increasing rates to clients, it\u2019s a competitive landscape change. So any of those actors can change, but based on where the things are today, I think where was is probably a good level for the balance of the year.","Devin Ryan","And the trails on commissions?","Paul Reilly","Trails, they were actually a little weaker this particular quarter because of mutual fund, I will call the market swoon in the middle of the quarter, as trails are based on average balances for the quarter. So certainly the equity funds \u2013 equity-based funds saw a little bit of a decline in trails. So, to the extent that we don\u2019t see another equity markets swoon those could actually recover a little bit from where they were this quarter.","Devin Ryan","Great. Okay. Thanks a lot guys.","Paul Reilly","Yes.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse.","Christian Bolu","Good morning, guys.","Paul Reilly","Hey Christian.","Christian Bolu","Hello. So, just curious how you\u2019re thinking about the 15% pre-tax margin target? So, I guess the firm is substantially bigger on short-term rates and substantially higher then where they were when these targets were set. So, maybe what\u2019s holding you back from raising that target?","Jeff Julien","Yes, I think on a non-GAAP basis, there was about 15.6% this quarter. I think continuing on the non-GAAP basis, it probably should be in the 16% plus range now that we\u2019ve gotten the benefit of that first rate hike given the magnitude of the benefit we\u2019re seeing. And we would probably shoot for that for the balance of the year. Whether we officially set as a target or not, it\u2019s \u2013 certainly our goal is to improve it from here.","Paul Reilly","Given some help in the equity market from capital markets, we should do that.","Christian Bolu","Okay, great. And then on a fixed income business, I feel like I ask one every quarter, but it feels like it just continues to defy what we see at the bigger banks. Curious how you think the market here in here, I think you\u2019ve classified as a B market in your kind of A to D scale.","So, where are we just now in terms of the market environment and any thoughts on how \u2013 what we can think about in terms of just outlook for that business?","Paul Reilly","Yes, I think the outlook in the present market is I don\u2019t foresee any short-term drivers for change. I think you have the big banks who are in the debt origination business which were really not to any degree, certainly have been impacted on the taxable side, the taxables that are certainly off. But the big banks have also, because of the capital requirements, have lowered their inventories. So I think we\u2019re a more go to market which helps us turn in more quickly. And we just have to manage it so that the markets over stop and you have less people with inventories you don\u2019t want to end up with them all.","So we think our risk management is very strong and I don\u2019t see any factors right now because the ECB held rates today, I don\u2019t see any factors right now that would say in the short-term we should look any different.","Jeff Julien","One of the things that helped us past quarter was some of the volatility you saw in the tenure bouncing around, which helps activity a little bit.","Christian Bolu","Okay, and is there any sort of seasonality in that business should we think about the first quarter or the March quarter as being stronger or do you foresee just fairly stable trends going forward?","Jeff Julien","Yes, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s seasonality in terms of the first quarter being exceptionally strong.","Paul Reilly","I think the opposite Jeff. Some of these annual costs that creep in.","Jeff Julien","So I don\u2019t \u2013 again I don\u2019t see anything that would say, I would look at it. We wouldn\u2019t expect anything different right now and anything can happen. We think we will get continue good performance.","Christian Bolu","Okay. Fair. And then just lastly clean up. On cash management just how much cash do you guys have just now, client cash and what kind of spreads are you getting on the off-balance-sheet cash?","Jeff Julien ","We anticipated that we would, just to tell you why we\u2019re off on our forecast and what we\u2019re guiding people to, we were predicting client cash balances around $34 billion to $35 billion for the year.","During the March quarter they spiked and peaked at almost $40 billion. They are back to about $38.5 billion as we sit here today. Most of that is in the bank sweep program, our own bank has had an appetite for a lot of it. But on that off \u2013 we\u2019re getting in the high 40s in the bank sweep program, off-balance-sheet program.","Christian Bolu","Great, thanks you for the color. Congratulation for strong quarter.","Paul Reilly","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura.","Steven Chubak","Thank you very much. Good morning, gentlemen.","Paul Reilly","Good morning Steve.","Steven Chubak","Jeff first question I had is, just on the last remark you made on decline cash off-balance-sheet you noted the yield that you\u2019re getting is in the high 40s. Can you remind us where that stood before the initial December rate hike?","Jeff Julien","It was in the high 20s.","Steven Chubak","They are in high 20s","Jeff Julien","They are almost all on floating rate. We basically saw 25 basis point increase in the rate actually 24 hedge funds effective only it went up 24 basis points actually. So we actually saw 24 basis point rise in the earning side when we passed about four basis points, so to the clients so far.","Paul Reilly","I want to get a little color why it maybe a little better than maybe others, the two. We\u2019ve been pretty disciplined about not fixing rates, leveraging the bank with fixed-rate securities and others. We\u2019ve kept it pretty matched floating business compared to others. So those rates came through and frankly we raised rates when the rates came through and no one else did.","So, we\u2019ve always said we\u2019ve had two rate rises and most people have done none and we\u2019ve just said well, it\u2019s kind of crazy to be way out in front of the market. And on top of that, balances spiked. So, you add all three together \u2013 this sum of what we do is certainly competitively driven and that just ended up, that we ended up with better earnings from that.","Steven Chubak","All right. So with the assuming with next rate hike, how much of that should you expect to retain? I assume maybe to step-up will be more modest just given, but it\u2019s going to be contingent on competitive dynamics? So may be you can give some outlook.","Jeff Julien","I think you look at it and that\u2019s absolutely right that if historically, one of our benchmarks has always mutual funds that will be interesting and the environment would gain some liquidity and all that with who is going to be the competitive rates that are for interest rates. So, we assume at some point the market is going to move and pass it on. And I would guess at the next interest rate hike you\u2019d see that",".","Paul Reilly","Yes, looks like the next hike money market funds would actually get off the zero to one basis point train and pass something through to clients but that remains to be seen.","Jeff Julien","So, it would be less. But we certainly would pass larger percentage to clients than we did so far.","Steven Chubak","Got it. And Paul, maybe just one on the DOL, I appreciate your comments on the expense items, some of the color that you've given, I guess what you view is that the greatest potential threat focusing on what some of the potential revenue impacts to be based on the proposal and there has been some discussion around revenue sharing fees, a declining commissions, and maybe as \u2013 are there any potential litigants that you also see on the horizon and one that has been highlighted by you guys in the past to be accelerated conversion through higher fee advisory?","Paul Reilly","Yes, even moving to fee advisory is a big under the DOL rule which means you are taking a fiduciary move with your client to put them on a fee-based platform. So there's no free launch on here.","And you know frankly people should do what's in the best interest of the clients. So that's fine. We don't object to that. The problem in the rule is you are almost caught no matter what you do. Even the grandfathering is if your account kind of stays where it is, you are grandfathered as soon as you change anything your ungrandfathered.","So the rule is very, very complicated. And I think the early assumption by lot of people was the rule wasn't bad than the rule was horrible. The truth is that a little better, and the adjustments and what takes time is not going to come from just the firm.","I mean there are going to be changes in client fees and charges. There could be a change in advisor fees and comp, certainly funds will look \u2013 I think the funds and the way we do business with each other will change over time too. So those are all the moving pieces that no one knows.","I would say, at the end of the day I don't see anyone in the chain, clients what if I so we have to make sure that we're comfortable for the liability we are assuming now that we can on very small accounts whether its worth it.","Mutual funds still want to use us as a platform. They are going to be supportive, there is just going to be a change I think across the business on how everybody does business. So and that's going to take a few months to even figure out. Everyone is in dialogue. And I think the first viewed some people's view was everything was going to fall on the company to absorb all these costs and compression and all of this. And I don't think that's the way it's going to work.","So we are still a few months away. We are in dialogue with all of our partners. We are examining first how we can serve clients the best and do the best job for them. Secondly, keeping the flexibility of that phase, and third what is the impact to us and our product suppliers and other partners and what's the right way to structure this, so it's fair and it's compliant.","For people that have reacted, I know some people have made changes, some this rule was a good excuse to further their platform objectives, and I am not saying that's bad. But it is just fit it right in. And for us our focus has always been on clients and advisor flexibility, and so we're just not going to jump out. We have time to do this right and we will do it right.","So I wish I could give more color than that, but that's \u2013 we're working very hard. We have a lot of people, a lot of outside help and I think we'll come through and find. I just can't tell you what exactly it will look like. All those things are under threat, yes, they are under threat, but I don't think they are static, it is very dynamic.","Steven Chubak","Understood. There is a lot to digest, so I appreciate the color. And I will hop back in the queue.","Paul Reilly","Okay.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Bill Katz of Citigroup.","Bill Katz","Okay. Thanks so much for taking the question this morning. I just want to come back to a couple of sort of math topics and I apologize if I'm not following along. If you look at many other banks across the sector NIMs have improved a little bit, even some of your peers, but not to sort of same magnitude. Can you sort of review your balance sheet a little more in terms of how much is floating rate versus fixed rate, just trying to understand the sequential improvement a little bit better.","Jeff Julien","Are you talking about at the bank level?","Bill Katz","Yes.","Jeff Julien","Of our $16 billion balance sheet, all about $1 billion is floating rate. And then the $1 billion that's not to the extent that its got any significant term to it, I guess we may with some security, but we had anything that goes out very long-term, so we are very insulated from interest rate moves.","Paul Reilly","I mean some of our \u2013 Bill, some of our residential mortgage loans we tend to do adjustable-rate mortgages that are five, sevens, and some tens that have \u2013 they are fixed for that period, Jeff has referred\u2026","Bill Katz","Yes, sometimes we put in the fixed rate.","Paul Reilly","Yes. But\u2026","Jeff Julien","We\u2019ll see some short-term fix stuff and then longer term fix stuff. Longer-term fix stuff which we call seven years or longer that\u2019s the billion I was talking about. We had a substantial portion of that and then all of the other \u2013 the vast majority which is a corporate loan portfolio is all floating rate.","Paul Reilly","And I think that's the route of the Delta when you compare, we're very interest rate\u2026","Jeff Julien","Yes. We have such a high percentage of floating rate loans through deposits versus other banks which have bigger resi portfolios and bigger security portfolios and we know there are \u2013 have fixed rate to them we would naturally benefit a little bit more.","Bill Katz","Okay. That's helpful. And then just following up on the provision discussion. I think I heard you said you still provision about the reserve about 7% of the NC book. If you do the math I think that division incremental would be even higher than what you reported at the average level the 9.6. Is there anything reversals elsewhere in the portfolio to bring the net down? I'm just trying to understand that in the concept of bit of a step off criticized loan portfolio.","Jeff Julien","A big \u2013 a growing portion of the reserve is qualitative in nature. We did add to the energy but there are other factors in the qualitative reserve that we could like upon and I could quite give you one example without giving any specific numbers is we had a qualitative, a course on a qualitative reserve relates to companies that are most sensitive to rapid rises in interest rates.","And six months ago when the Fed was \u2013 everybody's \u2013 the talk was the Fed was going to raise four times this year et cetera, that was a bigger risk for companies that were more interest rate sensitive but that specter has waned somewhat as we've gone on. So that's an example of a qualitative reserve that we didn't need to have as much allocated to.","We also have several credit fund loans payouts in full. There are other improvements in the credit quality. The residential portfolio continues to improve. So there are a lot of factors there to build, but you are right we actually increased our reserves against the energy portfolio by $13 million that outstand to 31.7 million as we reference at 7% of our outstanding. So we feel very comfortable with that we\u2019re on top of that situation.","Bill Katz","Okay. And just last one for me. Thanks for taking all questions this morning. If I still go back to your last guidance on rates it sounds like a lot more questions quarter-to-quarter, where do you stand if you would get a 400 basis points rate has now, what percentage of that 100 basis points you think you have incrementally from here?","Paul Reilly","We have \u2013 in our statements right now there's probably 45% of the full amount that we would anticipate from the 100. In other words it not 25, 25, 25, 25 with each rate hike, it is more frontloaded than that based on where we are today. So we have got another half at least to go if they raised by the 400.","That number we gave you for the 400 is probably still a good number, 169 is probably a little higher now because cash balances have grown. But that $160 million-ish type number is probably still accurate for the 400 basis \u2013 again it depends on what the money market fund rates are and competitor rates at that time. That's still about where we would expect to be. We are just getting further along from the first rate hike than we had anticipated.","Bill Katz","Okay.","Paul Reilly","We are just a little sort of half, I guess is the answer to your question.","Bill Katz","Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Chris Harris with Wells Fargo.","Chris Harris","Thanks guys. Just want to follow-up on a question that was asked earlier about the margin. Thinking about it for the year maybe in the second half, you talked about maybe being comfortable with 16%. Is that a good target even inclusive of what expenses might come out as it relates to DOL and the Alex. Brown integration or would that perhaps SKU you guys hitting that number?","Paul Reilly","For the Alex. Brown integration expenses, we're going to show on a non-GAAP basis, so it is exclusive of those. And you also have to remember what's going to pressure margins \u2013 recruiting is absolutely fantastic. But it does pressure margins in terms of our upfront transition assistance and amortization of that. So that continues to grow.","We think a great ROE and a great return on investment. So we've got \u2013 I think that as a target of 16% is probably reasonable target, but growth in our other growth investments are going to impact that. Our history on \u2013 if you look at our few acquisitions, they always take time to get up and running also. And get through the cost of the systems.","At Morgan Keegan, we're very heavy per year in terms of staffing and my guess this year will be little heavy also as we get through the integration process. So, I don't think the target Jeff had put out is probably unreasonable, but it's not a layout either.","Jeff Julien","We've got some higher than projected expenses with the DOL and other things, but we also are getting a little more help on the interest and accounting service fees than we had expected. So net-net, I think that's probably a reasonable goal to shoot for.","Chris Harris","Okay, very good. Just the one follow-up from me and that relates to the loan growth. Any commentary you guys might be able to share with us about where you are entering those loans and perhaps what the outlook is for the remainder of this fiscal year for that?","Jeff Julien","Chris, yes, it's been pretty broad over really all of our sectors that you see. And we grew loans in all of our categories residential, securities based lending, our tax exempt business, commercial real estate, and then our large corporate C&I book. So we have grown loans as Paul mentioned 19% year-over-year, we don't expect to grow that rapidly over the next 12 months I think some things in the low double-digit, high single-digits 9% to 11% would be kind of a good target for us for the next 12 months.","Chris Harris","All right. Thank you.","Paul Reilly","I would mention Chris we're expecting some positive growth coming out of the Alex. Brown advisor channel, we are excited about getting ready for that opportunity and we would expect growth in our mortgage banking business and securities-based lending business and our margin lending business too coming out of that business. So it should be very helpful for those businesses.","Chris Harris","Wish all will hit for fiscal 2017?","Paul Reilly","Yes, Right.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Hugh Miller with Macquarie.","Hugh Miller","Hi, appreciate you taking my questions and just wanted to follow-up with Steve at the bank. As we think about obviously asset quality still very sound, but looking at the uptick in MTAs and the criticized loans, can you just give us a sense of what types of credits you are seeing migrating there?","Paul Reilly","Sure. We actually had three full par payoffs in our criticized portfolio of this last quarter that we've downgraded five loans during the quarter, three of which were in the energy sector. So we now have out of the 32 energy loans, eight of them are criticized. That continues to be the largest concentration of criticized loans in the portfolio. There is no other real trends everything else is just unique to the client and company situation is in that portfolio. So still a very good, very good quality on a relative basis. Our level of criticized loans are relatively low still. So yes, continued obviously watch the energy sector in particular very, very closely and try to be very proactive in terms of how we are provisioning against those exposures.","Hugh Miller","That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then I guess, sticking with the energy themes as a follow-up. As we think about the potential for eventual consolidation in that space, and we think about your capital markets vertical there, is there anything you are seeing in terms of dialogue with CEOs and companies about just appetite for M&A and concern and just potential demand for that?","Paul Reilly","Yes. I think that typically in sectors where you have these issues, there is a bit in the asked and people not trying to hold out and get through as long as they can before they do something or feel like they have to do something. And I think that dynamic is still going on.","As you can see there\u2019s been some financings in energy, most recently, so we are seeing for those that are in strong balance sheets, there is some access. And there certainly are some people looking at the consolidation opportunities which gives us M&A opportunities. But I would say that\u2019s \u2013 discussions are more active, but it hasn\u2019t really shown too much up in the markets yet.","Hugh Miller","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Doug Doucette with KBW.","Doug Doucette","Good morning, guys. I think most of my questions have been asked. I just have one quick one. In terms of the increase in pre-tax income, is there anyway that you guys can tell us the amount that was attributable just to the higher rate environment?","Paul Reilly","Since we got the first full quarter, I would say somewhere in the high-teens. It\u2019s a little difficult because there is bank growth and client cash balance growth and other things during the quarter, but somewhere in the mid to high-teens.","Doug Doucette","Okay. Thanks.","Paul Reilly","Okay.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.","Jim Mitchell","Good morning, guys.","Paul Reilly","Yes.","Jim Mitchell","Just a couple of questions. With the significant pickup in FA hires over the last few quarters, I mean growth rate \u2013 year-over-year growth rate has been accelerating. I guess my first question is there a higher AUM per FA associated with that issue getting into the Northeast?","And I guess two, is most of those assets been brought over or is there still quite a bit to go? Just trying to get a sense of what we should think about new AUM flows over the next couple of quarters?","Paul Reilly","Yes. So, first thing the average assets recruited are higher than our existing average in general. And as we to focus more for those who are in the higher end markets either Southwest or Northeast, they tend to be higher-end advisors. But we\u2019re certainly recruiting higher-end advisors in other places too.","So, it takes maybe a year for a lot of people to get all of their assets over, good chunk come in the first six months, but if you look at the pipeline we keep recruiting, so I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s any really net changes. People coming in are being \u2013 are starting to bring assets over and we have the new recruits starting to bring assets over that pipeline has been pretty steady, it\u2019s slightly rising.","So, I think the trend should continue given the market\u2019s cooperation. And I think for the forward-looking quarter, we\u2019ve got those assets and we should get better billings off of those fee-based assets plus the recruiting should give us a good lift if the markets stay okay.","Jim Mitchell","Right. Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And maybe Jeff I appreciate the comments on the comp ratio, you guys are actually lower than the given seasonality expectations, but you guys declined quarter-over-quarter on a comp ratio, is that mostly because the benefits of the rate hikes and should we expect that comp ratio as FICA and other things slow down to trend down from here over the next couple of quarters?","Jeff Julien","Yes. We\u2019re not going to change that 68% target on comp ratio. You are right, I mean the rate hike, there\u2019s both a volume and a rate variance here. I mean, obviously the balances are up both at the bank and client cash balances, but the rate that might help.","And as the bank became a bigger part, the banks got a very low comp ratio compared to other parts of the firm. So overall, the mix and the rate hike, now the rate hike is going to be with us for the rest of the year too, but we kind of expect the other parts of the business to pick up on a relative basis to the bank and so I think the 68% is probably still where we would shoot more for the year.","Jim Mitchell","Okay. I got it. Your rate sensitivity does not include the balances from Alex. Brown right?","Jeff Julien","Correct. Because that\u2019s\u2026","Paul Reilly","There\u2019s none here.","Jeff Julien","There will be\u2026","Jim Mitchell","I get it.","Jeff Julien","There will be and that will be fiscal 2017 budgeting issue and how we deal with all of that. But they obviously won\u2019t have much of an impact on the fiscal year.","Jim Mitchell","Right. But there\u2019s still about what $5 billion to $6 billion?","Jeff Julien","They got between cash balances. That\u2019s correct.","Jim Mitchell","Okay. All right. Well, that\u2019s all for me. Thanks, and I guess, and I will see you in a few weeks.","Paul Reilly","Good.","Operator","Your next question its from the line of Daniel Paris with Goldman Sachs.","Daniel Paris","Hey, good morning, guys. Two areas, I want to focus on around energy and the DOL, I know limited visibility on both but I will try anyway. On the 7% reserve on the energy, well, can you just kind of give us the pieces, what was the outstanding energy of loan balance and are there any unfunded, can you give us the unfunded revolver balance on the earnings look?","Paul Reilly","Yes. Sure, Daniel. The outstanding balance of the March 31 in the energy portfolio is $444 million \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, $451 million, excuse me. That\u2019s once again 32 borrowers. Our total commitments came down by $28 million on a quarter and now the total commitment is $742 million. So the difference there is the amount of unfunded commitments.","Daniel Paris","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. So I guess if oil stays where we are today, do you feel like you are fully reserve based on your best estimate or we stay at this level for a long period\u2026","Paul Reilly","I don\u2019t think anyone is fully reserved and oil stays low for a long period of time. So there is certainly companies that are leveraged or asset rich and who are using cash or other things are going to struggle. So I would say if we have sustained oil prices at this level, there will be additions to reserves.","Daniel Paris","Okay. Got it. Maybe if I could shift over to the DOL, I understand that its very early days and very unclear. One area that stood out to me, the DOL was specifically talking about was the ability to kind of pitch for 401(k) rollover business. Can you give me a sense of, A, if you agree with that and B, kind of what percent of your organic growth the past few years have come from 401(k) to higher rate rollovers.","Well, first, you are allowed to pitch for 401(k) rollover business. You just fall into the BIC and you enter into a fiduciary position that you have to be giving that advice to rollover in the best interest of the clients.","So again if you look at most of the standards it says, you about can do anything as long as it is in the best of the clients and be ready to prove you did. So that\u2019s really what the rule over boiled down says. So certainly it has been an area 401(k) because people do retire and want it managed and rollover. I don\u2019t know if it is a huge percentage of our business, but it is \u2013 I couldn\u2019t give a percentage, but certainly it has been a part of everybody\u2019s business. And I don\u2019t think it will go away, the standard has raised. But I think the standard of making sure it\u2019s good for the client is fine. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that. That should be the standard.","I guess \u2013 I think the DOL in their historic position has had a bias saying that it generally wasn\u2019t in the best interest of the client. I think the new rule basically says we\u2019re not trying to force the lowest fee platforms, but just make sure you\u2019re recommending what\u2019s in their best interest.","So, anytime a person goes from not having a fee to having a fee, you can argue, they are biased. I just think you have to prove that it\u2019s a reasonable recommendation in looking at the client. And so it will continue. It\u2019s just I think there may be more liability associated with it, certainly more documentation which a lot of these costs are going to be on process and documentation.","Daniel Paris","Okay, got it. That\u2019s helpful. Maybe just one more. I know you guys tend to be very disciplined on capital in general and acquisitions, just curious if you think the final DOL rule makes it more likely for you to pursue wealth deals for smaller players who maybe will struggle with some of the kind of compliance costs that you\u2019ve just outlined here.","Paul Reilly","Yes. I think that\u2019s a potential outcome. And frankly, we like that there are independent firms in the industry. We don\u2019t want to be the only non-big bank owned firm, so \u2013 but we look at our costs and certainly any type of layer \u2013 layer of regulation really increase costs, especially if you cross the $1 billion, and then you cross $50 billion, you get another level. So it\u2019s certainly \u2013 it\u2019s tough on the industry and tough on employers when you have this much regulatory costs, we feel it. And I am sure our friends and competitors, the friendly competitors in other firms who share similar values, it\u2019s got to be tougher on them.","So we\u2019re not hoping regulation drives them out of business, but I mean if they make the determination that it\u2019s too costly and they want to join someone who is of like-minded culture for those firms we would welcome them. And I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s a good result for the industry.","Daniel Paris","Got it. Thanks a lot for taking my questions.","Paul Reilly","Thanks.","Operator","We do have a follow up question from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura.","Steven Chubak","Just one quick question for me. I don\u2019t know if you guys have provided, will you expect the step up in FDIC assessment fees to be beginning in the back half of this year?","Paul Reilly","We actually expect ours to be slightly down from where they are. The mega banks are going to be the ones that feel it a little more than us. We will get the step down but down a little bit of us \u2013 full step down and partially back up because of our size. So we actually expect hours to drop but not materially.","Jeff Julien","It will be a small number.","Paul Reilly","Yes. A fraction of a basis point or fraction thereof.","Steven Chubak","Okay. So modest step down, but nothing material?","Paul Reilly","Correct.","Steven Chubak","All right. Perfect. Thank you very much.","Operator","At this time there are no further questions.","Paul Reilly","Great. Thank you all very much. I know you had a lot of questions, so we wanted to allow the time. And most importantly, last quarter I know people thought was a little weaker and this quarter a little stronger, but what we focus really on is on long-term. As I said the end of last quarter, which \u2013 that all of the indicators recruitment assets were positive. Yes, I feel the same thing about this quarter. I\u2019m not going to takeover believe this is a long-term business and the good news is our forward indicators are positive. We have a great team of people here working hard, and we have to earn it every quarter.

So after I talk about our results for the fourth quarter and the fiscal year, I'll turn it over to our legendary CFO to provide more details on the financials, before I discuss the outlook and open it up for questions. ","First, I'm going to remind you with the backdrop going in to this fiscal year. We came off a record year in 2018 and almost all measures under very, very strong. We entered the year thinking interest rates would be on their way up that gave us stress tests that rates going up into the future and we thought the markets could be challenging. They were in the first quarter as rates rose and it was a very soft, tough quarter. ","Interest rates went up, which drove a lot of momentum than interest rates came down and the market went down, but the market went up. We had tariffs on. We had tariffs off. We had increased competition both in the recruiting market, transition assistance, and through that we really delivered another record year. ","Overall, I'm pleased with our results in the fiscal fourth quarter and the fiscal year. Business metrics were strong and I'm encouraged by the solid performance in a number of key areas during the quarter, which included record quarterly net revenue of $2.02 billion. We crossed the $2 billion mark for the first time, which increased 70% over prior year's fiscal quarter and increased 5% over the preceding quarter.","Revenue growth, this quarter was driven largely by a higher Private Client Group assets and fee-based accounts, strong quarterly assessment banking revenues, and a solid performance for both our fixed income for capital markets business and tax credit fund business. We generated record quarterly earnings per diluted share of $1.86 or $2 on a non-GAAP adjusted basis for the $19 million goodwill impairment associated with our Canadian capital markets business. ","Despite this impairment, which was due to challenging market environments in Canada, we remain fully committed to growing our capital markets business in Canada. Thanks to our strong financial advisor retention and recruiting results. We ended the fiscal year with records for client assets under administration of $838.3 billion, Private Client Group fee-based assets under administration of $409.1 billion, total Private Client Group financial advisors of 8,011 and net loans of Raymond James Bank, a $20.9 billion. All key fundamental drivers of our business.","Annualized return on total equity for the quarter was 16.2% or 17.3% on a non-GAAP basis, adjusted for the aforementioned goodwill impairment. And while it isn't a metric that we\u2019ve historically use, starting in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we'll begin reporting the return on tangible common equity ROTCE, whether we agree with the metric or not, even though we don't have preferred equity, but it seems that all other financial companies are now reporting that metric as well. ","If you look at what we discussed at our Analyst and Investor Day in June, adjusted return on tangible equity on an annualized basis at that time was about 180 basis points higher than our adjusted return on equity, which should be in the range of what the impact would be this quarter as well. ","During the fiscal year, we had record net revenue of $7.74 billion, increased 6% net income of $103 billion, increasing 21% and adjusted net income of $1.07 billion, increased 11% over fiscal 2018. Earnings per diluted share of $17.17 increased 25% and adjusted earnings per diluted share $7.40 increased 14% over fiscal 2018. Notably and really an accomplishment, all four of our core business generated net \u2013 record net revenues and three of the four generated record pretax income during the fiscal year. And if you adjust for the non-GAAP items during the year, the Capital Markets segments would have also generated an annual pretax income record, so really a strong performance all four of our core businesses.","The return on equity for the year with 16.2% or 16.7% on an adjusted basis, which is near the top of our range between 16% and 17%, and a really fantastic result given the tough start to the fiscal year and our very strong capital position. Speaking to capital, we were active in deploying capital this year repurchasing 9.83 million shares for $752 million at an average price of $76.50 per share. This represents just over 6.5% of the shares outstanding at the beginning in the year and combined with dividends we returned approximately $945 million to shareholders during the fiscal year. Even with these actions, our capital ratios remain healthy with total capital ratio of 25.8% in Tier 1 leverage ratio of 15.7% at the end of the year, giving us ample flexibility of the future. ","Now let me briefly describe the segment results. In the Private Client Group, we generated record net revenue of $1.38 billion for the quarter and $5.36 billion for the fiscal year. We had another fantastic year of retaining and recruiting advisors. On a net basis, we added nearly 200 advisors during the fiscal year, which includes those advisers recruited, no, the ones lost due to retirements or regrettable or non-regrettable basis.","On a gross recruited basis, our Private Client Group domestic at its second best year just behind 2018 with advisors joining the fiscal year with nearly $300 million of trailing 12 production and $43.5 billion of assets under administration at the prior firms. This is an excellent result, especially given the slow start to the year and the increasing competitive environment. ","While many firms increase their transition assistance and bet on cash balances at beginning of the year, we remain disciplined and still had an outstanding recruiting year. While higher short-term net interest rates and cash spreads were a tailwind during most of fiscal year, that benefit was partially offset by a decline in total clients domestic cash sweep balances during the fiscal year, as clients increased their allocations to other investments. As you know, the two rate cuts in our fourth quarter will likely be a significant headwind as they work through during fiscal 2020, which Jeff will explain more in detail.","Capital Markets finished the fiscal year with strong fourth quarter given investment banking results in a strong quarter for fixed income capital markets and the tax credit business, which offset the continued weakness in equity brokerage revenue. The segment finished the year with record net revenues of $1.8 billion, up 12% from fiscal 2018. The segments pretax income of $110 million was up 21% over fiscal 2018, despite a $19 million goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter and a $15 million loss associated with the sale related to our research sales and trading of European equities in the first quarter. ","As I\u2019ve said, we remained committed to the Canadian Capital Markets business and continue making long-term investments to expand [indiscernible] banking and sales and trading capabilities in Canada. Last year, we operated in a very small portion of the Canadian life sciences space and chose not to participate in the underwriting of Cannabis firm. Whereas the underwriting Cannabis space was very strong in the most significant part of the market last year, the subsequent market performance has been weak as the associated market index is down close to 40% over the last six months. Once again, we kept a long-term view and our decision making process. ","And the Asset Management segment, we generated record net revenues and pretax income for both fourth quarter and fiscal year. Financial assets under management end of the fiscal year at $143.1 billion, an increase of 2% over September, 2018 and flat compared to June, 2019. Overall, the growth in financial assets under management continues to be largely driven by equity market appreciation and positive inflows associated with the increase utilization of fee-based accounts in the Private Client Group segment, which has more than offset than that outflows experienced by Carillon Tower Advisers given the extremely challenging market environment for actively managed products. ","And last but certainly not least Raymond James Bank generated record net revenues and pretax income for the fiscal year. Record net loans of $20.9 billion, grew 7% over last year's September. And the growth of loans continues to be focused heavily on residential mortgages and security based loans, so the Private Client Group as well as C&I other sections. While the banks net interest margin for the fiscal year years 3.32% improved 10 basis points of the fiscal 2018 lower short-term interest rates including the two-rate cuts during the quarter, cause net interest margin declined during the quarter. ","Most importantly, the credit quality of the loan portfolio remains solid and remained extremely diligent with any new loans we add to our balance sheet. So overall I believe a very strong quarter and fiscal year. ","Now I'll turn it over to Jeff to provide some more color on the financial results and then I will provide some more comments on the outlook. Jeff?","Jeff Julien","Thanks, Paul. On the revenue side, most of the trends this quarter were fairly self explanatory or have been covered by Paul, so my comments on that side of the P&L will be somewhat limited. I will comment on asset management and related admin fees. However, there are up 5% sequentially, which happens to be directly in line with the consensus model, so not unusual there. The only reason I really bring it up is it happens to correlate directly with the increase in the prior quarter in fee-based assets of 5%. And it's nice just to see something work like it should sometimes. And that's our biggest revenue item by far. ","So the 3% growth in fee-based assets in the most recent quarter should be an indicator of this line item for the December quarter here as you are aware of large percentage of these accounts are billed in advance and have already been billed. The investment banking line was a slight beat relative to the consensus model as both M&A and fixed income investment banking contributed to the quarter and you can see that in detail on Page 12 of the release, which is the investment banking P&L for the quarter. ","Further on that same page, you'll see other revenues, which were well ahead of expectations in our current revenue format, that is where the tax credit fund revenues fall and they \u2013 as they did last year had a very, very strong September quarter. So you can see that also in a detail on Page 12.","Turning to a couple of the expense items, let's talk about compensation for a second. We had a higher absolute number than consensus as you would expect because of the \u2013 some of the higher compensable revenues, notably investment banking and tax credit fund world. But the comp ratio for the quarter of 65.2% was actually better than expectations and well under our 66.5% target. ","Looking forward in the very short\u2013term like at least about a quarter, we're really not going to change that target in the near-term. You have to remember that as revenues from client cash sweep balances declined a higher proportion of our revenues are going to be compensable in nature, which is kind of put some pressure on the margin. ","In addition, successful recruiting, which we've had two years in a row of near record levels, it's going to create a drag on the short-term through amortization of hiring dollars. At the end of the day, the 2020 budgeting process is still being tweaked a little bit. We're looking very hard at some of the controllable expense items, given the potential headwinds here, but we anticipate being in a position to give a little better guidance on some of these items next quarter.","On the non-comp expenses, although there was a large sequential increase of 13%, that includes the $19 million goodwill impairment charge, which hitting the other expense line item. There was a small spike in occupancy and equipment. So it\u2019s a number of factors in there. There\u2019s some recurring rental increases. We\u2019re actually incurring some double rent on our significant office space in Memphis, which we are relocating from downtown Memphis out to East Memphis. And on a portion of that new space, we\u2019re paying rent as we\u2019re still in the old space as well.","So there\u2019s a double rent. That will haunt us for the next couple quarters as well. There are some additional equipment amortization that kicked in. That will not go away. But one of the lumpy items that won\u2019t necessarily recur has to do with what we call PC refresh. We do -- we have a policy here of refreshing, widely changing out to the newest, latest and greatest models, our laptops and desktops on a three-year rotational basis. And we try to spread that somewhat ratably over the course of the year \u2013 over the course of three years really. So it doesn\u2019t have lumpiness to it. But in this particular quarter, it did. And those are just expense given the relatively low cost of individual PCs.","I do want to talk about the bank loan loss provision as well. Even though, it came in near consensus, it was certainly a turnaround from last quarter\u2019s credit. And actually, it may appear high relative to the $200 million of net loan growth, as you can see, shown on Page 17 of the release. But that was really caused by some downgrades during the quarter. We did get the semiannual SNC exam results at the end of September. That led to three downgrades of some credits we had fairly sizable hold positions in, and that also was -- what primarily caused the $88 million jump in criticized loans, that you can also see on the same page. No pattern to it or anything else, different industry, different types of credits.","And I don\u2019t really think indicative of any upcoming credit issues. It\u2019s just our policy to accept the lower ratings by the SNC. And if we have something low rated, say substandard or special mention and they come in with a pass, we leave it at our ratings. So the SNC exam can only mean bad news to us in terms of the charge, so we stuck with that policy and which caused a couple of million dollars of additional credit charges this quarter.","Some other items I\u2019d like to talk about. You may have noticed we don\u2019t have a non-controlling interest line anymore. We have collapsed that into other expenses to simplify the disclosure and presentation for what\u2019s become a really immaterial line item for us. If and when there is reason to that it becomes material again in the future, that line item may reappear, but for the foreseeable future. That will just be a collapse into the other expenses.","Now let me talk about net interest for a moment. At the firm level, net interest held up pretty well following the fed rate cut in July. First, I\u2019ll talk about RJ Bank\u2019s NIM, that actually fell 7 basis points sequentially from 3.37% to 3.30% and Page 18 gives you all the detail you could want on how that happened, but the bottom line is it was a primarily a result of the rate cut in July where, which caused some spread compression.","And you can see RJ Bank\u2019s earning assets fell 19 basis points in yield while the cost of funds fell only 13 basis points. So that\u2019s an indicative of the spread compression that we saw there. However, the loan growth for the quarter did allow them to have an increase in net interest earnings quarter-over-quarter.","So going forward, first of all, I guess I should point out that the July rate cut by the fed, about two-thirds of that was reflected in this quarter. And of that, with respect to client sweep balances, we had a deposit beta of about 55%. We passed through 13 of the 25. The September rate cut, very little of it was actually reflected in the September quarter, of course. And we passed through 60%, 15 basis points to clients.","The other change that we made before that first fed rate cut, where we switched in May from aggregate asset balances to aggregate cash balances, also was a 7 basis point weighted average impact to clients. So when you add all those things together, over the last six months, there has been basically a 70% beta on these first two rate cuts. If there are additional rate cuts next week and possibly in December as the forward curve would suggest, it\u2019s certainly likely -- highly likely the deposit beta will be significantly lower than it was on these first couple of cuts, which will have a more dramatic impact on our results going forward.","One wildcard I should have pointed out on the bank\u2019s net interest margin, the reason it\u2019s not as easy to correlate to fed movements is that a lot -- most of their earning assets, their loan portfolio is based on LIBOR, which doesn\u2019t always move in lockstep with fed funds. Generally, it\u2019s been a leading indicator. So it\u2019s been going down ahead of the fed rate cuts. And when the fed indicates that it\u2019s finished or skips a cut or whatever, then maybe we\u2019ll see LIBOR rebound and we may actually see NIM react much differently than you would think with no fed movement.","So it\u2019s a little bit difficult to pinpoint the NIM, but for guidance purposes, I guess that we\u2019ve done some work. And the bank also has some fixed rate assets in its portfolio that are impacted by rate cuts that aren\u2019t necessarily pre-payable. So when you \u2013 the work we\u2019ve done with, say, for each of the next couple of rate cuts, it looks like the NIM at the bank could be impacted negatively by somewhere between 8 and 10 basis points. It\u2019s about as close as we can get given the LIBOR dynamic and some of the other things I\u2019ve mentioned.","With respect to client cash sweep balances, they\u2019ve somewhat stabilized here at the $37 billion to $38 billion range. The simple math here would say that every basis point of spread change will impact us by about $3.8 million annually or just under $1 million per quarter. Most of that is reflected in accounting service fee revenues as opposed to interest earnings as we\u2019ve talked about in the past.","That\u2019s about as close that we can get. What we do with the next couple of rate cuts from a holding company basis, obviously will depend on the competitive landscape. We have tried to stay at or near the top of each client strata with our peer groups. And I say groups because there\u2019s regional firms, national firms, custodial firms, et cetera. There are number of different competitive groups that we look at. So it\u2019s going to be largely dependent on what the competitive landscape is.","On Page 7 of the release, I think it\u2019s \u2013 we really do need to look at the annual results, which is obviously a compendium of all the quarterly explanations we\u2019ve given you over the year. But for the year, 6% increase in a net revenues, comp ratio of 65.7%, which we are happy to see below our target. Non-comp expense growth of 9%, but remember, that includes the non-GAAP adjusted items on our schedules in the press release to \u2013 and it also includes some what we\u2019ll call accounting gross-ups and the expense side, because the revenue recognition adoption in early in the year, that were previously netted out of some of the revenues, obviously impacted both sides to some extent.","I would refer you to Page 5, to look at the annual non-GAAP results, if you really wanted to see what we\u2019ll call a good apples-to-apples type comparison of operating results, where you can see pre-tax up 7% for the year on a non-GAAP basis. And a non-GAAP net income up 11%. The reason that\u2019s higher than the pre-tax, we had a full year of the lower tax rate this year. Last year, we had a \u2013 the last quarter a phase in of the tax rate cut. So that\u2019s probably more indicative of our tax rate going forward.","And then diluted EPS, you can see up even a higher percentage at 14, obviously reflecting the share buybacks that we had during the year. So that\u2019s a wonderful page to look at, and then all in all, a great quarter to, and a great year.","So I\u2019ll turn it back to Paul.","Paul Reilly","Great. Thanks, Jeff. And thanks for being such a valuable partner for so many years. Tom and I and Jeff isn\u2019t really going anywhere, he gets as the CFO role, but we\u2019ll have his services at least for another year and as he helps us through the transition. So as Jeff has explained, we are in the middle of our budgeting process and looking at expenses, and I do want to just point out the magnitude. Jeff talked about our non-comp expenses up 9%. But if you look at the two non-GAAP items that we talked about and the impact of the accounting change that grossed up expenses. That accounted for $65 million of the $110 million increase, so over half of the increase was really accounting related.","So I think that people kind of maybe have missed that in the market. They talk about our expense growth, if you do the math. I think it\u2019s significantly less than actual dollar spent. And going forward, we still are focused as a growth company and we still with recruiting. We historically have done very well in down markets of recruiting if that comes, we continue to recruit for long-term growth and there\u2019s just more expense associated with that. But we\u2019re certainly looking at the non-controllable expenses.","We do have some visibility entering this next quarter, even though, with interest rates proposed cuts, certainly will \u2013 it makes it difficult right now to figure out, where we\u2019re going to be for the year. But the private client group assets and fee based accounts as Jeff talked about, increased 3% for the quarter and that should reflect in the asset management related administrative fees for the first quarter of 2020 as those assets are primarily pulled in advance.","Speaking of those billings, while client cash balances shown signs of stabilization over the past three months, our balance just decline in October, and that\u2019s really given to we bill, only bill, they come out to client\u2019s accounts in cash generally. So that was that impact. So what we see is even more impactful is 25 point that a rate basis cut at the end of our fiscal fourth quarter, as Jeff talked about isn\u2019t really fully reflected yet, because it was at the end of the quarter and that will impact 2020.","On a positive note, our financial advisor recruiting activity remains very active across our affiliation options, not a numeric metric, but I can\u2019t remember seeing so many $5 million to $10 million teams in the pipeline. And again, I think it shows the strengthening of our platform and even with our discipline transition assistance approach. Our M&A pipeline is robust. I know the market forecast has been down, but we have several large key deals that we hope will close and I think bode well for M&A at least how we can see it today, you never know in that market.","And the outlook for fixed income business is still very positive. We expect continued rate volatility in 2020. Raymond James Banks enters the quarter with fiscal year with record loan balances and solid credit metrics. And while I think about the only negative financial implications of lower interest rates, many of you do, there are some positives. I do think that the spread difference between cash sweeps and money markets has caused a lot of money to go out of cash and the money market instruments appropriately.","And as that spread comes in and goes to more historical levels, the premium for FDIC sweep balances should close enough, but I think total 12 for cash balances. Although, we may give it up at rate or return to more normal states long-term, and more rational pricing, I think this is going to be a long-term positive for the market. And hopefully also more rational pricing in the market on transitional systems and other packages, but there always seems to be some \u2013 but somewhat in the market being extremely aggressive.","A lot of you have asked about e-broker cutting their commission to zero. As you all know, we do not have a direct channel, so there\u2019s no impact there. And on the advisory side of our business, we think this move actually really reflects the RIA custody segment catching up with the full service segment. That\u2019s the vast majority of our fee based accounts today do not have transaction fees.","As for our growing and importantly significant but smaller RIA custody business, we did announce that we will follow the e-brokers, but that impacts us pretty small to the overall firm around $6 million to $7 million of annual transaction fees to the firms.","With that being said, all these actions always remind us there will be price pressure in our business just as there is in all industries, which means we\u2019ll have to continue to make investments in resources to help our advisors at value and strength to their client relationships and investments to make us more efficient on the cost side, which is exactly what we\u2019ve been focused on.","Before I open for question, I want to thank the associates and advisors for contributing to another great year. We\u2019re kind of overhead here. They really generate the revenue and the great client relationships we have. We\u2019re a people business and our success simply would not be possible without our client focused advisors and associates that support them every day.","With that Calandra, I\u2019m going to turn it over to you and open up the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question, sir, comes from the line of Devin Ryan of JMP Securities.","Devin Ryan","Great. Good morning, everyone. ","Paul Reilly","Hey Devin.","Devin Ryan","Maybe start where you left off, Paul, just on the kind of competitive dynamic and some the pricing changes we\u2019ve recently seen here. I guess first, maybe I just missed it at the end of year, but did you actually quantify the impact of the pricing change that you're making on the RIA side? I guess that's number one. Number two, what other areas are you seeing within kind of the financial advice part of the business, if you will, that that potentially could come under pressure. Are you seeing any areas of pressure? We've recently seen UBS cut fees on SMAs. I'm curious if there's any other areas as we're kind of constantly in this kind of competitive environment where your pricing seems to come under pressure, I'm not sure if there's anything else you would point to.","Paul Reilly","Yes, it is obviously not clear enough, but it was $7 million to $8 million the RIA revenue impact to the firm on those transaction for equities and ETFs. So $7 million to $8 million firm wide is the impact. Yes, we always see competitive pressure. Devin, whether it's been moving to ETFs, the industry moving mutual funds to ETFs whether it's pressure on advisory fees. UBS\u2019 announcement wasn't clear, a few years ago they unbundled between what the advisor charged in the firm. I don't know if it's a re-bundling, so we're going to have to see more, but there is always people that are pushing that dynamic and we've been going through that for years, it's not new. ","I can say the advisor fees have held very, very steady. And it's pushed us to be more efficient. And I think that's the advantage of scale as we've gotten larger that we can deal with some of that, but certainly if that continues long-term and Reg BI will be out in June and we'll see the impacts of that. But I think over the longer-term, if that dynamic continues, people have to remember there is three people that are impacted by changes the client, the advisor and us. And it has to be fair with the client. They're the advisor and then we have to be in business to operate and I think you always have to look at that dynamic. ","So right now we feel pretty good. Industry dynamics change, we're going to have to change with them. So I don't think that's a new dynamic. It's just a interesting during these periods of time. It will also be interesting as firms who have been dependent on a transaction fees, but especially we're most of the rent earnings or more than all their earnings are interest, but dependent that reaction. So we've certainly benefited from them, but I think we're a little more diversified in that. So we watch, we think through them, but I don't see any short-term call to action, but we're watching closely. ","Devin Ryan","Okay, great color. Thanks, Paul. And just to follow-up on kind of the recruiting strength in the quarter, obviously good to see and heard the commentary around I guess the backlogs. I mean with this pent up demand that just kind of came through in the quarter or was there something else that changed where maybe there's a reacceleration of trying to dig into that a little bit more. And then also you guys have been opening a lot of new offices with some of this expansion and that's led to at least some of the expense growth. And so I'm also just curious at what point you maybe see that slowing and ultimately I think that would be good for operating margin potential, just trying to think about that piece as well. ","Paul Reilly","Yes. So I think in the shorter-term you've got two dynamics, as we grow in open offices that is cost. And leases renew, especially in the big markets right now, may be cyclically at a peak, maybe they continue, but with those renew, that adds cost pressure to it. As we grow in major markets and need more space, that certainly has moved against us, but that comes and goes in the cycle.","So I don't see any relief in that part of the cycle. Again, we believe that the franchise value of recruiting great advisors is key to what we do. So that part I don't see kind of a lot of relief to. We just have to be more efficient at the back office side and that's what we're managing. And a lot of our expense growth, again, if you look at half the expense growth over half was accounting related, I'll call it, between our investments in technology beefing up our compliance supervision and service. I mean I think the expense growth is pretty reasonable given the growth we've had. So we'll continue to monitor that.","Devin Ryan","Got it. In terms of just the recruiting kind of the pretty material acceleration, any other color you could provide there if something else that's happening?","Paul Reilly","Yes. I think that, last year you saw that the recruiting was kind of flattish from the first quarter, which I think if you go back historically, a lot of people stayed for their bonuses and things through the year-end. And we just got used for a couple of years. We just people came anyway, right. So I think that that after you're in and go through bonuses, you generally, it's a more logical time for people to move and the pipeline has been strong. And I'll tell you a lot of people we thought would even join in the fourth quarter just for transitions, timing for their businesses, which is what they should do what's best for their business, moved into the next quarter. So we've \u2013 I can't tell you. What we said in the beginning was that we thought that it would accelerate and we'd have near record, which I think we delivered. ","And I would say the backlog isn't any different whatsoever. It's very, very strong. So I can't cited to anything, I get to push, pull business people don't leave for fun. They are leaving something to join something. And we just have to be that great platform that people want to come to. And if they're unsatisfied where they are, we know we've been the recipient of that. ","Devin Ryan","Got it. Great, thank you very much. ","Paul Reilly","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Bill Katz of Citi.","Brian Wu","Hi, good morning. This is Brian Wu on for Bill Katz. Thank you for taking the question. Can you give a sense of the client cash mix between purchase money market funds versus holding cash since you guys discontinued the money market sweep option? And how has that trended particularly in this declining rate backdrop? ","Paul Reilly","So we haven't reported on with some money market is certainly a lot of the cash movement, but we reported sweeps is cash, cash, pure cash in our system. But a lot of the movement out has been in the money markets and positional money market. ","Brian Wu","Got it. And then it looks like client cash after declining quarter as ticked up in September. You mentioned it stabilize and any update you can provide on client cash trends in October?","Jeff Julien","Only as Paul reported that, we have the fee billings come out at the beginning of each quarter, which causes a hiccup in the down direction and then it generally rebuilds over the course of the quarter to be in a position to accommodate those at fee billing in the next quarter. So that was the same dynamic that we reported last quarter that we saw in July that we obviously we saw it again for the billings in October. And so it's down now versus where it was at the end of the year, because of those billings, which are a little over $800 million now for us as a firm. ","So it's down now because of that. And we \u2013 it'll generally, if it follows history, it'll build back up over the course of the quarter through recruiting and through repositioning in those accounts to be in a position to accommodate the billing next quarter. ","Paul Reilly","Our feeling is that, that we're into a stabilized kind of platform and those money market rates, which tend to come down a little slower, because they buy a securities, it takes away while for them to mature and then invest in the new rates, which are lower rates, as those rates continue to come down, we think that pressure is going to leave as that spread narrows.","Brian Wu","Got it. Thank you for taking my question. ","Paul Reilly","Okay. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Craig Siegenthaler","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. ","Paul Reilly","Craig.","Jeff Julien","Hi Craig.","Craig Siegenthaler","And Jeff, just wanted to congratulate you again for the 30 plus years and wish you the best for the next step. ","Jeff Julien","Thank you, sir. ","Craig Siegenthaler","So I had a follow-up to the first set of questions on recruiting. Have you seen any changes in the composition of the incoming advisers in terms of where they're coming from and their sizes of book of business? And I'm especially looking on a near-term basis where we saw this reacceleration.","Paul Reilly","Yes. Again, I think the reacceleration has been steady through the pipeline is just when they hit. But the \u2013 I would say that the average advisor continues to be higher. We're seeing much larger teams through the pipeline. So it doesn't mean they'll all join us, but the pipeline is very, very strong in the size, very, very big. We just announced the big team that joined us the last quarter. It's almost $6 million. ","And so we are \u2013 we have a number of those teams in the pipeline in $5 million to $10 million range. So hopefully there we'll be able to recruit them and still there's very, very good advisors that are in $0.5 million and they're very profitable and very good with their clients. But so we are looking to recruit across the platform, but we are getting much bigger teams, I think in general right now anyway.","Craig Siegenthaler","Thanks, Paul. And just as my fault here with the RJF stock now well above the average levels of where you've purchased over the last year. I just wanted to see if we get an update on your appetite for buybacks, but also M&A in the future. And can you remind us roughly how much excess capital you currently hold?","Paul Reilly","Well, the excess capital is always a subjective question, but I do think first that, we were going to hold true to our \u2013 we've committed to purchase dilution on a regular basis and opportunistically buy in the market. I don't think that's changed. You would see we kind of raised our threshold given the tax act and our excess liquidity. So we were probably more aggressive than we've done historically. ","So I \u2013 but I think the guidance we've given and still we will buy dilution and then be aggressive when we think there's an opportunity. And on the M&A front, I can tell you. All I can tell you is, we've been very active. It's a very interesting cycle right now. There's a lot more firms talking about maybe doing something, but they seem to be looking at this last year's environment as if it's going to continue for the next 10 years.","And so if you discount interest rates, if you discount, what you think market may be involve ability and all that. The pricing has led to a number of places where those things didn't transact to anybody, not just us. And so we're going to stay very active, very connected and be very discipline. So we are very active in the M&A side. But again, we're not going to do something just to be bigger. It has to make us better, so it has to be strategic. It has to fit our culture. And then we have to be able to have a good return for shareholders. ","So with all of that, I'd say it's been a frustrating years. We've had some very good opportunities that didn't transact anywhere, because the pricing to us. I think the market agreed at least so far that the pricing just wasn't realistic. So but we'll stay active and I think that's the advantage. If there is a downturn and certainly downward interest rates will put pressure, it's been a great tailwind for the whole industry. That's tightening. So it may give us more opportunities, but we're still on it. But I can't tell you again with this type of market when we can do something, but we're very active.","Craig Siegenthaler","Thanks, Paul.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research.","Steven Chubak","Hey, good morning. ","Paul Reilly","Hey Steve.","Steven Chubak","So Jeff, congrats. Enjoy the well-deserved R&R. Paul, I wanted to start off with a question on the industry pricing changes. Appreciate a lot of the commentary you gave and addressing some of the pricing developments on the SMA side at UBS. I was hoping you can quantify your direct exposure that third-party and internal SMAs and how you think this change may impact the fees on this particular product?","Paul Reilly","Again, we have significant assets in our advisory accounts. So it's a both internal management and third-party sub advisors. So again, I think UBS\u2019 announcement isn\u2019t very clear, whether they're just re-bundling, whether advisers are sharing on that or what's going on. So it's hard for me to comment on that. ","If you look overtime, there's always been pressure on those advisory accounts and the fees that we in third-party managers charge. And it's been very competitive. So it would impact us if we lowered these. But we've continually since I've been here, I don't know how many times we've lowered fees in those accounts to be more competitive. And the good news of our scale has grown significantly. So it's been a pressure, but with size has been still a growth area for us.","So again, UBS announcement for us, I have no idea. Again, the impact is how is that change going to be passed to the advisor and client, and that wasn't announced at all. And if it's a re-bundling, it could have no impact. If it's charged the advisor, it has different impact. If they're going to eat it all and the advisor, client and shared as a more significant impact. But I have no idea what that is right now. So I wish I could be more clear, I just don't know. But we are looking at it. And it's just a couple day old announcement.","Steven Chubak","Recognizing we're still waiting additional color on that context is certainly quite helpful. I had a question on some of the developments ahead of the upcoming election. There's been lots of focus on election rich for financials and given some of Warren's momentum. What her agenda can mean for the group recognizing that the legislative hurdles for the DOL could potentially be much lower. I was hoping you could just give some perspective on whether you think it's reasonable for to be repurposed, especially given the implementation of Reg BI and how you're thinking about that potential threat or have you made sufficient changes already to your business model, you're already pretty well prepared.","Paul Reilly","So I'd say there is multiple answers. So first, the DOL will come back. I mean there is a \u2013 we've been told that the Department of Labor is looking for an October type of announcement. If you remember, Reg BI specifically talked about the DOL and our belief is that the \u2013 I have no idea, but our belief is the SEC and the DOL had long talks to make sure that what the SEC proposing with it and for the DOL proposal. And some of BI already signals some of the stuff that you'd have to do with DOL type of account.","So I don't think, and again we may see something in October for proposal and formal regulation in December. I don't think the DOL portion will be big. I think that Reg BI in a lot of ways is harder than the DOL, because the DOLs \u2013 here's what you have to do, here's what you can't do. And it was kind of easy to programs for it. Now I think it was bad for advisors and flexibility. Best interest standard says, hey, make sure you're putting clients first, you disclose everything. And so as you do that, you got a little harder from a judgment standpoint, but I actually think the standards more align. It just gives flexibility to say, yes, you can do this, just make sure it's in the best interest of your client.","And so, certainly, I think all firms will be better positioned if a DOL type of administration came back, we'd all be closer. Because a lot of those elements would have been already kind of programmed in, especially on disclosure, which is hard to argue against best interest, hard to argue with and documenting why you made decisions hard to argue with. The DOL, we're just going tolot of more stop, where it would have been hard to do, much harder to do commission accounts and other things.","So I think the industry would be better off. I think the challenge right now, it's been a little quiet lately as proposed state rules that we take to have a series of state legislations that differed, which is certainly add complexity to the business. Many think in our industry that it's surpassing the states authority to do those kinds of rules.","So my guess is that would go to court too. So the industry certainly who is ever President whether they like financial services companies [indiscernible] could have an impact on regulation. Many of the people in the regulatory seats terms do go for a few years after the next elections. So there'll be pressure, but it'll be harder to do it by appointment. It'll have to go through regulation and my guess is we'll have a divided Congress no matter what.","So who knows, right? But we'll react to it. I can't predict. I certainly think certain candidates, if they're look like they have an opportunity to be the next president would be a lot more disruptive than other ones. But I can't do anything about that. I only have one vote.","Steven Chubak","Fair enough. Although it is a vote in Florida. I could make sure, it gets counted. Just one more for me, Jeff, just to clean up question on the NII geography. Certainly good momentum this quarter. Looks like the beat was in the corporate other catchall segment. I was hoping you can discuss what contributed to some of the strength there. Just trying to gauge the sustainability of that NII momentum.","Jeff Julien","Yes. That kind of jumped off the page with us too. And I'm going to let our Treasurer, who we've asked to look into that, address that since you're going need to get used to hearing his voice in the future anyway. I'll let Paul Shoukry talk to that one.","Paul Shoukry","I think Steve is already sick in my voice. Some of the geography, Steve, is really attributable to rounding when you're dealing with such small numbers from quarter-to-quarter. So the other segment is showed that it was up $9 million sequentially through interest income. More than half of that was attributable to rounding, believe it or not, just when you're dealing with such small numbers. But the remaining portion was due to higher cash balances sequentially. They were up, the parent company around $300 million on average quarter-to-quarter. And we really didn't see the negative impact of the interest rates just given the timing of the cuts. So that will be reflected on those balances next quarter.","Steven Chubak","Very helpful, Paul, and Paul, thanks very much for taking my questions.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Chris Harris of Wells Fargo.","Chris Harris","Thanks guys. So we've seen pay rates on deposits come down quite a bit across the industry in it, your firm as well and you've already highlighted that. Is there a point though, where you might decide, hey, you know what, we need to be a little bit more generous with these pay rates if we want to grow cash balances a little bit more. Or is that not really under consideration at this point?","Paul Reilly","I think we look this way that we think that, obviously, we like funding by cash balances. And again to the extent, that spreads come in, the negative is spreads came in. The positive is that the delta between cash sweep, FBIC insured and the premium that you may give up in the money market will narrow. And we think that will naturally caused people to stay in the FBIC assured. So we think that may grow.","But being led as a firm, the number one thing, you always look at liquidity. We will look into raising higher rates, if we needed liquidity, third party funding in the bank. We're testing \u2013 we tested our CD program and it worked just fine and we're going to test other measures just to make sure the liquidity is there. But that's all at a much higher rate. So that would compress NIM, if we needed it. Right now, we don't. But you don't \u2013 everyone assume you don't.","So one of the things we'd like as having been more conservative in how we funded the bank, that the cash drop has not impacted our operations. Again at point, it would. And just need to make sure that we have that access to third party funds, but it would be at a higher cost. So we are looking at it, I would call it more as a contingency. You may see us raise some money, just to test that. But right now, it isn't a big driver of our cash program in our minds, certainly, not in the short-term.","Chris Harris","Okay, got it. I did want to ask you one question on your margins. And if the last Investor Day, I think you guys talk big picture. Hey, probably be an environment, where margins are generally flattish, revenues growing in line with expenses or expenses \u2013 excuse me, growing in line with revenues. If we \u2013 if the fed cuts again in the December quarter and we have kind of like a formal equity market for your fiscal year 2020. Do you think that outlook is still achievable?","Paul Reilly","I think as we look, Chris, honestly, the more interest rate cuts, certainly that's top line and frankly for the bottom line. We don't pay anything on that, right? So that's going to compress margins and even if revenue grows, it will be compensable revenue. We're paying 65% or 66%, whatever the number is this quarter, next quarter on that. So that the comp ratio will go up, as you go from non-compensable to compensable and margins will come down, because you can't make up a non-comp expenses, you can't make up that difference. The only way you do that is by changing your grid. And that's a major effort, which we have to do, we'll do, if that's the right thing of balance for the business. But it's not a short term fix. So interest rate cuts is going to impact anyone, who's interest rate sensitive.","Chris Harris","Got you. Okay, thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs.","Alex Blostein","Hey. Hi, guys. Good morning. Just one question around expenses, I think Paul, to your point around non-comp growth this year being really impacted by couple of accounting changes and charges. If you backed us out, I guess, you guys would have been in the closer to mid single digit growth in non-comp expenses for fiscal 2019. And understand that you guys are still early in the kind of budgeting process, but assuming it's similar level of \u2013 kind of investment continues. Is that a more reasonable way to think about non-comp expense growth in June 2020? Thanks.","Paul Reilly","I would say, yes, it is something we're going to manage. And I do think, we're not an e-broker. I mean, we will have recruiting expenses. We will have \u2013 you add raises, which you looked at the marketplaces, those 3% this year to our \u2013 you multiply that across our system. You have technology investment, which certainly isn't going down, you've got some embedded growth. I mean, even when you manage all those other expenses, if you're recruiting now, the good way is to make us all look good is to stop recruiting. And a lot of those expenses will go away. But I don't want to hand over the business some day to a successor who has a business that's not viable and growing. So we're going to continue to grow and that will drive expenses.","It's probably last two years. It's probably been 50 basis points. It shouldn't just in a comp ratio just from amortization. So, and the more we recruit, that number will grow over time. And so \u2013 and we plan to continue to recruit. We had a number in 2009, we had our record recruiting year until last year. And this year we beat it. But in downturns, we recruit now, it may not look good on the numbers on the downturn, but it certainly looked good, when I came out of it and drove really a decade of I think great performance. So, yes, it's not going to go away. We're going to manage it as well as we can, but it's not going away.","Jeff Julien","And there to point out, there are a couple of expenses that are really somewhat out of our control, such as now legal reserves can depends what happens with that and regulatory issues and bank loan loss provision being another one. It\u2019s subject to whatever happens in those particular areas. Those are very difficult to budget, although, they've been within a range, they're very difficult to pinpoint anytime over a year or such. Those can go either direction from this year to next.","Paul Reilly","And I'll just say that the CEO there in our control, but there are long-term cyclical impacts. So we make good loans and get good people. We allow a lot less of those. But I think we're in good shape.","Operator","And your last question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell.","Jim Mitchell","Maybe we could just talk a little bit about fee-based asset flows, if I \u2013 not that you disclose them but we can take the stab back in our market impact. If I look at flows this year or 2019, they seem to be down probably about, still solid but down very strong a year ago. Maybe cut the half in terms of the annualized growth. How much \u2013 I'm just trying to unpack that, how much of that has been the slow down and recruiting at the beginning of the year versus a tough equity market versus a slowdown and sort of migration from brokerage to fee based. I mean, I know there's a lot of moving parts there, but maybe you can help us think about the taste of flows. How that trajectory has been and where it could go with accelerating recruiting.","Jeff Julien","Yes. I'll just make a couple of comments on that, Jim. First of all, I think that last year was an abnormal year before they killed the DOL rule. There was a, as you know, as huge movement over to fee-based. And for us that happened for the first nine months of last year in a pretty big way. That has definitely slowed down to some extent. But having said that, we're still recruiting advisors that use our fee-based platforms to a large extent. And we still do see migration from our existing advisors to fee-based just at a slower rate. So that's why you see the growth of fee-based assets outstripping the growth of the market. S&P up one and fee-based assets up three, this most recent quarter, because we continue to see both those dynamics still at play.","Jim Mitchell","Okay. So but you would think last year was a lot of it or a good chunk of it was driven by just sort of that migration.","Jeff Julien","Now, last year and the year before, probably we're both heavily DOL driven.","Jim Mitchell","And we think about the new recruits, it looks like it was more in the employee channel versus the independent contractor channel. Where I guess geographically is that coming from and does that help the margin a little bit, because it's in the employee channel instead of the more fixed margin independent contractor.","Paul Reilly","So the employee channel had a very good last few quarters, where the independent, who's been really leading recruiting the last couple of years, had a little bit of slowdown, but not much. So I would call it, it's \u2013 I think it's episodic. Both channels are recruiting very, very well. And so I think economically we've had a big bull run, so independence look really good.","And if you get a little tougher market environment, the employee channel looks a lot safer. So some advisors just like, they want to work with clients and they don't want to worry about turning on the lights and paying bills and others want to have, feel like they own their business every day. So, although, we tell all the advisors they do.","So I don't think, I wouldn't call it one versus the other. I think they're both robust and their pipelines. And I couldn't explain why the independent has been a little higher and the employees pick up. I do think some of that's big teens, geographically it's all over doing better in the Northeast, pushing harder in the West. We're gaining ground, but we've got a lot of markets in the west. So we think we still have a big opportunity in California as long as we have electricity though around the offices.","So we are \u2013 and then people ask, have large market share in Michigan yet as a strong recruiting market, even though we have great presence. So it feels good all over. But I think we're starting, if you've seen growth, which has impacted expenses. So I'm just seeing a lot more growth from the big cities, where there's still a lot of opportunities. So, I wish I could give you more of a definitive answer that's the color, but I'd say it's too short to say that people switched to an employee of a cycle.","Jim Mitchell","Okay. I guess generator cost in California will have to go up for the Raymond James.","Paul Reilly","Yes.","Jim Mitchell","All right. Thanks for the color. And Jeff, good luck the retirement, hope your golf game improves.","Jeff Julien","Thanks, Jim.","Paul Reilly","Jeff, little quite the off the hook for another year, he's saying we still have a little more time that maybe a little more freedom, but we'll have his services both at the bank and as an advisor and helping Paul through that transition. So want to thank you all for the call. I do think that a lot of people, the recruiting numbers are big numbers, but you look at $300 million in assets and I made production the trailing 12, those $40 plus billion in assets. It's like a Morgan Keegan. I'm in, sorry, Alex Brown acquisition just on organic recruiting.","So we believe that's a great way of growth. We get to pick advisor by advisor and I still think it's the biggest testament to the underlying platform is that, and the fact that they're generally joining us for less checks and sometimes significantly less checks and then get at other places.","So we'll continue to push. I think the fundamentals are great from advisor and platform standpoint, but the fundamentals are very difficult from an interest rate standpoint and the markets will be the markets, especially coming to an election here. So appreciate you joining the call and we'll talk to you soon."],"18188":["Raymond James Financial, Inc.

We are just back recently, a few weeks ago, from our summer development conference which is our RJA Employee Advisor channel. And besides the great group of advisors, there were 700 kids in attendance under the age of 18 years old. So if that\u2019s not a cultural differentiator from other firms. It\u2019s kind of a unique place, unique culture and just great people for training for the advisors and to see families together.","I want to start off with kind of an overview of the quarter. First, I think we had a very solid quarter and that we\u2019re in great shape. And that we are really driven by a number of the key drivers that delivered this quarter and put us in good shape in the future.","First is private client group asset advisors. We reached 6507 advisors, up 123 over the preceding quarter. So that has to be a record recruiting for us in one quarter. We had growth in every advisory channel. And more importantly than great recruiting which we like to see is the retention. We still have fantastic retention and it\u2019s the people that really choose to stay here that make the culture here at Raymond James.","That recruiting and our advisors drove record assets under administration of just rounding to half a trillion dollars and assets under management of $70.2 billion.","Loans at Raymond James Bank were essentially flat at $12.05 billion and so very solid results there.","A quick overview of the financial results is we had record quarterly net revenues of $1.32 billion, up 9% from last year\u2019s quarter and 3% sequentially.","Quarterly net income of $133.2 million is up 9% from last year\u2019s quarter and 17% sequentially. And that quarter is our second best earnings quarter, just off from $3 million from our record. That quarter where we had that record was an incredible investment banking quarter. So I think very solid results from our bottom line which earned us $0.91 per diluted share and we have an annualized ROE of 12%.","Private client group, to get into the segments, had a record net revenue of $892.2 million, up 9% from last year\u2019s quarter and 2% up sequentially.","Quarterly pre-cap\u2019s income of $86.4 million, up 6% over last year\u2019s quarter and 15%sequentially.","And private client group assets under administration at $475.4 billion is up 5% over last year\u2019s quarter. Our assets under fee-based accounts at 39% of total client assets which really results in 75% recurring revenue for this segment.","Our capital markets had a quarterly net revenue of $233 million, flat from last year\u2019s quarter and then on 1% from the sequential quarter. Quarterly pre-tax profits of $18.3 million, were up 35% from last year and 12% from the previous quarter.","And it\u2019s really a tale of two businesses. Fixed income had a very good quarter as commissions were up, partly due to the volatility and we have a great team and a very tough market. ","Public finance had a near record quarter. In fact, if we had not changed allocations in accounting since Morgan Keegan joined us, it would have been a record quarter for them. So very solid performance and very good backlog.","That was off-set by the equity capitals market business with its headwinds and over-the-desk commissions remain challenging this quarter. And also headwinds in our flagship practices of reeks and energy where the market has been tougher in terms of new issues. We\u2019ve also made significant investments primarily in this quarter by adding bankers in our life science, financial services, energy and government services practice. Just to put it in scale, with 80 senior bankers adding a dozen of them, basically most of them in this quarter is a big investment but one where you get great people when you bring them on board.","Asset management, the net revenues were $98.8 million, up 8% from last year and 5% from the preceding quarter. Pre-tax of $31.6 million, was up 1% from last year\u2019s quarter and 1% from the sequentially. And the great results impacted by a successful closed end fund distribution fee cost that impacted the quarter and investment. Very, very good and also highlighted by the acquisition of Kruger. We welcome the Kruger Group and Dr. James Breech and his team, Tyrena James. Because they have a model at delivery program, their assets do not hit our financial assets under management, but a great group of people.","RJ Bank record net revenues of $103.9 million, up 13% from last year\u2019s quarter and 1% sequentially. Pre-tax of $78 million, up 20% from last year\u2019s quarter and 9% sequentially.","Total loans are down slightly, essentially flat. Both credit quality and our net income margins continue to improve, which Jeff will talk on.","So, if you look at all of our business units, they all performed well with the exception of the tough quarter for equity capital markets. But all the drivers are in great shape and I feel good about not only what they did this quarter but where we\u2019re headed. With that I am going to turn it over to Jeff.","Jeff Julien","Thanks Paul. I\u2019m just going to address some of the significant variances from the consensus model.","First of all, I will say they are fewer than normal, which we view as a good thing. Either we had fewer surprises than normal or our covering analysts are getting very good at projections and given the audience, I will lean towards the latter.","With respect to the revenue lines, except for the other revenue, virtually all revenue lines were within low single digits of expectations. And the other line, as many of you have already pointed out in your comments, really relates to the ARS gains that I mentioned at the Analysts Investor Day in May as well as some PG valuation gains that are slightly elevated. A little lower than last quarter but higher than our normal quarters. Aside from that, revenues were all pretty much in line with expectations.","Couple of more items on the expense side. I would characterize this quarter on the expense side generally as one of above average level of investment. A good portion of that was in people. We have seen 123 net FA increase, we\u2019ve talked about that. As well as at least a dozen significant ECM hires here till date, most in the most recent quarter. Coupled with we had higher commission revenues than projected, so that increase has come. And the commission growth in PCG came about two and a half to one in favor of the independent contractor division which elevates the pay-out level somewhat. So all that boils down to a comp ratio of about 68.2% for the quarter, a little above our 68% target. We are at 67.9% year-to-date so we are still running close to target in all these periods but this particular period a little elevated as a lot of these people that we\u2019ve hired are obviously aren\u2019t yet producing the level of revenues that we expect in the future.","Another area of investment would be in IT. Unfortunately that\u2019s not necessarily going to be an immediate revenue generator. Particularly in some of the systems there is a small spike this quarter related to some outsourced regulatory projects. When we have some of these projects that we think need to be done on a fairly timely basis, we don\u2019t necessarily want to add fulltime headcount or we don\u2019t have the bandwidth and sometimes even the expertise perhaps for some of these specialized regulatory projects in-house. So we outsource some of those projects as a couple of a million dollars related to consulting fees for outsourcing some of those projects that hit in this quarter.","On a year-to-date basis though, the data communications expense is running right at $65 million a quarter, which is right on top of where it was running in the prior year. So on year-to-date even that we have told you it is going to be lumpy over the course of the year but on a year-to-date basis it is all very much in line.","Another expense that I guess surprised a lot of people, ourselves included to some extent, is the loan loss provision. Which is really the net of several items. Even though loans were flat for the quarter versus the preceding quarter, the loan mix changed somewhat away from commercial, industrial loans to securities based loans and mortgage loans which carry lower provisions. So that was a net positive to the provision. Another net positive was the recovery that we talked about and you could see it in the press release at the end. The bank had a significant recovery in the quarter, a real estate loan that had been partially charged off. That was a positive and then going in the other direction, we did get the snick examined in the quarter but it was a somewhat non-event. They reviewed 339 of our credits; they differed on nine of them, five of them they rated more harshly, four of them they rated more softly than we did. But as you know, we follow the practice of going with the lesser of the two in terms of ratings.","So it cost us a little under $2 million to the provision for the quarter. And some of those, by the way, were unfunded revolvers. Of the five that they rated more harshly, three of those were unfunded revolvers. However, the 2 that they rated more harshly plus a couple of more other downgrades that we chose to make during the quarter, again I think we do a good job trying to stay ahead of any potential problems, that\u2019s what lead to the increase in criticized loans from the prior quarter which was about the only negatives that I would say are in the bank\u2019s entire two pages of statistics there.","So those downgrades that we chose to make and the snick exam results went the other way but when you net all those things together, it came out to a net benefit of $3 million in the quarter.","And other expense is another investment that we made, the only item of any consequence. There are a lot of little items in that, as you can imagine, other expenses is sort of a catch-all for anything that doesn\u2019t fit other places but we did make some investments in some new products and asset management, where again, we expect to get some future asset management fees from.","The tax rate, we recalculated for the year to date, came to just under 37% which required us to adjust it in this quarter down about a percent or a percent and a half from where we had been running, so, it came in at 36% to get us to the correct year-to-date figure. Again there were a number of items that impacted that but we kind of steered towards 37% or 37.5% for the year so we\u2019re running pretty close to that on a year-to-date basis.","There was a slight jump in basic share count which was unusual in this quarter and that was really a result of some of the Morgan Keegan three year RSU retention board\u2019s vesting in early April. The next and last [pronts] of those will be two years from this quarter when some of the capital markets five year retention awards are left.","All that boils down to a pre-tax margin of 15.8% for the quarter, 15.3% year-to-date, so above our 15% targets. ROE was 12% for the quarter, 11.5% for the year-to-date so we\u2019re running close to target.","A couple of other things that I will mention this real quickly net interest was a record $109.4 million as the bank continues to grow in their net interest margin stays at the level that it has been recently of 3.09%. Cash balances really haven\u2019t increased that much, it\u2019s really been more of the bank generated and some spread to that record.","And lastly for those that didn\u2019t happen to see and I know most of you did and made comments, we did file our stress test results in June which showed pretty strong capital ratios even in stressed conditions which I think most of you weren\u2019t expecting them to show.","So those are my comments on the things that varied on the consensus model. Paul?","Paul Reilly","Thanks Jeff. Before I turn over to questions, just I would like to summarize first. The private client group business from great recruiting and as I talked about before more importantly, the retention, with the asset, record asset levels about to swell and the recruiting momentum is still very solid, I would not expect this number a recorder but our pipeline is really good and people are continuing to still visit the office, so still optimistic about future recruiting.","In capital markets we had a very solid backlog, especially in public finance. The equity capital markets backlog is good, I would say its exceptional public finance right now. And of course, anytime there\u2019s investment banking, the kind of transactions, the timing is always suspect to when the transactions happen that I feel good about where we\u2019re sitting at right now.","Also, record assets under management I think will bode well for our asset management group and the bank is taking great shape and should continue to grow. We add loans or we have opportunities that need our credit quality, which we\u2019re very strict on and in quarters where we don\u2019t fine them or we have pay-offs, you don\u2019t see growths like this quarter, but we\u2019re very, very comfortable where the bank sits.","The last line I am sure will come up for comment from the department of labor because there\u2019s so much press on it. I would say there is nothing new to report outside of that the department of labor has openly stated in the last week that they are open to discussion and interpretation. I think there\u2019s been a lot of political and even regulatory other agencies pressures saying the rule need to be modified. We will see what happens so the comment period is just closing, there will be some testimony and hopefully we will be in a place where there is a modification where we are all very comfortable. Which, while I think it is good intent, but as published is not a very good way of achieving the results especially since it would cut off access to advice to a lot of customers.","So with that I will go ahead and turn it back to Maria to open up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Christian Bolu of Credit Suisse.","Christian Bolu","Good morning Paul, good morning Jeff. Firstly on the fixed income business, the strength there was a clear positive and nicely outpaced what we have seen at the big banks. You\u2019ve always said you have an 18 play in the B markets, how would you describe the current environment? Is it a C, D, A market and how sustainable is it?","Paul Reilly","I think for the core you probably have a D market. There is enough volatility that people are doing things. And our platforms are different from the big banks with our bank distribution channel and merely an origination business with public finance. But this market will certainly improve in terms of the volatility expectation and commission lines to start. It\u2019s gone up for a while and continues to stay up. The trading profits have been about the same but it\u2019s really been driven by increased commission volume and our guys have stayed close to the clients and I think when the opportunity came we got our fair share of more of the business. They are doing a good job and I am proud of what they have accomplished.","Christian Bolu","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And just on the DOL proposal, I heard your comments earlier but I just want to dig into two things you noted in your comment letter that you filed up just about a week ago. One was just the cost of compliance and two was the impact of some product exclusions. So my questions are can you help us size or give us your framework on how you are thinking about compliance costs and then two is, what is the revenue contribution of things like options, structured notes and hedge funds to your business today? Thank you.","Paul Reilly","First, on the ladder they are not a significant part of our product sweep for clients. So, there\u2019s some high network clients and these only affect the IRA accounts, where typically those are where products aren\u2019t in but they are in some. It\u2019s hard to estimate the impact, especially when you have a rule that\u2019s not really written. Even if it passed as it is, the prohibited transaction exemption would have to be written, and how it was written. The problem is if you read the rule and base value, the disclosure and the estimating that you would have to do on every single product and how you disclose it would take time from an IT\u2019s perspective can be very costly. We think there\u2019s much more cost effective ways of displaying those types of ","fees, which we already do in general terms and we can get a lot more granular, our clients see them but what they are asking for is so \u2013 you\u2019d have to be so precise you would be inaccurate on how these costs and fees were allocated. So that is the costly part and we have no idea until the final regulation as to what that cost would be or frankly if we could even afford to service some of the accounts \u2013 the smaller accounts \u2013 where we don\u2019t really make money. If we want to service the accounts, it might make them too costly, too risky to actually service and that is our concern with the rule as its written.","Christian Bolu","Okay. Thank you, that\u2019s helpful. And then lastly from me, clearly the new advisor momentum is very strong, help us think about the economic distribution of these advisors coming on board. Is the productivity level of the new guys you bringing on board about the same or higher than the current average? How long does it take these advisors to ramp up to full productivity and are there any additional costs we should be keeping in mind as the advisors ramp up?","Paul Reilly","Yes, I think that in general they are slightly more productive. We currently have some huge teams that are very productive. In terms of extra costs outside of A caps to bring accounts in, there\u2019s not really a bunch of extra costs. There\u2019s certainly transition or it depends where it is. If it\u2019s an independent advisor we certainly don\u2019t have the real-estate costs. If it\u2019s an employee, it depends if we are opening a new office or adding him to an office where, frankly, there\u2019s even more of uplift if there is an existing office because we are leveraging existing costs and real-estate. So there\u2019s not an unusual transition, and then the advisors bring over their assets in about a year, it takes them a few months and they get a lot of their assets and then they trickle in over the next year. Usually by two years they have got more assets than they had when they joined us so what you see in the recruiting pipeline is just really starting to impact the results because if they bring assets over as they move their clients here, we get the growth. So there is even a lag effect.","Christian Bolu","That\u2019s great and then comments on the strong business momentum.","Paul Reilly","We have got great momentum; I don\u2019t know what to say. I tell our people that we are \u2013 I think the culture that\u2019s been dealt here by Tom and team for many years now that\u2019s paying off. We\u2019re in the right place at the right time where we have the technology and the products to support all advisors and the very high end advisors that are joining us and we have the culture that they like. We are client-centric and our job is to help service and help the advisor. And we are very balanced in our approach on what\u2019s fair to clients, what\u2019s fair to the advisor and what\u2019s fair to us and so, again, our existing advisors who have been here a long time are the ones who help us grow that culture and help us to attract new advisors to do, hopefully, the same. So we are at the right place and at the right time in this market and the momentum is very, very good right now.","Christian Bolu","I hear you; I was just congratulating you on that. Thanks guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Hugh Miller of Macquarie.","Hugh Miller","Hi, good morning. I appreciate the color on the snick review. I had a couple of other questions about the bank, one of which is that it looks like we\u2019ve seen some softer economic conditions in Canada, can you just remind us the types of loans you\u2019re tending to extend there and some detail on the comparison on the yields relative to the U.S. loans and what demand is looking like up in Canada for loans?","Steven Raney","Hi Hugh, it\u2019s Steve Raney, good morning. Related to Canada, I would say the profiles of the deals up there look very similar to the deals in the U.S., with a couple of exceptions. I would say the structure of the C&I, the corporate loans up there probably have a little bit \u2013 we don\u2019t see as many coveted light transactions, the banks tend to be more rigorous in terms of the structure, in terms of the governance. Typically a little bit lower leverage and actually slightly higher margins. I would say that the real-estate transactions that we do up there are identical. About to retain and individual project finance business up there, I would say for the first six months of our fiscal year things were a little bit slow up there. As you mentioned, things have gotten a little bit soft but we have actually seen a pick up here. Recently our pipeline of deals in Canada has actually picked up over the last 60 days or so. And once again, I think it\u2019s a good counter-balance for us to have an opportunity to play in that market now is a good counter-balance to everything else that we are involved in at the bank. So we are very committed to Canada and think that that\u2019s a good long term business for us to be in.","Hugh Miller","Very helpful color. And you guys obviously mentioned in the press release that C&I lending was a bit softer relative to some of the security based and other loans, you mentioned about the pipeline for Canada which was looking like it was picking up a bit. Can you just talk about it in general the C&I loan pipeline and how that\u2019s trending recently?","Jeff Julien","Yes, Hugh. I would say some of the reduction was kind of self-imposed. We did see a higher run off rate this last quarter. When I say self-imposed, there were deals that were re-pricing that we elected to exit. We just didn\u2019t think the risk returns paid off was appropriate, the lower rates. We\u2019ve actually seen an increase in our pipeline in our C&I domestic business as well here recently over the last 30 days or so. We will continue to stay active here in this space that we play in. That is not [Indiscernible] on that higher end leverage document, particularly we don\u2019t want to go down that path to the extent that the market comes back to us, we will take advantage of those opportunities. We are pretty active in the secondary market. When we see higher rated credits and better credits that the price comes down around par or maybe a little bit less, we take advantage of adding the positions on a selective basis as well. So we can be pretty nimble in that way.","Steven Raney","I would just say that relative to the pipeline that we have got in place today, even though we can never predict pay offs very accurately, I would anticipate a couple percentage point increase in the overall loan portfolio, perhaps for the next quarter. It is dependent on a lot of things.","Hugh Miller","Okay, that\u2019s very helpful, thank you. And Paul, I guess you mentioned that the public finance backlog you guys get and categorize as exceptional, I was wondering if the feeling was that it is some opportunistic borrowing ahead of retailing higher or is it more a function of the economy might be getting stronger. Maybe municipalities are looking at doing more borrowing. Any thoughts there?","Paul Reilly","Probably a little of both, there\u2019s no doubt that any municipality has borrowing needs but the question is how? Is it going to pick up a lot of borrowing with the banks for a while just because it was quicker and cheaper to execute and we do some [Indiscernible] credits that we like and clients will do some lending. But there\u2019s just the pickup, I think, across the board right now. So I think that maybe it\u2019s in anticipation of rates. I\u2019d certainly, if I was looking at long term financing, would look at to do something in this market. So I think that is driving part of it.","Hugh Miller","Okay and obviously you guys had an exceptionally strong recruiting quarter, you did mention in the press release that you think very aggressive competition and we have been certainly been hearing about that as well. But I was wondering if you could give some comments about how that competition has changed over the last three to six months and whether or not you guys are still sticking with your upfront recruiting packages, have those changed at all and \u2013 that would be great.","Paul Reilly","With our comment we\u2019ve had aggressive competition for a long time so this isn\u2019t a new phenomenon. The last few years I would categorize that in the market. We have stuck to our packages; we have made no changes over the last year. We are very focused on making sure it\u2019s a good economic deal for us and we are well aware we are lower in the stream but in a way it\u2019s a positive self-selection criteria that people are not coming for the biggest check, they are coming here because they want to be here. And it doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t lose some teams we\u2019d like to have, because some of those checks are awfully big but the people that like the culture and want to be prosperous over the long term ends up taking the deal and coming. So we haven\u2019t made changes to that. I would say it\u2019s a combination of technology and products that were able to serve. A high or even just an acknowledgement when you start landing a lot of these large teams. It\u2019s a signal to the other people in the market to come in and ask why did they come, what is Raymond James doing? So then certainly the recruiting momentum builds on it. So often it\u2019s helping to tell our story.","Hugh Miller","Great color, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan of JMP Securities.","Devin Ryan","Hey guys, good morning everyone. At the recent investor day you spoke to looking at expanding the advisory business in the UK, potentially through acquisitions or something that would look like maybe Lane Berry in the U.S. So just curious about an update on this front. Are you still having dialogue there and thoughts around your growing advisory in the UK?","Paul Reilly","We want to grow an advisory in the UK; we haven\u2019t found anything that meets our culture first, price and immigration criteria. We\u2019ve found some cultural bits but not anything that we believe is attractive so we stay close like we do to firms here that we think fit Raymond James, will be a great home for us but we\u2019re just not willing to do things that are priced, that we think isn\u2019t a good return for shareholders. I am sure short term the results look good but we treat the money like it\u2019s our money and we are shareholders. But we haven\u2019t found that opportunity so we haven\u2019t done anything. We still have been perusing some M&A firm opportunity in the UK and Europe and it continues to be one of our strategic initiatives to grow our cross border M&A business. So that stays on our radar and we\u2019re actively talking to a lot of firms but we\u2019re just slow in doing something. This isn\u2019t about a short term hit. It\u2019s got a long term addition to the team that will help us to continue to grow the business. So we\u2019ll continue to be aggressive in looking but very deliberate on executing.","Devin Ryan","Okay, thanks for the update. And then maybe a bigger picture on capital deployment. All the ratios continue to build during the quarter and obviously you\u2019re looking at acquisitions so I understand that maybe there\u2019s some level that\u2019s pegged for that. And then you also believe in a strong liquidity position, just for financial visors, but is there any more discussion or contemplation around maybe moving some of the off balance sheet customers cash into the bank, increase earnings. I know I have asked this before but I am trying to think about other ways to drive some equal amount of returns with a doting capital position.","Paul Reilly","No, we look at all sorts of things. There\u2019s no doubt that we could put cash in the bank and grow it off its capital base. We could take \u2013 we don\u2019t really go out on securities and we could take security positions that are longer. To get income we could do that in the holding company or in the bank. There are lots of things we could do. We could not hedge a lot of our rate risk. Which we do, which costs us money. We\u2019re just not going to take those risks. We tell our clients not to take a lot of rate risks; we just don\u2019t do it here at Raymond James either. So yes, there are lots we could do and we would look good for a while and we could cross our fingers and hope we look good long term but we\u2019re more focused on the long term execution and then not taking those kind of risks. I am not saying they\u2019re bad risks, there are people that do them, but it\u2019s not in our nature. What you see is what you get here. We also know you can grow the bank. It\u2019s frustrating as we try to hit double digits to be just under double digits. So we know we can do it, the banks will grow but we\u2019re sticking to our discipline on loans and we are sticking to our discipline on capital allocation for the bank.","I remind people that our executive team that half of their restricted stock, which is taken out of their bonuses every year, is tied ROE and so we\u2019re as focused on ROE as you are but we\u2019re more focused on that long term return. We watch capitals discussed at every board meeting, we have recognized that we do have some excess capital balances and so we\u2019re not dismissing it and I am sure we will be discussing it in the November board meeting but there\u2019s really no update on it.","Jeff Julien","And with respect to liquidity, I would just remind you that we do have a $250 million note issue that matures in April of \u201916 and then a year after that in March of \u201917 we have got the ability to call our 6.9%, $350 million debt issue out there. So those are on the horizon as potential uses of liquidity.","Devin Ryan","Okay, appreciate all that color. And then just maybe lastly for me for Steve, with respect to the net interest margin, should we maybe think there was some upward pressure heading out of the quarter, just try to think about it as a go forward on the NAM, with all the moving parts there. And then, there\u2019s a little bit of a pickup in the size of the loans. I was just curious if there was any specific sector that drove that or what was behind that?","Steven Raney","Hi Devin, good morning. I would say yes there is pressure on NAM; we\u2019re trying to be disciplined. As I mentioned, in terms of the new loans that we\u2019re adding on, I think that there\u2019s likelihood that we\u2019ll see some nominal, small reduction in that interest margin over the next couple of quarters but nothing too meaningful. I would say on the criticize loan front Jeff alluded to, there was no real sector. There were three loans, two of which were part of the downgrades in the shared national credit exam process. One other term loan that we downgraded ourselves during the quarter ending to criticize status, none of that was in any one industry. It was all over the board. There was a consumer products company; there was a data centre, so it was kind of all over the board.","Paul Reilly","And again, I think our credit metrics are really strong. You can look at the absolutes of the movements which I call rounding. You move alone into the category and have material presented impact because the number is not that big to start with.","Steven Raney","We were very encouraged by our non-performing assets coming down. As Jeff mentioned before, we had a large real estate loan that we had actually partially written down that we actually got a full recovery on during the quarter of full pay off that was a material improvement. So we feel good about our asset quality still.","Devin Ryan","Thanks and I appreciate you guys taking the questions. I\u2019ll talk to you guys soon.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell of Buckingham Research.","Jim Mitchell","Hey good morning guys. Just I wanted to maybe talk a little bit about expenses. The comp. ratio, if you exclude option and security gains, which I wouldn\u2019t think we\u2019d pay our comp on and I would think the comp ratio and private equity is also get lighted and what it is in the rest of the organization, it seems like you are close to the 69% comp ratio which would be one of your highest ratios in a few years. So I am just trying to get a sense, obviously it\u2019s a great recruiting quarter. And if recruiting continues at this pace, can you get that back to your target of 68 or should we expect some elevated comp ratios for a little while, until the growth kind of offsets it?","Paul Reilly","I don\u2019t see a fundamental change. I mean in this quarter, to the extent that we get heavy recruiting in the independent channel it\u2019s going to drive that ratio. We certainly had elevated comp ratios in the equity capital markets because of the hiring and probably little bit of underperformance in terms of growth and revenue and challenge over the debt commission. So I don\u2019t \u2013 ","Jeff Julien","Hopefully we\u2019ll see a continued drive from PCG recruiting to where we\u2019d like to keep recruiting at a high level even if it\u2019s a drag on current earnings it certainly strengthens the platform for the next leg of the market. That happened even in \u201909 when we were making significant investment in people in that market environment. I hope that continues to write it as a current drag on earnings. I doubt we\u2019ll see this level of hiring in equity capital markets recur. So that one is a matter of waiting for the people that we have hired to be productive.","Paul Reilly","The irony is when you grow organically, whether it\u2019s private clients or capital markets, it has a short term drag. With your acquisitions you may have some costs in a quarter but the drag comes off and it\u2019s the same with the bank. If you do a loan portfolio, we have the provision expense. So we do have some short term hits when we have high growth in one of the segments and I think that\u2019s most of the impact you\u2019re seeing this quarter.","Jim Mitchell","No, absolutely. Okay I appreciate the color and just maybe on the non-comp side, forgive me if I\u2019ve missed this but I think last quarter that we talked about, communication and info processing was elevated as we accelerated some advertising. It was up even more this quarter. I think you highlighted some regulatory spending but I think you were sort of assuming longer term, closer to 60 and lower to mid 60s versus upper 60\u2019s. Is that still a good run rate going forward or should is that going to remain elevated?","Paul Reilly","I think that current run rate is probably about right for the year-to-date, probably maybe the mid 60s. By the way, the advertising and all was in business development expenses.","Jim Mitchell","I am sorry.","Jeff Julien","The [Indiscernible] for the three quarters will remain at $65 million where I think we\u2019ve been guiding the quarterly run rate. This one is a little higher but we think that run rate is a reasonable run rate.","Jim Mitchell","Okay, thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joel Jeffrey of KBW.","Joel Jeffrey","Good morning guys. I apologize if I missed this earlier but I really wanted to follow-up one question on the comp expense. Jeff, did you say earlier that the commission revenue was primarily driven by independent contractor activity and that drove a chip in the comp mix?","Jeff Julien","The increase in the quarter in the PCG commissions was about 2.5 to 1, that11 point something versus 4 something \u2013 [Indiscernible] something in the contractor versus in the four something in the employee division which obviously prized higher comp associated with it. They got about an 80% payout versus 50% type payout in the employee\u2019s channel.","Joel Jeffrey","I mean is this something that could continue and be a bit of headwind on comp versus [Indiscernible] more one time.","Steven Raney","Yes, we had pretty good recruiting results and it may in the short run but in the longer term it will become productive. My guess is it will be about where it is because they are both recruiting at about the same rate right now. So this particular quarter just had an abnormal imbalance.","Jeff Julien","I hope we continue the recruiting rate at the cost of that quarter. I don\u2019t think what we accomplished was an anomaly in terms of recruiting but we had a lot of people come in one quarter.","Joel Jeffrey","Great, thanks for answering my questions.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Chris Harris of Wells Fargo.","Chris Harris","Hey guys, a quick question on Department of Labor. I believe you guys and many; many others in the industry are fairly supportive of a uniform fiduciary standard as opposed to sort of the bifurcated approach we\u2019ve got now with the DOL on one side and the SEC on the other. I get it that having the uniform standard would really solve the inter-agency regulatory conflicts and reduce complexity. But I am also just wondering if you did have something like that would it not really force the majority of your customers in the industry into the fee model as opposed to the commission. And so just trying to square those two. Obviously advantages on one hand but on the other it might be disruptive if uniform fiduciary ends up dragging a lot more people under the fee model.","Paul Reilly","I don\u2019t think. First, we have always been \u2013 I think our industry is we have always been looks in the best interest of the clients. So whether you all the client\u2019s best interests standard or fiduciary model whatever. Our job is to do good work for the client\u2019s period. Being held to that standard is nothing. We think we have held to it now. And whether its commission or fee based, depends. So if someone wants to buy an Apple stock or some Wal-Mart stock for and leave it with there for five years, why should they be charged an offset management fee? And so they can go fee based. Why should they pay every year for five years? And then they belong \u2013 long term hold assets. So commission certainly has its place in compensation. I think what\u2019s more important is the client\u2019s interest. But first and it\u2019s fully disclosed how they are being paid and why they are doing things. So I think this over simplification; that \u2018Feel good\u2019 and commission is sad. We went to amide off incident and he was fee based. So yes, over simplification of what\u2019s in the best interest of the client. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re fighting, we\u2019re fighting for the client\u2019s choice. Frankly, for economics commission is good for a lot of accounts and yes, it could be abused, so can C be abused. You need to have good advisors looking after their client.","Chris Harris","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","I\u2019m showing no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.","Paul Reilly","Great guys, I know lots of earnings coming out last week and this week but thanks for your thoughtful questions and you\u2019re following us. I hope we could answer all your questions I just characterized. I feel very good about the quarter, especially when you look at the key driver of assets, the advisors and the investments we\u2019re making. I know sometimes quarter to quarter is choppy and that you have to look at sequential quarters but if you look at the year as a whole I think we\u2019re right on an extent and if you look at what\u2019s driving us forward, given any reasonable market going forward, I think we\u2019re in great shape. So, thanks for joining the call and we\u2019ll talk to you soon.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s quarterly call.

I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Paul Reilly, Chief Executive Officer.","Paul Reilly","Thank you, Judy, and good morning everyone. And most things seem sunny here today as we report our quarterly net revenues of $1.2 billion, a record pre-tax of $179 million, net income for the quarter of $116.6 million or $0.81 per diluted share. This marks our 104th consecutive quarter of profitability, a record we're proud of, especially in our industry.","We believe we had a strong start to the fiscal year this fiscal year '14. Now if you just look at the stats from quarter-to-quarter and net revenues up 5% for the preceding quarter, pre-tax income up 10%, client assets under administration up 5%, you\u2019d think we just take a victory lap and just say what a great quarter it was, and it was a very good quarter. But there was a also a number of favorable items that all just happened to hit this quarter that made a strong quarter look, from an ongoing operating basis, maybe a little stronger than it really was.","We did earn these one-time fees, but we can't expect them to recur every quarter. So we'll spend some time on the call giving color on those. ","Overall, the Private Client Group and Asset Management had very good quarters. I'll characterize the Equity Capital Markets Group having a good quarter. The Bank, as usual, performed solid, which I would call an okay quarter. And we still had headwinds in public finance and fixed income due to a challenging market, especially in the institutional commission area, but bolstered by strong trading profits.","We also had a very good Other quarter. And so we're going to talk about some of those items. Those items made our margin 15% and our comp ratio of 68% look a little better than they probably are on a pure operating basis, and we'll talk about that. As we told you, we're committed to reach those goals from an operating basis on a sustainable basis by the end of the fourth quarter this year, and we're still committed to that.","Overall in this segment, Private Client Group was pretty much good news all around, revenue up 5% sequentially over last quarter, pre-tax up an 11%. We saw an improvement in margins, but probably more importantly for the business as we look forward we had record Private Client Group assets under administration of $423 billion, up 5%. Our advisor productivity continued to rise and really strong recruiting pipeline in the Private Client Group. So all told, we think we have good momentum in that segment.","Under Asset Management, we had record net revenue of $96 million, which is up 19% over the last quarter and a record pre-tax of $31.8 million. Our assets under discretionary management were up 8%. So those results were both affected by the market appreciation, but also strong net inflows of assets into our Asset Management Group. However, as we talked about in the release, we had a $9.8 million performance management fee, of which half really impacts our bottom line. And it's not that we don't earn those, we just don't earn them every quarter, and this one was of greater magnitude than probably at this time last year.","The Bank had very good loan growth, almost $500 million in net loan growth for the quarter. Our criticized loans decreased. On the positive, the loan loss provision was muted for the quarter due to a combination of a number of factors. We had some loan pay-offs of criticized loans. We sold some loans that we got [hard for] [ph] that had some reserves. We didn't like the credit quality as much. And we had improved credit metrics. So despite the loan growth, the loan provision was down from a normal rate. The loan growth will help offset the interest compression, which we're still experiencing at the Bank.","On the Capital Markets side, ECM had a good month, off the record of the last quarter and certainly off the record of the M&A quarter a year ago, but very, very solid results really from good financing markets and also we talked about the commission that we had our Analysts\u2019 Best Picks sales, which actually drove commissions for the quarter. ","The fixed income markets remain challenging. We had a rough quarter for institutional commissions and public finance deals, which I think the industry had. We see that market still challenged, but with strong trading profits both from a good retail activity and we stayed in the market, I think, as people have lowered inventories and have de-leveraged we've been in the markets and continue to generate good trading profits despite lower commission levels.","We talked about Other, which had a very good quarter, had some of the cautions. On our private equity side, we had $10 million of gains. $6 million were non-consolidated, $5.5 million gain on the sale of our Jefferson County Sewers auction rate securities. Again, both of those are earned, but lumpier in this quarter. And also our tax rate was down. Our tax rate due to some refunds due and a change in our state filing position in the state and as the markets go up, we get the COLI benefit. And we're looking forward that the tax rate we think is closer to 37% target tax rate, given a good market. But this quarter, it was lower than that. So that added to the earnings for the quarter.","So all in all a good start to the fiscal year. We're very pleased with our positioning. I'm going to turn this over to Jeff and talk a little about, after Jeff speaks, kind of the outlook and the segments in this quarter. Jeff?","Jeff Julien","Thanks, Paul. I have a very similar outlook on how the quarter went. We're very pleased in general with the start to the year. We had some very big positives to take away from this quarter. The asset levels, both under administration and management, certainly give us a good headwind or a good tailwind into the next quarter. And equally important in the release, as Paul mentioned that fee-based assets surpassed $150 billion which is obviously a big driver of our ongoing securities, commissions and fees.","Paul mentioned the Bank loan growth, that's faster than I know we had forecast in the last call or two. Production did pick up a little bit, but pay-offs lowered a little bit as well. So a combination of those two factors are giving us a good start there. You would expect with that kind of loan growth a little larger provision I know. But again, given some of the pay-offs and upgrades of some of the previously criticized assets, we continue to experience low provision expense.","The recruiting pipelines and other positive takeaway and Paul mentioned that probably again as we look into the coming quarters, it's as active as it's been in some time. And then I think the overall expense control, particularly in IT, based on what we know today, we think that this level of IT expenditure, this low $60 million type number for the quarter is about a run rate. Obviously if any regulatory requirements change or some competitive pressures, et cetera, that could change. But based on what we know today, that's probably a pretty good run rate.","But this quarter wasn't without a couple of negatives. The fixed income markets still aren't cooperating. On the commission front, we've managed to continue to realize pretty good trading profits. We're not sure if that's going to be sustainable over the rest of the year or not, but so far so good on that front. And then the other negative I guess in the interest of fair disclosure is the tightening spreads, both in the Bank and in our overall earnings on client cash balances around the firm largely to Bank suite program as those contracts continue to burn off from prior years and get renewed at lower rates.","Paul mentioned the comp ratio of 68%. That's actually still a good target for the year I think for us. We had a very good quarter this quarter and some of these what you would call some of the unusual items that kicked in the revenues that caused the ratio to look a little lower than otherwise have been this quarter. But that's still, I think, a good target for us for the year if we can keep it at the 68% level, down nicely from where we were last fiscal year.","If you look at the margins in our businesses, in your Private Client Group, we talked about having a 9% target for the year. Well, they exceeded that obviously in the first quarter, 9.2%. Some of that was due to nice revenue growth, which should continue given the equity market lift going into this next quarter, but also the expense control side, like I mentioned, which largely falls into the Private Client Group segment in our public reporting.","Capital Markets had a 13.8% margin for the quarter, which is not bad, given the fixed income environment. So Equity Capital Markets is doing okay. I probably wouldn't describe it as hitting home runs, but they're keeping busy and have a reasonable amount of business. Asset management had a 33.2% margin. So that performance fee that we've mentioned, about half of which is ours on bottom line have a pre-tax line helped them surpass the 30% margin target for the quarter. So we had these things.","And then the other Paul mentioned, the auction rate securities will get $5.5 million gain from that. And we had some private equity help, which we had almost every quarter, but this one may be a little larger than our average, excluding the (inaudible) transaction last year. But we've had some of that pretty much on a recurring basis. And with those things all rolled together helped the company to achieve its 15% target for the year. These are still our targets for the year. I mean we're not saying, okay, we've already hit the 15%, so let's change it to 15.5%. I mean we still think that the 68% comp ratio and the margin targets we gave you for each business and the 15% for the overall firm are still where we'd like to be on a run rate basis at the end of the fiscal year.","Our tax rate in terms of bottom line obviously was a help. Paul gave you the right guidance. I think 37% is kind of what we would counsel you to use in modeling going forward for this year. If the market stays high, we'll continue to benefit from the non-taxable gains in our corporate-owned license portfolio however and then obviously the other way in our market correction.","I think that covers most of the big picture comments. We did do a comparison to sort of the analyst models to see where we were way off-base relative to the average of the model. And actually we're pretty close on a lot of them and they're all very explainable, which we've already talked about. The performance fee caused us to be over in investment advisory fees. Trading profits were better than most we're anticipating. In the other income, we had the private equity gain and the ARS redemption proceeds. So those kind of where the differentiating factors on the revenue side.","The one that stands out a little bit is the account and service fees that actually declined slightly from last quarter. There's really a couple of reasons. One is I would say September was abnormally high as we did some catch-up entries in that quarter that we didn't really elaborate on it and seen that material at the time related to some of the Morgan Keegan accounts that we brought over. So we're comparing to sort of an abnormally high. And the other part of that is I mentioned the compressing spread on client cash balances in our Bank suite program. Remember that's a fee income to us, not interest earnings to us from these outside banks. And that did compress several basis points this quarter to last, while the balance has stayed relatively flat. So that actually caused a slight decline as well.","On the expense side, there were only a couple of items that were significantly off. Obviously the bank loan loss provision, which continues to come in at lower levels than would be normally indicated by the loan growth. And other expense was up a little higher. There's a couple of things. We had a little more legal expense. That wasn't a big driver. The bigger driver is we're doing a better job now of estimating and spreading across the four quarters of the year some of the valuation adjustments that happen annually in the tax credit funds that we consolidate into our books.","We usually we've had a spike in the March quarter related to that, but we can sort of estimate them pretty well. So there is no reason for us to have that spike. We can make that ratable throughout the year, and I will also remind you that virtually all of that comes out to non-controlling interests. So it's not really our item to the pre-tax line, but it does distort the other expense line item.","The one other thing I'll mention is for those who looked at the balance sheet saw our assets decline by almost about $1.3 billion from last quarter to this quarter. The real reason for that is at the end of December, we undertook a project to move about $1.75 billion of client cash balances out of what we call our client interest program on our own balance sheet into the Bank suite program. We hadn't been able to do that earlier, because we were up against capacity constraints in the Bank suite program. But we had some new banks join and some existing banks agreed to take larger deposits. So now we are able to accommodate clients' wishes for FDIC insurance and move another group of accounts off of our balance sheet into this Bank suite program.","So you saw us come out of the brokerage client deposits on the liability side and generally out of the segregated assets or the reserve account on the asset side. So that plus the bank loan growth were really the two big shifts in the balance sheet from last quarter to this quarter.","Paul Reilly","Thanks, Jeff. Just in terms of little bit of our view of the outlook, Private Client Group certainly, with their assets up 5%, should start off the quarter with some tailwinds and the same with Asset Management with a 9% increase in those assets were the new record of almost $450 billion of assets under administration and $60 billion of assets under management. However we don't expect our performance fees that usually come at the end of the year to be next quarter. So as you look at Asset Management, you can adjust those expectations.","The Bank loan growth was good. We never know on pay-offs to decline. I think we give you direction if something else happens in that quarter. But overall, this is a very competitive market, but we've been able to grow loans. But there is a pressure on spreads. It will continue. And I'll talk about interest rates a little bit more.","The provision has been low, but it won't remain low forever if we grow loans. So we've had again improving credit quality that's reduced the provision. But at some point, that provision as we grow loans is going to have to come up to match loan growth. The good news is credit quality continues to improve.","On the Capital Markets side, the Equity Capital Markets, the overall market volumes remain challenged. We've done well. We've had a good lift this quarter by the Analysts' Best Picks. The financing markets appear positive and deals should still get done as long as the markets are good. M&A backlog looks good for us. I would call it strong, although traditionally, January and the first quarter are generally weaker in M&A markets, because a lot of deals get done by year-end. But as long as the markets stay good, I think the Equity Capital Markets outlook remains positive.","Fixed income is just challenged with low short-term rates and the expectation of long rates to increase is just leaving a lot of investors on the sidelines watching. And those commission levels still remain challenged and I think will for some time. The offset has been very good trading profits. But if rates start to rise and if commissions don't improve, volumes, it will be hard to maintain those kind of trading profits in that environment. So we stay very, very cautious.","Public finance issuance was down last quarter. We got a raise in the top 10 public finance issuers as the whole market was down. We expect it to improve. But when governments, which we think have the need to finance, start financing, we don't know. So we're cautious in the short term, but more positive in the medium to long term.","So interest rates will rise, I think, and the question is when. We're well positioned to benefit from them, but until they do, especially with all the cash in the market, I think that spreads will continue to be challenging. We thought we had some relief from them last quarter. They look like they're getting to hurt again. And again, rates will rise some day as our position, we don't when. So in this environment, spreads will continue to be challenging.","Cost discipline is very good. We talked about that through the whole Morgan Keegan integration, and you could see them show up in numbers last quarter and this quarter. And we are committed to managing that and you can see it in the run rate.","So overall, we think the markets look constructive. There could be a correction in the Equity Capital Markets, but we believe the economy is in reasonable shape and expect constructive market, but again cautious given the reasons we talked about there. Overall, we feel great about our position. I think the integration is behind us. It's great to see we are acting as one team and we are operating as one team within a greater leadership. Our position is good. We feel great about our people and our firm overall.","So with that, I'll turn it back to Judy and we'll take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Steven Chubak from Nomura.","Steven Chubak - Nomura","On the last earnings call, you noted that revenues at the Bank had recovered to $90 million level, as items were, I'm using your words, abnormally penalized in the past including SBA loan mark-downs as well as FX movements had reversed. This quarter, Bank NII was flattish and total revenues at the Bank came down $7 million. And I was hoping if you could clarify what drove the revenue decline this quarter.","Steve Raney","Steven, this is Steve Raney. There're some things in other income that in effect really went against us in the December quarter relative to the September quarter. It was a rather significant loan fee that was recognized in the September quarter, resulting from a loan pay-off in the Canadian portfolio that we bought a couple of years ago.","The SBA loans that you referenced, the lower cost of market adjustment, there was a big positive back in the September quarter. We didn't see a similar improvement in that mark in the December quarter. That was about $1.4 million difference quarter-over-quarter. The foreign exchange impact and the strengthening U.S. dollar relative to Canada had about $3 million impact. We've already talked about the provision expense. There was about $3.5 million change quarter-over-quarter. Our Bank and life insurance had a $0.5 million difference quarter-over-quarter.","So all those things combined resulted in the other income line being dramatically lower than the September quarter. So our core business remained very stable. As we had already mentioned, the net interest income, the small decrease in net interest margin was offset by higher average earning assets. But our loans on an average basis were up about $200 million. Point to point, it was $500 million. So hopefully that clarifies the difference for you on the other income line.","Steven Chubak - Nomura","And I guess digging into the commercial lending side in particular, we're clearly seeing competition intensify and a general loosening of underwriting standards across the industry. I didn't know if you could speak to some of the competitive dynamics you're seeing in the market and your outlook for commercial loan growth, given what's been a historically conservative or disciplined approach to underwriting?","Paul Reilly","Yeah. That dynamic has really been in place now for a better part of two years. We continue to be extremely selective. We're really under no pressure at all to really grow loans or loosen our standards in order to grow loans. There's been enough volume and there's actually been an increase, I would say, in the M&A markets that have driven some of the transactions. We did have our most productive quarter. We did 89 transactions this last quarter. The higher watermark was the June quarter of last year that had 79 transactions. So yeah, in our unique model, there is still enough availability of new transactions that meet our credit standards.","So I know we grew loans over 5% this last quarter. I don't think that pace will continue. But we're more optimistic just given the economic environment and deal flow that we're currently seeing, and we\u2019re going to do that without loosening our standards.","Steven Chubak - Nomura","Transitioning to the Capital Markets side, we saw that revenues were flat quarter-on-quarter and the contribution from some of the higher margin areas such as [inaudible] trading profits and M&A results are flat sequentially. And yet, the segment margin did decline 300 basis points. I didn't know if you could speak to some of the expense accrual trend that we're seeing within this segment in particular.","Paul Reilly","I think it's the two things. First, you get comp true-ups during the year-end, which are harder to predict and M&A, so we kind of I mean with the equity capital markets. So in the first quarter, I think the P&L is a little harder. And secondly, September quarter, I think, was our second best M&A quarter. And M&A, we tend to have better margins. We had a decent December quarter. It wasn't a bad quarter, but September was a very big quarter for us. And that drives comp down. So you are probably seeing most of the delta really in comp margins that drive that. Again, it\u2019s a transaction based - a lot of transactions in that business. So it's a little lumpier.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Harris from Wells Fargo Securities.","Chris Harris - Wells Fargo Securities","So you guys called out the recruiting pipeline and just kind of curious to get your thoughts, what does a good recruiting year look like for Raymond James in terms of advisor additions? And I know you guys historically tend to focus on quality, not quantity. So just wondering if you could share a little bit of what we might expect for the balance of the year.","Paul Reilly","Recruiting and net recruiting are two numbers. And I don't know if I can quantify honestly. I think the goal is actually $75 million in our businesses in each segment in our Private Client Group and our employee and independent contracted groups at similar targets, roughly that run rate of new recruiting. We also have rolled out our new RAA. It's on a new business, but I guess the reformatted business that we're hoping to add to those numbers, but it's early days. I think it's allowed us to fill our recruiting pipeline between getting people in and bringing them over.","So that's kind of the run rate number we're targeting, but we're just as focused on the net number of assets, the way they keep growing is not to lose them and our retention has been very good. And so we're focused not really on the numbers, but we really look at assets.","Jeff Julien","And when recruiting, we're also reinvigorating the training effort in the firm, partially in response to some of the succession planning for ageing financial advisors, but also we've had some success with that in prior years and it was a good time to get that going again.","Chris Harris - Wells Fargo Securities","And one follow-up question on the Bank maybe for Steve. I'm wondering if you could share maybe your NIM target for the year. And then in addition to that, given the puts and takes you guys have with loan growth and pay-offs, do you feel comfortable that you could maintain this level of revenue for the balance of the year, or do you think it could go potentially higher?","Steve Raney","Chris, it is hard to predict that. I mean as it has played out, the NIM compression has slowed, but there's still pressure on it. So we do think that over the balance of this year, we're going to continue to see net interest margins come in, but maybe at a slower pace than you saw NIMs come in year-over-year over 50 basis points. We don't think we're going to see that level of compression. I would say maybe another 20 to 25 basis points over the next year is maybe kind of a good number, offset hopefully by higher average earning assets and more loans.","So I know there's been some volatility in our other income line. The net interest income line, we're focused on all of it, but there are some things that are really outside of our control on some of the other income line. I'd like to think that we're going to be actually able to grow net interest income slightly. So therefore, the increase in earning assets would more than offset the net interest margin compression. But I would say there's risk in that prediction just because there is a lot of unknown and uncertainty.","Paul Reilly","That's a hard one to predict. It looked like we were going to get some relief from that, and that's come back in and who knows what else went out. So we're subject to the markets. But today, from a standing start, which seemed to be off every time we predict, the market has moved another way. It looks like compression will still get some of that light compression.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joel Jeffrey from KBW.","Joel Jeffrey - KBW","Just to dig in a little bit deeper on the trading gains, I appreciate the color you gave. Can you just give us a little bit more clarity on precisely on what securities experienced the meaningful gains and is this going to be a sustainable trend, or it's just due to higher volumes in those securities or is there any kind of one-time issue?","Paul Reilly","Yeah, most of the trading profits have come through the muni book. Certainly that was true in last quarter. So there are two pieces to it. One is the retail activity was okay just because I think people have repositioned, giving longer from shorter, which we think is a good thing for retail clients. They're going shorter. And then in the institutional side of the market, if you talk to people, a lot of people got frightened in June with the rate corrections, which none of us liked, but we're pretty steady. And we've stayed in the markets. I think people have backed out a little bit. And since we're turning inventories really twice the weeks, we feel pretty comfortable in our position.","And we have some rates, the 10-year came in during the quarter, which anytime that happens when you own stuff, you make a little more money on it. So overall, that's where it's coming from. And again, the concern is that as commission volumes stay low that that's going to be under pressure. January, same trends continued both on conditions and the trading profits are pretty good. I don't know how long that holds up.","Jeff Julien","In the past, Joel, we have guided in the $12 million to $15 million, I think, per quarter in trading profits. I don't necessarily think we would change that guidance going forward. This past quarter, we had some additional help from some emerging markets trading. They all were going in the right direction this time on top of the majority of it, which was provided by fixed income.","Joel Jeffrey - KBW","The diluted share count continues to rise. I think it's up a little under 3% year-on-year, and I know you guys have historically looked to buy back stock when you're at about 1.5 times book. But has there been any sort of change in how you're thinking about this, given the valuation of the stock? And then how should we think about future share count growth?","Jeff Julien","Well, it's something as we've grown, we've had share count growth. A lot of people have asked us about capital. We like to deploy the capital in the growth areas in the business. And we're consistently looking over opportunities, but we're conservative and we're so analyzing kind of what the options are there. So I'd say you're going to continue unless we do something differently to see a little bit of dilution in the share count. We'll look at opportunities to deploy capital and when we determine we have excess capital, what we'll do with this.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Christian Bolu from Credit Suisse.","Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse","On the fixed income business, by your words, activity remains sluggish there. Just curious on your thoughts on resource allocations in that division. Should we expect that to be resized in the light of weaker industry trends?","Paul Reilly","We went through a significant resizing when we combined Morgan Keegan with Raymond James. We sized it hopefully for a growing market. And it obvious that didn't happen. We made some cuts. And then again last year, we sized it. So I feel very comfortable with size. It's a pretty variable model in terms of costs. We do have salaries, but they're generally low and it's really more of a variable cost model in general. We have some fixed cost guarantees basically from the acquisition that come off in April. And so I think the sizing of the fixed income business for now we're very comfortable. We've very, very good people. And we've proven in the operations both in the top market. In June, I think we outperformed by losing less in trading profits. And that's due both to our very good traders and our very good salespeople.","And I think we've shown that we've outperformed in this sluggish market. So I feel good about the people we have, but that model is pretty variable. I mean obviously if there is a dramatic change or you think you're down for a extended period of time, you ought to look at cost. But we tend to rise temporary downturns through and done over higher in big boom times. So we're more long-term player than trying to adjust for short-term profitability.","Jeff Julien","And further to your question of resource allocation, we're running that business on about half the inventory levels as we were running it at the peak in these, kind of averaging between $500 million to $600 million in total outstanding, where it was well over $1 billion at its peak before we further streamlined that. It's not using as much capital in that regard.","Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse","Just moving on to retail, you sound very constructive. And in light of some of the positive comments we've had from your peers, I was just curious as to what you and the team are seeing in terms of retail engagements just so far this year.","Paul Reilly","There is no doubt there has been a movement in the equities. And if you look at our economist review, it's a rather overweight equities and underweight fixed income in general for the individual investor. So you're seeing some movement in there. I'd get concerned when the retail investors are chasing a positive market. You don't want them to get into the peak. On the other side, if you look at retail, it is not positive on the equity markets. And in fact, our December sentiment actually went down under 30% for the investors who were positive about the short-term equity market.","So you're seeing a mixed bag. I think there is movements in the equities. Some of that is the push out of fixed income a little bit. And looking for dividend yield, some of it is watching the rise in the market. So there's definitely inflows into equities out of fixed income.","Jeff Julien","When you look at our client base and their mix of investments, it has shifted a little bit toward equities, but we attribute most of that to appreciation and portfolios, not actual money movements.","Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse","Can you give broader client cash management strategy just in the context of kind of the excess capital you're sitting on, what would drive you to the more opportunistic in terms of deploying that client cash within the Bank?","Paul Reilly","We look at that pretty regularly. It's hard for us to do much different than we're doing without taking either credit or duration risk. And even a modest amount of that just seems like in stressed times, whenever something can go wrong, it's a little bit of our risk aversion that's causing us from trying to catch bigger spreads on that client cash. But we have looked at exactly what you're talking about on several occasions. And maybe to some modest extent, to the extent that we can find acceptable investments on the asset side.","And we know a lot of the competitors and we could see in the releases of middle firm securities to raise their spreads. We try not to take those rate risk and we've always been conservative. Our strategy is like that, a little slower or not earning as much. But when markets move, we look a little smarter. Again, we tend to be on the conservative long-term side. So we do some of that to be modest. We're more worried about long-term impact.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs.","Alex Blostein - Goldman Sachs","A couple of things here, first on competition. Jeff, can you remind us on how much of the RSU amortization from the Morgan Keegan deal that I think expires in April amounts to? So kind of in dollar terms, how much will sort of this drop-off in amortization for you starting I guess in May?","Jeff Julien","Yeah. We've got some RSU amortization, but most of those were three year, not two year. But we've got some management. So it's really what ties some of the guaranteed payouts and things we're using in place of RSUs. I want to say it amounts to on an annualized about $4 million or so. I remember the number that was given to us by fixed income.","Alex Blostein - Goldman Sachs","And how much of that drops off in three years?","Jeff Julien","In three years, it'll be a bigger number. It's running about $6 million to $7 million a year right now in the RSU amortization.","Alex Blostein - Goldman Sachs","Can you talk a little bit about which client you're seeing most pressure in and what type of broad environment do we need to see exploration and fixed income results?","Paul Reilly","Well, the bulk of our fixed income business, I mean our really franchise is in the muni business and the mid-bank in place that are very, very strong. We're in the corporate business. So it's more of an accommodation business for us. I wouldn't call it our pure profit drivers. So it's that space both the bank mid-tier banks and their investments and loans and the muni business that really drive our levels in our fixed income practice, as well as our retail.","Alex Blostein - Goldman Sachs","Did you see an improvement in those areas or what kind of environment do you guys need to see? I don't know if there are one or two metrics, but whether it flows into the new funds or steeper yield curve, or what kind of environment should yield better results?","Paul Reilly","Definitely a steeper yield curve and volatility. I guess you'd say the worst part for that business would be a slow, steady creep of rates, where people just wait and wait and wait. And the best environment is when the rates jerk up and it shocks people. It's bad on trading profits maybe for the short-term, but long-term, people move and your commission volumes go up and you make it back. So we'd rather see steep rate increases in a slow, steady couple of basis points every month. That's kind of the torture environment for fixed income business. So steep and volatility is good for fixed income.","The best news is when they're doing bad, the equity markets are doing really well and the overall firm does better. But definitely rates have to move. They're absolutely low. And so rates moving up help that business to reposition their securities portfolios.","Alex Blostein - Goldman Sachs","When you look at consolidated net interest income for the whole entity, and that's a pretty decent source of net interest income for you guys. So can you talk about the balances you saw in the December quarter and maybe what you're seeing for January?","Jeff Julien","Yeah. We're not seeing a lot of movement in balances. But we have to look at jointly with securities base lending at the Bank, because that's kind of an alternative with sort of a lot of the same purposes. On a combined basis, they're certainly growing. But SPL at the Bank is growing faster than traditional margin lending at the brokers firm. The reason that the net interest earnings were up a little bit over the last quarter in the Private Client Group segment was we talked last quarter about a number of fee changes that were being implemented around the firm that would lead to some increased revenues this year kind of being phased in over the course of the year. But one of the changes that went in on October 1 was a change in our margin schedule. And that did have some immediate impact to the tune of $1.5 million to $2 million per quarter, which did show up in this first quarter in the Private Client Group net interest spread. Some of the other fees will hit some of the other line items over the course of the year as they are phased in January and April.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Allen from Evercore.","Chris Allen - Evercore","Just wanted to ask about the Private Client Group margin. I realized sort of the 9% target in one quarter into the year. You don't want to revise that yet. But moving forward, just given what client assets have ended the growth in fee-based assets and what seems to be a decent recruiting pipeline, is there any reason not to expect incremental margin expansion from here?","Paul Reilly","The impact to recruiting is you got to charge against income too. So as you amortize those payments, so as you recruit, it's actually a drag on short-term margins. So obviously if the market continues to go up, you're going to get margin extension on the revenue. But I think it's kind of early to call. We changed our grid and our employee size this year and those effects are still coming through. We've done a number of fee changes that are still coming through. So I wouldn't declare one quarter as the number that we should live off. I think we got to look that play out. Markets are good.","Chris Allen - Evercore","The $1.75 billion in customer cash is moved to the Bank suite program. Is there any economic benefit?","Paul Reilly","It's roughly a push in terms of economics. Otherwise, we might have had second thoughts. But it is where clients want it. But it does move the revenues on that money from what was interest earnings to us in our segregated asset account moves it to now the fee income from the other banks. So it'll be a couple of million dollar year shift from one item to the other, but in terms of economics to the overall premise about a push.","Chris Allen - Evercore","I know you guys mentioned a bunch of the special items. Any color in terms of what those numbers would look like ex the items? Obviously there's some compensation that's included with the performance fee in private equity. So I'm just trying to get a handle on that.","Paul Reilly","I mean where we'd hoped over the course of the year, remember I said to get us down to that 68% type comp ratio was going to require some revenue help. We'd like to see that as an operating revenues, not special items. And we're starting to see that in some of the divisions. So certainly it was a big improvement from last year's average and trending the right way, but it probably wasn't quite as good as it looked, but we are still hopeful that we can get to that level on a sustainable run rate by the end of the fiscal year.","Chris Allen - Evercore","The cash balance is still over $2.5 billion. And once you axe out the corporate debt, it came to over $9 in cash per share. And I realized you guys are going to be reassessing capital and thinking about investing for growth. I'm just wondering if there's a minimum cash level that's kind of necessary to firm, so this seems pretty high at present.","Paul Reilly","We have talked about this in some of our conferences. We do have cash targets. All that cash that you see in our balance sheet is not ours. A lot of it is client cash at the Bank, for example, that's just not invested yet. We actually have at our corporate about a little over $1 billion that we call free cash. We do have internal targets that are somewhat less than that. We kind of set that as a percent of overall shareholders' equity. So it gravitates up over time. But by those measures, we have some excess cash and capital at this point in time, not huge numbers, but in the couple of hundred million dollars range. And that's kind of what we said publicly.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan from JMP Securities.","Devin Ryan - JMP Securities","Within the equity underwriting business, the revenues there were a bit softer than I would have expected, given the strength that we've seen across the street. So just curious to know if there is anything maybe that you guys experienced from a sector exposure perspective and maybe waited on your results a bit and then just how to characterize your backlog specifically in the equity issuance business?","Paul Reilly","I wouldn't have characterized them as soft, but we play extremely well in certain sectors, the REIT, the downstream energy space. There's number of other spaces, growing technology, healthcare and those markets are all differential depending on who is financing, what deals at what time and what space. So I would say our backlog is good. I think I fell good about what they did in the quarter and I think the backlog looks good in a good market. So when certain sectors hit or certain areas we specialize in and the markets grew, were better. And when other sectors do better, maybe it will take up a few more deals. I thought they did a good job in the quarter and I think the outlook looks good.","I would tell you I feel good about the business. And as long as the market is open, I think they're fine. They weren't record, but they were good. And M&A wasn't record, but it was good. And I think the backlog is good. We'll just have to see. And M&A especially is lumpy. So when they lose, you get big fees.","Devin Ryan - JMP Securities","And then just another question on capital allocation and thoughts, I mean from an acquisition perspective, are you guys seeing any interesting opportunity? I'm curious to know what the volume looks like of opportunities that are coming to you guys in this market, and then are there any segments specifically? You guys highlighted in the past Asset Management where you've actually done a couple of deals, but are there any areas where you feel like you'd be interested in doing something if the right opportunity came across your desk?","Paul Reilly","Yeah, I'd say first Asset Management is the one that we've highlighted, because they've probably been most active consistently on and they're still interested in deals. As you know, we're highly selective and tend to be long-term. We talked about a number of Private Client Group we'd love to have, but you could count them on one hand and they're probably not for sale. So we tend to be long-term and focused on those kind of deals. And we're not going to buy something just to grow. We get a lot of people that bring stuff to us for size and we just say we're not interested. So we're selective.","We've wanted to extend in Canada where we seem to be profitable when the other non-fixed banks are challenged. But again, you got to find the right opportunities at the right price. And we've been more active in looking at the U.K. in M&A and Private Client. But again, that has been successful in marrying up what we're interested in with the opportunities. But we continue to work at it, work on the contacts. And again, we're not transactional-based. We'll continue to look at those deals. And at the right place, the right time, if doesn't, we're not going to buy.","Jeff Julien","You make it sound a little more passive than it is. It used to be outside of Asset Management. They just react to deals that were shown to us. But we do have a proactive effort now in addition to the ongoing effort in Asset Management to look at potential targets in all of our spaces.","Paul Reilly","We have corporate development function. We have targets. We do have conversations. But again, we're only going to do the right deals at the right price and firms with our culture that fit long-term. And if we could find more Morgan Keegans, we do them, but there's not just a lot out there that fits that way and certainly not of that size.","Devin Ryan - JMP Securities","With the respect to the headcount, I thought I missed this, but what drove this small sequential decline from last quarter? And then with respect to your comments on the backlog, it sounds like things are picking up. And so just curious if you can provide any perspective around expectations for timing just based on where you guys are in discussions if you expect that you could be closing on more individuals? Is it going to be this quarter or does it look like it's first half of the calendar year, or just any perspective based on where the conversations are?","Paul Reilly","Year-end you tend to have more activity. We also put new grid in for RJA combined Raymond James and Morgan Keegan. And it was tough around the lower end of producers and where we try to continue to upgrade, and you can see it in our productivity. We tend to lose people to lower end. And for economic reasons, they go to firms where lower volumes and they get a little better payouts and what we think is appropriate for our strategy. So that's where you're really seeing the numbers.","If I could tell on recruitment, when people join, everyone is almost like an M&A deal. You got to convince them over and then they time it. Sometimes they move so much, they don't come. They generally move out a little bit. So I don't think you're going to see any lumpiness. I think you're going to see a good, steady. From what we can tell on the pipeline and good steady increase in terms of the number of people coming over. So we kind of measure that by pipeline, how many people are we talking to, how many people come into the home office. And I think we can just tell you that those activity levels are all up.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell from Buckingham Research.","Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research","I don't know if you can give any color on what net inflows look like into the retail brokerage business and\/or asset management, that would be great.","Paul Reilly","I don't have the numbers here. You would expect in Asset Management, they're up 9%. 5% to 6% of that would have been market lift and the rest of net flows. We had very good net flows in that business. An d it just continues, partly as advisors get more into it, Morgan Keegan continues to invest more in our Asset Management business. Our outside businesses are going good. So we get good net flows.","Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research","Maybe just one quick follow-up on the Capital Markets division, that's the one area that pre-tax margins are a little bit below your target. Is the amortization coupled with better revenues, or do you think there's still some more that you can get done there to hit your targets?","Paul Reilly","Fixed income is tough right now. So you're going to get some margin drag from there. And as I explained a little bit earlier, in the Equity Capital Markets business, I think it's hard with comp ratios to predict what they really should be. So that's kind of a lumpy business. So we kind of estimate them and correct them. As we get through the year-end when we get a better view on volume, so that's some work to do to get those margins up and there might be a little bit of cost. We continue to analyze kind of our total cost in Equity Capital Markets. But they're doing well. They're positioned well. So I think you'll see an improvement. Again, in that business, the Capital Markets business, it's hard to get a trend off of one quarter.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions.","Paul Reilly","Thank you. I would like to make one further comment before we get off the call. First, thanks to all for joining. The other one is really to thank Chet Helck. Chet has been invaluable in growing our Private Client Group business. He was an innovator in RJF. He took over and ran that and has jointly overseen our Private Client Group business and we had great growth, great advisors joined us under his leadership. And he has proactively put succession in place a couple of years ago with Scott for doing a great job. And I have seen too many people for a couple of years to hang on. So he says you got the team in place and I want to go on and enjoy life a little bit. So I appreciate him for his leadership, his development and promotion of people internally. Part of all of our jobs is to make sure that organization succeeds well beyond as we bring succession in. So he's been invaluable. We'll miss him. He's left a great legacy here and just wanted to thank him and let you all know that the Private Client Group is in great hands.","So with that, thank you all for joining and hope it warms up there for you in the Northeast by our next quarterly call and certainly by the Super Bowl, because I'll be up there next weekend. So warm it up.","Operator","Thank you. That concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"18178":["Raymond James Financial (NYSE:RJF) Q4 2012 Earnings Call October 25, 2012  8:15 AM ET","Executives","Paul C. Reilly - Chief Executive Officer, Director and Member of Special Committee","Jeffrey Paul Julien - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President of Finance, Treasurer and Chairman of Raymond James Bank","Steven M. Raney - Chief Executive Officer of Raymond James Bank and President of Raymond James Bank","Analysts","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Hugh M. Miller - Sidoti & Company, LLC","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Devin Ryan - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Operator","Good morning. My name is Jodi, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Raymond James Quarterly Analyst Call. [Operator Instructions] To the extent that Raymond James makes forward-looking statements regarding management expectations, strategic objectives, business prospects, anticipated expense savings, financial results, anticipated results of litigation and regulatory proceedings and other similar matters, a variety of factors, many of which beyond Raymond James' control, could cause actual results and experiences to differ materially from the expectations and objectives expressed in these statements. These factors are described in Raymond James' 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is available on raymondjames.com and sec.gov.","In addition to those factors, in connection with the Morgan Keegan transaction, the following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking or historical performance, difficulty integrating Raymond James and Morgan Keegan's businesses or realizing the projected benefits of this transaction, the inability to sustain revenue and earnings growth, changes in the capital markets and diversion of management time or integration-related issues. To the extent, Raymond James discusses non-GAAP results, the reconciliation to GAAP is available on raymondjames.com and the earnings release issued yesterday. Thank you.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Paul Reilly, Chief Executive Officer of Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Paul C. Reilly","Thank you, Jodi. Good morning, everyone. After the release, a lot of people asked me how I felt, and despite fighting a cold and economic, political and regulatory uncertainty, I feel pretty good. The -- I think it's important because there's a lot of what I called noise in the quarter, with so much going on within the firm and the integration as the first, put the quarter in perspective.","This was a record quarter in revenue and in earnings, and sure, you could say, well, part of that was Morgan Keegan. That certainly aided. But if you took Morgan Keegan out in the related costs of the acquisition and integration, it still would have been a record quarter in revenue and earnings. So I think that if you look -- it was a very solid quarter in terms of operating, much of the beat we recognized, as you have, was from a tax rate benefit driven by COLI, which Jeff will talk a little bit later. But it was a good operational quarter. And in this environment, especially with the integration going on, we feel very good about it.","There is a lot of things happening on the cost side, as you've noticed, and we will talk about in some of the segments, especially in Jeff's part. We do have, as we've told you, increased technology spend. We've been very focused in elevating the platform for our financial advisors and our individual clients, which has gone very, very well. But on top of that, we've had the integration with Morgan Keegan. And while we're integrating the Morgan Keegan system, we've made some upgrades to our back-office system, because we would have had to do them twice. And that has elevated technology spend. And we've also used a lot of consultants, which has elevated technology spend, with the philosophy that once the integration is over, the consultants can leave and the operating people will still be here.","So you see much of that going through the system, which will be here for a while as we go through the integration. There is some onetime charges. We'll talk about them. There's some allocation changes as we move people, align departments. We've moved some people from MK and RJ, and we've kept people in MK in the broker dealer. There are pieces that move around. So it makes comparisons, sometimes quarter-to-quarter or business to business, a little difficult as we get through the integration.","One message that we kept on is that we wanted to err on the side of keeping our service high. Anecdotally, I was at operation managers' dinner last night, and I just went from group to group asking how service was since we announced the Morgan Keegan integration. And everyone said it's been very, very high, that they haven't noticed any declination [ph] in service. And I think that's the result why we've continued with high retention rates, both in legacy Raymond James and Morgan Keegan, and that has been our strategy. So we know the costs are high through this integration process. It's been part of our strategy. And given this environment, I think we've had it -- we had good revenue for the quarter. Maybe more importantly, as we position the platform, record assets under administration at $390 billion, record assets under management at $43 billion, should bode well moving forward.","We do have some market tailwinds coming into the quarter, especially in our Private Client Group. In our advance billings, we went in with a 3.3% drag with the S&P 500 down. We moved in with a tailwind with 5.8% increase in the S&P, really helping us start our next quarter. So all in all, I'm really proud of the management team. It's difficult running and focusing on a business while integrating a company at the same time, and I give them very high marks for doing that. So far, so good. We still have a long way to go to complete the integration, and I'll speak a little bit more of that in a minute.","PCG group. I'll talk to a few factors, and Jeff will talk to some of the costs. Revenue up despite going into that headwinds, with the S&P down, moving into the quarter. You can see growth really in our account servicing fees. We're slowly moving Morgan Keegan into some of our cost structure. But most of the benefits on the revenue side, on the omnibus platform, on marketing fees with our mutual funds and other things. Although we're getting some, almost most of that will happen after the integration of the PCG platforms in February.","Technology costs are probably the big costs of this sector, and I'll let Jeff go through that. And I describe kind of some of the issues that are hitting us in that, and I leave it for that. The other area I wanted to comment was on the financial advisor headcount reduction, as you noticed on the schedules. And that's really driven more than 100% on the net number by a reduction of low-end producing Morgan Keegan FAs, who have exited the system. For example, there's a group of 30 that average 136,000 in trailing 12s. I mean, there are people that -- good people that just weren't meeting the standards. We had 4 retirements and one death, where we kept the book. So if you look at who's left, it's really been the lower-end producing MK financial advisors. Our retention on those who were offered retention agreements is close to 96%, so we're feeling very, very good that the people that we targeted to keep are staying.","Our HOV, which we call our home office visits, those are recruits coming into the office, are increasing, continuing to increase both in our employee and our independent contractors divisions. So we feel very good about the recruiting pipeline, especially a very high-end producer. So I think that the Morgan Keegan combination has resulted in a lot more interest than our overall platforms. People recognize that maybe a little bit more of what we're accomplishing.","The other difficult segment to really read through for this quarter is the Capital Markets segment, as we titled it, \"The Tale of Two Cities.\" The Equity Capital Markets business has been difficult since really the meltdown of the European markets last September. This quarter, our Investment Banking revenues were down. Actually, securities commissions were up some, but if you look at the whole tracking of the institutional business, it's in decline. When you gain -- we've been gaining market share but certainly not enough to offset the overall decline in commissions over the desk as more and more, not only is volume going down, but the percentage going electronic and ETF is going up.","On top of that, in a tough market, if you look at Howe Barnes, who we acquired right before this -- the Morgan Keegan. In Morgan Keegan, we've added substantially to our support, to our banking and our research staff during that period of time. So as the market has gone down, we have grown. So that has put a lot of pressure on our results in Equity Capital Markets and something we're just looking to rationalize and see where we think the markets will head and where we're positioned.","On the flip side, the Fixed Income has done very good. If you look, overall, it's interesting the commissions are slightly down, doing some right-sizing really last quarter, as we continued to -- last quarter, we did our adjustments in our sales and trading group but our trading profits are solid. The group is very strong. Management has come together. We love the platform. And it's been very, very consistent. And so it's made up much of the decline we saw in Equity Capital Markets.","Our Public Finance group was off on the quarter due to a very, very slow July as we told you in the operating statistics. But since July, we've had a series of very strong months and very good backlog in our Public Finance fields. And we're very, very comfortable where that business is also. So we have the equity side of the business struggling and the Fixed Income, Public Finance side of the business doing very, very well.","On the Asset Management side, we continue to have steady growth, good net inflows. As you've read in our releases, we've had an addition of several teams -- a strong, seasoned, the small and mid-cap team has joined Eagle. And also, we announced the purchase agreement of a large minority interest in ClariVest, the $3 billion asset manager, which will help us in our strategies in the large cap space.","We've said we've been open to looking out for the large cap manager in international space. We'll continue to look a little less aggressively. If we find someone, we will continue to add opportunities in Eagle, but we are making progress on our acquisition strategies as we have mentioned before.","There's a lot of information on the bank. We just had a great quarter on the bank, driven -- again, we have great loan growth for the year and a good credit quality. And we benefited from a lower provision this quarter. But great quarter and great year for the bank, and you've got a lot of operating statistics in there, so I won't really go into too much detail, but very, very comfortable where the bank is headed.","So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Jeff. I know you're going to have a lot of questions. So Jeff, why don't you go ahead and address some of the items?","Jeffrey Paul Julien","Okay. I think most of the comments I've read from all of you this morning, that have written about us already, have been pretty much right on with how we view the quarter. It was really kind of a confluence of goods and bads and highs and lows for the quarter, and in some ways, for the year as well. I mean, on the positive side of the ledger, we certainly would have the bank, as Paul just mentioned, which had -- has had consecutive record quarters and, by far, a record year.","Fixed Income for the last 6 months since the integration is performing about as well as one could expect, given the massive task of integrating 2 fairly sizable businesses and trying to right-size that. There's probably still a little bit more of that to go. But certainly, for the fourth quarter, they performed every bit in line with our expectations.","Proprietary Capital, for the last 6 months, has certainly been a pleasant surprise as we've -- in both quarters, to our interest, had a $5 million type profit recognized in that segment. And certainly, this most recent quarter, the tax rate benefited, which I'll talk about in a second. So overall, very positive elements. But there were also some negative elements. Equity Capital Markets continues to be a difficult business. As Paul mentioned, I'll talk about our comp ratio, which we view as a higher than -- it should be and higher than it will be in the future.","And certainly, IT costs, as we've made some of these investments, which, again, I'll talk about. So with that, let me talk in some detail about a couple of things, in no particular order. With respect to the tax rate, we've used the reasoning with the COLI in the past. Typically, we've had to use it when we've had down markets, and it's possible [ph]  To have an exceptionally high tax rate. Well, it's nice to know it does work in our favor as well. We have around $150 million block of corporate and life insurance that -- which gains and losses do not impact taxes. So this case, we have to kind of predict every quarter where we think COLI is going to go.","And at the end of June, when the market was coming off a 3.3% decline that quarter, we kind of projected COLI would be flat to slightly down from that level for the year and pegged our rate accordingly. And of course, when you do that, it just does the opposite, then it rocketed up in the fourth quarter. So we had a lot of tax-free gains on the COLI, which is -- there's some other items going back and forth but that was, by far, the main driver. And obviously, it helped overall for the year to some extent as well.","The comp ratio has a lot of moving parts in it. Now we did have -- we recognized this year and mostly in the fourth quarter over $10 million of what I'd call non-recurring items, things like a catch-up expense on some benefit plan accruals, some -- and FLSA internal review, to catch up on that to avoid any kind of -- it's the Fair Labor Standards Act, in terms of catching people up on past over time, et cetera. So those type of things should not be recurring going forward. And most of that hit the PCG segment, which caused that segment to show a poor margin than we would have expected.","The level of comp in Equity Capital Markets, when they're having poor revenue times, is obviously going to be higher, it has a big overhead base in that area. So to the extent that revenues recover, that should normalize that comp level over time.","IT is still very heavy. Remember, we're still running 2 systems, and a lot of that's in people count. Some of it's in systems -- the systems line but a lot of it is in people headcount where Morgan Keegan still run their Phase 3 system and all the support related to that. So we still have a lot of what I'll call, future synergy in the IT area, some in the headcount.","Fixed Income and Private Client Group are probably still running heavy. And Fixed Income, as Paul mentioned, did some right-sizing at the very end of September on some of the sales and trading areas and some of the support areas. And we started to do a little bit more of that in some of the other PCG support areas as well. But most of that won't be recognized until post the integration in February. So when I look at all this together and look at our businesses going forward, I think mid-60s is still our target and still achievable as a comp ratio. Again, that includes the high comp level associated with independent contractors. But most of the remaining synergy savings are going to be -- will be headcount reductions and IT ops, other support areas, post integration, so that will help drive down the comp at that time.","I'll talk on net interest for a second. It's interesting it increased every quarter this fiscal year, despite the fact that we incurred a lot more corporate debt in connection with the Morgan Keegan acquisition. And that's mainly on the heels of the bank's growth which, as we mentioned already, had a -- by far, a record year. They didn't -- we still have the same dynamic. I don't need to go into -- with respect to when interest rates rise, so we're still looking forward to those days.","Proprietary Capital, I mentioned, the difference this quarter versus last quarter is that last quarter, the writeup was in an investment where we had a fairly minor interest. So the -- it's a consolidated entity, however, so we had a very large revenue and a large, non-controlling interest charge to reflect that part that we did not own.","This quarter, the writeup was in one that we're accounting for on, I'll call it, the equity method or investment method, where it's all to our interest. So it's same amount of writeup basically, net to our interest, but one larger revenue and then minority interest in this one, the revenue and straight to the bottom line. No minority interest.","IT costs. We've talked about -- there's a number of things going on in that area. The headcount is certainly one [ph]  From running 2 systems, but they're also -- some of the initiatives that we've had under way for the year are regulatory in nature. Cost basis is probably the biggest regulatory project that we've got going on as do -- does everyone in the industry. We also have other regulatory reporting efforts under way. There's unfortunately no capitalization involved or anything else with those type of projects. It's just regulatory necessity. We also have spent quite a bit this year on improvement of the advisor desktop, a system we call Advisor Access, and other enhancements to stay competitive, maybe doing a little bit of catch-up in that regard but to remain competitive with the competition out there, so as not to impact recruiting and our ability to service FAs and clients.","ROEs. We don't put that in the press release we make going forward. For the quarter, our GAAP ROE was 10.4% versus last quarter's 9.8% and last year's 10.7%. So all hovering around the 10% level. On a non-GAAP basis which, this year, excludes the acquisition and integration costs and, in the prior year, would exclude the auction rate securities charges was -- for this quarter was 12.6% versus 11.5% last quarter and only 10.2% last year, when we -- was a very rough quarter. If you remember, the U.S. downgrade, the market was in a tailspin last year, September quarter. So from that perspective, it was a little easier comparison. And more importantly for the overall fiscal year, our ROE on a GAAP basis was 9.7% versus 11.3% last year.","Again, that's on a GAAP basis. We had higher integration charges than we did auction rate securities charges. But a better comparison is the non-GAAP number, which was 11.2% this year versus 12.2% in the prior year. Paul mentioned we would have had a record year of even ex-Morgan Keegan. The real -- the whole reason for the decline in ROEs, we had more E [ph] between earnings. And the stock offering we did to consummate the acquisition added $360 million to equity. So we're running about the -- still in that 11% to 12% ROE range on an operating basis.","I have a couple other things that you all have asked in the past. I thought I would just get that out on the table. People ask about the commission breakdown in our line item. I've tried to look at -- I've looked at the last 6 months, which is the period we've had Morgan Keegan, and try to give a rough approximation of how the commission line -- commission and fee line breaks down. It's roughly 80% Private Client Group, 13% Fixed Income and 7% Equity, is about what it is over that period. That's going to bounce around from period to period, but that's effectively the breakdown as it stands now.","The other one that you've asked about is the Investment Banking line. Again, looking at the last 6 months when we've had Morgan Keegan and their significant Public Finance effort, it's been about 40% equity underwriting, 25% M&A, 25% public finance and 10% tax credit funds are the 4 components of that line. Again, 40% equity underwriting, 25% M&A, 25% public finance and 10% tax credit funds. So those are your constructing models going forward.","We get asked a lot about client asset mix. We have -- and again, an approximation, this bounces around. But where we stand today, on our client assets, we don't have as good information into the Morgan Keegan system as we do the RJ. But we'd suspect they're fairly similar. Our client assets are 300-plus billion is approximately 50% equity and this looking through mutual funds to what they're actually holding. It's about 50% equity, it's about 35% Fixed Income and about 15% cash alternative investments, real estate, everything else. Cash levels are probably in the 11% to 12% range right now, so not much of the other.","At the same time, sometimes I'm asked, and I try to tell what's in the asset managed segments, in terms of how sensitive are those to the equity markets. In terms of the managed portion of our assets, the $43 billion, it's about 70% equity and 30% Fixed Income, which is probably as high a Fixed Income component as it's ever been and are -- because we've had our roots as an equity shop and still are mostly known as that.","In the non-managed portfolio, the rest of the fee-based assets that you see that we talked about, it's about -- it's similar, it's about -- as a client breakdown, it's about 50% equity, 30% Fixed Income and 15% cash and 5% these others. So not much different than the overall client breakdown, but that gives you some idea of our sensitivity to the equity markets. Obviously, we had a good market in the September quarter. So our billing base will be substantially higher -- was substantially higher on 10\/1 than it was on 7\/1  going forward.","Back to the current year, I tried to do an analysis extracting all the revenues and expenses associated with Morgan Keegan out of our numbers to see what our true increase would have been for the year, and it's -- I would say revenues, ex all the Morgan Keegan, were up about 2.5% for the year. Legacy Raymond James expenses were up a little less than that, about 2.3% to 2.4%, which would have meant the non-GAAP pre-tax was up about 12% for the year, which is a pretty good, good result, given we had some of the higher IT spend, not much help from Equity Capital Markets, and some of the other factors I mentioned.","So a lot of facts and figures, but that's sort of where we ended up for the quarter and the year.","Paul C. Reilly","One last comment and I'll open it for questions, is that in terms of the integration, we continue to be on schedule. We've stayed ahead on retention. So our targets, I'm very confident we're going to be able to get our operating synergies down on the cost side, that's going to be after conversion. So we're slating for our final conversion in February. There's probably 90 days to get operationally stable and through it all. So we're going to be -- we'll be able to lower some of our costs in between. But I think the great bulk of that is going to happen during that post-integration time frame. But I'm confident that we're on track. I'm confident they're there. And if we can keep the people, it would be a great story. And so far, so good.","So with that, Jodi, why don't we open up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] You're first question comes from the line of Chris Harris from Wells Fargo.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So I know there's a lot of noise going on this quarter, a lot of moving parts you guys addressed, I guess, a lot them in the prepared commentary there. Just trying to get a sense on the cost side of things. Paul, you mentioned the majority of the savings to come, I guess, after you integrate. And I'm just kind of curious, right now, you guys are running about $180 million or so of non-comp expense backing out provision and adjustments. Just kind of curious as to where you think that number can go, as you guys start to integrate the platform.","Jeffrey Paul Julien","Chris, it's Jeff. I'll remind you that a lot of the future synergy is going to be in the comp line. And non-comp might -- it will probably trend a little lower than that, as we get rid of some of the system and platform duplication that we've got, some of the contracts that are in place that we won't have any more, et cetera. But...","Paul C. Reilly","Think of most people [ph] .","Jeffrey Paul Julien","Yes. And most of the synergy, to date and remaining, is going to be in the comp line.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Are you guys still budgeting for that $50 million to $80 million target? I mean, I guess you've already realized some of that but...","Jeffrey Paul Julien","I'd say we've probably realized maybe 1\/4 of it and a lot of it was in Equity Capital Markets, where we kept the revenue-producing units and -- et cetera. But even the people we've kept there, we haven't had the best of markets to realize the production. So that hasn't really resulted in a synergy. Even though we had quite a bit of headcount reduction in the Equity Capital Markets area, we haven't had the revenues that historically have been there.","Paul C. Reilly","Yes. Our estimates haven't changed, Chris. We're pretty confident they're there, and it's just -- we're going to have to get through integration to realize them all.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. All right, fair enough. And a few questions then on the bank. Nice step-down in provision expense in the quarter. You guys are at 181 basis points now, your allowance ratio. Just wondering where you guys are comfortable taking that ratio, assuming credit continues to do well here.","Steven M. Raney","Chris, it's Steve Raney. Yes, you saw that it trended down just slightly. We're actually trying to grow loans and adding to provision accordingly. That said, we've had a pretty benign last 18 months or so in terms of credit. In terms of that ratio, it could come down slightly, but it's not going to come down materially. So we're really watching that closely. We're very comfortable of having quite a bit of coverage in terms of our total allowance to our non-performers. You see that's about 138% right now. We like to have that level of cushion in our credit portfolio. But it could come down a little bit, but not materially.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, Steven. And then while I have you, maybe a quick one on the NIM, and then I'll let others get in here. Pretty big step-down this quarter. I mean, I guess that's similar with pretty much every other bank. What are you guys seeing NIM going over the course of the next year or so?","Steven M. Raney","Yes. Chris, just to clarify, it was down 14 basis points for the quarter. About half of that was attributable to -- we had about $150 million more in cash balances that obviously impact the NIM but don't negatively impact our net interest and bottom line. So about half of that 14-basis-point reduction was related to additional cash balances we had. And the rest was just across the whole loan portfolio. We -- as you know, we introduced this securities-based loan product earlier in the year, back in February. That product has about a 300-basis-point net interest margin. We want to grow that business. It's a very low-risk business, but it is a lower net interest margin business. And we have had some very small reductions in NIM in our corporate and our residential portfolio. That being said, moving forward, I would say maybe compared to the 355 basis points in NIM, it's something in the 340 to 350 range. So not a material drop for the next 12 months, but maybe -- it will come down maybe slightly.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Hugh Miller with Sidoti & Company.","Hugh M. Miller - Sidoti & Company, LLC","Certainly appreciate the insights you guys have given us on kind of the exposure to the equity markets. As you talked about kind of a 50% exposure with the retail client assets to equities, can you just talk about how that compares historically? Have you taken a look there to see what -- has that really changed much in the last several years?","Jeffrey Paul Julien","Well, I can only give you an anecdotal. I mean, we didn't have the same ability to look through mutual funds and sort them out as we do today on an automated basis. I would say it's probably down, I would guess, probably 10 percentage points from historic levels versus the client allocations in the past. I think the world has gotten a little bit more conservative here in their investing strategies, but that's just anecdotal. I was a little surprised. I thought it'd be a little higher than 50 even now, but that's how it shook out.","Hugh M. Miller - Sidoti & Company, LLC","Okay. And I mean, how much of a factor do you guys feel or are you getting any feedback from clients about the November elections, the fiscal cliff? Is that really playing a substantial factor in their aversion to equities? Or what do you guys think has to happen in order for there to be potential rebalance of allocations?","Paul C. Reilly","Hugh, I think it's just overall confidence. And all those add into it, whether it's Europe, fiscal cliff, the elections, governmental policy, direction, regulation. I mean, there's just not a high degree of confidence that we're heading somewhere, and people are risk-averse.","Jeffrey Paul Julien","There's one more uncertainty that will be removed in a few weeks.","Paul C. Reilly","Yes. But a few to be added even when that one is removed until we see what happens so...","Steven M. Raney","It may add a few more.","Paul C. Reilly","It's going to take a while. So we may get some euphoria after an election with one result or another. But I think people are going to settle down and say, \"What does that mean until Congress convenes?\" So...","Steven M. Raney","We aren't having -- we aren't advocating that people make election [indiscernible] at this point.","Hugh M. Miller - Sidoti & Company, LLC","And I know that the majority of your fee-based accounts are booked in the prior quarter. But we did see a kind of a pickup in September in average daily commissions that were -- it's a little higher than what I would have expected. Anything in particular? I assume, given the higher exposure within the PCG side, but was there any -- to those types of commissions. But anything in particular that was kind of driving that rise in September?","Jeffrey Paul Julien","There's 2 general factors for us. One is, it's after summer. So September is usually better than the summer months. And secondly, it's our year-end. And I think that people work hard to close out their books and positions and -- so we'll get a lot of -- they qualify for clubs and levels and -- so they work really hard in the month to close out the year well, and they probably work harder. So I think that if you look overall, it was a -- it wasn't record month on a daily basis, but it was much better than the previous 2 months.","Hugh M. Miller - Sidoti & Company, LLC","Okay. And last question I had was just with regards to some of the commentary you guys have made about consideration of cost structure within kind of the cash equities business, just given what you guys referred to as both cyclical and structural changes in there. Can you just delve in a little bit further about -- to what extent you would consider making an adjustment there and any types of things that you guys have talked about and what you would consider changing?","Paul C. Reilly","No. We're still early going. But I mean, if you just look at the market that the -- if you look at the over-the-desk commissions were down. And that's how we get paid. We're a research-based firm. So we have high costs, and it's just -- you got to rationalize either what people get paid, how much cost you structure, how you -- just how you look at that whole thing. So we're examining it, because we believe that part of it is cyclical, but part of it's structural. And we're just taking a look at it now so...","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Jeff, sorry if I missed it already, but can you walk me through the comp dynamic again this quarter? So I guess your point on the comp rate being higher because of kind of slower Equity Capital Market activity. But I guess, when I look at last quarter, $736,000 and just in dollar terms, went to $745,000 this quarter. Commissions were kind of flat. Everything else out of Investment Banking were kind of flattish as well. So can you just explain, I guess, what drove the sequential increase in comp, dollar terms?","Jeffrey Paul Julien","Yes. A couple of things. We had some onetime charges, as I mentioned, about $10 million of them. Most of which hit in this fourth quarter, which probably makes up your difference right there. But there are other things as well. As we continue to work on these IT projects, some of the hiring we do comes in the form of contractors, which actually gets into the comp line. The consultants don't, but contractors do. So we've actually added headcount in IT to keep some of these projects alive, that I mentioned some of the regulatory, some of the advisor desktop, et cetera. Not much, that's a small quarter-to-quarter but still an item. So it was predominantly right-sizing of all the incentive comp pools -- it happens at year-end. That's an exercise around the firm, as well as these onetime charges probably between quarter-to-quarter, probably makes the difference.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got you, that's helpful. And then I guess, looking at the entire expense line for the quarter, 930 [ph]. You're saying you guys are already running about 20%, 25% of your targeted cost saves, kind of in the numbers. So it's sort of -- kind of in the run rate. Can you give us, I guess, an update? What's -- how much is left? But also most importantly, when you think about extra cost that the business is incurring right now, aside from Morgan Keegan, so whether it's travel, which is I guess something you guys talked about last quarter, some of these contractors, IT-related stuff. It just feels like there's more running through the total expense line right now than what's kind of implied in your ultimate savings. Is there a way to size that?","Paul C. Reilly","Yes. Let us address that. Let me go back to your first -- your other question real quick. One more -- one other thing that impacted quarter-to-quarter on the comp, the Morgan Keegan retention packages, which were delivered in April and May, the amortization of those started July 1. That's about $5 million a quarter.","Paul C. Reilly","And those aren't onetime.","Paul C. Reilly","Yes. Those unfortunately will be recurring or fortunately, but those will be recurring. But that was just looking quarter-to-quarter. That was the additional $5 million increase, not a onetime charge.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just I guess on the -- on any other costs that are flowing through that will eventually go away?","Paul C. Reilly","It's hard for us to say. We've told you for several quarters that we're going to have higher technology spend here for some time. And we certainly lived up to that. Some of these costs [indiscernible] systems, et cetera, aside from Morgan Keegan. We'll finish some of the projects we have in process. I don't know if that means the cost will go away, because some of the capitalized projects you start -- then realize the amortization of those through your P&L. And we'll have other projects that need addressing. So I don't know that we can say that there's a lot of fat in the base level of expenses outside of the comp expense at this point in time. I don't know, Paul, maybe...","Paul C. Reilly","No. I think the ongoing IT is a little heavy. But I mean -- after the cost savings. But it's -- we do have an elevated IT investment that we'll be seeing really for a few years. And we've talked about that way before the Morgan Keegan acquisition that, that's up. So that run rate is up. It's just accentuated this quarter by a number of the things Jeff has talked about, some adjustments, some allocations and the consultant cost. So...","Jeffrey Paul Julien","I don't see that occupancy or business development or some of the other expenses really. I think they're in the approximately the right rate for where we are, inclusive of Morgan Keegan, and obviously, have more people going on trips and things like that.","Paul C. Reilly","That will slow down.","Jeffrey Paul Julien","Yes. But I don't see a lot of, like I said, trimming to do in the non-comp expense area beyond some of the IT.","Paul C. Reilly","Yes. There's a lot of costs that are honestly hard to quantify that you go through in these integrations, for example, we've had almost 60 Morgan Keegan office people here for 5 weeks being trained on all of our systems. We've had all their operations people being trained for 3 days this week and then joining our operations as managers running [ph] the new system. So you do get some elevated costs through this integration process that will go away but the...","Jeffrey Paul Julien","I think there might be a little help in occupancy. We right-sized 5 or 6 Equity Capital Market offices around the country already. Now we've taken some of those charges through the non-recurring, as we have either abandoned or subleased some space or whatever. But we won't have that occupancy expense for some of those going forward. I don't know how big a lift that is, but that may be fairly minor. And I don't think there's much of that, if any, in the PCG side post integration to come. So we do have a new data center going in, in Colorado that will increase occupancy a little bit. But I think, by and large, the expenses are at about the right level outside of comp for the current level of operations.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. I know it's difficult. So I guess -- throw out the number there. So I appreciate all the additional color. One more from me on the bank. Clearly, you've a good growth there. Have you guys talked at all about, I guess, how you're thinking about growth in the bank heading into next year? Should we think about the loan portfolio growing roughly at the same rate? Can you accelerate some of that? Have you seen incremental opportunities in certain parts of the market? Or is that -- should be, I guess, pretty similar to what it's been this year?","Steven M. Raney","It's Steve Raney. A couple of things. Since this last fiscal year, reminding you that back earlier that year, we closed on the Canadian portfolio. We also closed in July on a $185-million purchase of the legacy Region's securities-based loans. We had a couple of non-recurring events that helped catapult our growth during fiscal '12. That said, we are being opportunistic in trying to grow the loan portfolio organically this year, kind of across the whole spectrum, our corporate lending, our mortgage banking business and securities-based lending. I would -- I think that we're -- to the extent that the market is available, we're not going off into any new businesses or any new ventures at all, so we're going to stick to our core businesses. But we'd love to be able to grow the bank high single digits, low double digits, call it 8% to 12% over the next fiscal year. So that's what we're targeting right now.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan from Sandler O'Neill.","Devin Ryan - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Just want to get your perspective on acquisition opportunities in the Private Client space, just as regulatory costs rise and in smaller firms, I think, continue to get squeezed. They just don't have the same economies of scale that you guys do. So essentially, maybe outlook and even appetite, given an outlook.","Paul C. Reilly","Well, right now, we're fairly busy digesting our latest venture here. I think that there'll be opportunities for small firms. We -- the -- as the regulatory burden comes up, it's going to be hard for people to be small broker dealers. They can go into the RIA space. There's lots of opportunities to change business for advisors. But there'll be -- we are interested in organic growth or in this acquisition, I think Morgan Keegan was a rare opportunity. There's a couple of mid-sized firms. We'd love their business. If they became available, either in the independent space or the employee space, we'd love to have them as part of the family. But there's smaller kind of -- maybe smaller kind of acquisitions. But right now, they're not. And -- but there aren't -- if you go through the list, there aren't a whole bunch of them. And there are a lot of firms that are also in business, just have different products in space. We're not big in variable annuities. We're not big in closed-end funds and things that firms -- some firms do. And we don't do them. So if you look at the people that do business the way we do, there's a handful we'd like. But there's not a ton of them. And if they became available, we'd love them to join us. But I think that a lot of them may stay private or stay their own way, unless the regulatory pressure or succession dictates [indiscernible].","Devin Ryan - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Got you, okay. And then from a modeling perspective, how should we think about the ClariVest results? And then are you planning on consolidating that business? Or I guess, how should we think about modeling it?","Jeffrey Paul Julien","That will be consolidated. So there's some additional non-controlling interests to come there. We're acquiring 45% of it as the release said and then manage about $3 billion, mainly in the large cap space.","Devin Ryan - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Great. And then, I apologize if I missed this. But did you give the specifics on what drove the $10 million in onetime comp charges? And then just additionally, on comp again, just to beat the dead horse, I'm just trying to figure out the numbers here. And based on the commentary, if you're going to assume that the $60 million to $80 million of expense saved, are the majority still yet to come? Then I'm estimating that the comp expenses may be elevated by another $10 million to even up at $15 million higher, just related to that Morgan Keegan -- the elevated Morgan Keegan expenses. So I just want to make sure that I'm kind of thinking about things, maybe just in the right ballpark. And then secondly, just give us some detail on the onetime $10 million this quarter.","Jeffrey Paul Julien","It wasn't all this quarter. It was over the last 2 quarters. But most of it was this quarter. We had a -- we did an internal Fair Labor Standards Act analysis around our entire firm. So we weren't subject to any penalties, et cetera, in the -- by the DOL or anyone else, when they look at that at a later date, which caused us back  overtime pay off about -- over $2 million around the entire firm, most of it in the IT ops areas where most of the clerical-level employees are and some in the branches. So -- but most of it was in the PCG area. Another one was the $5 million catch-up charge for some of our deferred plans, where people had reached retirement age and aren't subject to forfeiture anymore. And that was in the fourth quarter. Those were the 2 biggest things, and there were some little true-ups around the firm. To your second point, I think, your -- I would expect that your number, hopefully, is light, that we -- like I said, I think we're probably 1\/4 of the way, at least, in the September numbers. We severed 30 people at the very end of September, so that hasn't been reflected in this yet in terms of any comp savings. But probably 20% of the, what I'll call, the synergy expenses have already been incurred through the integration of ECM and the beginning of integration in Fixed Income. And like we said, when the rest of it happens, it's going to be primarily in comp.","Devin Ryan - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Yes. And my numbers were on a -- I was talking on a quarterly basis, not annualized, as well.","Jeffrey Paul Julien","Yes. So I mean, I would hope that -- yes, I hope comp is inflated by more than your $10 million to $15 million, post integration.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions. I will turn it back over to management for closing remarks.","Paul C. Reilly","Thank you, Jodi. Thank you, all, for joining us this morning. Again, I think it was a very good quarter, given everything was going on in a tough market. And it reflects all the work we're doing and a lot of work left. So I appreciate your time this morning, and we'll talk to you again soon.","Operator","Thank you. That concludes today's Raymond James quarterly analyst call.

First, I'm really pleased with the overall results of the quarter and I think that you need to reflect back on our first calendar quarter where we have a lot of seasonal factors that typically impact us, which we'll talk about a little bit later in the call. Overall, we had record quarterly net revenue of $1.81 billion, up 16% over the prior year and 5% over the preceding quarter. We had record quarterly net income of $242.8 million, up 115% over the prior year's quarter, but you have to remember we had an unusual legal expense item in that quarter and we're 104% over the preceding quarter, but again then we had the tax charge from the new Tax Act in the preceding quarter.","We had no non-GAAP adjustments in the quarter, so I'm going to use some comparisons of GAAP numbers versus our adjusted net income. But our GAAP versus our adjusted net income was up 29% over the prior year and 2% over the preceding quarter. So, the seasonal factors that Jeff may get into a little bit, first, we had fewer days in the quarter, a couple of fewer days and that impacts interest income and our fee billings, so there's a couple percent drag really on those items. And expenses, we have our FICO reset that starts as we start paying FICO taxes starting this quarter. We have our mailing expense in our year-end statements, and we also ran a flight of advertising this quarter. So, those expenses are in this quarter, which usually are elevated over the rest of the year.","We had record quarterly net revenues for the Private Client Group, Asset Management, and Raymond James Bank and record quarters for the two biggest profit drivers, pre-tax income for our Private Client Group and Raymond James Bank. I think most impressively for the quarter, we had a 16.7% return on equity, and our return on equity includes both tangible and intangible capital. A lot of firms exclude intangible capital, which would significantly raise our ROE compared to our peers. So, if you look at that ROE adjusted, I think you'd find that we've outperformed most of our competitors. We also have no preferred equity, we all have common equity, so there's no adjustments to the denominator either.","More importantly, maybe our key drivers, we ended up with records; client assets under administration of $729.5 billion; we had financial assets at a record under management at the quarter-end of $132.3 billion. Our number of financial advisors, 7,604, were up 382 year-over-year and 67 sequentially. Client assets grew even though the S&P Index was down 1.2%. So, if you look so far for the year, the first half of our fiscal year, we had net revenues of $354 billion (sic) [$3.54 billion], up 16% versus last year's first six months, and record net income of $481.7 million or 23% (sic) [32%] over last year's first six months. So, again, we think it's a very, very good quarter.","I'll give you a little color on the segments, the Private Client Group had record net revenue and pre-tax. We've had great retention which has really been the key to our growth. We focused a lot on recruiting, but our recruiting has trended up even over last year's recruiting levels, so recruiting is extremely strong. And all of our channels are independent, our employee, our financial institution division, RIA divisions, all had recruiting growth.","The other thing, I think, that's really kicked in is Alex. Brown, it is showing very well. We closed the transaction and we retained 92% of the trailing 12s which is extremely good compared to any transaction, especially the European bank private client groups. But since then, we have 30 advisors who have joined or committed to join in the last 18 months, and a lot of those have been in the Northeast or West which are target areas for expansion. So, after a year of settling in, they've really had great traction and performing very well.","They've also helped bolster our ultra-high-net-worth platform as we've expanded our alternative investments, our private equity solutions, and our lending to ultra-high-net-worth clients, but still within our Raymond James kind of conservative underwriting. But we've been able to grow those types of products focused for those clients, not for the masses. We've also had robust asset growth really over this time of period, so the Private Client Group has done very, very well and continues on its steady trend of growth.","In Asset Management, we had record net revenues, financial assets under management of $132.3 billion, up 2% sequentially, despite the S&P drop. We had a successful integration of Scout and Reams. They're a great fit into the family and off to a great start. If you remember that transaction, it had added $27 billion in assets last November. Our growth in financial assets under management is driven largely by increased utilization of managed accounts in PCG and we anticipate that continuing.","Raymond James Bank had a record quarter both on net revenues and pre-tax. Loans ended up at $18.2 billion, 13% year-over-year and 3% sequentially, and growth really in all of our major loan categories. Bank NIM increased to 3.21%, up 13 bps sequentially and over last year, driven by short-term interest rates. And even though the Fed funds rate is up 75 basis points over the last year, LIBOR, if you look at 30 and 90 day, if you look at our mix of loans, they're up probably by average over 100%, so that spread and growth has actually helped increase the Bank's earning, and we've had lower-than-expected deposit betas. And this shows a little bit why, for some of who've asked why we didn't load up the Bank balance sheet with fixed rate securities, you can see the impact as rates go up that our balance sheet in the Bank adjusted very, very quickly.","And had we loaded up over the last year, if you look at \u2013 even though there's not an accounting charge, if you look at disclosures, a lot of those securities would be underwater if they were forced to be liquidated. So, we take kind of a long-term economic look as we add any asset to the Bank's balance sheet. Most importantly, the credit metrics continue to improve where we had declines in nonperforming asset as a percent of total assets and a decline in criticized loans as a percent of total loans.","The Capital Markets is the area that's been challenged. We had a slow start in M&A, but we told you we felt the pipelines were good and certainly in March we had a big rebound that did help investment banking revenues, both year-over-year and sequentially. However, the challenge industry-wide is I think you'll see as the non-bulge bracket firms certainly report this in institutional equities where the market has been weaker and MiFID II has had an impact for us less than 10%, probably about 8 percentage range, but for a lot of people already maybe 10% or more on over-the-desk commissions.","In fixed income commissions, as the market has been quiet and a flattening yield curve and low rate volatility has certainly impacted those trading volumes. So, if you look at both institutional equities and fixed income commissions, they're down during the quarter. That flat yield curve, maybe with the movement in the last week, maybe help us going forward, but I think we're still cautious. So given that, I'm very pleased with our results for the second quarter and our key drivers look in good shape.","So, with that, I'll turn it over to Jeff for some more color in the line items. Jeff?","Jeffrey P. Julien - Raymond James Financial, Inc.","Thanks, Paul. As usual, I'll only talk a little bit about some of the variations from the consensus model, although I would say, this quarter, there were relatively few. As most of your notes already reflected, we came in pretty much very close to consensus on revenues and earnings both.","On the securities commissions and fees, it was a miss versus consensus. Paul already mentioned the short quarter, which does impact fee billings to some extent. But also, the bigger factor was the weak institutional commissions, both on the equity and fixed income side. PCG, the transactional commissions continue to be a little weak, but the fees, as you know, I think the fee-based assets were up 6% starting the beginning of the quarter.","Looking forward on that line item, PCG, as you can see in the press release, PCG fee-based assets are up 3% versus where they were at the end of the preceding quarter. So, we got a little bit of a tailwind on the billings, despite the drop-off in the S&P for the quarter. The investment banking line, I know we were guiding toward a lot of headwinds in our operating statistics releases throughout the quarter, but we got, once again, a late M&A surge in March that saved the quarter in terms of total investment banking revenues. So, the beat on that particular line roughly offset the shortfall on the securities commissions and fees.","For the year, looking forward on that line, as we mentioned last quarter, we're hopeful we can match last year's $400 million type revenue for the investment banking line, although we've got some work to do in the second quarter, which has historically been a little \u2013 the second half of the year, I'm sorry, which has historically been a little stronger for us. But we're still optimistic that we can perhaps achieve that same level of revenues.","Paul mentioned the investment advisory fees. Scout and Reams are performing as expected. The assets are still here. We got a little bit hurt by the shorter quarter in terms of days. Even though we bill things on a quarterly basis, it is prorated by days over the course of the year. The other item that had an impact in that particular line item is, bear in mind that for the investment advisory fee revenues, 60% of our fee-based assets are billed in advance, generally all the PCG-related fee-based asset.","But all the institutional type accounts, which are about 20% of the assets, are billed based on average over the course of the quarter and 20% are billed in arrears, particularly the institutional \u2013 individual institutional accounts. And so, if you're looking at billings at the end of March versus the end of December, the assets could actually have been down on a per account basis, so then the volatility in March obviously had an impact on the average assets. So, it wasn't quite as clean as just the change in total assets under administration or assets under management.","The net interest income line, we surpassed $200 million for the first time in a quarter. Couple components to that, Paul mentioned the Bank NIM at 3.21%, that was a combination of factors. We put a page now in the press release, page 12, which gives the details of the Bank's net interest margin. You can see on that page that it was driven partly by having less cash on the balance sheet, which is a somewhat low-earning asset. And Paul mentioned the LIBOR increase versus Fed funds, the Bank's loans are generally priced off of LIBOR, some off the one month, some off the three month, and that has moved up faster than the Fed funds rate on the deposit side. So we enjoyed a little bit of a benefit from that.","We've been giving you guidance looking forward there of the 3.10% to 3.20% range, I think that's probably still a good range, although it looks like we're trending toward the higher end of that range at the moment because of those factors. But I think that's still probably a good range for now. The other part of the interest income is the general overall corporate results which reflected the full impact of the December 2017 rate increase.","Deposit beta is a tough one to answer. We're staying as competitive as we think we need to be with all of our peer groups. We look at this every week in detail. So far, for example, of the March rate increase, we've passed through 45% of that to clients, but still deposit beta is very low relative to where we thought it would be at this time. And unless competition dictates that we move higher again in the near future, the March rate increase will actually further assist earnings in the June quarter to the tune of $12 million to $13 million or so. So, it's a hard call on deposit beta. It's historically low.","One of the related factors here, as we put in the press release now are total client cash balances and you can see in there that's been on a fairly steady decline. I wouldn't call it a rapid decline, but it's a steady decline as some clients who have cash that's a little more permanently allocated to cash, they're buying what we would cash alternative products and CDs or purchasing money market funds that we don't sweep to and other things for better yields. So, it's something we keep an eye on is that cash balance, of course, is the primary financing source for our Bank's growth.","On the comp side, the comp ratio came in at 66%, which is below our 66.5% to 67% target, despite the FICO reset and I think that we could predominantly give credit for that to the benefits of the higher interest spreads which have very little variable comp associated with it. Communication and info processing was a big jump from the preceding quarter as almost everyone noted, mainly some timing of projects coming online and consulting fees being incurred and things. But year-to-date we've averaged $90 million a quarter which is kind of in line with our guidance of high-80s to $90 million.","This quarter, as Paul mentioned, was impacted to the tune of probably $2 million to $3 million by the seasonal factors of mailing of 1099s of our summary statement for all of our capital access, which is our cash management account. All those accounts get a 13th statement summarizing their activity for the year and then obviously we had all the shareholder mailings related to our annual meeting. So, those things all hit in this March quarter, so that was somewhere between $2 million and $3 million of cost that is a seasonal factor. Going forward, I think we're still comfortable with our high $80 million to $90 million a quarter type guidance for that line, for the rest of this fiscal year.","The other line that took a little jump was business development. That's going to be a little lumpy when conferences hit. We have virtually nothing of that sort between conferences and trips in the December quarter. So, when you look sequentially, it looks like a big increase, but we have conferences in each of the other quarters. The other thing that we did was run some flights of commercials. Those of you who watched the golf tournaments may have noticed them on the Golf Channel, which is where I happen to see them most often. So, our guidance was of the $40 million a quarter roughly for that line, I think, is still good for the rest of this fiscal year at least. We probably won't be running flights of commercials every quarter. So, I think we're still in line there, just the December quarter was particularly light in that line item.","Bank loan loss provision was a little higher than one might expect, given about the $450 million of net loan growth for the quarter. And as we mentioned in the quote to the press release, aside from all the variety of activity with upgrades, downgrades, payoffs, and sales, and other things that we do during the quarter, we did also add some reserves related to the general interest rate environment as an upward trending, particularly a rapidly upward trending and maybe you don't think a 25 basis point hike every quarter is rapid, but it does add up when you get to three and five-year loans. So, the impact that that rate environment has on certain of our borrowers where it increases their debt service requirements can be of concern, so we added some reserves for those credits that are particularly sensitive to the rising rate environment.","Tax rate was reasonably close. There's still some factors that we don't totally have our arms around and we still don't have answers on and interpretations of, et cetera. But we are assuming about a 28%; it did come in lower than that for a variety of factors. But I think that the 27% to 28% range is probably still good for the rest of the year, plus or minus whatever impact corporate-owned life insurance has on that. And if you remember, that kind of works in opposite directions. In a rising equity market, that will lower our tax rate, and in a declining equity market environment, that will increase our tax rate related to the COLI.","Couple other metrics; the segments which are on page 7 of the press release, for PCG, we ended up with a margin of 12.4% for the quarter versus 12.6% in December. So, still both nicely above the 12% target that we had set as that segment continues to benefit from the interest rate increases. Paul mentioned the FA counts and we would just continue to remind you that the increase in financial advisors and the resultant assets under administration really are what drive the majority of our growth in this firm as they fuel a lot of the other segments.","Capital Markets had a margin of only 7%, which is well below our 15% target, as all three divisions in that particular segment have been challenged for various reasons. Equity capital markets, we've talked about a slower underwriting environment and that's partially contributed to the weak overall commissions in that division. Fixed income, the flat yield curve has resulted in weaker commissions and also in weaker trading profits in this particular quarter. And tax credit funds, they're still in the process of rebuilding their pipeline and that business may or may not be repriced a little bit as tax credits are a little less valuable. They may do an equivalent volume, but may be slightly less lucrative to us in terms of the revenue side. That remains to be seen for the rest of the year.","Asset Management was nice to see AUM up despite the S&P 500 decline for the quarter, but remember that's a point in time measurement. We may have won a couple of big mandates late in the quarter that didn't really contribute much to revenues. Those revenues I talked about were impacted somewhat by the March market volatility, so you can't just draw a direct correlation between their revenues and assets, but it's largely in sync.","And RJ Bank, we talked about the NIM, loan growth there. That gave them record revenues and pre-tax. So, from a segment basis, three of the four performing very well, particularly when you look at the year-over-year comparisons, you see nice double-digit growth on both revenues and pre-tax in three of the four segments.","Just a couple other comments, the overall corporate pre-tax margin of 18.3% for the quarter and for an adjusted basis for the year-to-date as well is nicely above the 17% type target that we had set last year. And again, we'll reset targets here this coming quarter as we get into budget season and hold Analyst Day, which is typically where we unveil sort of our new targets for the coming year. And likewise, the 16.7% ROE for the quarter, 16.6% year-to-date adjusted also surpassing our 15% goal for the current environment.","So, lastly, I'll say that all our capital ratios climbed during the quarter, because the fact is we had a nice net income boost which boosted equity and we had really very little in the way of total balance sheet growth. So, all the risk-weighted assets and total assets and things didn't really change particularly during the quarter. So, as a result, all of our capital ratios strengthened even a little bit further.","So, that's on a line item-by-line item basis some better color. Now, I think Paul's got some comments looking forward.","Paul C. Reilly - Raymond James Financial, Inc.","Thanks, Jeff. Just a few, we've covered an awful lot so far in the call, but really I think a good quarter and our momentum based on our key business factors should continue. We have near-record levels on most all of our business drivers. The interest rate hike in March, as Jeff talked about, should continue to help. So, overall we're good in position.","There is changes on the regulatory front. As you know, the DOL fiduciary rule was overturned by the First Circuit who vacated the whole rule. The Department of Labor does have really till May 7 to appeal to the Supreme Court. We think that's unlikely, but who knows and there may be other challenges by other groups, but we think most likely that rule will disappear, but you never know.","In the meantime, the SEC has introduced the best interest standard. The standard is fairly short. It is only a little over 1,000 pages in its release, so as regulatory areas go, as we go through it, it seems workable. It's not everything we love in it, but it's we think certainly more balanced, but we will work with it. And the SEC will be taking comments over a comment period, so that rule could change also, but from a distance it looks like a positive trend and a more balanced and more flexible ruling for investors.","Private Client Group, we talked about recruiting, we're trending over last year and the growth is happening in all of our divisions. And then, once again, Alex. Brown is really getting great traction. So, the retention of our financial advisors is a focused one. We've got a great group and as long as we do that and have good recruiting, I think we've got really a strong outlook. Quarter 3, we should benefit really from starting firm with higher assets and fee-based accounts, up about 3% in the cash spreads.","In Capital Markets, Jeff really hit this is that the M&A business looks good, and public finance and tax credits look like they're recovering and should help. Underwriting still looks a little challenged and the real headwinds are in the equity institutional commissions and fixed income markets, although hopefully with the 10-year moving up and getting a little more volatility, maybe we'll get some more action, but that remains to be seen.","Asset Management also benefiting from their starting assets for the quarter. So, it should be helpful. And the Bank continues to perform well. So, feeling good is the starting part going into this next quarter, but certainly don't know what's going to happen in the markets.","I want to make one comment before I close really on capital deployment. First, our strategy has not changed. We have a long-term focus on utilizing and deploying our capital to grow our business. Our retained comp is partially tied to return on equity, so we're very focused on that to do the right thing, but we're focused on the long term, not the short term. So, we want to grow our business first. We do look at continuing to grow through niche acquisitions and investments in recruiting. But any acquisition first has to fit our culture, be strategic, and most importantly also have a positive return to shareholders.","So, we're very disciplined. And a couple of years ago, we had a lot of pressure saying where are the acquisitions, and then we announced three pretty close together: Alex. Brown, 3Macs, and Scout and Reams, which have so far been very good and very successful, but we do them when we can do them. Our dividend policy hasn't really changed, it's 15% to 25%, and with the tax changes and earnings increase, certainly is morphed to the lower end. But the board, I'm sure, will be looking at that in its next meeting or meetings, but that strategy hasn't changed.","I think also as we talk about even with the capital levels having a 16.7% return on total capital, not just intangible capital, that we're using our capital well for the long term and really providing good returns to shareholders, which is really our focus in capital management. So, good quarter. I think we're in a good position in the industry and in the markets.","And with that, I'll turn it over to questions. So, Ashley, why don't you open the line up?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes, sir. And your first question comes from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.","James Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Hey, good morning, guys.","Paul C. Reilly - Raymond James Financial, Inc.","Hey, Jim.","James Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Hey. Maybe just a question on the recruiting in PCG, and an update sort of on the West Coast. It seems like you've gotten better or you're ahead of the game a little bit on the Northeast, but West Coast maybe not quite as developed. Can you just sort of update us on how the West Coast penetration is going? And do you see sort of Alex. Brown-type opportunities there that could help jump-start the penetration there?","Paul C. Reilly - Raymond James Financial, Inc.","Yeah. So, first, we certainly have a lot of room, which is the good news, to recruit both in the Northeast and the West. And if we can get anywhere towards average market share in the rest of the country in those two states, we'll be growing for a long, long time. So, it's our focus still. We've made good progress in the West, but we didn't have the kick-starter of a big Alex. Brown recruit.","Alex. Brown really made a statement with significant presence in Baltimore, New York and Boston, so in the key areas. So, we haven't found that type of opportunity for the West Coast, whether that be LA, San Fran, and Seattle. So, we're doing it organically. We're beefing up our recruiting resources. We are growing and recruiting there, but we certainly have a lot of room. So, if we found something that fit our culture and was a good fit, we would do it, but we're not going to do something just to do something. So, it looks like at least for the short to near term, we're focused on organic recruiting out West and look forward to the opportunity. I think we've got a lot of opportunity to grow.","James Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","No, certainly. Do you feel like momentum there is improving?","Paul C. Reilly - Raymond James Financial, Inc.","It's improving, yeah, but we've got a lot of opportunities still. So, we're still small, but certainly our recruits are growing and, again, in all channels, both independent and employee, and Alex. Brown has added commits in California also. So, we're focused on it. Just had a meeting with Scott and Tash that run those two divisions on recruiting out West, so it's been a focus really for a number of years, and we're making progress. But again, we don't force numbers. I mean, I could give them a challenge for numbers and I'm sure they could hit them, but we only want quality advisors and good business. So, we're deliberate and we're taking a long-term focus, but we certainly have a lot of energy around recruiting out West.","James Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","No, absolutely. And maybe for Jeff, one question. In terms of cash levels at the bank, it did come down and it did help the NIM as you reinvest that cash, but it's still above $1 billion. What is the right level of cash? Do you still see reinvestment opportunities going forward from these levels?","Jeffrey P. Julien - Raymond James Financial, Inc.","Yeah, we've got targets for how much liquid cash we need to keep on hand at the bank. It's generally between $500 million and $1 billion, just so they can be in a position to fund any loans that they're needed any day, et cetera, without having to borrow or us having to do some kind of machination with the sweeps or anything else. So, it was just heavier than usual in the December quarter, as we were reallocating some of the bank sweep assets out of other banks over to our bank in anticipation of their growth. So, we try to stay ahead of it a little bit. So, I think the level that they've been running at in the March quarter, on average, is probably more realistic for where they need to be.","James Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","So, the upper end of that range is probably a safe assumption?","Jeffrey P. Julien - Raymond James Financial, Inc.","Yeah, probably. As we try to stay ahead of their growth, that's correct.","James Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steven Chubak with Nomura Instinet.","Julian Craitar - Nomura Instinet","Good morning, guys. This is actually Julian Craitar filling in for Steven.","Paul C. Reilly - Raymond James Financial, Inc.","Okay.","Julian Craitar - Nomura Instinet","Hi. So, just a question on capital. So, I appreciate your commentary at the end, but this quarter's strong earnings and significant capital build reinforced the challenge of not having a clear capital deployment strategy where the pace of capital build continues to exceed your organic growth needs. And despite your reluctance to load up on securities, we would argue this has dampened your earnings potential and weighed on the earnings multiple. When should we expect a more fulsome update and any change in your approach?","Paul C. Reilly - Raymond James Financial, Inc.","Well, we will update you as we make changes. So, our approach has been consistent. We can do a lot of things to bolster short-term earnings at the risk of longer-term economic issues. Acquisitions tend not to be pro rata. They are lumpy by nature. So, we don't have a quarterly acquisition program to fill in our capital needs. It's a long-term strategy and sometimes we get them, sometimes we don't.","So, we will look at \u2013 again, a lot of people try to anticipate the Tax Act just because the Tax Act came in effective really for us at the end of the year, one quarter ago doesn't mean that we're just going to knee-jerk and say without looking at the impact of the running of our public finance business, our tax credit business, our muni business, a lot of other things. So, we could anticipate it or we could do what we always do here is take a longer term, more measured approach and I think that's why we had our 121st consecutive quarter of profitability. And we're still, even with heavy capital by most people's standards, generating superior things.","So, yeah, we could do things for short-term profits. We don't do that here, we do things for long-term profits. And we will analyze again both the impact of the tax law changes, the business mix, and make good longer-term decisions for the firm. So, we're one quarter in to the new tax regime. Certainly, it will be a topic of our May board meeting on capital allocation, but we try to be very clear on our capital deployment and we understand that we have pretty healthy capital ratios.","Jeffrey P. Julien - Raymond James Financial, Inc.","I would add to that, Julian, with respect to growing the securities portfolio at the bank, I mean first of all you're not getting paid much to do it, it's a very flat yield curve. We're very opposed to taking a lot of duration risk, which you'd have to do to get any kind of yield pickup right now. And thirdly, we could grow that portfolio significantly and really wouldn't use much capital because the instruments we're buying, it only takes $25 million of capital to support $1 billion of securities. So, it just doesn't seem the logical thing to do to get overly aggressive in that at this point in time, and on top of that, client cash balances aren't growing. And so, which...","Paul C. Reilly - Raymond James Financial, Inc.","And rising interest rates too \u2013 environment, so.","Jeffrey P. Julien - Raymond James Financial, Inc.","And why would you \u2013 and we would \u2013 again, I want to take duration risk in the face of a rising rate environment, not an excessive amount of duration risk.","Julian Craitar - Nomura Instinet","Understood. Appreciate the color, guys. That was helpful. What about in terms of like an annual buyback plan?","Paul C. Reilly - Raymond James Financial, Inc.","We've had a plan which we announced previously to kind of buy back on a dilutive basis. We did it in one chunk. And again I said, the board will read this at the capital plan in May. Again, our view was a lot of people took knee-jerk reactions when the tax law was announced. We haven't, because we wanted to analyze it and see the impact of our business, and we're going to relook at it at the May board meeting.","Julian Craitar - Nomura Instinet","Got you. Okay. And then one last one from me, but switching gears to Capital Markets. Are you guys planning to take any actions on your IB trading businesses, just given some of the regulatory challenges that you've cited, such as like MiFID within your trading business?","Paul C. Reilly - Raymond James Financial, Inc.","I think we have taken actions and have trimmed costs, and others. The model for research is challenged across the industry right now, and certainly it has been really for a decade. And MiFID's probably accelerated a trend that already started. So, we're being rational. We have no plans to exit the business. Our focus for a number of years has been to grow M&A, because the public markets have become increasingly private markets and the M&A business is reflecting that. So, we are taking, I think what I call, reasonable business approaches and watching costs on the one side, and growing the part that we think will continue to grow. But no plans to exit or anything drastic.","Julian Craitar - Nomura Instinet","Got it. That's it from me, guys. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. Hey, guys.","Paul C. Reilly - Raymond James Financial, Inc.","Hey, Chris.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey, so it sounds like Alex. Brown has a lot of momentum. Can you guys maybe comment a little bit about what's resonating there?","Paul C. Reilly - Raymond James Financial, Inc.","Well, I think that it has momentum and certainly probably focused more on the ultra-high-net-worth space, but it's relative, the other divisions have a lot of momentum too, right? So, I think each of the positions, whether it's our Raymond James employee channel, which has ultra-high-net-worth clients also; the Alex. Brown, which is a brand that's been focused really on that area, the independent side, are all growing.","And one of the things for Raymond James that I didn't create, but inherited that's been great for us, is that we have advisors choice, that we have all these platforms that advisors can choose how they want to affiliate. So, it's been a real advantage as people move from employee to independent to RIA, or RIA to employee to independent, whatever the movement is that we have those options. It certainly helps with the retention. So, Alex. Brown is doing great. We expect it to continue to do well as we do the other divisions. Right now we have positive momentum in every single one of our affiliation options, which is good news for us. And hope it certainly continues. It bodes well for us if it does.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","A lot of people tend to think about all the regulatory changes that have happened on the financial advisor side as being universally bad. But I didn't know if you guys maybe thought that actually might be helping you on the recruiting side. Do you think that's been a factor? Or does that really not have anything to do with it, it's kind of all the other things that you mentioned?","Paul C. Reilly - Raymond James Financial, Inc.","No, I don't think it's \u2013 the regulatory environment, I think, for everyone has gotten tougher. I mean that's just where it has. I will say that it's \u2013 since the elections, has been more balanced. I think our worry a year ago was so many rules were coming out so quickly, it was hard to keep up with them, and now there isn't. I think people are looking both at existing rules and making sure they're balanced and they're not seeing a flood of new rules. So, that's been the positive on the regulatory side.","What's really driven recruiting is that we just have a model where we have great respect for advisors in our \u2013 whether it's our trust department, our bank, or anything else doesn't compete with our advisors. And many advisors feel at many institutions that they're trying to own their clients and they're competing with the different divisions. So, here we tell the advisors they own their book and they can leave any time they want. So, protocol wasn't even an issue for us because they could always leave and always could.","Second, we don't allow our trust department to call on a client, the bank, they have to go at the invitation of the advisor. Our bank doesn't solicit mortgages or credit cards. We don't put mailing stuffings in. We don't do anything to compete with our advisor, maybe sometimes to our economic detriment, but certainly we think to our long-term benefit. So, I think we just offer right a platform that has the technology and scale to offer advisors what they need, and many are joining us because they feel like we're supporting them versus competing with them. So, I think that's been the secret to the recruiting.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Makes sense. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Conor Fitzgerald with Goldman Sachs.","Conor Fitzgerald - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. Just first, thanks for the new disclosure on your cash breakdown. That's helpful. Just digging into the $900 million quarter-over-quarter decline, it sounds like based on your comments, the decline is really being driven by your clients buying cash alternatives and not rotating in the equities side, but just was hoping you could elaborate on that a little bit.","Jeffrey P. Julien - Raymond James Financial, Inc.","Yeah. That's a true statement. We track the growth of purchased money market fund positions in the firm. We don't really \u2013 we can track CDs, but that's a little harder to do. But there is no question that people who have asset allocations that have 5% or 6% or 8%, or whatever permanently allocated to cash are able to get a better yield than we are offering through our sweep program, are able to get a better yield by purchasing one of these short-term cash all taken by a two-year T-bill or a one-year T-bill.","And there's a lot of alternatives out there, and that's happening for those who have permanent allocations to cash. Those who have temporary allocations are in the middle of an investing methodology, then they continue to want to use the sweep vehicles that we've got, which are FDIC insured, which is a benefit over purchasing money market funds or some of the other instruments.","Paul C. Reilly - Raymond James Financial, Inc.","But not all of that movement was into cash. So, I mean there's a fair chunk of that's market related, too. So, $900 million did move out from cash to cash alternatives. But certainly there's a fair chunk of that that has and then some that's moving into market as well.","Conor Fitzgerald - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. That's helpful. And then on your account and service fees, can you just give us an updated understanding on how that breaks down between fees on your third-party deposits, money markets and other fees?","Jeffrey P. Julien - Raymond James Financial, Inc.","Yeah. We put that breakdown to Q, right? 10-Q.","Paul C. Reilly - Raymond James Financial, Inc.","We're looking for this at the (45:38) moment.","Jeffrey P. Julien - Raymond James Financial, Inc.","For the quarter \u2013 is it $191 million for the quarter?","Paul Shoukry - Raymond James Financial, Inc.","Yeah. Conor, I can follow up with you on that. I mean like I said it will be...","Conor Fitzgerald - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yeah, yeah, I know.","Paul Shoukry - Raymond James Financial, Inc.","(46:03).","Jeffrey P. Julien - Raymond James Financial, Inc.","We got a breakdown, but it would take a minute to do some of the math to give you percentages or anything else. But the breakdown is in the Q each quarter, it probably hadn't changed dramatically from last quarter's percentage breakdown.","Conor Fitzgerald - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. That's helpful. And then, Paul, appreciate your comments on capital. And I know M&A opportunities can kind of be sporadic in nature. But my question is, how long would you need to go without finding the right opportunity before you would reconsider your capital return policy?","Paul C. Reilly - Raymond James Financial, Inc.","Yeah. So first, we examine it constantly. We have a capital planning group inside and we certainly present to the board. So it's always open. We're not locked and we're not trying to hoard cash. I mean both the shareholders and where our comp is tied \u2013 our deferred RSUs, half of them are tied to ROE. We certainly, I think, are just concerned about getting a return on capital as every other investor. So, we always look at it. I don't know what the calling point was. We resisted when the rule changed to instantly increase dividends because we wanted to do it measure or instantly change capital and we're being very thoughtful about it.","And so, I just want to say that our policy on capital has been very much the same and the commitment we made is we can't use it, we're going to return it. And again, we know it grew this quarter and part of that because of the tax changes. So, we're looking at it and we'll talk to the board on it, but I think our long-term strategy is the same. I don't think that will change dramatically. The question is at what points do we think we have capital over-accumulated we can't use and, in that case, it would be to our benefit to return it to shareholders. I mean we're not motivated to keep it for any reason.","Conor Fitzgerald - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","And your next question comes from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities.","Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC","Hey, great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Paul C. Reilly - Raymond James Financial, Inc.","Hey, Devin.","Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC","Hey. So, I guess first question here just on some of the technology investments that you're making. I mean it seems like it's a bit of an arms race right now to add capabilities and there's a lot of innovation occurring around back-office functions and digitizing there and then adding the capabilities to help advisors become more productive. Can you maybe just talk about some of the investments that you're making into the system right now, and then also how we should think about the related impact on spending over the next few years, because it seems like that's one kind of inflationary trend and just trying to think about how that could flow from here?","Paul C. Reilly - Raymond James Financial, Inc.","Yeah. I think that in the whole industry, the technology spend is certainly up and there's certainly a lot of uses for it. And where we've really focused is two things. One is making sure that we move from multiple platforms to first having a one true source of data for five years. What we haven't \u2013 people don't recognize, probably internally or externally, the amount of money we've spent. And with our last initiative going through, which is our automated client onboarding that when we get through this, which has been a little painful to the field as we really collect the data, we'll have one exact source of data across all of our platforms to be able to help clients and our advisors with a lot of data.","So, that is that money and we spent money. We started with, first, the advisor apps, won awards on our mobile \u2013 our mobility of all of our advisor apps on our iPhones or iPads to make sure that they were up-to-date. And I can tell you from prudent (49:58) that we're extremely competitive. I never want to say we're the best, but we're extremely competitive on those platforms.","We secondarily are now spending a lot on the client interface to those apps, so we've had on the board robo-like technology for our clients. But we wanted to do the advisors first to make sure that there was an integrated communication. And those are being rolled out now. So, a lot of the spend is really what I call into those client-facing apps right now. And the other part is supervisory and compliance that we are going through a rewrite. And we feel that we want to also have world-class supervisory and compliance systems that actually instead of compete with the advisors just help them make great decisions right at the point of entry.","And so, we've been updating those systems and we've added both a new chief compliance officer and new head of supervision recruited from outside. We've really beefed up kind of our capabilities in those areas. So, that's kind of the big back-office spend we've been going through right now. And through the last few years, we've done things from cash movements and other things in the back office to speed those up. So, we've kind of focused really a lot of our spend on our Private Client Group business, although we've also invested in the bank systems, loan monitoring systems. And I can go through division by division. But the biggest dollar spends have been PCG and advisor and client-facing systems.","Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks, Paul. And then maybe just a follow-up here on kind of industry regulation. So, a couple of things. We're approaching the end of the comment period for FINRA's rule proposal on outside business activity, which could affect oversight requirements for some advisor activity away. I know Raymond James doesn't allow kind of outside custodians. And so, I'm just curious if you have any thoughts on that rule. If there's any implication on Raymond James, or just kind of thought on the industry more broadly. And then also kind of similar kind of theme, the SEC's proposal that could require RIAs to have greater licensing and continuing education requirements, and if that's actually maybe a good thing.","Paul C. Reilly - Raymond James Financial, Inc.","Yeah. So, first of all, we don't get paid on assets held away. We don't have any of those issues that I think they're worried about at other firms. So, the rule changes would have pros or cons that certainly would clarify supervisory responsibilities. They should be more clear than \u2013 the rule is a little high level, so a lot of our questions is what does that mean. And then what monitoring requirements would we have if assets are held away in an RIA and we had commissioned-based assets on issues like client suitability, concentration, other things because we couldn't see them all.","So, I think that in discussions with Robert Cook and FINRA, they are listening to kind of the issues, and there are pros and cons I think to that rule. We're not overly worried about it. There are things we like about it, like certain outside business activities if you join a charitable board and you're an independent advisor, you become treasurer of your church board, I mean really how much do we need to supervise that.","So, those kind of areas, we think, are good. The supervisory ones are a little tricky is, how do you supervise if you don't see the assets. The proposed rule is voluntary, so you can choose to have your own policy, but you're not required to. So, you ask about competition and all the implications, and we've had a good open discussion with FINRA on it. So, I think that rule, I don't know where it will go, but I think it's early to tell. But I can't tell you I've been up the last month worrying about it too much, although we have provided feedback on it.","Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC","Got it. And then the SEC just looking for commentary around greater requirements for RIAs around licensing and continuing education, which I know has kind of been maybe one benefit to being an RIA. So, I'm just curious, is that potentially higher bar or something that would change the momentum there or you change oversight requirements, et cetera. I'm just trying to think about that.","Paul C. Reilly - Raymond James Financial, Inc.","Our view has been first, we're supportive of the advisors in any channels. But we think that both the requirements and the supervision should be similar no matter where you practice, because at the end of the day we're here to protect clients and to get them to invest. So, any rule that kind of makes sure that any advisor and any business is qualified, and that is both whether that's a licensing or testing, and then ongoing education in which we spend a lot of money helping our advisors and our advisors do on their own too, the continuing education would be good.","So, I think the trend of the rule is good. We'd rather see one kind of set of rules apply to everybody. It'd certainly simplify our lives and make it a level playing field, but I think this is a move in the positive direction. And again, the devils in the details. We're going to spend a lot of time, I think, in that rule and who you can call an advisor, or an advisor which I think is a little bit weird in the way it's presented, but I understand why it is and things like that. But in general, I think the SEC rule is a good step forward that allows, first, advisor and client flexibility, pushes for full disclosure which clients should have anyway.","And we've always thought we had a best interest standard with clients, so we've been, as you know, advocates. Although we publicly opposed the DOL rule and testified \u2013 I think we're the largest firm to testify to Congress against it. We've been advocates of the best interest standard and the SEC has stepped up to propose one, and like any rule parts are good, there are parts we would tweak, but that's, I'm sure, every firm has a little different view. But I think it's a really good move in the right direction and we'll see during the comment period what comes out.","Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC","Yeah. Great, okay. Appreciate it, Paul. Thanks a lot.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time.","Paul C. Reilly - Raymond James Financial, Inc.","So, great, I'd like to just thank you all for joining the call and I believe we had a good quarter. Our assets show and positioning in advisors that we have good momentum and hopefully the markets will be conducive over the next quarter. So, thanks for joining and we'll talk to you soon.

Good morning, and thank you all for joining us on this call. We appreciate your time and interest in Raymond James Financial. After I read the following disclosure, I will turn the call over to Paul Reilly, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jeff Julien, our Chief Financial Officer.

A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures may be found in the schedule accompanying our press release.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Paul Reilly, Chairman and CEO of Raymond James Financial. Paul?","Paul Reilly","Great. Thanks, Paul, and good morning, everyone. Well, this earnings release marks our 120th consecutive quarters of profitability, so 30 years of quarterly profitability. That's a quarter since Black Monday, when we had a small loss because Tom kept the retail trading desk over to help clients. So it's a big benchmark for us. It shows long-term performance. And as we work towards our 121st consecutive quarter, it's comforting to know that the federal government has funded itself all the way until February 8. But despite what happens in the markets, we seem to be able to perform based on our kind of overall long-term strategic outlook. We're pleased with the results this quarter. Private Client Group, Asset Management and the bank, all had record net quarterly revenues and pretax income. The Capital Markets' quarter was disappointing but as we'll speak about a little later, I think a lot of that was really timing related. ","For the quarter, we had record quarterly net revenue of $173 billion, up 16% over a year ago and 2% on the preceding quarter. And quarterly net income of $118.8 million, down 19% or 39% sequentially, but really affected by the estimated discrete tax impact of $117 million.","If you exclude that tax impact and the $4 million related acquisition expenses, our adjusted net income of $238.8 million or $1.61 per diluted share was up 33% from a year ago and 9% sequentially.","Quarterly annualized ROE of 8.4% and adjusted quarterly annualized ROE of 16.8%, which is really very good considering our low leverage and strong capital position. ","Maybe more importantly for the business, our quarter ended with records in all of our key business drivers, record number of financial advisers, record asset under administration of $727.2 billion, record assets under management of $130.3 billion and record net loans at the bank of $17.7 billion. As you look to the segment, Private Client Group, as I already said, had a record quarterly net revenue and pretax, really driven by just continued retention of our advisers and still very, very solid recruiting momentum. We continue with our growth in fee-based assets. And before we get too carried away, we had a little help from the markets and interest rates with the vibrant equity market and the tax law change. But with that, our fee-based assets accounts grew 32% year-over-year and 8% sequentially, and our client assets under administration up 46% over a year ago. So all very strong numbers.","Although year-over-year cash is still down, we had a nice sequential uptick in client cash at $44.3 billion, which has also helped drive interest earnings, as Jeff will talk more about. Asset management record quarterly revenue up 32% year-over-year and 15% sequentially, record pretax profits of 37% year-over-year and 18% sequentially, again, all strong numbers. And that's a combination of organic growth, increased private client penetration, rising markets and inflows, and of course, the Scout and Reams acquisition, which added $27 billion to our AUM.","We're thrilled to welcome Scout and Reams to our Carillon Towers Associates, which is now comprised of Eagle, ClariVest, Cougar and Scout and Reams. The bank had record net revenues and pretax, as stated earlier, really driven by net record loans of $17.7 billion, up 12% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. And this growth was diversified against our residential mortgage, SBL and tax-exempt loans. It's good growth across the board. More importantly, the credit quality continue to improve. Credit size loans were down 11% really due to payoffs. The bank's NIM down to 308, 3 bps down, but Jeff will talk about it. A lot of this was really attributed to the tax law change than cash balances.","Capital Markets was a very difficult quarter. Net revenue is down 7% year-over-year, 18% sequentially. Pretax down 78% year-over-year and 89% sequentially. The year-over-year decline has been really -- a lot of it's challenged institutional, fixed income and equity commissions. That's been due to the whole industry. We had low volatility and a flattening yield curve. ","Sequentially, though, the numbers were really driven by investment banking being down, particularly M&A. We had a very strong September 30 quarter and they tend to average out. And a lot of the, we think, the underperformance is really just timing of closing, so the M&A tends to be a very lumpy business.","So overall, good results, we believe, strong performance. I'll talk a little bit about the outlook for those segments after Jeff goes through a little detail in some of the numbers. Jeff?","Jeffrey Julien","Thanks, Paul, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to say that the variances from the consensus model were fairly minor with a couple of exceptions this quarter and only one item was a negative variance. So I think that does well for us getting the story out and you understanding the story. On the top line, our big headline numbers, securities commissions and fees, the consensus was reasonably close. We had a very modest fee there mainly because of transaction-based volume, including in the institutional segments we're a little better than they were in the previous quarter than the preceding quarter. But I think on a fee basis, everything's pretty close as we disclose fee-based assets.","The negative variance and what everyone's commented on in their comments so far as investment banking line, which was down 50% sequentially, was a fairly weak quarter for virtually all the divisions in Capital Markets and there are some detail of that line item in the press release. But you can see that if you look at last year, we had a similar start so there may be some seasonality at play here. But this follows, obviously, a very strong September quarter for us. It looks sequentially quite slow. And we made some comments in the press release that it's not a matter of activity levels, it's more a matter of timing when individual revenues get recognized.","On the expense item, really looking at Page 5 of the press release at the moment, on the expense side, communication and information processing was lower than we were guiding you to last call. And we would say that our outlook is that we do think it'll trend higher on a quarterly basis for the rest of the year and we're sort of staying with our high 80s per quarter guidance that we gave you. Maybe last quarter, this one was a little lower, just has to do with the timing of new systems coming on stream, et cetera. So I think the high 80s is still a good number for modeling purposes there.","The other expense that beat pretty handily was business development, and that's also a timing question. They're a timing of when we run flights of our commercials. They're timing of visits, which is seasonally around the holidays, get a little slow in terms of some of the recruiting activities. There's also timing of conferences in December. We really have no major conferences where we do in all the other quarters. So we would still stay with the high 30s to $40 million per quarter type estimate on that line, even though it was lower than that in this particular quarter.","Another expense that was under projection was the bank loan loss provision. We had almost $700 million of net loan growth in the quarter. So with our -- given our reserve is a little over 1%, you would assume if the mix was the same, it'd be about a $7 million loan loss provision for the quarter. That didn't happen, obviously, and that was mainly because we had -- we received payoffs for about 5 or 6 criticized loans during the quarter. The sponsor stepped up or the projects were able to refinance, et cetera. So that released a lot of reserves in the quarter. And you can see that in the decline in criticized loans and criticized assets.","I think the 1% of projected net loan growth is probably still the right way to model that line item going forward.","And then the 800-pound gorilla is income taxes. I think the consensus model that we had, I think, was before people even tried to adjust. We issued an 8-K on January 11, talking about how the interest rate would work for us for the year where we used a blended federal statutory rate of 24.5% for this fiscal year. Our actual effective rate for the quarter adjusted was 24.1%, and the reason that is low. So federal is 24.5, obviously, there's state taxes on top of that. So we think 28%, if I had to pick a number for the rest of this year, 28% is probably about the right blended rate to use for modeling. The reason it was 24% this quarter had to do with our seemingly ever-present COLI gains, at least for the last year. And then, as you know, in our first fiscal quarter, we have the equity comp benefit and we've talked about that in the past. It's not quite as lucrative as it was when rates were 35%, but it'll still mean about $10 million or so of benefit in the December quarter going forward.","And then the onetime charge, we were estimating $120 million when we put out the 8-K. We're currently estimating $117 million. The reason it's an estimate is it depends on when some of these deferred items are realized because at this year, obviously, they'd be realized at the higher rate than next fiscal year when we really will be at 21% federal statutory rate. But that was refined to $117 million. A little over $100 million of that relates to revaluation of our deferred tax asset, the biggest items in there being deferred compensation, a bank loan loss provision and, to a lesser extent, legal provisions. And then the balance of it was deemed foreign repatriation from our Canadian subsidiary.","So for this year, again, I'd use -- for modeling purposes, I would probably use 28%. And then for next fiscal year and forward, I'd probably use a blended rate of 25% plus or minus whatever you want to assume for COLI and other things that might happen in the quarter. But for statutory rates, those would be good items to use.","A couple of other things. You may notice on the P&L, we no longer have a line item called clearance and floor brokerage. It was a fairly small number. It's may or may not -- maybe a required line item on broker-dealer financials, but it's certainly not in ours, holding company level financial. So we've merged that into the other line so that won't be a separate line going forward.","Investment advisory fees, I should note Paul mentioned the Scout, Reams acquisition, which closed in mid-November. That aided investment advisory revenues by about $9 million for the December quarter. So you could assume, at least for the current level of assets, about $18 million a quarter of revenues from that. It may be slightly dilutive to the asset management segment margin, but not dramatically so. So that's pretty close. I think we told -- we mentioned $70 million to $75 million annually when we did the transaction last year. So that's falling right in line with that.","Net interest income, obviously, a record number there, $192 million for the quarter, the deposit beta getting all the hype. By the way, when we talk about the deposit beta for us, it doesn't pertain to that $44 billion that Paul mentioned. It pertains to about $24 billion of that. And then there's about $2 billion that's in various money market funds and then the rest is swept to Raymond James Bank, which shows up in the Raymond James Bank net interest margin separately. So we're really talking about direct earnings on the $24 billion. And some of that is not an interest. It's in account and service fees from external banks as we've talked about in the past, but still impacts the P&L.","Since the December rate hike, we've moved to raise rates to clients twice, but the total amount of that move on a weighted average basis is just a little under 10 basis points. So our retained spread has grown to about 130 basis points on that $24 billion. We are now seeing frequent but fairly small adjustments from the competitors. So if nothing happens in March or June or whatever the next potential hike is, my guess is there'll be some compression of that. If there's another hike in March and\/or June or other times, we may be able to take advantage of a little bit of the lag effect and maintain this beta for a period of time. But for now, we're certainly enjoying a historically high and potentially unsustainable spread on these cash balances. So that was a beat slightly.","On the RJ Bank net interest margin, we've added a page to the press release, Page 9, which is basically the computation of the bank's net interest margin on a quarterly basis. We get a lot of questions about that. I think we put that in our Q, but we have it ready in time. We'll just include it in the press release. And you can see the two factors. Obviously, we had a little bit of lift from the client -- from the raise in rates for 0.5 month at the bank as well. But the real reason that the NIM decline was two things, it was higher average cash balances as we sweep more cash on balance sheet in preparation for continued loan growth and securities portfolio growth; and secondly, the revaluation of the taxable equivalent yield for the tax-exempt portfolio was a pretty big factor. And you can see that in that table pretty apparently. So that was an impact of the Tax Act on the NIM.","Our comp ratio for the quarter was 66.8%, a little better than our stated 67% target, but worse than the preceding quarter. This one was driven mainly because of the embedded comp in the Capital Market segment, which then we just did not have the revenue production from that segment this quarter. So as a result, that segment had a high average comp and that high comp ratio and that drove the entire firm's comp ratio up just a little bit. So if they get some normal activity, we would think that we might get back to the low 66s again, like they were in the preceding quarter. ","We did mention in the last quarter and quarters before that we made a grid adjustment to Private Client Group. What I would tell you was it yielded virtually no benefit to us in this particular quarter. What's happened is since we started formulating that grid adjustment 3 or 4 quarters ago, there's been enough bracket creep from people with good production with help from the markets because a lot of our assets, as you know, are fee based. That virtually ate up the benefit that we would have seen in one of the divisions and the other divisions phasing theirs in over time. So we haven't -- we didn't -- aren't really seeing any benefit from that except it would have been higher if we hadn't done it, I guess, is the benefit that we saw, but it didn't really have a direct impact looking at the ratio compared to prior periods.","A couple of things on Page 8 of the press release, Paul mentioned the ROE of 16.8%. I mean, that's the highest I can remember in a long, long time for a quarter here in the adjusted pretax margin of 18.3%. Obviously, both those things were interest rate aided, interest spread aided. And then in our case of the ROE, tax rate aided as well. We'll be fine-tuning our targets in this area now that the Tax Act has passed. And we'll be updating our targets and we'll let you know when we have some better feel for all the impacts to the Tax Act. It's not just the rate to us, but it impacts some of our businesses as well as it impacts tax credit bonds, impacts public finance and the municipal bond area can impact tax-exempt lending at the bank. So we've got to look at the impacts on all these businesses to try to fine-tune our targets.","Also on that page, you can see the capital ratios. They're all modestly lower, both at the holding company and the bank, than they were in the preceding quarter, mainly due to the asset growth of the company for the quarter, over about $1.2 billion in total assets. But we didn't really have the accompanying capital growth, mainly because of the discrete tax charge that Paul mentioned. So that we didn't get -- capital didn't keep up with the asset growth because of that charge. But going forward, I would not expect that to be the case, particularly as we had a lower tax rate going forward.","I do want to make sure that everyone noted the footnote by the growth in financial advisers, footnote 11. We -- if you remember last year, we had a recategorization of some advisers out. We actually subtracted about 100 because they were in predominantly nonproducing roles. This quarter, we did -- we had the opposite in another division of the company, where we've had people that met certain test for production assets. They're all on a team meeting with -- whatever the various tests are that they really truly are full-time producers and put into that category now. We're not trying to show the highest number possible. We have a lot more registered people than that. We could show a higher number. We could show a lower number. But what we try to really do is show what the people that we think are their primary mission is, full-time adviser production. And so we're trying not to distort average assets and average production in numbers like that. So that adjustment was made. It was still a decent recruiting quarter.","Actually, in both divisions, we just had in the employee side a larger than normal number of retirements and people leaving the business. And some switching divisions and other things that cause them to look flat for the quarter. But in the contractor division, we had a nice recruiting quarter of 70 or so advisers.","Last comment I'll make, one thing you can't see and hear is the percentage of recurring revenues for the quarter. It actually reached a high, partially aided by poor investment banking revenues, which are all transaction based. But it hit 73.9% for the quarter. So for the quarter closing in on three quarters of our total revenues in the category we call recurring.","So with that, I will turn it back over to Paul for some outlook comments.","Paul Reilly","Great, and thanks, Jeff. First, just the overall market and business confidence is, obviously, is high right now. So don't know how long it lasts and certainly subject to other things, including government staying open and global issues. But everything looks positive right now. ","There are several tailwinds really coming into the quarter as we talked, again, just our primary drivers are at records. Adviser and advisory recruitment is still strong. Our assets under administration, asset under management will lead -- should lead to higher billings in the quarter. And we expect the bank loans record to continue to grow but more at a modest pace. Certainly, the interest rate changes should help us into the quarter and we'll see where it kind of goes going forward. There's been a lot of talk about the Tax Act and the effect of the philosophy of companies and what to do with those earnings, and this won't be a shocker for anyone who's followed Raymond James very long as it doesn't really affect our overall philosophy. Our focus stays first on our clients, our advisers, our associates and shareholders. Our strategy is still to focus on organic growth and be very disciplined about acquisitions. We continued to look for acquisitions in the market. And if we find things that culturally fit to our business at a reasonable price, we'll do that. I don't think the Tax Act really changes that. ","Our dividend payout ratio has stayed in the 25% to 30% range. I'm sure the board will review, now that that's up going forward, what to do there, but our payout ratio has been very consistent for many, many years. We've only purchased shares opportunistically when it made sense for the company. I don't think this act changes any of that. Now if we get to the point we feel like we can't deploy capital effectively, we'll look at other ways of returning it. But so far, we feel like we've been able to do this. And this philosophy has driven our long-term performance, and I think we see no reason to change really the basis of how we operate.","We have not announced any major things for associates. We have traditionally looked what other firms have done both on minimum wage, and for most of our employees, they get over 7%, putting deferred programs for them this year already. We gave bonuses really in the last two years, and this year, we gave bonuses for those impacted, which is a big part, in Irma. And we'll continue to look at this year where we have an associate survey out now on all of our benefit plans, what the fair thing to do is, but we don't -- we're not going to do anything knee-jerk just because it passed. We'll continue to look and see what's fair and make sure that our associates are treated well and fairly and the shareholders.","One of the changes I think we're starting to feel is really some change in the regulatory tone overall. We all know about the delay now in the DOL. The SEC now is in conjunction with the DOL and working with FINRA, and the industry input is looking at a standard to go across all accounts that's more holistic and, in their words, really focuses on preserving choice for clients and their advisers. So DOL, the most draconian parts of that have been delayed and we think probably won't get enacted. And we'll have some overstaying or mirroring type of, we believe, something from the SEC. They said it's a high priority.","The tones from the regulators on top has changed. You hear very consistent we are your regulators, we're going to regulate. But they're looking at a more balanced, cost-effective, cost benefit type of approach. Now that may take a while to get down through the system, but you really can't feel it maybe in the lack of new rules that were coming out left and right before the administration change. ","One of the things I think that has had bipartisan support, both in the last administration and this, is lifting the $50 billion threshold, which obviously, as we get closer to that, would be a positive for us also.","A lot of industry press on the broker protocol. Some firms have announced that they were leaving the broker protocol. And at Raymond James, we are just steadfast supporters of broker protocol. We recognize the importance of the adviser-client relationship and don't believe it's our place to interfere with that. Also, the impact of leaving that broker protocol in place, it really kind of forces us to focus on making this the best platform. ","At Raymond James, one of our foundations has been we focus on clients first, next on the advisers, even to the point that we give book ownership to our employee advisers. We say if you want to leave and go to a firm and you're in good standing, we'll help you move them. And that forces us to really be the best platform for them and their clients, and we believe it's a positive. ","We also believe that clients deserve the right, it's their right, to choose what adviser they have and what platform they're on, and we believe it's not our job to interfere with that right. So we continue to be strong supporters of the broker protocol and believe it's just an inherent right of clients and advisers.","To close, outlooks in the division, Private Client Group. Our strong adviser growth and pipeline, together with higher quarterly fee billings, should bode well for the coming quarter. And cash spreads have certainly still helped the Private Client Group, and again, without any major changes, there should be a lift in that to the Private Client Group segment. Asset management, same factors are really driving them and with the addition of Scout and Reams fully on the platform for a quarter. And again, record assets under management should bode well for the quarter.","RJ Bank, we continue to expect disciplined growth. This quarter was a high growth number for a lot of factors, including tax-exempt loans where a lot of people wanted to refinance before the tax law changed. But so the growth was higher than normal, but we will keep the same model we've had and look at as long there's good loans, good ROEs, we -- I think you'll still see the kind of growth you've seen in the past.","Capital Markets, I think that challenging on institutional commissions and equities and in fixed income should continue. That's been a challenging part. But M&A, the underwriting and equity on -- the whole equity underwriting and M&A business looks -- the backlog looks good. So I think you'll see more of -- to our old guidance for the year. We have no reason to change that.","Near term, we think public finance as a tax credit business may be still a little impacted getting back up, but the markets will find their equilibrium. So the tax credit, as long as there are CRA requirements, it'll be a balancing of sellers and buyers for those tax credits and may have some impact on profitability. But we assume those will work through the pipeline. Might take a little bit, another quarter to do that, but we feel pretty good about the long-term outlook.","Jeff talked about the expense ratios, and I think our guidance really still hold on expenses. The comp ratio was a little elevated because M&A was down, which has a lower comp payout. But the guidance, I think, holds. And remember that we have FICA reset year-end mailings and all those things that hit us in the first quarter. ","So I believe we're in great shape. Our positioning's good. We don't feel like we're super managers because of these numbers. We realize we have market help, so we stay disciplined, realizing that markets aren't always this robust. We'll enjoy them while they happen. I think we're in a good place to monetize them, but we always focus what happens if it goes the other way to make sure we're in good shape. ","So with that, I'll turn it over to Tamara for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question is from the line of Devin Ryan.","Devin Ryan","Maybe the first question here, just -- and it's a few parts, but I want to dig in a little more around kind of the tax reform commentary and some of the benefits. So capital is building, sounds like the philosophy is very consistent. But I guess, the first part of the question is, do you feel like it moves the ball forward at all on M&A? Obviously, that's a priority. So does it feel like maybe some things are moving closer as a result to having uncertainty or for any other driver? That's part one. And the second part is on spending. Do you lean in more on any specific projects or technology spending? Just trying to think about how you may look to spend some of that. And then the last part of the question is around just competition and it doesn't seem like there's any obvious areas where the benefit could be computed away. Maybe lending, but just trying to think about anything I might be missing there in your business.","Paul Reilly","Yes. I think, Devon, one of the things that's good here, just because we have more money, we don't feel obligated to spend it. So on acquisitions, we really look -- we continually look. We have a corporate development function. I think the ones we've done so far, we need more time in the last three to show they paid off or four, but we think we did very good strategic cultural acquisitions and we continue to look. ","Obviously, the more capital you have, if they're a little bigger, maybe you're -- you feel like you can do them, but I don't think it fundamentally changes anything there. We have a very robust technology spend, but the one thing about technology, we never run out of ideas or more ways to spend it. But I think our guidance is, for this year, is about what we can do well. If there's overspends, it may be for consulting help or stuff. I think we've got a full plate of technology and the guidance we've given you is a good guidance.","So our view is just because tax rates are down doesn't mean we should change the fundamentals of the business at all. So the question will be over the next year or so or two if we're accumulating capital faster we can deploy it, what do you do with shareholders? So far, we feel that capital ratio is built slightly but it's been in the range and we found areas to invest it, and hopefully, we can invest it to make it a better platform and business. And if we can't, we'll look at Plan B but I don't think it changes anything short term.","Devin Ryan","And then areas that -- things might be computed away or some of the benefit could be computed away over time?","Paul Reilly","No. I mean, there is all -- there's talk about how, in lending, it will be all given back to clients. I'm not sure we see that yet. Just like interest rates weren't all given back to clients in the industry. We're the first to raise a number of times and no one followed. So now we're in maybe the middle or upper middle of the pack. But I don't see any rush on loans or any part of our business to give away tax. We always associate -- we always look how our associates are treated. I think we've adjusted that and we may have some adjustments, but that'll be more on the fairness market comp, making sure we're treating our people well, which I think we always have. So I don't see anything from our management team. We just came in an off-site and I don't see anything that jumps out on us where we feel like that because of this found money, we should do anything different right now.","Devin Ryan","Got it, okay. And then with respect to the broker protocol, I think Raymond James is pretty clear in its position here. But obviously, the status of the actual protocol seems like it's a little bit fluid here in the firms that are in and\/or out of it. And so I'm just curious, now that several or even a few kind of large firms have now backed away, is your appetite to recruit from those firms lower? I know that there's obviously been over time firms that are not in it and you still recruit from them. So I'm just curious kind of does that create more complexity in recruiting at all? Do you still feel confident in kind of playbook to recruit from firms that are not in the protocol?","Paul Reilly","Yes. I think that there's a number of firms that we recruit from are non-protocol and we just make sure we follow and the advisers are instructed and taught that they have to follow the letter of the rule. And as long as they do that, they're still free to move and their clients can follow them, subject to whatever contracts they have and following protocol. So I think we're just very clear on those folks what it takes to come over, and we've been doing it for years. We disagree that, I think, protocol was really raised by the industry given regulatory concerns on clients have the right to choose their adviser and know where their advisers are going. And there may be some regulatory intervention on this, too, that will help reinforce the protocol. So our -- people have always said our book ownership policy was going to hurt our retention, and our retention's been really world-class. And again, we think it's quite the opposite when you lock people in. It gives you an excuse not to perform well. ","And we don't think that's a good factor for us or our clients. So it hadn't hurt us so far. We book ownership protocol. We haven't seen anything really in the pipeline. Might be a little slower getting the first members over under the new rules, but so far, so good. So I don't see any drastic change.","Devin Ryan","Okay, great. And then just last year, tax credits and debt underwriting, I mean, do you have any sense of how long it could take the markets to adjust tax reform? Do you think it's purely timing or maybe more so for the tax credits business? Do you think it drives a structural change to that market and then trying to think about some of the other inputs, infrastructure if we do kind of move a plan forward here without actually being a catalyst for the debt underwriting side? I'm just trying to think about some of the moving parts.","Paul Reilly","Yes. I think in public finance, there'll be a little bit of input, a little bit of volume change just because of things that aren't available. But did -- I don't think it will be that significant. The tax credit business, we already have had the slowdown since they've talked about reform change and no one wanted to speculate on what the rate was going to be and there's a gap between buyers and sellers. The project developers wanted the old rate and the banks didn't want to take the risk on the new rate. Now we know what the rate is. So that'll adjust economics. May hit our margins some and it's going to reprice. And as long as there's CRA needed, I mean, this wasn't bought on a competitive to other investments. It was bought for CRA and a reasonable return. And I think that will reprice and now people know what the rates are and we get through that phase, we think that business should be fine under current rules.","Operator","The next response is from the line of Ann Dai.","Yian Dai","The first one, I just wanted to zero in on expenses quickly and see if there were any meaningful amount of expenses, whether in comp or some other expense lines that might have essentially been pulled forward into fourth quarter with the tax reform and that you might not expect to recur.","Jeffrey Julien","Yes. No, there was nothing that we did in that regard. As you know, our effective tax rate is for the entire fiscal year. So by the time the law got passed, we are already in the lower rate the environment. So we really didn't have the same opportunity that calendar year and the company's had. So we -- with expenses felt like they felt, we did know -- had no reason to do any manipulation. It'll be the same rate in March or June as it was in the December quarter.","Yian Dai","Okay, makes sense. And another quick question on MiFID. Now that we're just -- were a few weeks into 2018, can you give us an updated view into the discussions that you're having with clients around MiFID II? And just give a sense for what you think the impact might be to the equities business on a year-over-year basis.","Paul Reilly","So I'm not sure we're prepared to really talk about what the impact will be. Certainly, the discussions are there. And certainly, as we've always said, it's not going to be a positive, right? So it's any time you're negotiating and you have something like MiFID, it's a reason to drop what you pay people. So I think it's early. As an overall part of our business, Raymond James as a whole, it's not that big. But certainly, it's not going to be a positive impact. But it's too early to tell you what that's going to be right now.","Yian Dai","Okay, understood. Last thing's on CRE. Just looking at the yield decline in the CRE portfolio, was that driven by new loans and a reflection of where the market is today? Or was that decline more from repayment of old loans or roll-off of higher-yielding stuff?","Steven Raney","Yes. Ann, it's Steve Raney. Yes, it's kind of the normal flow. I would say, there's been maybe more pressure in commercial real estate in terms of spreads that the market is demanding now. And as you know, we have a lot of clients that are REITs that tend to be lower price than the project finance loans and our loan growth in REITs was a little bit higher in the quarter. So it was repayments of prior loans. Jeff cited that we had a couple of criticized loans that were in the commercial real estate category that paid off in full and then replaced with new loans at lower spreads.","Operator","Your next response is from the line of Steve Chubak.","Steven Chubak","So was hoping to dig in a little bit more and early clarify some of the tax guidance on the 25%. And Jeff, I know that the 21% federal rate, the state and local has run on average on an adjusted basis for the lower deduction about 3% to 4%. So it tells us that you're essentially assuming no benefit from additional tax credits, which is since a lot of the benefits appear to have been preserved even with the change in the tax law, whether it's things such as low-income housing credits, I'm just wondering what level of future credits do you think would be reasonable to assume going forward and to what extent is that contemplated in your tax guidance.","Jeffrey Julien","Yes. Well, we have kind of things that go in both directions. I mean, we have -- I mentioned that we get the benefit of the equity comp provision in December quarter of each year. That's going to impact that rate. COLI can work either direction, depending which direction the equity markets go. The new law also isn't all positive. There are some clawbacks to the lower rate. We lose some of our meals and entertainment deduction. We -- next year, not this fiscal year, but next year, we'll have some equity comp impact -- equity comp -- have some executive comp impact, my bad, going forward. And in fact, because our bank is over $10 billion, we have a phaseout of some of our FDIC premium deductibility. So everything's not just change the rate and it's done.","There are some other factors, and we're having to do a little bit of -- obviously, we don't know what the markets are going to do for COLI and -- but the other things, we do have a reasonable handle on. And so that weighted average -- and that's a weighted average statutory rate with these things that we're aware of is the guidance I'm giving you. The big swing there in either direction is going to be what our $300 million-or-so COLI portfolio does on any given quarter, but I think everyone's sort of used to that now and the impact on rates. And -- but if the markets are relatively flat, that shouldn't have a huge impact. So those all factored into our estimate of the rate I would use for modeling going forward.","Steven Chubak","Great. It's extremely helpful. I had a follow-up just relating to some of the discussion around capital management priorities. As I think back to, it was 1Q '16, when your stock was trading at north of a 20% discount to the market. You guys got pretty aggressive and actually bought back shares. I know it's a very different environment then. But just looking at the improvement in your earnings profile, you're actually trading on a tax-adjusted basis, just taking your new guidance at an even higher discount today. And I'm wondering, what valuation levels are your guys looking at when considering the potential for additional share repurchase? I'm just trying to understand some of the dynamics given the pace of capital build that we're expected to see, what we should be expecting and the bank growth targets you've already outlined, whether you guys might have more appetite to actually initiate a share repurchase program.","Paul Reilly","So once again, I think the discounts you're referring to are to the S&P, not to the financials. So we're -- we look at share repurchases just as opportunistic and where we can earn a return. We don't look at it to manage capital. So as -- just as a mechanism, a short term, to do something with earnings. So everything we do is very long term. And so the rule's just been passed. We understand. We should have, right? If the markets don't turn, we just can't assume the markets are going to continue to be constructive and we're going to make all that extra money. But we'll look and we're not going to do anything for a quarter. We're going to look as we go. We're going to look at our growth and our acquisition opportunities. And if we can use the capital, we'll use it that way. If we can't use it, we'll look at alternatives. So we don't feel in any rush to do anything different and our philosophy hasn't changed.","We just may have a little more capital to do things with. So I think speculation that we're going to buy shares now just because we have much -- we have more capital isn't -- doesn't fit our philosophy that we've had for many, many years. So I know we are under pressure before we repurchase shares to repurchase shares, and when we waited and did what we did, everyone said, well, you guys are pretty smart about it. Now all of a sudden, we're down because we're not doing it right again really fast. So we're going to hold our philosophy. And I think part of this long-term growth and return that we've had in out-performance has been because we look long term, not just how can we do something for the next quarter or two. So you're going to see the same type of behavior. We just have -- may have a little more capital. If the markets hold up, to do -- to look at.","Steven Chubak","And just one final one from me on the deposit beta commentary. I'm just trying to parse it a bit since I know you guys have tended to be fairly conservative in terms of some of the guidance that you've given. I mean, it looks like the messaging, though, from your peers has suggested that the positive beta from here should track more in line with historical levels. They've cited somewhere in the range of 50% to 60%. It felt like with some of the remarks, that essentially the competitive dynamics are really going to dictate or anchor what you guys do on the deposit side. Not necessarily relying on what we've seen historically in the last rate cycle. I mean, is that a fair reasonable expectation? So long as competitors are running within that range, that you guys aren't going to deviate materially from that?","Paul Reilly","I'd say we have two principles. One, we're going to be competitive. If we have to be the business, we are going to be fair to clients. And I think that our view has been, at some point, there will be a demand for cash and rates will get more competitive than they are today. So that may or may not happen. The spread between client deposits and other alternatives, whether the government funds and others widening, and at some point, interest rate markets are competitive like any other ones. So I think it's pretty speculative to say that we're just going to give away half of the future increases. At some point, if history's been -- is going to hold true at all, that's going to get much more competitive. And there are times when those rates are double years ago, right, when rates were very, very high. So we will just see. We'll -- that's why we're conservative in guidance. We don't know. But we're certainly -- we're not in a race just to be the highest. I think we're being very thoughtful, being very competitive, but we don't want to be fair also.","Operator","Your next response is from the line of Chris Harris.","Christopher Harris","We may have to go back a bit in time to answer this question. But wonder if you guys could help us understand what the environment was like for adviser recruiting prior to the broker protocol. And I think getting that perspective would help us try to gauge what things might look like if protocol were to dissolve for some reason.","Paul Reilly","That's a good question. It's been around a long time now, and we're a different firm than we were back then, too. So with our size and scale, I don't think we were the -- today, we are one of the alternatives from people leaving bigger firms. Back then, we did recruit but certainly not to the level and size we do today. So the market's very, very different. I don't know if you can draw that conclusion. We can certainly look at how we recruit from non-protocol firms today, and they don't seem to -- it doesn't seem to get in the way. So I don't know if I'd be prepared to go back in a different firm. It's a very good question and maybe we ought to talk about that a little bit and think through it here. But it was a different time. We were a different firm, it's a different market. 60 firms that took us public, there's eight names left. They're all not in the Private Client Group business. I mean, it's a dynamic market. But good question, I just don't have a good answer for that right now. But we don't -- again, what I can tell you is that our pipeline looks very good for recruiting.","Christopher Harris","Got you, okay. And then another sort of related question I was wondering about, firms that make the decision to get out of protocol restrict adviser and client movement. Do you think that ultimately might be able to be challenged under fiduciary standards?","Paul Reilly","I think that I know that we've raised it. I know some of the regulators are looking at it, which we believe the clients have an endemic right to know where their adviser is and to choose advisers, whether they leave us or join us. So I actually think and I know at one point regulators were looking at it when the industry came up with protocol. And we certainly are raising it. And another, I think that's the place to -- for it really to be solved just to say what's the right of a client. And it's hard for me to imagine, talk to yourself as clients with your adviser your accounts. Do you feel like you should know where your adviser goes or have the right to choose? And I think it's a fundamental right of investors. So we'll see where that develops out and if regulators take a stand on it or not. But we just think it's the right thing to do.","Operator","Your next response is from the line of Bill Katz.","William Katz","A couple of tactical questions, a lot of the big picture questions already asked. As you think about the interplay on the business for the NIM, just wondering if could give us sort of an update on how you sort of think the NIM plays out over the next couple of quarters as you potentially redeploy some of the pickup of cash you may have gotten from the strong growth in the business.","Jeffrey Julien","I think the NIM will -- barring anything else, it should go back into that 3.10% to 3.20% range that we were sort of guiding to. I mean, we'll get a full quarter of the benefit of the rate hike in December that some of that does and near to the bank is well. And at least I don't know, Steve can comment, I don't haven't seen the Tax Act cause any particular compression there of loan rates at this point.","Steven Raney","Yes. Bill, we haven't noticed anything yet. Obviously, it's still early days in terms of spread compression that I would attribute to that. I mean, we've seen credit spreads obviously come in quite a bit over the last couple of years, so just given a lot of demand for loans, but I would not attribute any changes here recently to any of the tax law changes nor is our strategy changing in terms of the types of credits that we're going to pursue nor do we expect to have a lot higher average cash balance than we had this past quarter, nor do we expect to expand the securities portfolio aggressively in the face of rate hikes. So those won't be factors that drag on it particularly going forward either.","William Katz","Okay. And just sort of circling back to capital management again, sorry to beat the dead horse. But it sort of seems like with the tax reform, that you'll have a nice step function up in the ROE of the company, even if markets sort of stabilize from current -- past growth. So certainly, it seems you are going to build a fair amount of capital. So is it really just something on the spending side that you've been delaying that might pick up a little bit? Didn't sound like that from your prepared comments are in technology. Just trying to understand in the give and take around the capital generation and the return of the company.","Paul Reilly","Once again, I think the theoretical capital generation, assuming the markets are good, it gives us the opportunity. We're going to look at strategic acquisitions. We certainly are -- the biggest use of our capital right now is probably recruiting, and that's certainly been a big driver of our metric. We can think that will continue and we just don't look at doing anything outside at the moment. Technology, we have a pretty aggressive technology spend and a lot on the plate. I'm not sure how much we could really speed that up just because of capacity and competing systems that rely on each other as you're -- if you want to put out a new system, it's relying on a number of other systems, so they have limiting factors. And I don't see anything yet, doesn't mean it won't come or won't happen as we look and study this or see market reactions that would say just because we have the money, I think it's the worst reason in the world is just to spend it, right? So I don't think shareholders like it either, that because we have extra money, we'll decrease the ROE -- projected ROE because we could spend it on something. No, it has to be a good spend and I just don't see where we would inject the delta in tax savings right now on an area that would be great for shareholders outside of earnings. If we find it, we'll do something, but it's not apparent to me.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of the Conor Fitzgerald.","Conor Fitzgerald","Just wanted to ask on the cash buildup in the bank, just a little sense around how quickly you think you can get the extra $350 million deployed. And if you just comment on what type of reinvestment yields you're seeing in your securities portfolio today.","Jeffrey Julien","We can control the growth pretty readily with the securities portfolio. We're -- I mean, that certainly could fund our growth for substantially a quarter or so. We don't have a specified target. We're just trying to stay ahead of our growth in the bank on loan activity. I think this was, as Paul mentioned, this was sort of an exceptionally high growth quarter. I don't think I would annualize the growth for this particular quarter in loans.","Steven Raney","No, I would say low double digits. 10% to 12% would be a great target for us for the next 12 months. And the types of yields we're looking at in the securities portfolio right now are kind of the -- once again, in terms of the duration that we're looking at, it's kind of in the 2.75% range. Once again, we're planning to stay relatively short on the securities.","Jeffrey Julien","Yes. And the reason it didn't grow much last quarter is we're staying so short. There are huge pay-downs every quarter of the portfolio. So it's -- net basis, it's going to be a little hard, particularly if we slow down on the buy side a little bit in the face of rising rates.","Steven Raney","As a reminder, everything we're doing is agency-backed. No credit risk in the securities portfolio.","Jeffrey Julien","And the average life is generally a little over three years.","Conor Fitzgerald","And Paul, appreciate your commentary around no obvious sources for tax reform to get computed away. But what about your appetite for growth or recruiting? Like most businesses, you obviously think about decisions when you're hiring somebody partly on an after-tax return basis or earn-back basis. It just seems like mathematically, at least, a lower tax rate should increase your upside for growth or at least what you're willing to pay the recruited advisers. Do you think that flows through at all?","Paul Reilly","Yes. So first, I mean, our pipeline is very, very strong and I -- it's like anything else. You can unleash growth and you make bad decisions. So we look at the ROE. It's interesting in, if I was an investor, I wouldn't mind higher ROE instead of people just spending it just to spend it. So I mean, we're going to focus where we get good ROE. Most advisers come over and they're paid on transition as a function of their trailing 12s. So you also have to look at the markets. Is the market going to continue to grow robustly from here for the next seven years while you get that ROE back? So sure, you can raise it and we can make great models to show why it's a good investment. But also, since we are not the highest payer in transition assistance on purpose, we lose some people because it's a great selector of people that really want to be here and really believe in who we are. So we think what we pay is fair. It's certainly behind a lot of our competitors, and yet, we're having this growth.","So we don't see any reason to fundamentally change. Yes, because the ROE will be up a little bit on transition assistance? Yes. Are we going to automatically raise it just because it happened? No, we will do it because we feel like it's a good investment and we need to do it for competitive reasons. So again, we're not looking to give away the savings, but we're certainly open to investing it when we find good investments.","Conor Fitzgerald","That's helpful. And then, sorry, just one last one for me. Total capital this quarter was 23.4% versus kind of the 20% target. If I'm interpreting your commentary around the call, we should just think about that as 20% is the target, but when times are good, you're perfectly happy running with excess for some unspecified period of time?","Paul Reilly","I think that, honestly, part of our return and stability in 120 quarters is because we've had higher capital. We often get compared to banks. And a bank model on capital is very different than a broker-dealer model on capital. Capital doesn't -- it doesn't equate to cash, and it's a much more volatile cash business. So you need to have reserves for those bad times. So are we comfortable being in the high teens? Yes. Are we comfortable we have a target out there that's conservative? No, we could be in the high teens if we felt we had good opportunities to invest in something, but we're not going to leverage up the balance sheet just to do things because we can. We're going to wait for good opportunities that are long term and we believe are conservative and fit our model. So we're not in a rush. However, we also -- excess capital doesn't help us on the balance sheet. People forget that we're also measured as the executive team. Half of our -- part of our bonus goes into equity, half of that goes into an ROE-adjusted return where we can make money in ROE.","So we could do plenty of things to try to leverage up the ROE, but we don't. We try to do what's right for the firm and keep the right balance. So I know people in good times always ask us, well, when are we going to buy back stock? And I think our -- to us, there's no reason to change our long-term view. It's been successful. If we have opportunities for acquisitions, we'll do them. If we have opportunities to invest, we'll do them thoughtfully. We're not going to announce because something that happened a few weeks ago hold change in strategy. We're going to be thoughtful about it. We'll see how the markets evolve. And if we have cash we can't use, then we'll do something with it. It may change our philosophy on shareholders, but we're not ready to say our approach has changed at point.","Operator","Your next response is from the line of James Mitchell. Okay, there are no further questions in the queue at this time.","Paul Reilly","Right. Well, thank you. Again, feel very good about our quarter, our positioning and our markets. Certainly, the Tax Act and changes, you've asked a lot of questions on it. We're digesting it too, but we're going to do it very thoughtfully, and like I think we've always done is invest long term for shareholders. And certainly, the markets look very constructive in the future, but we also get concerned when comments overall get pretty euphoric because that's usually when some bad things could happen in the market. So we don't take our eye off the ball what happens if markets go down. It's great they're expanding. We hope they do for a long time for our clients and for us. But we're going to keep to take a balanced view and just do the best we can to manage the business. So appreciate your time this morning, and look forward to talking to you next quarter.","Operator","Thank you again for joining us today. This concludes today's call. You may now disconnect."],"18431":["Raymond James Financial (NYSE:RJF) Q2 2012 Earnings Call April 26, 2012  8:15 AM ET","Executives","Paul C.

Miller - Sidoti & Company, LLC","Paul C. Reilly","Okay, good morning. Jennifer, are we live here?","Operator","Yes, you're live, sir.","Paul C. Reilly","Okay. Thank you. This is Paul Reilly in Raymond James. I'm going to turn over to Paul Matecki to read our FD disclosure.","Paul Louis Matecki","Thanks, Paul. To the extent that Raymond James makes forward-looking statements regarding management expectations, strategic objectives, business prospects, anticipated expense savings, financial results, anticipated results of litigation or regulatory proceedings and other similar matters, a variety of factors, many of which are beyond Raymond James' control, could cause actual results and experiences to differ materially from the expectations and objectives expressed in these statements. These factors are described in Raymond James' 2011 annual report on Form 10-K, which is available at raymondjames.com or sec.gov. ","In addition to those factors, in connection with the Morgan Keegan transaction, the following factors, among others, could possibly cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking or historical performance. These include difficulty integrating Raymond James and Morgan Keegan's businesses, or realizing the projected benefits of the transaction; the inability to sustain revenue in earnings growth; changes in capital markets; and diversion of management time on the transaction related issues.","Paul C. Reilly","Thank you, Paul, and what a rousing way to start a conference call with a good FD disclosure. We're going to go through, I guess, step by step in the conference call to make sure we understand the pieces and talk a little bit about the quarter and kind of the non-GAAP adjustments and how I think the basic operating business is doing and go through the segments. Jeff will then go through a little more detail in some of the other things, and then we'll get into the Morgan Keegan combination, which I know a number of you have questions about.","First, I really believe we had a strong quarter in an improving environment. Our net revenues up 11% at $871 million plus and our non-GAAP pretax earnings up 22%. Now we are doing that off a weaker December ending quarter and if you go again to a year ago, we are comparing -- we're up only 3% or 2% of the net revenues that are very, very strong quarter, if we can remember the markets a year ago that we're comparing to. But certainly, a very, very solid trend, really driven by rising asset values are a strong equity market. ","Our assets under administration were up 8% and had a record of $292 billion and this is again without any Morgan Keegan numbers we closed after the quarter ended, and our assets under management up 11% at $39 billion. So on the basis of that as you know, we bill a lot of assets in advance. We've started with tailwinds in that quarter and again with the S&P up 12% this quarter should portend well to a strong start to our next quarter.","Starting with the Private Client Group. The second quarter was really driven by those asset values, and again with the tailwinds in our billings, we had record productivity per advisor at $361 million at RJFS and $540,000 -- I'm sorry, I wish it was million, $361,000 at RJFS and $546,000 at Raymond James Associates, our employee division. ","We also had a net increase of 42 advisors. As recruiting continues to ramp up, one of the slight concerns when we announced the Morgan Keegan acquisition, we felt that recruiting was taking up the impact. We were worried about an impact. There's been no negative impact and I think, as we talk to recruit the positive impact that we're growing the business and the backlog of home office visits continues to improve. ","So as we go into the third quarter with an S&P up again and more advisers, we should be off to a good start. The revenue growth there was offset by comp expense, some of that was additional personnel, but a big chunk of that is what I call seasonal, if you can use that word. The first quarter, our raises hit, starting in January, our FICA payments and taxes start over so we always have a first quarter impact on comp. The other areas we've told -- we talked about before as we have been ramping up our technology expenditures. We've got some very exciting technology rolling out, including a new advisers desktop starting in May, and it's a strategic investment we've made across the firm and that did have some impact on the numbers for the quarter.","In the capital markets area, ECM had a big recovery, really since, again, against a very weak December quarter. We can number what happened at the end of last year the markets, starting that September, really shut down. The underwriting part of our business in IPO was slow in January and February as it was in the quarter, but really picked up in March and has continued up stronger in April and who knows what happens day-to-day in that business. But if you look to the -- commissions were up, underwriting revenues were up versus last quarter, but M&A activity was down slightly. So again, improving significantly from a very weak market the quarter before, but certainly not at the levels that we were a year ago, where we had a strong equity capital markets.","Moving to fixed income. Fixed income has been kind of a steady producer for us, with the announcement of Morgan Keegan. I think people had some concerns but again, we're showing a strengthening -- slight strengthening through the quarter for fixed income and trading profits and commissions. So business is performing very, very well. Asset Management, again, it's kind of our Steady Eddy business. Assets were up both from market appreciation, as we've talked about earlier, and continued net inflows. So off the back of a 4% increase in the revenue side. We had a 5% increase in profits and again the markets coming in should portend well for a good start this quarter. ","The bank had outstanding performance for the quarter, record earnings, basically 2 factors here. We've continued to grow loans, as you remember, $400 million of that was the Allied Irish Bank loan portfolio that we did finally close on that drove significant loan growth, as well as other loan growth. As you can see through this year, we've had good loan growth and improving credit. If you look at the loan loss provision there almost all of it was attributed to the Allied Irish Bank acquisition. So we've had strong credit metrics and improvements and pay off of loans that have continued to, I think, show improving credit performance of the bank. ","What I'm really proud at, I think we had solid operating performance, but this is all accomplished while we were working on the Morgan Keegan integration. So people were doing their day job and the other job and when we get into the acquisition expenses, you're going to see that those costs are really only adjusted for direct costs of that acquisition and acquisition planning and it doesn't include the massive amounts of people time and other efforts that are going focused to integrate Morgan Keegan, which I'll get to that one in a minute, but that has gone extremely well. We've got a lot of work to do. We can't declare victory yet, as I said in the release, but we're very pleased with where we are to date.","Moving into the -- projecting into the third quarter based on the S&P up and improved ECM environments, net recruiting and a strong loan book at the bank and good credit, I think, portends positively to third quarter and we've also have to add the small factor of Morgan Keegan combination as we report next quarter. ","So with that, I'll turn it over to Jeff Julien to give you a little more color. Jeff?","Jeffrey Paul Julien","Thanks, Paul. I just want to reiterate that we had a whole host of records this quarter. I think that's important to note going into the second half of the year. We had both record gross in net revenues, record Private Client Group revenues, record Private Client Group average productivity, record assets under administration, record assets under management, record bank pretax earnings for the quarter, and although this one's a little bit out there, if you use a non-GAAP section of our release, that's actually a record pretax income number for a quarter for us.","Paul C. Reilly","Non-GAAP record pretax.","Jeffrey Paul Julien","Paul said, if we pick the right expenses to exclude, we can get a lot of records every quarter. ","A couple of other comments I'll make to augment Paul's description of what happened in the segments. We had a nice jump in book value. I'm sure you noticed it's amazing what can happen when you do an offering at 1.5x book value during the quarter. So that was somewhat as expected. Tangible book value did not see quite the same increase. ","Our shareholders equity now exceeds $3 billion. It's nice not to had have to explain the tax rate for the quarter. I'm mentioning it, but just to say I don't have to say anything about it. It was about 38.25% for this quarter and 38.75% for the year to date, which is about where it should be. We got some benefit from the appreciation in COLI but as I point out in prior periods, it's offset by some of the nondeductible meals and entertainment and other things that hit our books. These rates are about where it should be in a normalized environment on a year-to-date basis. ","We talked about the $19.6 million of hard acquisition expenses in the non-GAAP measure. That's the line item that you see in the P&L. To that, when we did our non-GAAP presentation, we also included about $1.7 million of interest expense, which is in interest expense, not in that $19.6 million, which relate to the debt offerings that we did ahead of time prior to the actual acquisition. And we also factored in about 3% dilution from the share offering that we did in mid-February in anticipation of the acquisition. Those things all added together came up with that $0.12 impact related to the Morgan Keegan acquisition. ","The ROE for the quarter, as reported, was 9.62%, again on a non-GAAP basis, so that would be about 12.2%. And on a year-to-date basis, it was 9.83% reported, again on a non-GAAP, excluding those costs what we'll call operating -- core operating earnings was about 11.25% that's year to date. ","I think the surprises for the quarter relative to what was projected and I've read some of your comments this morning. The bank loan loss provision I think was a surprise, it was the Allied Irish portfolio shrunk from the time we initially started talking to them to the time we consummated the transaction. So our provision for that originally started at somewhere around $7 million, ended up only being about $5 million. But the rest of the entire bank's portfolio on a net basis was really yielded no provision expense for the quarter. ","We had some net growth, which there was some provision expense for, but we also had a lot of credit improvements, payoffs, pay downs, things like that, that had the opposite effect. So it was basically a net neutral other than the Allied Irish acquisition, which I think was a surprise maybe even a little bit to us, that it was at that level for the quarter.","Obviously, the net interest margin at the bank held up a little better than, at least I expected, early on in the quarter thus net interest earnings a little better. Again, we had some of these payoffs, pay downs, which yielded fees but we also have, adding the Allied Irish in at a fairly high average coupon certainly helps the net interest margin as well. So that will maybe be a little higher going forward than it has been in the past. ","Another surprise I think you all pointed to other revenues. Well if you look at our segment basis that's really in the Proprietary Capital segment. We had a fairly significant writeups and distributions received from some of the private equity funds in this quarter. That's a lumpy number, very, very hard for us to predict. As you all point out, usually it's a June quarter event as we get the audited statements for all the smaller ones that we're invested in, but there are these larger ones that, some of which we even consolidate, that we mark on a quarterly basis and that's what happened this quarter. Now not much of that, as you can see in the segment results fell to the bottom line. We do consolidate one fund in particular that we have about a 14% net interest in. So a lot of that comes out to a minority interest, but it did impact the revenue line. ","I'd also want to make a comment on the number of lead managed deals. If you've been tracking that from our monthly operating statistics to now, it looks like we had one deal in the March month. Well that obviously wasn't true. I think you know how active it was. We made the decision at the end of the quarter here to exclude from that total, the RJF offerings, which we were a joint book runner on, all 3 of them, to debt on equity, but we didn't think it appropriate to include those. ","We also made the decision to exclude some of these at-the-market deals. These continuous offerings, there were about 5 of those during in the quarter. So March was much more active than it appears. It was the monthly operating statistics that included those things that I mentioned that we have now excluded at the final count here for the quarter. ","I'll make a couple of comments on the year-to-date segment information on the press release. As you can see, again, we're comparing against a very good 6 months a year ago and then looking forward last year, you know we ended up with a record year last year, while the June quarter last year had a $45 million pretax charge for ARS in it for starters, but then we also had a very difficult capital markets environment in the fourth quarter last year. So the first half of last year was much better than the second half. While we've just about equaled that first half this year, we're about dead on in terms of net -- in terms of total revenues. We're a little bit behind even excluding the acquisition related expenses. We're a little bit behind in total pretax income, but again -- so if you look at it on a big picture basis, we're just a little bit behind where we were on an earnings basis this time last year and we had all these negative impacts in the second half of last year. So that should give us some optimism looking into the second half of this year.","In terms of the earnings, you can see for the 6 months Private Client Group's about 6% behind where they were a year ago. Paul mentioned some of the factors in our methodology, the most of operations in IT was parts that aren't allocated to other segments end up in the Private Client Group segment and IT expenditures and people have been a large factor in Private Client Group not surpassing the prior year, yet. ","Capital markets, we talked about. Last year's first 6 months was a strongest period we'd had in sometime. So that's going to be a tough comparison and it really is all Equity Capital Markets this shortfall from versus the prior year fixed income slightly ahead of where they were on a year-to-date basis last year. ","Asset Management stuff, as you would expect, modestly. We expect again some sequential improvement. As you've heard, we're at the asset level. So you see where the asset level started the third quarter and then the bank is eclipsing all records here both from an earnings and a credit perspective. So we go into the second half, I think, with some optimism. ","The last thing I'll mention is on the other segment, you can see that there's all of the acquisition related expenses, even though they've been incurred by all the segments, we're putting them all in the other segment for convenience. So that entire $20 million is down there in the other segment and the other thing impacting that of course, is the additional corporate interest from our April offering a year ago, as well as the $1.7 million that I mentioned from the offerings we did in anticipation of the acquisition. ","So a lot of facts and figures, but at the end of the day, I think a good quarter and I know that we need to talk a little bit more about what to expect from acquisition related expenses going forward. So for that, I'll turn it back over to Paul.","Paul C. Reilly","Thank you. So I think you know if you look at the operating statistics, I'm kind of proud of the organization as they've taken on their day job of running their business and the other day job of planning on the integration now well into the integration. It's great to have solid operating results going in. And I think we're starting -- certainly it started the quarter with tailwinds, but it's been an interesting market the last few years. So we're not putting anything in the bank. ","Jeff read a lot of records off to start with, but I'm sure we'll have records next quarter just because of the combination then the important thing's is going to be how we do on the bottom line in our earnings per share, which as we've said, we didn't expect this transaction to be immediately accretive but believe strategically it will be accretive and very, very strong. ","I do want to note, as I get into the MK acquisition, net-net, we're ahead on retention and we're behind -- we're doing better on our budget of costs slightly.","Jeffrey Paul Julien","Ahead meaning we've spent a little less than we've planned.","Paul C. Reilly","Ahead on retention in terms of percentage of people we've retained. We've had less overlap than we thought in some of the businesses, so we severed a little less, although it's a big number. And you have to remember too, that our MK acquisition, the numbers were based on market conditions in December. We use the December trailing 12, so part of the purchase price adjustment you saw was strong performance at Morgan Keegan. We haven't audited them and we can't give you those numbers. But in the first quarter -- so a lot of the trends that impacted us or impacting them, I can't take this -- it's a little bit of a different business, but we've got some room because of that, if we can keep the people, which is the focus, because the improved conditions in the quarter for them also. ","We are ahead of retention, as we said. Of those we made offers to in PCG and retention, we've had 98% of them still here at the quarter, and so we've done better in the retention side than we assumed. But we know we'll lose a few more advisors. We don't want to. It's just right so far to date, it's been a smattering 1 or 2 here, no particular direction and just a handful of regrettable losses. But in this market we've always had some given the checks that are put out, but we are ahead of our retention estimates to date and our job over the next year is to make sure that we make people feel at home. So we've done very, very well there. ","Fixed income, similarly we had less overlap, so although severance numbers, as we talk about as we look forward are significant across the organization, there was less in fixed income and our revenue per producer has been growing there also. So we're hopeful, but we expect more fallout, as you merge accounts and move accounts around, you do lose some sales and trading folks. But again, so far to date, we're ahead of our own budgets and estimates but we don't think that that's done yet and we'll watch closely over this next couple of quarters. ","Our retention expenses that we've spent are below our estimates, mainly on the capital market side of the business. We've spent less in our issues totally than we originally projected in estimates. We're about slightly below, but above on our projections on the PCG Group. So we feel good about those too. But this is all early. We have -- we know the combinations here. We are, we have fixed income trading off one group of inventories. We have Equity Capital Markets basically all consolidated into the RJA business and the PCG, we're operating dual systems but utilizing marketing, branding, a lot of other things and trying to use all of our resources, marketing, research and everything we can help them during this transition period before we make a systems change over. ","So, so far so good, but a lot of work ahead of us. So we're optimistic, but know we have a lot of things to do. With that, Jeff, I don't know if you want to make anymore particular comments?","Jeffrey Paul Julien","It's hard for us to really accurately project where we're going to be on these future acquisition-related costs. We had originally projected I think $70 million for the fiscal year. The interest will stop now, so it's going to be just the remaining severance related costs and other integration costs that come up for the rest of the year. And we don't have a great handle on that because it's going to be a continuing, evolving number. But I guess if we had to give you a projection for the rest of the fiscal year it'd probably be in the $40 million range plus the $20 million we've already spent gives us $60 million, which will probably come in a little under the $70 million we originally projected. But that's one of these things kind of swallowed up in Paul's forward-looking comments earlier. Paul Matecki, our counsel.","Paul Louis Matecki","There's a good chunk that we've incurred in -- that we'll incur in this quarter especially severance. But as we've told you, we've been deliberate in terms of the integration, going step-by-step and keeping support levels up. But so far so good, the market continues to be reasonably solid. I think the basic business is in good shape and we're focusing on working hard in retentions and no red flags yet on the integration, just a lot of work ahead of us. ","So with that, I'm going to go ahead and open it up for questions. I'm sure you have a number of them today. And -- so Jennifer, why don't you go ahead and ask for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from Joel Jeffrey.","Joel Jeffrey - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Just a question. On Morgan Keegan, in terms of their fee-based assets and the additions that you'll get from that deal, did they -- can you give us what the level was at the end of the quarter? And do they typically sort of price off at quarter end levels as well?","Jeffrey Paul Julien","We're thinking how to answer that one.","Paul C. Reilly","We're going through the process actually now and again, not having -- we're just finishing kind of the opening audit and balance sheet, so that's why there's a little bit of hesitance here on the numbers. They have more of a stock brokerage business than an asset management sized, a little less fee-based. So we just don't want to give you a number that's not totally accurate yet. That's the only hesitation.","Jeffrey Paul Julien","You know they've got $70 billion in retail assets that will be coming over. It'll be on our books. It won't be coming over until next year sometime. But of that, I think -- we think the numbers, just in terms of wrapped fee, we should have a better handle on that, I guess, and we do. It's something around $8 billion is the number we've been told. They're going to make sure they pick up outside discretionary as well as our equivalent nondiscretionary to make sure we get the total correct, not near the percentage that we've got, where we've got 1\/3 of our client assets in wrapped fee-type arrangements over $90 billion, including discretionary and nondiscretionary. Their number's between 10% and 15%.","Joel Jeffrey - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","And do those typically price off quarter end levels?","Jeffrey Paul Julien","I believe they're quarterly in advance like -- it's sort of the industry norm.","Joel Jeffrey - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then in terms of the capital markets revenues, can you just give us a breakdown in terms of -- on the institutional side, what the equity commission line was versus the fixed income institutional line?","Paul C. Reilly","Do we have it here?","Jeffrey Paul Julien","For the quarter, you're talking about?","Joel Jeffrey - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Yes.","Paul C. Reilly","What were you asking? An absolute number?","Joel Jeffrey - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Yes. Just the level of revenues generated by institution against traditional fixed income business versus the institutional equities business.","Jeffrey Paul Julien","They're about equal at about $36 million each for the quarter.","Joel Jeffrey - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then I guess just lastly, in terms of -- you guys sound like you had some solid growth at the bank outside the Allied Irish deal. How should we think about loan growth going forward and sort of what you're focusing on there?","Steven M. Raney","Joel, it's Steve. I would anticipate it's growth going forward kind of in the 6% to 7% on an annual basis for the next couple of years. We think that this quarter, growth would be maybe $150 million to $200 million in the loan portfolio. The one item that will be a little unique is, and we don't anticipate it closing this quarter, we anticipate it being in the September quarter but we're working on a plan to purchase the securities face loans from Regions Bank that were referred by Morgan Keegan Financial Advisers. That's about $200 million. So add of that, I think that kind of a good forecast fee to use would be loan growth in the 6% to 7% per year for the next couple of years.","Joel Jeffrey - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","So that would be inclusive of the growth you've already experienced this year?","Steven M. Raney","Well really, no. I would say, going forward, I would say, obviously the Canadian portfolio that was acquired this quarter and then we had a very robust quarter in the December quarter. So that was really higher than that forecast I'm giving you going forward. I think you're going to see some more temperate growth going forward kind of in the 6% to 7% range.","Joel Jeffrey - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","And in terms of the types of loans, are they the similar sort of the commercial type loans?","Steven M. Raney","Yes, I mean we're trying to grow our residential portfolio as well, which typically has lower reserves on it compared to the corporate portfolio, but I would say that the asset mix going forward, it'll be roughly equal to what the current mix is. It may be slightly more heavily skewed towards corporate, which would have more reserves associated with it.","Paul C. Reilly","Joel, before you go, let me correct what we said. I gave you the domestic numbers only. When we add Canada and some of the international operations, x total equity institutional commissions are about $56 million, fixed income is $36 million.","Operator","The next question is from Chris Harris.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So a really record quarter in Private Client. You guys talked about that, great metrics, great production we're seeing there in that business. I'm really wondering how we can reconcile that strong performance relative to, I guess, some of the other indicators we're seeing that suggests volumes really haven't picked up and referencing kind of trading volumes, trading activity, exchange volumes, margin borrowing looks like it's coming down, retail funds originally not all that robust either. So just wondering if you guys could help us think about that, how your advisers and clients continue to stay active relative to what we're seeing in the market.","Paul C. Reilly","Yes. We've got a strong fee-based billing business. And so as the markets go up, it really drives our commissions more than anything, more than the trading volume. So we've continued to push our advisers for years to be in the fee-based business to be on the side of the clients so in down markets we get downdraft and in up markets, we get updrafts and that's really driving the business and driving the numbers in PCG, as well as our increasing productivity, which is market and asset gathering driven and net recruiting so...","Jeffrey Paul Julien","If you look at the commission line in Private Client Group, commission and fee line, more than 60% of it is fee-based, recurring revenues. Fee-based meaning that includes things that are time-based as opposed to transaction-based. As that sort of differentiates us, I think, from some of the other Private Client Group comparables.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, got it. And then on the NIM, nice increase in the quarter, you mentioned. I'm just wondering how much of that is related to the allied transactions? In other words, if you backed out that deal what would NIM have been in the quarter?","Steven M. Raney","Yes, Chris, we had one month impact of the Canadian loans, there was some extraordinary pay downs in that portfolio even in the 1 month that we had it, which had an impact. That portfolio has NIM in the 8% range going forward. So that's going to have more impact this quarter because we're going to have the full -- the full impact for the entire quarter. I don't know -- I don't have the number off the top of my head what the NIM would have been, absent Canada. Every quarter we have fee recognition on pay downs and payoffs of loans that can be rather lumpy and can skew the NIM number. I do think that going forward, kind of a 3.50% to 3.60% NIM is kind of a good number to use.","Jeffrey Paul Julien","Which is higher than we've guided in the past because both we had excess cash balance in the past and then we also didn't have this other portfolio.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay and on the pay downs, what is the average yield on those loans versus the new loans that you're originating today?","Steven M. Raney","Well it's really been -- when Jeff mentioned that in his comments, those pay downs that impacted provision were loans where we had higher reserves on them, so the NIM on those loans compared to what we're doing on a go forward basis, are approximately equal to one another. So no impact to NIM, but it does have an impact or its impacted us positively over the last few quarters in terms of problem loans, loans that we have higher reserves on paying down, getting good resolution on them, either paying down, restructuring, paying off entirely.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then last question for me, real quick, on the Morgan Keegan transaction. You had mentioned that a little less overlap than you would have thought in the capital markets and so maybe fewer headcount reduction there. What are you guys assuming for how the environment is going to progress over the next year or so as you think about making your employment decisions or your headcount decisions in capital markets?","Paul C. Reilly","First, let me talk about the overlap. We had a significant overlap in the Equity Capital Markets business. We knew that going in. I think our coverage overlap was 86% or something. So we knew we had overlap coming in, but essentially, we ended up with more people than we thought, just good professionals and we kept all the good people we could in there. In fixed income, we were actually surprised. Again, still a good number of severed folks, but less overlap and what we want to do is we think that will, through a natural attrition,  fall a little bit. But we're trying to keep people on higher service levels. And assuming that the market -- you know our strategy over time has been to try to keep people in down markets, and we don't waste out and pay a lot to try to hire people in up markets so our focuses tend to -- to the extent we can, is carry them down, as markets are slower and they pick up we get the benefit of it. And it's been a strategy that's paid off well for over 20 years here being public. And I don't see any difference in our strategy right now.","Operator","Your next question is from Devin Ryan.","Devin Ryan - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","You guys had a nice quarter for SA hiring. So with the Morgan Keegan integration underway, I just wanted to get a sense of whether you guys are backed off of your hiring efforts outside of the deal or whether you can do both simultaneously?","Paul C. Reilly","Absolutely not. I think in the ECM fixed income business so we're not being as aggressive. We're hiring folks as we're still slotting people in because the size of those businesses and our position -- we are looking at spot hiring in those areas. But in the Private Client Group, we are hiring full speed. We find good people that willing to come in. And again, we're not leaders in transition assistance in the industry by a long shot, but we're continuing hiring. In fact, hiring pace has picked up as you can see in the quarter. Our home office visits have picked up, and we were concerned that the acquisition may slow that down but I actually think it's helped that people see that we're investing in the business, where we think we have a different model of being FA centric and with our advisers choice platform and we know we're -- we don't want to slow down in hiring. In fact, even Morgan Keegan is starting to hire again for the first time in a long time for them and now it's been resolved. So we will go with the market and continue to hire any time we can good people. We haven't slowed that down at all in the Private Client Group.","Devin Ryan - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Does it feel like the competitive environment maybe has changed a bit? Cause I just know that a year ago, things were incredibly competitive and there was big upfront packages and so that put a little bit of damper on the ability to hire. So has that dynamic changed at all more recently?","Paul C. Reilly","The dynamic in that there's still big packages out there. The dynamic we've seen are people that have gone through mergers with packages that are wearing down. I just said, it's not the right environment for them. That's not a slam on the other firms, but there's a big difference between the way we operate and some of the larger firms operate in terms of process, financial adviser kind of freedom, the way we serve versus others. And I think that what's happened are people from -- who have served at some of those firms want to go back to an environment they were used to before, some of the consolidation began so that's been the main source of recruiting.","Devin Ryan - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","And then in regards to the Morgan Keegan integration, I appreciate all the update that you gave. It sounds like both revenues and expenses are trending ahead of original expectations. But I just want to dig in, specifically, on the expenses. Is there any change to your thoughts on the ultimate size of the cost saves, was they are fully phased in?","Paul C. Reilly","I think we take the same approach as first after 20 days, we're not declaring any victory so we have an early trend. As we've told you when we did the acquisition, we tried to budget conservatively and do better. So I'm hoping that we do get some cost savings or grow into capacity as we hire and that's been our strategy. That hasn't changed so, I think that there could be further cost savings in terms of percentage of revenue if the market grows or more cost reductions if we're in a flat market we will size it so to fit but our goal right now is to keep all good people and we get a little revenue growth. It's hard to find good people. Our model has been, keep service levels high, and hopefully we grow into the headcount that we have on both sides.","Jeffrey Paul Julien","Devin, it's going to be hard to really know what the savings are from rightsizing the support until we actually go through the integration of the Private Client Group next year. That's going to see a lot of support related to that operation. It's just a little hard to tell right now how it's going to look on a combined basis versus how we're handling it today.","Paul C. Reilly","But our goal is to keep their -- they've got some very, very good people. We want to make sure they have a home to the extent that works out on both sides.","Devin Ryan - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Just last one for me, a question for Steve on the bank. Is it reasonable to expect there could be some more reserve releases going forward? And on the Allied Irish acquisition, I believe you mentioned a NIM of 8%, are you going to be hedging that portfolio from here? Is that a good number to think about going forward?","Steven M. Raney","Devin, we already have that hedged. That's a different line item. So the expense associated with the hedging or the impact of the hedging won't be reflected in the NIM. But it will be reflected in other expense items. So you need to factor in approximately around an 8% net interest margin in that portfolio. In terms of reserve releases, our bias is not to do that, it's obviously built loan by loan. We've had a lot of success over the last 18 months or so in terms of problem asset resolution in reducing our criticized loans. We remind you the last couple of years when we got the share national credit exam, we've had, last year was a relatively small, in fact it was a couple of million dollars. It was in the June quarter last year, the prior few years that it had been in the September quarter, we're actually trying to grow loans, which should, you know, should have provision expense and actually increasing our allowance through that process. But we were pleasantly surprised with the credit impact this last quarter and the credit improvement and the impact to our allowance to upgrades and pay downs.","Paul C. Reilly","Devin, I want to be clear, we didn't make any general reserve release. We had releases because loans paid off or paid down in the higher reserves too that it netted out. So this isn't a reserve release, it was a loan by loan result.","Jeffrey Paul Julien","But if you're asking where we have additional pay downs and things, I'm sure we will. But we also, like Steve said, hope to have net growth, which would replace it.","Devin Ryan - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay, great. Just one last one on the expenses, the communications and information processing ticked up and I know that you did have some seasonal items there. Could we expect that to come down to more normal levels or levels that have been in previous quarters? Or are we at a higher run rate because of some more permanent expense increases. I think that there's some increased mailings, et cetera in this quarter that might have taken it higher?","Paul C. Reilly","I think just because of the time it occurred with statements and stuff there's increasing -- there's increased mailings. So technology is increasing as the spend, but there is, obviously, from a -- the mailings that come in a quarter, this is where we do get a big jump up and hit. So it's a little bit of both. It's not all there, but it is -- we are continuing to increase our spend in technologies.","Jeffrey Paul Julien","We've talked about that for the last several calls, I think, Devin. I mean, I think that technology's kind of reached a little bit of a new plateau here for the foreseeable future as we have a number of big initiatives underway, and some of what Paul has mentioned already.","Paul C. Reilly","So I can't back out the mailing expense for you right now. But we can -- it's a number we could look at.","Jeffrey Paul Julien","We don't think it's going to come down dramatically from these levels for a while.","Operator","Your next question is from Douglas Sipkin.","Douglas Sipkin - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Just a couple of questions. One -- and I'm pretty sure you guys are going to refrain from giving more color, but I'm just sort of trying to look at Morgan Keegan revenues for March, I guess it was in the regions release and maybe now that we have -- that was sort of the last quarter before the close, how does that compare to what you guys are thinking. I know you guys are modeling a pretty decent sized drop off in sort of the run rate. I guess I remember it being sort of in that low $800 million range, does that March quarter shed any light, make you feel better, make you feel worse, just curious for your thoughts.","Paul C. Reilly","They had -- from what we've seen, they had a good quarter. So they had a very solid quarter, which makes us -- we'd rather -- except outside of paying for the net income, we actually like the fact that their business had a positive momentum also so exactly what the resulting revenue before the retention all settled out it's kind of harder to say but certainly they were doing better as they opened up than they were in December when be projected. And we tried to be conservative on retention and conservative on the revenue to the extent that the run rate is higher and our retention's higher, we should do better. But we'll let you know this quarter. So they do have positive momentum coming in.","Jeffrey Paul Julien","It was good to see.","Douglas Sipkin - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","And then with the Asset Management business, I mean,  continues to do very well. Strategically, any update on what you guys are thinking about that business. I know the strength historically has been small and mid-cap and I know you guys want more international and more large-cap. Any color on efforts there?","Paul C. Reilly","Our efforts continue. It's been very clear. We've been looking systematically at acquisitions and hired firms to help us with lift outs and niche acquisitions focused on the large-cap international spaces and are talking to folks but nothing to announce. So -- but we'll, in our normal Raymond James way be very methodical if we rind the fit, we'll close on it.","Douglas Sipkin - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","And then just last question, just curious with your increased size now, at FA headcount, have you already started to see maybe a little bit more negotiating power with some product providers? Or is it too early in the days for that? Or just not big enough of an increase in FA count that that's going to change things that much when you negotiate with firms?","Paul C. Reilly","Obviously, we think it will. We treat our -- we treat our --  we have partners in this business. So we have a dialogue and then we've got great relationships with them. Certainly, it hasn't gone unnoticed that our sales forces has increased. We also do some things that we think will put a lift to Morgan Keegan in terms of things we do with some of our partners in the business. So we will see some, we're sure. How much and how significant we don't know yet. But it will be a positive. I don't think it would be a needle mover on it's own. But there are a lot of little pieces that, that we do think it will contribute to this being a good combination.","Operator","And your final question is from Hugh Miller.","Hugh M. Miller - Sidoti & Company, LLC","I just had a, I guess, a question for Steve, at the bank. I appreciate the updated guidance on the expected NIM going forward and I realize that the pay downs from some of the potential problem loans has a benefit there. But I was wondering in general for some of the pay downs for loans that aren't substandard or your nonperforming, are you guys benefiting at the margins for many prepayment penalties that may have been embedded in these loans?","Steven M. Raney","Yes, Hugh, what occurs is fees that we earn at closing actually get amortized over the life of the loan and if it was a 5-year loan and the loan pays off, restructures, pays down, other than what the scheduled repayment terms were, we take that as seasoned income. Now the portfolio is of the size now where every quarter we got fees that we don't expect to -- there are payoffs and pay downs that are not part of the scheduled payment structure. So we're recognizing fees every quarter, and it can be a little lumpy. This last quarter, it was a positive impact of the Canadian portfolio, even for that 1 month. The legacy domestic portfolio was about equal to, maybe even slightly lower than the December quarter in terms of pay downs. So our NIM gets impacted by that fee recognition, but each quarter, we're going to have some of that. We could run into a quarter were the NIM gets negatively impacted because we don't have any extraordinary -- or a reduced level of extraordinary pay downs or payoffs.","Jeffrey Paul Julien","I don't believe there are prepayment penalties in any of those...","Steven M. Raney","No, none of the corporate loans have any prepayment penalties. It's just fee recognition. Acceleration of unamortized fees.","Hugh M. Miller - Sidoti & Company, LLC","Exactly. And that's just -- what I was trying to assess was that, that potential for pressure from there. For some reason you don't start to see the continuation of those pay downs. And then, within the loan portfolio growth that you were guiding to, kind of exclusive for some of these opportunities to purchase loans, 6% to 7%. I realize that the entrance into Canada is expected to be a conservative growth going forward. But how do you think about the target between domestic and Canadian growth in that 6% to 7% forecast? Obviously, it seems like the margin benefits for the Canadian exposure would be substantially more positive?","Steven M. Raney","Well yes, the new business in Canada will have net interest margins and the credit profile is very similar to the U.S. business. So I wouldn't anticipate heavier weighting towards Canada. I would anticipate it being -- right now there's about -- we have about $500 million in outstandings to Canadian-based companies. I would anticipate that percentage growing equal to the domestic business.","Hugh M. Miller - Sidoti & Company, LLC","And I apologize,  because I hopped on the call late. But I think you were starting -- or you talked a little bit about the reduction in March average daily commissions versus February and I was wondering if you could just quickly mention again what was it that caused that to pull back more than what may have been expected?","Jeffrey Paul Julien","I don't -- I think you misheard that part. Commission revenues were up, I think, sequentially in all of our businesses really.","Hugh M. Miller - Sidoti & Company, LLC","No, I was talking about the month of March on an average daily basis was kind of down for the run rate in February and I was wondering whether or not there was [indiscernible] or if it was kind of from an institutional side of the business or any reclassification or something like that?","Paul C. Reilly","Hold on one second.","Hugh M. Miller - Sidoti & Company, LLC","And the last question I had was just with regards to -- obviously,  you've talked about retention kind of running in above your expectations for the Morgan Keegan deal. But I was wondering if you guys have given any updated insight into your expectations for the total percentage of the advisers that you anticipate will probably stick with the company?","Jeffrey Paul Julien","I think we told people that we kind of have this 90% kind of retention rate. From the original numbers we said 10% that we would lose and our redundancies and 10% of -- and loss just being unable to hold them. And I would just say the redundancies have been less than we thought and the fallout has been less to date. So obviously, retaining the revenue is the #1 goal and that's why we've gone very deliberate on expenses to keep service levels high and that hasn't changed. So we're ahead of where we thought we'd be. But we've been joined as a family now for 20-some days. So we're not going to declare a victory on the trend. So we're sticking by the estimates. We thought they were conservative when we made them, but time will tell. The other upside is their business is up. So that's obviously helping too. We acquired a business that had much better momentum than when we negotiated the purchase.","Paul C. Reilly","Hugh, I'm just looking, I'd say that total commissions were down slightly in March versus February.","Hugh M. Miller - Sidoti & Company, LLC","I think that there were a couple of more days in March relative to February as well.","Paul C. Reilly","Per day basis is even -- I don't have an explanation. The only thing unusual that comes to mind other than we participate heavily on our own offerings.","Unknown Executive","I think it has to do with the number of days, because the assets -- the fee-based assets, are impacted by days of transaction, they're just a monthly number..","Hugh M. Miller - Sidoti & Company, LLC","That's a good point. That's true. Okay.","Unknown Executive","[indiscernible]","Paul C. Reilly","There's nothing that happened in March. I mean if -- March and going into April has been an uptrend not a downtrend so...","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions.","Paul C. Reilly","Well great. I think that -- again, after a very solid quarter, which we are I'm proud of, of our folks that worked very hard to keep the business going and to welcome the Morgan Keegan people. The fit from a cultural standpoint is as good as we thought it was. And you have glitches and you have people changing jobs. This has been a challenge and will continue to be a challenge as people settle in. But it's gone much better than we thought to date. It's good to have an economic environment that gives us some tailwinds moving into the quarter. And we'll continue to slug it out here. So I appreciate your time on the call. Jeff, did you have something?","Jeffrey Paul Julien","We look forward to seeing most of you at our Analyst Day next week. Our annual Analyst Day...","Paul C. Reilly","And if some of you can't get there, we still have some slots open.","Jeffrey Paul Julien","So please attend.","Paul C. Reilly","Great. Well thank you all very much.","Operator","Thank you.

A reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures may be found in the schedule accompanying our press release.","So, with that, I'll turn the call over to Paul Reilly, Chairman and CEO, of Raymond James Financial. Paul?","Paul Reilly","Thanks, Paul, and good morning, everyone, and welcome. Thanks for joining us. I'm going to start as usual with a brief summary of the second -- of the fiscal second quarter of 2019 and then turn it over to Jeff, who'll provide some more details on the financials and some line items. And then I'll discuss outlook before turning it over for questions.","So, following a challenging market during the December quarter, I am pleased with the solid performance in a number of key areas during the fiscal second quarter. These include quarterly net revenues of $1.86 billion, an increase of 3% over the prior year's second quarter, a decline of 4% compared to the preceding quarter.","As we discussed on the last call and at our recent conferences, Asset Management and related administrative fees were the primary drivers of sequential decline in net revenues as the vast majority of these fees are billed based on the beginning of the period fee-based asset levels, which were down with the market in December quarter. This quarter also had fewer billable days than the December quarter, which negatively impacts both Asset Management fees and net interest income.","But despite the fewer billable days this quarter and the seasonal expenses related to year-end mailings and reset in FICA taxes, we generated quarterly net earnings per share of $1.81, lifted by record Investment Banking revenues and higher net interest income, primarily at Raymond James Bank, which experienced improvement in its net income margin during the quarter, driving record quarterly net revenues and pretax income in the segment. We ended the period, importantly, with records for client assets under administration of $796 billion. Total Private Client Group financial advisors of 7,862 and record net loans at RJ Bank of $20.1 billion.","Annualized total return on equity for the quarter was 16.7%. And I want to remind everyone, a lot of people report on tangible equity, but this is total equity, which is a terrific result, particularly given our strong capital levels, which I'll speak about a little bit later.","Stepping back, if you look at the first 6 months, the first half of this fiscal year, we generated record net revenues of $3.79 billion, which were up 7% and net income of $510 million, which was up 41% or adjusted net income of $525 million, which was up 9% over the first half of fiscal '18. And notably, all 4 of our core segments generated record net revenue during the first 6 months of the fiscal year. This is really a fantastic result, particularly given the challenging market environment during the December quarter.","Now, turning to the segments. In the Private Client Group, we generated net revenue of $1.27 billion and pretax net income of $132 million during the quarter. The segment's results were negatively impacted by the market downturn in December, which caused fee-based assets, which are billed on balances at the beginning of the period, to start lower this quarter than the starting balance in the immediately preceding quarter. Moreover, once again, there were fewer billable days this quarter than the preceding quarter.","Partially offsetting the lower Asset Management fees, fees from third-party banks increased substantially during the quarter due to higher spreads following the December rate increase and higher client cash balances at the beginning of the quarter. However, these cash balances have been declining due to clients increasingly -- increasing their allocations to other investments, primarily as a result of improvement in equity markets as well as tax-related seasonality. The trend has continued into April.","Fortunately, PCG asset based -- PCG fee-based assets under administration, which now represent nearly 50% of the Private Client Group's total client assets, grew 16% over March of 2018 and 12% over December 2018 and achieved a new record, ending March at $378.4 billion, again driven by equity market appreciation, increased utilization of fee-based accounts and net additional financial advisers.","Our financial adviser retention and recruiting remains solid, resulting in a healthy net increase of 47 financial advisers during the quarter to a record of 7,862. Our client-focused culture, multiple affiliation options and robust service and solution offerings continue to resonate well with existing and prospective advisers. In the Capital Markets segment, we generated net revenue of $277 million and pretax income of $41 million for the quarter, both representing significant increases over prior year's fiscal second quarter and the preceding quarter.","We achieved record Investment Banking revenues in this segment of $156 million for the quarter. The strong results were driven primarily by record M&A revenues of $118 million, which also included our largest fee in history. This more than offset the industry-wide weakness in equity underwriting in the first quarter due to government shutdown. Fixed Income and brokerage revenues improved, largely due to a spike in interest volatility during the month of March. However, institutional equity brokerage revenues continue to be challenged by structural and cyclical headwinds.","In the Asset Management segment, we generated net revenue of $162 million and pretax income of $55 million during the quarter. These were negatively impacted by the starting the quarter with lower billable asset levels, given the decline in the equity markets in December, as well as net outflows for Carillon Tower Advisers. Financial assets under management ended the quarter at $138.5 billion, an increase of 5% over March of '18 and 9% over December 2018. Overall, the growth in financial assets under management continues to be largely driven by equity market appreciation, positive inflows with increased utilization of management accounts in the Private Client Group, which we believe will continue going forward.","Raymond James Bank generated record quarterly net revenue of $212 million and record quarterly pretax income of $136 million during the fiscal second quarter. We ended the quarter with a record -- with record net loans at $20.1 billion, which were up 11% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. The growth in loans during the quarter was driven by the C&I portfolio and residential mortgages to our Private Client Group clients. Raymond James Bank net interest margin expanded to 3.35% in the second quarter, up 14 basis points over a year ago second quarter and 10 basis points over the preceding quarter. Importantly, the credit quality of the bank's loan portfolio remains strong, resulting in a decrease in our loan loss provision.","So overall, strong quarter, I believe, an excellent first half of the fiscal year.","So, with that, I'll turn it over to Jeff before I provide some comment on the outlook. Jeff?","Jeff Julien","Thanks, Paul. I'll run down some of the line items and add a little color.","On the revenue side, although total revenues were reasonably close to the consensus model, there were really -- it's the net effect of two pretty significant variations. One is in the Asset Management-related fees. The actual decline in that revenue line versus the December quarter was pretty much in line with the drop in the related fee-based assets. If you remember, if you look at the December release, you can see those various asset categories decline between 8% and 10% in December, given the 14% drop in the S&P that quarter. At least -- so it's not a surprise that, that revenue line item would be down 9% sequentially, but apparently that you -- the Street underestimated that a little bit. So that drop was a little more severe than the consensus model would show.","Looking forward to Q3, again, billings, which we have already done in April here, were up a percentage similar to what you would see in terms of the growth in fee-based assets in the March quarter for that particular line item. Granted, a small portion of that line is based on average assets or end-of-period assets, but again, the vast majority, 90% type range are beginning-of-quarter billed. So, you can expect that I think for the June quarter.","Brokerage revenues, PCG commissions and equity institutional, both declined. They continue to struggle as we shift more toward a fee-based model here in the Private Client Group. That was offset this particular quarter by a nice uptick in the Fixed Income institutional business, in the principal transactions, both in commissions and what used to be called trading profits, which are now encompassed in the principal transactions line.","Looking forward, the higher equity markets will certainly help some of the PCG trail revenues and things like that going forward, so there may be at least a flattening of the PCG-related portion of that line. And Fixed Income, although they had a really good March month, may regress a little bit back toward the levels they were at and we're starting to see a little bit of that already. So we wouldn't necessarily anticipate a continuation of the level they were running at, at the end of the quarter.","The account service fee line, which is largely fees from unaffiliated banks that are in our sweep program waterfall. As you can see on Page 7 of the release, client cash balances continued to decline subsequent to December, when the markets start recovering and -- so we have seen that all the way up, as Paul mentioned, all the way up through today. We continue to see clients seeking either higher-yielding cash alternatives or going to risk assets. But that decline throughout the March quarter was more than offset by the increased spread that we earned as we had not passed through any of the December Fed hike to clients throughout that quarter. So that caused the net impact to actually have an uptick in the account and service fee line item in the March quarter. Going forward, assuming no additional Fed moves, the spread may hold up in the current range of about 200 basis points, but the balances may continue to run off for the quarter. We'll have to wait and see how that plays out.","The other offsetting variation or fluctuation from the consensus model was in Investment Banking. And again, a really strong close for the quarter. Generally, these have been happening almost too late for us to signal anything in our monthly releases, but we came in with record Investment Banking revenues, driven by record M&A fees for the quarter of $118 million. So we've had 2 really good quarters in a row in M&A fees. And looking forward in that line item, while the pipeline is still pretty active, it seems like it will be difficult to meet or beat the first 6 months on that particular line, but it'll still be a very good year overall.","Net interest income was just slightly above consensus, the NIM at Raymond James Bank, you can see on Page 17 of the release, actually grew 10 basis points to 3.35%. Again, as we -- some of the assets repriced from the Fed rate hike in December had very little impact on the cost of funds to the bank. For quarter 3 and 4 going forward, at least for now, we would think it would stay somewhat in the same range. We'll have to wait and see as the bank continues to grow probably in that 8% to 10% a year type range. So should we continue to see some -- we should continue to see some increase in outstanding loan balances, which helps drive the NIM up. But it's a matter of how much cash and securities they have on average during the quarter and other factors. So for now, I think in that range is probably a good estimate for the next quarter at least.","And the other revenues is the only other one that came in under consensus and that was a little bit slower quarter for the tax credit funds in terms of closings this particular quarter, which now falls in this line item. It used to be in -- with the old Investment Banking line item, but now it's in other revenues. In this particular quarter, there were no significant impacts either direction from valuations on private equity holdings, so that came in slightly lower.","Turning to the expense side, comp expense, the comp ratio came in dead on expectations. The ratio is 65.9% for the quarter and 65.7% for the year-to-date. They're both well under our 66.5% guideline. And that's despite the fact that the current quarter has an $8 million to $10 million impact from the FICA reset that happens every -- beginning of each calendar year and impacts us in the March quarter. So no real surprises with comp.","We've talked about communication and info processing. It was up slightly from last quarter, but still under our guidance for the quarterly average for the year. But we're not really going to change our quarterly -- our guidance for the year of running in the mid to high 90s on average for the year, which kind of means that we are expecting a little bit of an uptrend in the back half of the year here in that particular line item based on what we know today. Some of those things certainly are controllable and subject to delays and other things. But at this point in time, based on what we know, we still think the mid-90s on average for the year is probably a good number for that line.","Business development is running also below guidance. We talked about maybe mid-40s for the first 2 quarters. It has actually run in the low 40s for the first 2 quarters. We had -- some of that had to do maybe with a little bit slower recruiting, which is one of the big costs that goes in there. And also we did no branding or advertising of any kind during the first half. As we've mentioned on prior calls, the last 2 quarters of the year, we anticipate will be higher than the first 2 quarters, based on the timing of our large conferences and our reward trips which are -- both of which are important to preserving our culture and morale within our sales force.","We also have some modest image advertising planned, so we'll be -- my guess is at this point in time, again some of that is controllable, but at this point in time, we would think it would be more in the high 40s to $50 million type range per quarter for the next 2 quarters. Paul mentioned the bank loan loss provision. It went back to what we call a more normal level this quarter after a series of downgrades within the past category generally in the prior quarter, direct to what we call a more normal level, which is more correlated with the overall loan growth of $247 million during the quarter. And that growth this quarter was largely within the C&I and CRE portfolios, which led to a little bit higher than the 1% overall provision reserve that we have related to outstanding loan balances.","In the other expense line, again, we think maybe this has regressed back to what we call a more normal run rate that we talked about really actually last summer, when we were experiencing some elevated legal and regulatory costs. In this particular quarter, as noted in at least one report, there was a catch-up valuation adjustment of about $9 million for the one tax credit fund that we consolidate because we have guaranteed the tax credits will flow to the buyer. We've had this on our books for years and years, so as a result of that, their expenses flow through our P&L. And we own a very small fraction of this fund to our own interests. So virtually all of the impact comes out to the noncontrolling interest. So $9 million of that $12 million in noncontrolling interest is all related to that. But that did inflate other expenses by that amount. So ex that factor, you can see it was a fairly low quarter for the other expense line item, and that's again, we think that somewhere around where it is now is a little bit more indicative of what we would call an ongoing run rate.","A couple other metrics. The pretax margin was 18.7% for the quarter. I've been getting a lot of questions about whether that's -- whether we have additional leverage to increase that, whether we -- we're at a maximum point in the cycle on that, et cetera. What happened this quarter, of course, so we had lower revenues from the fee billings and we had some higher interest earnings in account and service fees and things that are very high margin type revenues, including Investment Banking M&A fees. Those are more profitable marginal revenues than the PCG-related fee income, which has a high attendant payout. So as a result, it drove the margin up this particular quarter and also helped the comp ratio.","Going forward, we have -- as you know, for Q3, we had higher fee billings, which again, will be a little bit lower margin revenue, and will drive some higher compensation with the FA payouts, particularly with the independent contractor space. And lower cash balances point to a possible decline in the margin for next quarter when you add those 2 things together, but it will be on higher revenues. So it's not to say that earnings or earnings per share will necessarily be impacted dramatically, but it'll just be a different mix, more like it was in the December quarter perhaps. Then Paul mentioned the ROE coming in at 16.7% and also for the quarter and also for the adjusted number for the year-to-date, when you take out the impact in the first quarter of the sale of the European equity sales and trading operations. So we're, again, well above our long-term target of 15%. But again, still trying to make up for the many years we ran along at 11% and 12%, when we had no interest earnings to speak of.","Capital ratios, they all remain well above regulatory minimums -- multiples of regulatory minimums, actually. And a little bit up from the preceding quarter, because we only had modest buybacks this particular quarter of 603,000 shares. I will say, however, the record EPS that we had during the quarter, even though we did not have record income, pretax or otherwise, we had record EPS, which really reflects the full impact of the over 6 million shares that we repurchased in the December quarter.","All-in-all, a pretty satisfying quarter, given the headwind of the lower fees that we started with and the continued runoff of client cash balances. That's what I have, and I'll turn it back now to Paul.","Paul Reilly","Great. Thanks, Jeff.","So, let me touch on the segments quickly and then we'll open it up for questions. So in the Private Client Group segment, we entered the third quarter with assets in fee-based accounts up 12% on a sequential basis. And remember, these are billed substantially based on the beginning balances. So it's kind of the reverse of last quarter, when they were down. This quarter, they are up. Also, last quarter, we had 2 fewer days. This quarter, we have 1 more day than last quarter. So those will both be positive on the tailwind for us going in the quarter. Offsetting some of this benefit is the decline in cash balances, as Jeff just mentioned. So overall, we continue to experience very good financial adviser recruiting and retention, so we're really optimistic on this segment and we're excited.","In the Capital Markets segment, while the timing of closings are always difficult in the M&A business, we -- the pipeline for M&A remains very strong. It would be hard to match last year -- the first 6 months' closings, but on the other hand, the activity levels for equity underwritings are increasing. Although it will still be difficult, I think, to match the first half, but we expect good results. Unfortunately, the Fixed Income side of the business, we had a really strong March and a reasonable April, but you could see it's slowing back down a little bit. So if rate volatility remains low, given a flat yield curve and low long-term rates, it will still be challenging for that division.","The Asset Management segment entered third quarter with assets under management up 5% year-over-year and 9% sequentially. So again, this should help the billing. Increased utilization of fee-based accounts in the Private Client Group as well as a good return performance in Carillon Towers should also help us with financial assets under management over time. Raymond James Bank started the third quarter with record loan balances and attractive net interest margins. The bank remains very disciplined in growing the loan portfolio and the credit metrics, we believe, will continue to be healthy.","So, I said, I would touch on our capital levels. As we obviously have excess capital, with our total capital ratio now around 25%, but the story remains consistent as it has always been and we continue to deliberately deploy our capital, after repurchasing 6.1 million shares in the December quarter for $458 million on an average price of $75.70 per share. In the first quarter, we purchased nearly 603,000 shares for $47 million or an average price of $78. This leaves us with $458 million of availability under the $505 million share repurchase authorization, which was increased by the Board of Directors in March of '19. We'll continue to be proactive in offsetting shareholder compensation dilution while remaining opportunistic with increased repurchases.","We also closed on 2 investments in April, including Silver Lane Advisors, a high-quality M&A platform with expertise in asset management and the wealth industries. And we bought out the remaining 55% interest in ClariVest, an asset management manager with over $7 billion in financial assets under management that we first purchased a minority stake in 2012. While these were not huge uses of capital, they do represent our strategic investments that we are continuing to make to augment our strong organic growth. We have been and will continue to look on pursuing larger acquisitions, but again, only if they meet our criteria of being a strong cultural fit, a good strategic fit and something we can integrate at a price that generates attractive returns to our shareholders.","We also get a lot of questions on whether or not we'd be willing to grow the bank more rapidly. If we found assets that could generate good risk returns, we would. So we are growing our loan portfolio at a rate we are comfortable with, given our conservative parameters and disciplined focus. And while the bank has grown our agency MBS portfolio over the past 3 years, with a flat yield curve, it doesn't make a lot of sense to take 3- to 4-year risk duration for maybe 25 or 30 basis points, given the incremental spread pickup over the floating rate we earn off balances for third-party banks, which offer much more flexibility and more FDIC insurance for our clients.","We have focused on deploying capital to generate good returns for our shareholders, as we did this quarter with a 16.7% annualized return on total equity. We want our balance sheet not only to remain on the defensive side, but also allow us to be opportunistic when we see opportunities.","So overall, we enter the second half of 2019 with a lot of tailwinds, with a record number of Private Client Group financial advisers, fee-based assets up 12% than preceding quarter, record-high spreads on our cash balances, record net loans at Raymond James Bank and a healthy Investment Banking pipeline. But we also have some headwinds, including declining cash balances and some expenses, such as communications and info processing, as Jeff spoke about, and business development for conferences. For example, we have our largest conference occurring next week with over 4,500 people attending, which will impact the business development line.","So, with that, I think we're in great shape. And Tiffany, I'll turn it over to you to open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Steven Chubak from Wolfe Research.","Steven Chubak","So, I wanted to start off with a question on the operating margin outlook. You cited a number of sources of record revenue balances and just given the strong revenue tailwinds in the second half and the growth in higher margin NII, how should we think about the outlook for operating margin? Should we think that some expansion in '19 versus '18 is achievable, even with the absorption of some of the higher non-comps as part of your investment plans?","Paul Shoukry","There's multiple layers to this, but revenue mix does impact the margin and the comp ratio. So it's great that our fee billings will start 12% higher, but we pay advisers on net revenue. And if interest rates, where we pay -- we don't pay anybody, it really almost flows 100% to the bottom line of net interest. It's obviously going to impact -- the revenue will be up, but it's going to impact, both the comp ratio will be higher and the margin will be lower, given the same mix of other activities. So the revenue mix has been driving some of that margin in this quarter. And if we think what happens, happens, our comp ratio should be up and the margin should be down slightly, but Jeff, I don't know if there's anything...?","Jeff Julien","Yes. I think that's right. I think, Steve, if we can keep the pretax margin in this 18% type range, that's a very acceptable long-term margin, in our opinion. The way we would like to see growth happen over time is to grow revenues, control expenses at about the same level. So we continue to see this 18% margin, but on an increasing revenue base going forward and then controlling the share count through the repurchases, which we've been doing. And that's sort of long term how we would see it, not so much through concentrating our business in such a way that we optimize the pretax margin. I mean remember, PCG is our core business. And if you look at the margin in the segment, it's actually the lowest margin of our businesses, but it feeds all the other businesses. So through attribution, it's an integral part of that 18% margin. But I wouldn't look for a lot of margin expansion personally. If that's -- that's not how we intend to grow earnings per share going forward. It's more growing revenues and holding the share count flat.","Steven Chubak","Got it. Being provided to where we are [indiscernible] I think expectations reflect margin contraction anyway, so it doesn't feel like the bar there is particularly high. But comments about keeping it stable at 18% is certainly quite encouraging. Just one question for me on the non-comps. Though it certainly -- I can appreciate the fact that you guys continue to invest in the business, it was nice to see also that the other expense line came in a bit better. Jeff, you indicated that the core number for that was somewhere sub $60 million this quarter. At the same time, also noted that $67 million may actually be indicative of a more normalized level. I'm just trying to unpack how we should be thinking about that line item going forward.","Jeff Julien","It's hard to pick a number on that one. There's a lot of -- I hate to overuse the word lumpy, but there's a lot of costs, particularly on the legal side, that can come in or go out of that any particular quarter. But again, it's somewhere in the -- if we can keep it somewhere in the $60 million to $65 million range for that line, now that we've taken professional fees out and established a separate line item, we can keep the other expense in that $60 million to $65 million range, I think that's indicative of some ongoing legal costs. And in this business, we're never going to be without some litigation from clients or other sources. But in terms of all the other items that fall into that particular category, that would be an acceptable long-term run rate at our current level of operations.","Steven Chubak","And just one final one for me on Private Client Asset Management fee yield. Clearly, well-positioned to benefit from higher AUM levels in Private Client as we approach the back half. But the calculated fee yield continues to contract, albeit at a fairly modest pace. I was hoping you could speak to what's driving that fee dynamic and how we should think about the trajectory for the fee yield going forward?","Paul Reilly","The only shift that you could really see is there's more of a movement to fee-based accounts. So we're not seeing big pressure at all on advisers, what advisers are charging clients. So those have held in pretty well. So I know there's been a lot of commentary about compression there, we don't see the compression on the fees advisers are charging. There's normal compression on any Asset Management fee or in our industry, but in terms of the adviser fees have held up very, very well. So I think it's more of a mix than any fee compression.","Jeff Julien","It's mix and average size of account, as over time in our client base, average account size has grown and larger accounts typically can come in at a slightly better fee.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Katz from Citi.","Kendall Marthaler","This is Kendall Marthaler, actually, on for Bill Katz. So I know you guys talked a little bit about the client cash since April, but I was wondering if you could give more of an update on pace of that relative to the last few months and how we should think about the economic trade-off between the elevated retail engagement and the lower cash balances.","Jeff Julien","We've been spending a lot of time on this over the last 4 to 5 months with our sales force. It's gotten to where the rate that people earn on what we call sweep balances compared to what they can earn in what we'll call positional cash, such as an investment in the money market fund. The differential is large enough now that advisers and clients are actually bifurcating their cash into what we'll call operating cash and what we'll call investment cash. And so what we're seeing is, it used to be all just amorphously one into the sweep balance, so now what we're seeing is additional runoff, if you want to use that word, of cash balances into what we'll call positional type of investments. The pace of that, at some point in time, it will hit what we'll call stasis, where the investment cash is in its investment vehicle, and what's left in the sweep program will be the operational cash. I don't know at what point we hit that inflection point. We continue to recruit new advisers and our client assets continue to grow. So there's an incoming flow from that process. But at this point in time, at least through today, we continue to see a net runoff of some of that cash. And again, what percent of assets it ends up being is a little hard to predict now at this point in time. So we'll just have to wait and see.","Kendall Marthaler","Okay, great. And just a quick follow-up, kind of going back to the previous question. So as PCG client AUA shifts more towards the fee-based, how do you see that impacting just the overall margin for Ray Jay?","Jeff Julien","Historically, on average, fee-based revenues as a percentage of assets have been a little bit higher for us than commission-based revenues as a percent of the related assets. But there's a lot of assumptions and all that go into making a statement as broad as that. I don't think it will have a material negative impact, and if anything, it could have a slightly positive impact. The good news about it is it creates a very predictable stream of revenues and it makes us a little bit more model-able company, if that's a word, going forward. And I know that people in your seat appreciate that. And our advisers have been kind of encouraged over the years to use professional management and other sources of fee-based revenues to eliminate some of the old conflicts that arose with commission-based accounts, and that was obviously accelerated with DOL and some of these other potential regulatory changes, and maybe will again, depending what regulatory changes come out and other things that may be on the docket. But at this point in time, I think we still see a continuous shift, plus we recruit advisers that have a practice that is largely focused on fee-based, because it fits with our model better. So I think profitability-wise, it will be our best long-term economic history shows it's a slight positive.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Harris with Wells Fargo.","Chris Harris","On the 2 acquisitions you just closed, how should we be thinking about the financial impact of those deals? And if you happen to have a revenue number for us, that will be helpful.","Jeff Julien","Well, Silver Lane is an M&A firm, so trying to determine how those revenues fall is as difficult as trying to determine how our own M&A falls, but it certainly will help augment our M&A revenue stream going forward. It's not an overly material part, as Paul mentioned, neither one of these are transformational acquisitions. And on the ClariVest side, they've been consolidated into our numbers all along. And then the portion we didn't own came out through minority interest. So given the size of minority interest over the last several years, since 2012, when we purchased our initial 45% stake, I mean you could see that what will no longer be coming out. Again, that -- and that won't be a huge transformational number.","Chris Harris","Got it, okay. That's helpful. I guess a follow-up question I had was on PCG recruiting. You know, you guys continue to have great success there. Just wondering if there's been any kind of change with respect to where you guys are seeing interest among advisers. And then maybe if you can elaborate a little bit more on how the pipeline looks, whether it's better or worse or about the same as to how things were maybe 12 or 24 months ago.","Paul Reilly","So I'd say the interest still remains high. Pipeline is strong. We started off with a slower quarter at the first quarter. Part of that was due just to also a reported net number, we had a lot of retirements. We have some retirements this quarter, but we're lower than last year, our pace of recruiting so far on average, but the pipeline is very good, very strong. And I would say similar to 12 months ago, maybe a little bit less, but not a lot. So given that we're behind on the first 6 months, I would expect us to be under last year's all-time record, but still a very strong recruiting pace.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell from Buckingham Research.","Jim Mitchell","Maybe just talking a little bit about recruiting expenses, how do we think, if we're looking at FA headcount growth and recruiting off a record year, I think you had 3 record years in a row, this year is a little bit starting to, I guess, the second derivative is starting to slow. Do we -- would we expect recruiting expenses to also slow in terms of the growth? Or is it not really that impactful because the bigger numbers, amortization, that takes time? Just help me think through the recruiting expense dynamic from this year and next if we're kind of at these levels.","Paul Reilly","Yes, so first of all, last year's record was a record above 2009. So we didn't have 3 years in a row. 2009 was our all-time record and then we beat it for last year. So although recruiting is still very strong, it's just not as good as last year's all-time record, so -- and certainly, if recruiting is slower, the expense is lower, both ACAT fees when we transfer client assets in, and outside recruiting fees, if we have to pay them. So those costs, those transfer costs, certainly hit the P&L when people move over. So our goal is not to have it slow down. But if it's slower, the expenses will be lower.","Jeff Julien","And the amortization of all the transition assistance related to that does have an impact on the comp ratio.","Jim Mitchell","Great. Well, I'm just trying to get a sense, does this help the margin if these expenses flatten out and the revenues continue to come on? It seems like it will naturally help the margin.","Jeff Julien","It helps the margin over time. It doesn't in the year or maybe the 2 years following the year you recruit the person. But once they have their business substantially over and have started using our other platforms, the bank, the Asset Management platforms, et cetera, and it radiates throughout the rest of the firm, they become incrementally profitable within a couple of years.","Jim Mitchell","Okay, thanks for that. And then maybe just a question on just on the progress on the West Coast. I know that's been an area of focus. It seems like you've had very good success on the East Coast, just any help in thinking about the progress in the West Coast would be great.","Paul Reilly","Yes, the progress is we continue to recruit. The pace is higher, but we've got a long way to go, because we're just starting, really, in that market being aggressively recruiting. So we're having more and more success, but we've got a lot of territory and opportunity there. So we continue to be very focused on it. We've increased our support out West. And so we still view it as a big opportunity for us.","Jim Mitchell","Do you think it needs sort of kind of like an Alex. Brown type deal to help jump start it, or do you feel you can still penetrate pretty well without that?","Paul Reilly","We have a number of independent -- we have many independent employee offices out there now. Almost all of our affiliation options are represented in the West. So if there was something out there that made sense, we -- I don't know what it would be.","Jeff Julien","If you know of one, please call us, Jim.","Paul Reilly","But we're long term, and I think our pace is picking up, the number of advisers on a percentage basis, the growth is good, but again, it's a small base, so we're continuing to work at it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs.","Alex Blostein","Jeff, back to your point around the margin, I guess when you talk about 18% being an acceptable margin I guess over time and well, clearly interest rate dynamics and markets will fluctuate and I get the fact that it's obviously going to impact margin in the quarter, but bigger picture, why is there a structural reason that your model can't have margin expansion over time?","Jeff Julien","Only because our mix of businesses, and this is back to me talking again. I don't think interest spreads are necessarily sustainable at these levels, particularly if the Fed is done with the rate hikes and there will be -- I think there will be continued pressure on client deposit rates for us to maintain any kind of acceptable level of client cash balances. So I think that will -- if we see some spread contraction there, even though we're growing the overall revenue base with the PCG business, and 18% is not just acceptable, that's excellent. I'd love to stay at 18% for the rest of our careers. But given our mix of businesses and that dynamic with interest rates that I foresee going forward at some point in time, I may be right. I haven't been yet for the last 3 or 4 years, but at some point, it may happen. That's why I'd be surprised if there's much room for margin expansion in the near term.","Paul Reilly","That's a challenge, when you have, whatever the number is, 65%, 2\/3 of your revenues in compensation expense and you add 18% margin, and you've got less than 15% to operate the whole rest of your business, expenses, real estate, people, support. So you can always eke out a little, but there's not a lot of room in there. In our Private Client Group business, our second-biggest corporate expense is real estate. So you add that and put the people in and the people costs, those are hard to beat -- those are hard to move in the short term. You can move them in the short term, but there's a lot of consequences, on service levels and everything else if you do that. You can change payouts, but then there's consequences also. And we pay competitively, not at the highest, but we think we pay fairly and we're able to keep people because of the support, so it makes it tough to move that number a lot.","Alex Blostein","That's helpful. And then second question around just the current dynamic. So obviously, you guys talked about cash balances coming down in April. Any sense of where these stand today and then more specifically, looks like the bulk of the client cash outflows took place from third-party banks over the course of the quarter. Is that the dynamic you guys expect to continue, where kind of Ray Jay Bank balances remain fairly stable?","Jeff Julien","Again, it's continued through today. But at some point in time, we think it will level off. We don't know where that is and we're looking at doing some things that will help stem the tide on it that don't involve just purely raising rates to try to keep deposits here. So I don't know where that's going to bottom. It's continued to flow out a little bit every day. Not every day, but a little bit on average every day since the end of the quarter. But again, at some point, we'll reach that level at which people are going to move this investment cash to another location have done so and the money that's there is money awaiting investment.","Paul Reilly","I think your comment about it, what you see flow out of third-party, we feed the bank first. So you're going to see the delta really in that cash.","Jeff Julien","Yes, it's going to be in account and service fees. That will be the line impacted, as Raymond James Bank is, we accommodate its growth. It's the first one in the waterfall stack.","Alex Blostein","Right, so cash is kind of fungible. Got it. All right, one more, guys, for you, just on Fixed Income trading. Obviously, a quarter of improvement for the first time in a while. I understand that the backdrop sounds like got a little bit softer, but to what degree is the recovery in the muni market is helping you guys and if there's any sort of sustainability in that business? How should we think about that impacting your overall Fixed Income franchise within Cap Markets?","Paul Reilly","Yes, again, I think it's really more rate expectation. We do have a big part of that business is muni-oriented. But I think, again, the volatility is going to drive that more than anything else and to get a continued movement, or rate expectations. So you see in March 2 things. That volatility went up, but also, people's mind shift changed about investing long as the Fed announced they were considering slowing down and not giving rate. So there were a lot of people that went long that have been holding off going long, a lot of clients, and that certainly increased the appetite and certainly the volume for us. On the other hand, I mean not just on the revenue side, on the profit side, we have adjusted sales force and have taken cost actions there, where even at a downscaled business from a revenue standpoint, we are profitable. So I think a lot of firms are experiencing that we are, but not certainly the margins that we enjoyed a few years ago, but we do have it scaled for profitability and yet have kept the main heart of our group. So that if there is a market increase, we'll be able to take advantage of it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan from JMP Securities.","Devin Ryan","I hopped on a minute late here, but I don't think you touched on this. Just on M&A opportunities, I know you guys have interest in doing deals that can augment organic growth. But the question is, is there really anything out there in wealth management today? Are there any targets, meaning specific companies that you're in touch with, that might be a good fit, but really, I guess the timing will need to be right for them and the price needs to be right for you. But I'm just curious, really, if there is anything out there. And then would you actually look at something in the independent adviser side or is there strong preference in employee adviser models?","Paul Reilly","So there are certainly a handful of companies we think are strategically and culturally good fits. They're just not for sale, so we stay in touch with them. And if the point comes that they're interested, both whether they're independent or employed or both, we are ready, willing and able. There are also a lot of things we're looking at outside the Private Client Group. There's probably more opportunities in M&A and Asset Management in terms of certainly a number companies than there are in the Private Client Group side, as that group has just gotten much smaller. It's much more consolidated. So it's not the numbers, same number of firms, certainly, that there has been historically. So I think of the 60 companies that took us public, I think 8 names are still alive, including Alex. Brown, which we kept alive. So there's just fewer opportunities. So we're in touch, we're in dialogue and we have a corporate development department that's active. And again, it just has to line up.","Devin Ryan","That's helpful. And just one on the ClariVest, the kind of the full acquisition. I know it's a relatively small transaction, but can you just remind us how moving the ownership to 100% from 45% is going to impact the P&L? And then just whether that's contemplated in the expense commentary you laid out?","Jeff Julien","It'll impact our pretax income by a couple million dollars a quarter. And that's the extent of that. So that's the amount that was flowing through NCI related to the part we didn't own. But that's -- and the revenues and the expenses were already in our numbers, because it's been consolidated because of our control. We're not a majority ownership, but our control on the board and other things over some of the operations, where we've been consolidating, but the revenue and expense numbers won't -- you won't see any change. You'll just see lower NCI.","Operator","And your final question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse.","Craig Siegenthaler","On the Private Client Group fees that you really aren't seeing any fee pressure, can you share with us your internal estimate for the PCG advisory fee rate in the quarter and how this compares to historicals? Because we're back into a large decline sequentially and on a year-over-year basis, and the driver really is just mix shift. Can you help us better understand what you mean by mix shift there?","Paul Reilly","We didn't hear the first part of your question. You came in late, can you just...","Craig Siegenthaler","I can repeat it, if that's okay.","Paul Reilly","Yes, please do.","Craig Siegenthaler","All right. So earlier in the call, you responded to a question on Private Client Group fees. And I just wanted to understand what your fee rate is in the quarter for PCG advisory fees, and how that compares to historicals, just because we're back into a decline there. And then I think you said to a response to another question, that the driver really was mix shift. I just wanted to better understand what you guys meant by mix shift.","Jeff Julien","It's hard to say. You can pick one big average rate, and you can just take the revenue line off the PCG financial and divide it by the assets and that's probably what you're doing to see this decline. But it has to do with which types of programs they're in. We have a whole range of different types of fee-based programs, it depends. The mix really has to do more with are they heading more toward Fixed Income versus equity, which do have some impact on some of the programs, particularly in the managed programs. And then as I mentioned earlier, both the average account size makes a big difference as well, as we've seen the average account size of our accounts within the managed programs increase over time, which again, usually engender a smaller fee as you go up the scale. We're not seeing, and we're not seeing within any particular program or within any of our particular objectives or within our management programs -- our managed programs, we're not necessarily seeing a whole lot of fee pressure and decline. It's been a slow dribble for several years, but it's not been the pressure that it has been in years past.","Craig Siegenthaler","And then just as my follow-up, I heard your response to Alex's question on third-party bank deposits. But can you help us on the account and service fee line? What is the outlook for this line in the next couple of quarters?","Jeff Julien","Yes. So, I said in the very beginning of my comments, in that line item, we're going to see, at least so far, we've seen continued decline in the assets that are in those third-party banks. I think our spread could hold up. It's just a matter of whether the balance decline stops, reverses or continues. If we froze everything today, it would be slightly lower probably next quarter than it was this past quarter, because even though we have the same spread, the asset balances are slightly lower. So it's, that's strictly a combination of balance and spread-driven number. And at this point in time, the spread's constant and the balances are slightly lower. So again, if we froze it today, then it'll probably be down slightly in that particular aspect of account and service fees. There are some other fees and things that fall in that line item, but that's the primary one.","Paul Shoukry","Okay, well, I understand that's the last question, so we appreciate you all joining us this morning, and we'll talk to you again soon. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for joining.

My name is Demetris, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome, everyone, to the quarterly analyst call for Raymond James franchise (sic) [Financial]. [Operator Instructions]","To the extent that Raymond James make forward-looking statements regarding management expectations, strategic objectives, business prospects, anticipated expense savings, financial results, anticipated results of litigation and regulatory proceedings and other similar matters, and variety of factors, many of which are beyond Raymond James' control, could cause actual results and experiences to differ materially from the expectations and objectives expressed in these statements.","These factors are described in Raymond James' 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is available on the raymondjames.com and sec.gov.","In addition to those factors, and in connection with the Morgan Keegan transaction, the following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking or historical performance: difficulty integrating Raymond James and Morgan Keegan's businesses or realizing the projected benefits of the transaction; the inability to sustain revenue and earnings growth; changes in the capital markets; and diversion of management time on integration-related results.

Thank you.","Mr. Reilly, you may begin your conference.","Paul Christopher Reilly","Thank you, Demetris. And good morning, everyone. I'm calling you from Dallas, Texas. We have our RJFS, our independent advisor conference. A little over half of our total independent advisors are here and in fact with our advisors [indiscernible] are guests in the home office and sponsors over 3,400 people attending. So that's quite a conference. The mood is very upbeat and very strong. Jeff, Jennifer and Steve Raney are in St. Pete. So we have a little bit of a split call, so if we get to questions and answers, either will cut in and cut out, you'll understand.","We have now substantially completed our Morgan Keegan technology integration and have just started our Phase 2 rightsizing, which will go through the fiscal year end. I know that an awful lot of you that are trying to time some of the savings, but there is a lag. So as we just started our rightsizing, in fact, with our 160 people primarily in the technology segment, which should benefit next quarter, the numbers are just starting. We're committed to complete it, but it's going to be still a couple of quarters before we get it done. The integration costs are still high, and the benefits still not fully realized. Overall, our business is good. The retention is strong and believe that our combined platforms puts us in a great shape to compete.","Last night, we reported record net revenues of $1.14 billion, up 3% from the preceding quarter and 31% from last year's quarter. EPS per diluted share of $0.56, down 8% from the preceding quarter, but up 8% from the prior quarter. And the non-GAAP EPS, taking out our integration charges and other charges, of $0.68, down 1%, down $0.01 from the preceding quarter, but up 6% from the preceding quarter.","If you look at our businesses, I believe our businesses are really in good shape. And all but one, I think, had pretty good performance. And I know the numbers are moving, and it's hard for everyone to get a handle on them given the integration. But let me try to walk you through the big picture, and we'll have Jeff dive into the numbers a little more. Private Client business is in good shape. Our revenue was up 2%, and I think that's in line with -- in the same ballpark as most of our competitors. And you have to remember that our Morgan Keegan colleagues were put onto our platform in the middle of a quarter. And they're new systems, and they spent a lot more time entering stuff and learning the systems, that's taken them a little bit out of the market. So I think that, that transition has gone about as well as it could. I think it's positioned. The people are on our technology. If you track our help desk calls that were significantly elevated for the first week, slightly elevated the second week, have come back to about normal levels. So it certainly impacted productivity of that group. We can't prove that anymore because we have them all consolidated in our numbers, but certainly I believe it had an impact on them. Our technology rightsizing of the 160 people should benefit mainly PCG in this segment. That's going to be $5 million per quarter going forward before the other types of cost synergies that we work on in the next 2 quarters.","Assets under administration hit a new record of $407 billion, up 5% and up an impressive 30% from a year ago. And you also have to remember that we bill in advance. So last quarter, we came basically with a 0.5% increase in assets under administration, which didn't give us much tailwind coming into the quarter, essentially flat, a little up. We'll be moving into the next quarter with a 5% tailwind as we bill in advance. Assets under management also hit a new record. $51 billion, up 10% for the quarter, which is a great number, and up 30% off a year ago. And they were both due to a rising equity market and also strong net inflows.","Our Asset Management Group was up 6% in net revenue from the preceding quarter and 19% from last year. Pretax was flat basically due to the addition of ClariVest, but it was up 26% over a year ago. So I think we have a little bit of blip as we brought ClariVest cost into our structure for the fourth quarter.","Capital Markets was a tough quarter for us. And I think if there was disappointment for us, and frankly, for the industry, for the people, the businesses that we were in is, it was a tough quarter. ECM had strong positive secondary commission flow. It was actually up 10% for the quarter, which has been unusual. We have a positive trend, starting to trend positively. Some of that due to our underwriting, some of it due to just overall flow. The underwriting markets have improved, and we see some continuing improvement. But like most other firms like us reporting, M&A was well off from what we expected, and I think most people expected. I don't think most of us recognize, we've been trying to say that there was an acceleration and M&A would be much slower this quarter. But if you look back at last December, the month of December alone was a record M&A quarter for us, and that was due mainly to the acceleration of deals as people looked at potential tax law changes and the fiscal cliff. So M&A was a very, very tough and really and the Equity Capital Markets business had the major impact. Fixed income has been steady. It certainly isn't the -- the Morgan Keegan integration has gone very well, but results are off from the early -- the last couple of quarters from the early returns, basically because commission volumes are down across all of our businesses as we had very low interest rates and a very flat yield curve and people expecting rates go up sometime. I think that just commissions are off. And our trading profits in the muni space, like everyone else in the industry, has been hit. They were a significant contributor to profits. But the last quarters, last 2 quarters, they were barely positive. They were slightly positive, but really weren't the significant contributors. Again, due to rates and the yield curve.","RJ Bank, basically loans were flat. We showed a drop from $8.5 billion to $8.4 billion -- $8.5 billion to $8.4 billion. But actually, it was $44 million drop, so we got caught in the rounding from $8.416 billion, from $8.450 billion. So we did have a modest compression in spreads, and we ended up in a $2.5 million drop in net interest income.","The surprise part, not a surprise to us, was the Proprietary Capital, where we have contracted to sell Albion Medical Holdings, one of our Proprietary Capital holdings. We expect it to close at the end of this month or soon within then. But due to that, the Proprietary Capital segment contributed $20 million of pretax earnings for the quarter.","The Morgan Keegan integration continues to be on track. Everyone is now operating under the RJ brand across all platforms. In fact, our training folks who are out in the field have come back home from the offices as we believe that people are up on our platform and very, very comfortable.","We've just begun the cost synergies in the business. So as I mentioned earlier, 160 people in technology, which is very culturally difficult for us. It's the first really layoff we've ever had in St. Petersburg, being a family-run company, I mean, these are people in our community where most people there are friends of our kids, friends, mothers and fathers and people we've known for a long time, but it was necessary given the integration. And we have more to do in terms of the cost cutting, that is the biggest in terms of numbers of people. But we will continue to do that over the next 2 quarters as it will bring the costs closer in line going forward.","So with that, let me turn it over to Jeff, who will get a little bit more into the numbers. Jeff?","Jeffrey Paul Julien","Thanks, Paul. My big-picture take on this quarter as you just look at numbers, you see basically 3.5 of our 4 major segments almost flat with the preceding quarter. The 0.5 that was off would be equity capital, equity side of Capital Markets. Off substantially for the reasons Paul mentioned, and Proprietary Capital increase made up most of that shortfall, which caused us to be, again, roughly flat in total with the preceding quarter. We're not saying that flat is good. We're just saying that, that's the dynamic. Let me talk about a couple of the facts and figures that you all have raised in your early comments, but we had -- I had planned on commenting on anyway. The comp ratio, total comp was flat with the preceding quarter. We had, obviously, with some of the Capital Markets falloff, we had some reduction in comp-related there, but we did have increases in comp related to consolidating ClariVest for the first time. There was -- someone pointed out, there was a modest amount of comp related to the private equity sale. And in addition, one of the points we mentioned at the non-GAAP, some of the restructuring cost were severance costs in the European operation that found their way into comp as well. So some of the -- the overall net-net-net comp was flat. We had -- we have started on the compensation reduction rightsizing plan. We talked about the, what I'll call the significant rift that we had on April 11 of 160 people. But in the March quarter itself, between -- mostly between the conversion date of February 19 and the end of the quarter, we also had several million dollars of compensation reduction from people who either left voluntarily or who had contracted to be with us only up to that time, et cetera, through conversion. So the savings of $5 million only related to that rift, but that number is probably slightly understated when you add in all these and also were let go or left toward the end of the March quarter itself.","So though the comp ratio itself showed improvement in the quarter, again, it was related to the Albion revenues replacing higher compensation Capital Markets revenues, so there really was not much, if any, improvement. Although it shows that not through the March quarter, but we pointed out, we expect to see some reductions hit starting in the next quarter.","Net interest income. We had a little bit of slippage. Paul pointed out the bank margin tightening a little bit. It did 18 basis points on what we call adjusted NIM. We are continuing to hold several hundred million dollars of excess cash above and beyond what we really want in our bank in order to provide our clients with insurance as we're still capacity constrained in our bank waterfall program. Just to remind you, the extra cash that the bank holds has no capital requirement associated with it as it's really in zero-risk weighted overnight Fed deposits. It does have a positive spread to the bank. So it's helping earnings, and it's helping ROE. The only statistic that's getting damaged by them holding that excess cash is the net interest margin. So for the foreseeable future until we are able to secure capacity, you'll see us do a reporting of the NIM like we did this quarter.","Noncontrolling interest bounced around a lot. To help your analyses, we actually put a schedule in the press release this time detailing out the items within noncontrolling interest. I know it bounces around a lot. There's some positives and some negatives in that schedule in terms of our share. So hopefully, that helps people understand what's in NCI.","Recurring revenues are steady at 54%. There wasn't a big shift in business in any direction. That's about where it's been running since our acquisition of Morgan Keegan. It's down a little from where it had been running as Morgan Keegan is being fixed income related and less PD-based and PCG, actually it was -- had a lower recurring revenue percentage than our legacy company did. So we dropped from the high-50s to the mid-50s in terms of recurring revenue percentage.","In terms of our product mix, we've seen even since the last quarter about a 2% shift from cash and other investments over to the equity side in terms of our client holdings. But I would tell you, that's probably not people actually moving, that's probably more a result of just appreciation on the equity side causing the change in allocation there.","Our shareholders equity, which is shown in the press release is approaching $3.5 billion. Over $25 per share total book and $22.5 tangible book now.","A couple of other things. Acquisition and integration costs, our original estimate for the grand total of what we would incur was $110 million. We thought it will be $70 million in the first year and $40 million in the second year. It turned out it was only $60 million in the first year, but it looks like it's going to be closed to $50 million in this year. So our original estimate is going to be right. The split between the 2 years may be a little off, but we're at just under $100 million cumulatively now. And our best estimate is, we got about $5 million to $10 million more to come in the next 2 quarters. And then we should be through with that line item.","Cost synergies we've talked about a lot. We've talked about a $60 million to $80 million number from the beginning. We told you in December, we were about halfway done. What our best estimates now of synergies to be realized starting April 1 going forward is about $35 million probably give or take. The timing of realizing all those is a little uncertain. Things like restacking our Memphis office space and things like that, negotiating with landlords, although the timing of that is a little unclear. But definitely, those will be front-loaded because most of it's compensation expense and a large part of that's happening right now as we speak in the June quarter.","A couple of comments on expenses, which were also noted in the reports. I've talked about comp expense. Datacom, which showed an 8% increase this quarter. By way of reminder, it was just barely up in the first quarter from September. It's a little bit lumpy as to when systems come onstream, and we start the amortization and the maintenance fee process, et cetera. So that's a little bit lumpy. We certainly don't expect 8% per quarter increases in that line item over the course of a year or we would take some drastic steps to change that.","Other expense. When you strip out the nonrecurring items and NCI, noncontrolling interest-related items, you actually see that the true-up used to be just in other -- through other was actually down quarter-over-quarter by about $6 million. And the largest lumpy item, if you will, in there typically is legal expense where we -- sometimes we have new cases, sometimes we settle cases and reverse reserves if they are favorably settled.","So that's kind of a quick walk through the numbers. The ROE at 11.4% on a non-GAAP basis is kind of about where we've been running. It's not fair, I don't think, in your writeups to discount all of the benefits that we receive from the sale of Albion. In prior quarters, we've had quite a bit of writeups related to that investment over time. So it's actually been impacting our results not nearly to this extent, but it's been impacting results for many quarters in just to a lesser amount. So I don't think it would be appropriate to totally discount it, but you can do as you like there.","In my own opinion, I think the assets under management up 10%, that's really what the billings are related to. The billings are probably up 7% because it's not all equity in our asset management sector. But billings are probably up about 7%, so there is the lift that Paul was talking about for the second quarter as opposed to the 5% total client assets. One other comment on the bank loans. It's going to be, as we mentioned, it will be a challenge to grow them, but the other thing that we're going to be perhaps challenged with is the receipt of the SNC exam here. If the timing followed last year, it will be the end of June. So it will be in this June quarter. As you know, the way we treat that is we take the lesser rating of what they come up with or what we already have it on the books. So it's not ever a positive number to us. It's been a fairly controllable couple of million dollar type number in the last couple of years. So as we continue to try to get pretty far ahead of the hit of the ratings on these loans, and we adequately reserve going forward.","So with that, I'll turn over to Paul to give me his outlook on the segment this fiscal year.","Paul Christopher Reilly","Great. Thanks, Jeff. I think that as we kind of look forward, with record assets under administration and our asset management, assets under management being up significantly. Both provide good tailwinds for the Private Client Group and asset management businesses. They are -- they bill in -- the Private Client Group bills quarterly in advance. As I mentioned previously, we only had a 0.5% really increase the year before -- I mean, the quarter before coming into the quarter. So we have much stronger tailwinds plus the conversions behind us. And I think the advisors are really focused on their business. I'm actually pretty positive given the flows of equity markets so far. So I think we've got good tailwinds and should see good results on those businesses. The banks will be, I think, a little more challenged in this way. Loans were rounding down. Most of the down had to do -- we had a $200 million sale of our SBA loans. We warehouse them there, sell them up if it gets lumpy and build them back up. And so C&I was actually up. But we're projecting -- our best guess is bank -- the net loan should be flat to down slightly. The flow is great. We're seeing a lot of stuff. But there's a lot of -- a lot of the financings are covenant-light, and we don't like them. So we are maintaining our credit standards. We won't take a covenant-light loan unless it's an extremely strong credit. And if the market moves away from us from a credit perspective, we will grow loans slower. So you can't say 1 month or 1.5 months or a quarter as a trend, but we're concerned about that, so I think it will be difficult to grow loans in the next quarter given that environment. And also with the SNC exam coming, there may be a charge. We actually hope the examiners are tough on covenant-light loans. And if it tightens up covenants, we'll participate in more loans. So the bank outlook for the next quarter, we think flat to down slightly in terms of net loans.","The Capital Markets are a little more difficult to estimate. The Equity Capital Markets, the commission flow has been good. The underwriting market has improved, and if the Equity Capital Markets stay in good shape, and that's the big if, we should see improvement. M&A volume, although in the industry we're seeing it down, we're actually seeing deals starting to close again as the backlog acceleration has worn off. And so my guess is, we'll see improvement in Equity Capital Markets throughout the second half of our year if Equity Capital Markets participate. And I think the fixed income business will be challenged to grow in this interest rate environment. It's been a very steady performer with steady margin, but until rates move or there's an impetus for people to really start repositioning their fixed income portfolios, that the commission volume, I don't see anything that's going to push it to grow significantly. And municipal trading [indiscernible] in this type of rate environment would be very, very difficult. So with that, could everyone hear me?","[Technical Difficulty]","Paul Christopher Reilly","Jeff?","Jeffrey Paul Julien","Yes.","Paul Christopher Reilly","I'm sorry. I don't know where I got cut off. I got disconnected somehow here.","Jeffrey Paul Julien","All right. You're back.","Paul Christopher Reilly","Where did I got cut off?","Jeffrey Paul Julien","When you said, can you hear me.","Jennifer C. Ackart","I think you were about to lead into questions, Paul, you said, with that.","Paul Christopher Reilly","Yes. Okay. I'm sorry. Just as a reminder, so I think where we are is the cost synergies are going to take some time to get out, longer than I think most of the analysts have estimated. And I think we tried to signal that they'd be in through the rest of the fiscal year and it's still going to take us those couple of quarters to get there, but we're committed to doing that. And overall, if you look at the first 6 months versus the first 6 months last year, we've had very, very strong results with net revenue up 36% and net income up 22%. Our non-GAAP fully diluted EPS up 17%. So the businesses are in good shape, and we just have to finish the job of getting the costs out, and we hope obviously the markets will stay favorable. We're in a great position to compete.","So with that, I'll turn it back to Demetris for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Joel Jeffrey with KBW.","Joel Jeffrey - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Paul, I appreciate your commentary on the M&A market because we're certainly seeing a pretty big slowdown early on just from what seems like the pull forward of the middle market activity. I mean, in terms of the deals starting to flow through, I mean, how long do you think this overhang is actually going to last on the market?","Paul Christopher Reilly","I can tell, Joel. I mean, typically, the big numbers in the market are affected by major transactions, but the middle market seems to follow. So I think the deal flow-through of the things in backlog, and I guess the question is overall -- if overall M&A deals slow down, I mean, we'll certainly be impacted throughout the year. I think it's ironic to most people that kind of still record low rates and most people optimistic about going forward getting revenue growth that M&A would slow down at this pricing. But that's the report from everybody else. So I can't really tell you.","Joel Jeffrey - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then sort of thinking about the other revenue line. So with the sale of the stake in Albion, should we think about this more in sort of the $10 million to $20 million range going forward?","Jeffrey Paul Julien","Other revenues, let's see what the -- you mean from private equity or just in total?","Joel Jeffrey - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I mean, just in total, it seems like that's a line that certain of the unrealized gains over the quarters you guys listed have been sort of in the...","Jeffrey Paul Julien","We have other private equity-related investments. So there'll be some activity related to those. It looks like the ongoing run rate unrelated to private equity is in that ballpark that you just mentioned. But there still will be some lumpiness related to our other private equity investments.","Joel Jeffrey - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then I appreciate the commentary about the loan growth, but just thinking about in this sort of flat loan levels, how should we be thinking about NIM going forward?","Steven M. Raney","Joel, it's Steve Raney. Yes, continued pressure on net interest margin. I would think that over the next couple of quarters, you could see further compression in the 15 to 20 basis point range. We're being selective not only on credit, but also on return and there are credits that we're passing on that just don't meet our return expectation relative to the risk that we think we'll take with the loan. So as Paul and Jeff mentioned, we're not under any huge pressure to grow loans, and if the opportunities are there to do that, we will take advantage of it. But if they're not, we're not going to compromise on what we think is unacceptable return or credit.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Hugh Miller, Sidoti.","Hugh M. Miller - Sidoti & Company, LLC","I guess as a follow-up on the banking questions. I was wondering, is there anything that's either geographically or product-specific that you're seeing more competition than in other areas? And the other follow-up is just, is there the opportunity to potentially grow in Canada a bit quicker if you know -- or are you seeing the same type of environment there?","Steven M. Raney","Hey, Hugh, it's Steve again. Really, I would say, it's relatively widespread in terms of the competitive landscape. Probably more so in the C&I, the commercial and industrial loan portfolio. But we're seeing it in the commercial real estate sector as well. We're taking some actions against that in terms of some other industries. We've not done any tax-exempt lending in the past. That's something we're evaluating going into. These tend to be good credits.","Jeffrey Paul Julien","It will help NIM.","Steven M. Raney","They tend to be -- you have better credits than the C&I loan. These will be loaned large enough for profits and municipalities. It's not anything we've done in the past but we're evaluating that as another diversification strategy. Your question about Canada, we've actually grown Canada more rapidly than the -- than our U.S. portfolio in the last couple of quarters, seeing a lot of good traction there. Some of the same dynamic exists, but it's not nearly as widespread, a competitive landscape. There aren't as many players up there. So that's been -- now, we're over a year into that opportunity and investment that we made, and that portfolio is actually growing more rapidly. And it's turned out to be really good business for us.","Hugh M. Miller - Sidoti & Company, LLC","Okay, appreciate the insight there. And then, I guess looking at the institutional equities that you did report. I mean, we did see a volume drop year-over-year and you guys saw quite a nice rise, a double-digit rise year-over-year in the institutional equity commissions. If you can just provide some color on kind of what's driving that? I wasn't sure if it was related to secondary trading post, underwriting activity or if it's just market share grab or what you're seeing there?","Paul Christopher Reilly","I would say it's all 3. I think that we've done better in share. Certainly, the underwriting as we do retail oriented MLPs or REITs adds to that. And we're just seeing better flows in the secondary trading too, so it's a little bit of all 3. And we anticipate that we're not going to get that kind of rise quarter-on-quarter, but we don't see them going down in the short term.","Hugh M. Miller - Sidoti & Company, LLC","Okay. I mean, so is it safe to say -- we've seen kind of a shift in the assets coming back in the equities that you guys are seeing, that sentiment changing a bit more in the institutional side versus the retail side?","Paul Christopher Reilly","In this market, I don't know how safe it is to say anything but I'd say yes.","Hugh M. Miller - Sidoti & Company, LLC","Okay. And then the last question was just on the recruiting side. I mean, you guys previously talked about being somewhat positive about the opportunities there and the pipeline for home office visits. And it seemed like it wasn't kind of coming through this particular quarter with the net adviser headcount. Can you just talk about that a bit further. Are you still very optimistic in what your expectations are on the recruiting side?","Paul Christopher Reilly","Yes, I don't think we're going to see recruiting like we did in 2009. But I think home office visits have been strong. And I think if you look at this conference, we had 65 people attending from other firms, who were kind of kicking the tires here. So that's our largest number since 2009 during the commotion in the market. So it's good. I will say that people tend to be slower when the markets are up. When things are good, people tend to take a little more time to make the decision. So when things slow down a little bit, they're much quicker to pull the trigger. So I think we're in that. The flows are good in terms of home office visits. But I think it's taking a little longer to get people over. The other trend is we're getting much larger advisers. They continue to get multimillion dollar-producing teams coming through. And again, they tend to do a lot more due diligence also to move their books. So we're happy with the flows and we'll have to see, we're going to have to close. But we still think we can do a good job on recruiting.","Steven M. Raney","And average gross per adviser continues to increase. One of the biggest net-net loss of advisers this past quarter was in Canada. You may have noticed on the chart. But a large part of that was a result of a grid change that they made, that was more punitive to people in the low-end. So they lost a chunk of advisers doing about $125,000 average gross, which is far lower than the average recruit we're hiring.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Alex Wilson [ph] with Goldman Sachs.","Unknown Analyst","Can we focus on expenses for a little bit? A couple of questions there. I guess when you look at the comp grade in the quarter and when you exclude the gain you guys are accruing comp, I guess, at a -- at the 71 almost percent you comp grade. And I understand you guys are going to get a little bit of a benefit next quarter with $5 million going away. But how should we think about the comp grade I guess pro forma for the cost cuts for the next few quarters? And then as a follow-up to that, non-comp, it feels like there's a lot of things that are still kind of coming through that are one-off-ish. Is there a way to quantify that and maybe Jeff, you can tell us how we should think about total dollars in non-comp for the next couple of quarters?","Jeffrey Paul Julien","I think with respect to the comp ratio, I think that we'll certainly see a downward trend from the -- you want to call it the [indiscernible] on the adjusted 70 to mid 60s. But it will take us at least a couple of quarters or more to get there. And that also implies some revenue help. We got hurt this quarter a little bit with having the fixed cost in comp and equity capital markets when the revenues went away. So with the normal market health, whatever normal is anymore, we still think that comp ratio with our mix of businesses that we got today should trend down say to the 66 type level over time. But I can't tell you when that will be realized. Obviously, I think, we'll start making progress on it right away here in the June quarter when you see some of these -- when you've seen some of these reductions in headcount that we've been talking about.  The other expenses are a little bit all over the board. I mean, occupancy you saw went down this quarter. We've got a data center that will be coming onstream that will add a little bit to that but not much, probably in this June quarter, if not, then the next quarter. Occupancy, I don't see moving a lot relative -- I don't see it doing much different than inflationary-type increases or CPI-type increases related to all of our leases and things like that. Other expenses, we've already talked about. They're pretty well controlled. And actually, that's where some of the synergies come. Some of the insurance expenses and audit expenses and things like that, that we get the benefit of having Morgan Keegan rolled into Raymond James going forward here. So I don't really see a big change there. Business development, we can control. We can -- those are largely controllable expenses in terms of what we want to do in terms of branding, in terms of conferences, in terms of home office visits and bio visits and other things. I think we're comfortable with where it is on a run rate right now. So unless there's a dramatic change in revenues one way or the other, I think that will probably stay where it is which leaves the wild card of Datacom. It's very hard for us to predict the total cost to some of the projects underway, when they come onstream, which things are going off stream. We've had contractors we've hired to keep some of the projects running that we will let go. There's a lot of moving parts in Datacom. As I told you, I certainly don't expect that we'll see 8% per quarter increases in that line item throughout the year. I would like to think that -- I don't necessarily think I can honestly tell you I believe it's peaked because it's a hard one to say. But I certainly don't expect dramatic increases from here. The best way for us to look at that expense I believe is as a percentage of revenues because you can't control some of your spend each year in that particular line item based on what the overall market firm is doing. We're approaching, if you exclude Albion again, which I don't think is totally fair as I mentioned, we're approaching 6% of revenues in that cost, and that's a high level for us. We haven't had enough internal discussions for me to tell you we've set some kind of absolute threshold, et cetera. But that's historically a high number, and I'd be surprised if we went over that going forward.","Paul Christopher Reilly","I'd like to add another comment on expenses. We are there during the conversion to spend money to get the conversion done and keep support levels. And examples is our back-office operations. If you take us pre-Morgan Keegan and add the Morgan Keegan office support, we're actually up 6% headcount. And we're adding new people and account openings. We are -- as we're trying to get back to service levels these people are on the new systems so we haven't seen synergies in the ops area. And it's easy to add to add people in new accounts. It doesn't take -- I don't have to be too smart to realize that's a good thing when we're getting inflow of new accounts. And it's going to take us a while in all these areas of our firm to really make sure that we're operating back on a good service-level basis before we're going to adjust anything. So we're going to see some of those runoffs in technology costs as we get the business, the systems converted. We've got a little bit more to do in the fixed income area. And same in the ops area, we're going to keep levels high until we feel like we can adjust them. And it's just -- it's going to take a while to get the cost out. We tried to articulate it. We probably haven't articulated it well enough. So we are going to make sure that the transition goes as smoothly as possible, and then we're going to drive back our target metrics.","Jeffrey Paul Julien","Another example of that is the Morgan Keegan legacy operating system. It's not as though on February 20, once we converted to Raymond James' system we just unplugged it and settled with the vendor and went away. We're keeping that system up and running for several quarters to make sure we get customer 10 99 outs accurately to make sure we get customer history over accurately to the Raymond James platform et cetera, et cetera. And so we still got that data in the event something happens here in the next couple of quarters. So that cost won't technically go away until early fiscal '14.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it, very helpful. It clearly sounds like you guys are still running a lot of kind of non-core expenses through your core expense base call it. And I guess it should be helpful to get a little bit better granularity on what they are so we can get a sense of once they go away. That's what the business sort of looks like. But I guess when we kind of take a step back, I mean, I think you guys talked about when you did the deal that the margin for the business overall should be 15-plus percent because that's kind of where you were pre-deal and obviously, you expect the deal to be somewhat accretive to the margins. Assuming revenue base doesn't change, just knowing what you know about expenses, can we still count on the 15% plus pre-tax margin from you guys?","Jeffrey Paul Julien","I'd have to go back and look with -- assuming revenues don't change, we -- if revenues aren't going to regrow, we would clearly adjust our business to optimize what we're doing. But I think right now, we would say that everything we're doing, the investments we're making, et cetera, are to grow revenues not to sit on a flat revenue base. That's a hard one to answer because we haven't modeled it that way. And I'll answer your other question, on how much other noise is going through. Remember, I said, we got $35 million-ish still in synergistic cost to come. Of that, about $12 million is non-comp. So that's how much it's run through some other expense lines or occupancy expense or Datacom type lines that will go away.","Hugh M. Miller - Sidoti & Company, LLC","And then a couple of specific questions on the bank. Appreciate your comments around the outlook for loan growth and I think it makes sense given what you're seeing with the environment. But you guys are sitting on a ton of capital both at the bank and the holding company. You used to kind of post some capital back into the bank to grow the loan portfolio, but since you're not going to do that in the current environment, should we expect -- what should we expect from you guys from Capital Management, I guess?","Jeffrey Paul Julien","Same old boring selves. I mean we tend to stay over capitalized as we long-term think we're a growth business, and we're not going to -- it's unlikely for us to ever do buybacks when those prices are lower, special dividend, which we really haven't done unless we think we can't grow the business in the medium- to long-term. So for short-term kind of things, if the business does slow down and we can't deploy capital, we'll tend to keep it. We've got -- probably our first use is to pay down debt when that opportunity comes. So I always tell investors, don't look to us as a balance sheet restructuring ploy. We still believe we're a long-term growth company and that we will -- we can deploy the capital. We have determined -- if we ever feel differently, then we'll tell people, and we'll do something different.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just feels like the bank was a big source of that capital. So the big user of that capital. So with that now growing at least in the near term, would you consider buying back some of the debt or I guess what else are you going to do with that?","Paul Christopher Reilly","We still think we can -- we're looking at still niche acquisitions across the board. We're very disciplined. Most deals that have happened, we've looked at and stepped away from for various reasons. We're still looking. We think we can grow. We believe that every one of our businesses has room to grow either geographically and\/or in some product line. But we're going to stay disciplined. And I think the bank is -- if the bank goes into a long-term decline, it will -- and it gives us back capital which it can do and we accumulate excess capital, we'll look at something different. Our anticipation right now is that we're in a shorter term loan bank and we believe we could still grow that business and all of our other businesses so.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Chris Harris with Wells Fargo.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So a couple more on the bank. First on the NIM guidance. I think if I recall correctly last quarter, we were thinking NIM would be down 10 basis points for the full fiscal year. Now if I'm hearing you guys correctly, if you count this quarter and then for the remainder, it sounds like NIM might be down in the 40 basis point-ish range. And I'm just kind of wondering what happened in those 3 months that you have such a large change in the NIM outlook. I get it that loan growth isn't as good. But is there something else that's going on, that's at play here? Are you guys getting a lot of high yielding loans that are paying off or what other variables are really driving the decline in NIM?","Steven M. Raney","Chris, the repricing of credits are pretty widespread in the portfolio, which is causing in some cases for us to accept that and in some cases, we're accepting payoffs in exiting or reducing levels in certain credits. So once again, yes, it's very widespread really across all of the commercial loan categories. So I would say that a large portion of our portfolio is already repriced and in some cases, multiple times over the last couple of years. So we think that the pace by which that we're going to continue to see that is going to decline. But I do expect some more of that to continue, and that's why I was guiding down further for the next couple of quarters.","Jeffrey Paul Julien","My recollection is we gave guidance of 3.4% to 3.5% for the year. Isn't that right, Steve? And we're at an adjusted NIM for this quarter of 3.49%, and we exceeded it in the first quarter, but there was some large fees and things like that, that we took into earnings that particular quarter. So I think that the guidance for the year probably is -- it should still probably be in that range unless -- on the adjusted basis taking out the -- stripping out the excess cash, which is depressed in the margin as I mentioned earlier.","Paul Christopher Reilly","The adjusted amount, we were down 18 basis points compared to the December quarter.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. All right. I guess I was looking at it on an unadjusted basis.","Jeffrey Paul Julien","You heard me earlier on that, having all that excess cash helps earnings, helps ROE because there's no capital requirement associated with it, and there is a positive spread. The only thing it depresses is our net interest margin. We don't really want that cash, but we do want to provide the service to our clients to give them FDIC insurance on their bank's weak program.","Steven M. Raney","Chris, I'd also mention, I know we're providing you point in time in the period loan balances that -- our average loan balance for the March quarter was actually $325 million higher than the December quarter. Yes, just to provide that additional color.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Yes, okay, guys, that's definitely helpful. The bank, how do you guys think about growth. I really got to commend you guys for not wanting to chase bad product or make loans that really are uneconomic or don't make sense as far as your credit standards are concerned. But if we enter into a period where we've got a couple of years of really very lax lending standards, are you guys comfortable with just kind of keeping the loans as they are at the bank as far as a no growth scenario, or how do you kind of balance the desire to grow versus maintaining your credit standards?","Paul Christopher Reilly","We have a strong desire to grow our company, but not at the cost of credit standards, and it's been very clear to Steve and the bank and the whole firm is that I'd rather have loan balances shrink than start chasing credit. So we're going to stay disciplined. We've expanded areas, our SBL loans have been growing, our Canadian loan portfolio is going, we can have some growth in our home mortgage origination where we've seen some success. But we're not going to chase bad credit. So the mandate is as the firm, we're a growth firm, but if the credit -- we're not going to weaken credit standards and if we shrink, we shrink.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And last one for me, real quick on the Merchant Banking business. Can you guys remind us how large that portfolio is in terms of assets? And should we assume that you guys will be in kind of this monetization phase considering how strong markets have been and so that the gains in proprietary capital, are they likely to be kind of recurring over the next couple of quarters?","Jeffrey Paul Julien","We've got something around $100 million invested now. Albion was our biggest piece. But we've got some we own directly outright, some we own through fund formats, some are affiliated and some are unaffiliated. So you can see that in our Q in the level 3 assets section. Do we really think that if we're going to see gains like this? First of all, I'd say I don't necessarily think we're in total liquidation phase. We are cognizant of the Volcker rule. Any impact that may have on our ability to grow the business in the format we've been doing it in the past, we can continue to do it in a fund format where we manage the assets but aren't a significant owner of the assets. We do have several that we are still the significant owner of in the portfolio. I would certainly not model out gains like we've seen. We may have some going forward, but I don't think they'll be of the magnitude that we've seen here with the Albion investment, not for some time.","Operator","Your next question comes the line of William Katz with Citi.","William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just  coming back to the discussion on the timing of cost savings. I'm just a little confused by the tone or just the commentary. Most expectations were to have the full cost savings in by the end of this fiscal year. Is that still the case or are you suggesting that it slips into fiscal '15?","Paul Christopher Reilly","Our target has been to get it done this year and to try to keep next year's earnings clean. There may be some items that slip over but our target has been to get the savings done so we can start realizing them at the beginning of the fiscal next year. But there's a lag from when we do all these cost adjustments until they start coming through the P&L. So we're still on the same guidance we've always given you. But I can't tell you that some of the stuff won't slip over.","Jeffrey Paul Julien","Yes, we've got cost savings initiatives planned for some for June and some for the September quarter. But if you do them in the September quarter, as Paul points out, you won't really see the benefit of it until the next quarter.","William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Next question is, when you look at your Capital Markets pre-tax margins, that has been coming down pretty steadily, and I appreciate the seasonal nature between the fourth quarter, calendar fourth quarter to calendar first quarter, but more structurally, at what point do you take a look at the margin of that business and have to right size for what appears to be a weaker revenue backdrop?","Paul Christopher Reilly","We've been pretty clear in the last couple of calls that we are looking, and we will make some changes in that business. A part of it is headcount and part of it is just comp and payouts. Some of it is elevated by the integration and retention payments. Some of it in transitional deals as we try to get 2 businesses together. And some of it is headcount related. So it's not the massive numbers we went through in technology. But there will be some trimming and there will be some comp adjustments. And so again, our goal is to focus through this fiscal -- the rest of this fiscal year to get that done. So we do acknowledge that they're elevated.","Jeffrey Paul Julien","With respect to equity Capital Markets, those aren't part of the synergy cost we've got in here. That's just pure right-sizing.","William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, so that would be on top of the planned integration savings, is that correct?","Jeffrey Paul Julien","Right, but fixed income is part of the continued integration.","Paul Christopher Reilly","We balance here. We have not been a big -- the markets get good, hire like crazy to participate and then when markets slow down it's cut to the bone and wait out. So we've been more middle. Bull markets, we don't chase them and the down markets, we trim and we will trim. But we don't cut to the bone and then start chasing an up market again. So but we're running elevated on any standard, and we know that and we will address it. We are addressing it.","William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","That's helpful. And then just a back up for me, when you look at the bank discussion for a moment. Can you tell me what the duration of the bank is today versus the end of the year?","Jeffrey Paul Julien","Versus the end of the fiscal year?","William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Right.","Jeffrey Paul Julien","The duration of all of our assets?","William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Right, on the asset side, right.","Jeffrey Paul Julien","About the same.","William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And have you quantified that and it probably appears around 2, 2.5 years, are you assuming the same ballpark?","Jeffrey Paul Julien","No, well, it's shorter than that. I don't have a good number for you on that. I'd be glad to follow up with you. I mean just looking at all of our asset classes...","Unknown Executive","We don't have the GAAP report in front of us but we can do that and let you know, Bill.","William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then just a final one. You mentioned in terms of you're seeing a pickup in the size of the better mix if you will of sort of the FA growth versus what's it riding. When you look across the business, a lot of your peers talk about the competitive nature and the markets being what they are. How do you think about the upfront costs and return on investment in terms of timeframe to get your return? I mean, changing economics if you will.","Paul Christopher Reilly","Yes, we are, we have not -- we just don't compete head up in front money and the transition of systems that we have competitors especially the bigger ones that pay out twice as much as we do. And we -- our sales point is coming to our culture, which is high service, FA focused, no product push. And if you can get less money up front, your payout is going to be better over time and you can earn it, but you got to earn it over time. And we want you to join to be with us, not for a check, and that's -- we've been in that position as being lower than our most of our competitors for a long time, and we continue to do that. We're not buying business for dollars.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Wong with MorningStar.","Michael Wong - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","So what have you seen in Europe that caused the impairment and restructuring charge this quarter?","Paul Christopher Reilly","We just -- if you think that people talk about the commission market versus research being challenged here as we've had declining over the desk commissions because of ETFs and electronic trading. The European market has been tougher and it has been for a while, not only our volume is down. Pricing is tough and we've just decided to kind of -- we've had a long-term partnership there, and we just felt it was time to restructure. We have a great leader there who's been with us a long time and running the U.S. equity side and we wanted to get the European equity side under him fully too. So we bought out the minority interest in that -- in one of that deal, and we're downsizing our number of salespeople and analysts to fit the market. So we just because it wasn't fully controlled, it was a little harder, so we just bought full control and we're making the adjustments.","Michael Wong - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. So there was no big change in the market. It was just decided to take that charge this quarter off of trends that have been going on for a while?","Paul Christopher Reilly","Yes. We've been looking at that, and it was obvious to us that the market in the short term wasn't going to turn. We have good people, so we went ahead and just bought out the remaining shareholders took control of resizing the business to where we think it should be. We just -- we've been watching it really for 2 years now and just went ahead and bit the bullet.","Michael Wong - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","And just a bit curious about how this is the third quarter in a row that margin balances have declined. I just assumed that they would grow with the market [indiscernible] client assets and sentiment is not terrible. So if you could just comment a little bit on that, that would be great.","Paul Christopher Reilly","Go ahead Jeff.","Jeffrey Paul Julien","The only we obviously -- I mean, we don't counsel our clients to take a lot of leverage here. Our margin balances for FA are probably very low compared to the Street in general. The only new development there has been that a lot of the new --  the leverage based on your securities portfolio has been going to the bank in the form of securities-based lending, which we've had for about a year at the bank, which has grown to over $400 million. So in fairness, you almost have to look at those 2 in unison. They don't necessarily I wouldn't say it's cannibalized existing business to a great extent, but certainly the new business, they're considering, which is most appropriate between the bank line versus the broker-dealer line.","Paul Christopher Reilly","And especially for new advisers, as we recruited and higher- and higher-end advisers with the wealthier client, they choose the securities based lending usually because they use it as a financing vehicle, not really just as a stock repurchase vehicle.","Operator","And your final question comes from the line of Justine Mario with Lord Abbot.","Unknown Analyst","Just to beat the horse on the NIM. I would appreciate some color, and sorry if I missed it, about NII versus NIM. Just given the fixation on NIM as a percent I know, I'm sure it drives you guys crazy too. But any kind of directional commentary on NII would be appreciated because it sounds like most of the stuff you're talking about really is kind of OpEx on NIM as a percentage, maybe not as much NII in dollars other than to the point about loans, you're not going to be out chasing them. But would you expect much degradation there?","Jeffrey Paul Julien","If loans run flat and NII stays where it is, we'll be flat. But that's a math exercise. It's a matter of whether we're be able to maintain loan balances or whether they actually decline. If loan balances decline, then NIM stays the same. We'll have a degradation in NII. And if they both occur, the decline in loans and the decline in net interest margin, then it will be even more severe. But yes, we don't foresee a significant decline from the current levels, at least I don't. And see a significant decline from the current levels in net interest income at the bank. I think there might be a slight contraction of NIM from here. We're still guiding like we said 3 40 to 3 50 for the year. And I think that loans will probably be -- my guess is it will be flattish for the rest of the year given the current environment that we're seeing.","Steven M. Raney","We had 2 days less interest in the March quarter compared to the December quarter, which impacted the net interest income significantly, nearly $2 million worth.","David M. Trone - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","Jeff, to a point though I mean NII is what determines earnings, not NIM. And the variables you're talking about in terms of not growing loans and obviously some stuff prepaying or whatever is really OpEx and NIM, unless you're saying that we're seeing massive downward repricings on stuff or retaining, which it doesn't sound like. I mean, obviously, there's rate pressure in the world, but it doesn't seem like that's the case with you guys. Is that fair?","Steven M. Raney","Well, a lot of that has already been reflected in the numbers but I do think that we're going to continue to have reductions in NIM and our balances will, like Jeff said, will be flat to maybe slightly down on an average basis the next couple of quarters. So there will be some...","Jeffrey Paul Julien","Some impact, but I don't think it will be material based on the current levels. And there are other factors in the bank that are equally important like the provision.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time.","Paul Christopher Reilly","Okay. Well, I'd like to thank you all for joining the call. I know that with the integration, the numbers are difficult as you guys try to figure out when the costs are coming out, I actually think outside of the M&A number, the revenue numbers and our businesses weren't bad. I think we've got tailwinds in the business. Given a good equity capital markets, I think the earnings power is here. We just got to get the cost out. We're focused on it. I know and we're going to do it when we believe we will get to our targets. But again, we're focused first on making sure our business is operating well. That people are settled in, that the systems, processes and support are working. And then we are attacking the costs, which we've started to do. So I know it's hard for you all to predict the timing. So I think a lot of this is timing versus the ultimate goal. But thank you for joining us, and we'll talk to you soon.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's conference call.

Paul?","Paul Reilly","Good morning, Paul, thank you. Kind of a very interesting year if you'd asked me in the first or second quarter if we were going to finish on record. So I would have said, with that assets down at the start of the year in a tough market, oil prices plunging, the underwriting markets is almost freezing up, I would have been very surprised. So needless to say, we're very pleased about the record quarter and record fiscal year. We kind of achieved this remarkably in a very unremarkable fashion with just a relentless following up of a long-term implementation strategy.","Tom celebrated his 50th year at Raymond James and he constantly reminds us that our mission is to focus on the well-being of our clients, and assist advisors in helping clients achieve their financial objectives, and to make all our decisions for the long-term. And if you look at this year there is nothing in particularly that stood out, except all divisions had record revenue. This year as our record revenue and profits were achieved while we underwent robust recruiting.","The integration of three groups that joined our family; the Duestche Bank U.S. Private Client Service Unit that we've rebranded Alex Brown, a division of Raymond James and added capability in the Northeastern expansion of our ultra-high network capabilities. 3Macs; the firm actually older than the country of Canada, has well joined us after almost a 200-year partnership, great divisors and giving us some multi-language capabilities, back office capability in Canada. The company is expanding our M&A capability in Europe will Mel [ph] numbered his group.","The implementation of masses of world-class AML system in very short order in our platform. New client and advisor technology including advisors have been able to do all their work on their iPhone or iPads, so unique technology. So this year was achieved really by our associates. They accomplished all this, we don't talk much about the Austin, Texas people but we ought to thank them. Through all of this, not only did they achieve the above but they kept the outstanding service levels to our clients and advisors that drive our retention and satisfaction. So they really deserve the credit for this year.","First, I want to cover our fiscal year-end highlights. I'm going to turn over to Jeff and he is going to cover the Q -- the quarter, and certain line items. Then I'll kind of discuss the segment year, how we did in the segments in our kind of outlook in some of the segments.","So with that we achieved record annual net revenue of $5.4 billion, up 4% over last year's record. And that was driven by annual net revenue in all four records, in all four of our core operating segments. Record annual net income of $529.54 million or $3.65 per diluted share. Again, this was driven by record profit in our capital market segment and RJ Bank, and still the second best year of pre-tax profits for both, the private client group and asset management group combined they in this record by a less than $5 million. So it really was a good year for everyone. The record diluted EPS of $3.65 for the year represents a 6% growth over fiscal 2015.","On adjusted basis, and that if you take out the $41 million of acquisition-related expenses, our non-GAAP net income of $556.3 million or $3.84 per diluted shares. That represents a 12% growth over the fiscal 2015 diluted EPS. We also ended the year with several new records and key operating metrics which should bode well for revenue going forward. Helped by the aforementioned acquisitions, we hit some of these records but I also wanted you to note that even without the acquisitions, our organic growth alone would have achieved records in most of these segments that drive our forward revenue.","Record client assets under administration of $604.4 billion, a 26% year-over-year increase; again augmented by the $50 billion roughly of client assets brought over from Alex Brown and 3Macs. However, even if you excluded those additional assets, our client assets under administration would have grown roughly 15% on a year-over-year basis which reflects our solid organic growth. We had a record number of private client group financial advisors, 7,146; a net increase of 550 over the last year, which was augmented by approximately 265 advisors added through the acquisitions we talked about.","We are proud of this result because we've retained approximately 90% of the Alex Brown team, and nearly 100% of the 3Macs advisors. So during the year on an organic basis, even if you excluded those, we added 285 advisors during the year. That combined with our low regrettable attrition which remained below 1% in all of our divisions drove advisor growth. Record financial assets under management of $77 billion, up 18% over the last year lifted by our asset management group which exclusively serves clients in our private client group.","Record net loans of Raymond James Bank of $15.2 billion which is up 17% over September 2015. More importantly, a lot of that growth this year was slanted in categories of strength in our client relationships and our PCG in capital market segments such as securities based loans, residential mortgages, commercial real estate loans, and tax exempt loans.","So with those highlights, I'll now turn it over to Jeff to talk about the record quarter, and even though it was almost half driven by tax benefits or a lot of -- the other half was driven by solid operating trends. So Jeff?","Jeff Julien","Thanks, Paul. As Paul mentioned we had a record revenue quarter, $1.46 billion, up 9% compared to last year's fourth quarter of 7% compared to the preceding quarter. That -- this revenue growth was really across the board, all four of our core operating segments had record quarterly revenues and in the September quarter. Furthermore, three of our four segments, private client group, capital markets and the bank all generated record quarterly pre-tax profits. So a very strong quarter.","Net income was $171.7 million, 19 per diluted share. That represents the 35%% growth over last year's fourth quarter and 37% over the preceding quarter. And then on a non-GAAP basis, kind of a headline number I guess that people are talking about. The adjusted net income of $185 million was $1.28 per diluted share which is a 38% increase over the preceding quarter. So obviously the $1.28 far exceeded everybody's expectations including our own. So let me touch on some of the major variances from the consensus model that really drove that feat [ph].","On the revenue side, the biggest line item that really varies from everyone's expectations was the strength of the investment banking revenues and that was really a combination of several businesses we had. We seem to have a tradition of having strong Septembers in lot of these businesses and this year was no exception. M&A, equity underwritings, both picked up and our tax credit fund business which is also in that line item had a phenomenal quarter, a lot of syndications closing in the quarter. So while we -- most of all still under that -- maybe not commissions on the institutional equity side but the other cylinders were all firing pretty well.","So we're -- we have a good pipeline in most of the businesses but I'd be surprised if we stay at that level in the equity capital market side, all year next year but that one's a hard one to predict as you all know. Interestingly, almost all of the other revenue items were ahead of the consensus numbers but all by mid-single digit type percentages, so nothing really -- nothing else really blew the cover off the ball on the revenue side of an investment banking. So while we're on the revenue side let me talk about a couple of the other line items and give you a kind of a little help in terms of what we see going forward here.","On our biggest line item, the commission and fees line, you can see in the release fee-based assets, our assets in fee-based accounts ended the quarter at $231 billion, 12% up from the preceding quarter. A lot of that was -- we've got about $11 billion to $12 billion or $11 billion-ish of fee based assets from the acquisitions that we made, so that obviously helped that increase. That certainly is going to provide a good tailwind for the security and commissions and fees going forward. But all those are aren't going to manifest themselves in a percentage increase in fees but we think that the bill -- the billings in the October versus the preceding quarter were up about -- between 9% and 10%. So a good start on that line item for the quarter going forward. Similarly the increase in assets under management of 7% sequentially provide a help for the investment advisory fees as well.","Let me touch on net interest for a moment; in the release you can see the increase in secured client lending ended the quarter at $4.3 billion, about $800 million higher than the preceding quarter, about $75 million of that was organic growth and the rest was really all attributable to the increase in margin loans that came as part of the Alex Brown transaction. So those -- that will obviously help interest earnings going forward. Net interest was $140 million for the quarter which is 3% above the preceding quarter despite the additional interest expense during the quarter from our bond issue in July. So I mean -- most of that was driven by the strength of the bank and its growth.","Going forward, we're -- it looks like net interest will pick up about $30 million of net interest such as the -- no rate change, it will pick up about $30 million of net interest next year from the Alex Brown related cash, to customer cash balances and margin balances. And then we'll obviously expect to have some continued bank growth with the NIM somewhere in the current range, and we're guessing somewhere between 10% and 15% growth in the bank. So all those things will lead us to some nice continued growth in the net interest income line item.","If we're fortunate enough to get a rate increase which is being rumored more and more strongly all the time; any rate increase we're projecting would add somewhere between $12 million and $15 million pre-tax per quarter for us. Of course that's dependent upon how much gets passed through to clients but just so you can do sensitivity, we're assuming that that somewhere between 40% and 50% of it gets passed through to clients but you can -- for sensitivity purposes, every basis point means about $4 million. So if that assumption is wrong, that's the sensitivity of that.","Now let me turn to the expense side; the comp ratio for the quarter was a very nice 65.9%, much lower than it has been recently and lower than expectations has largely to do with revenue mix there in the quarter. The comp ratio for the overall year was 67.1% which I think was nicely below our target of 68% and I think that we would be happy to repeat that in fiscal '17. So we're not necessarily going to lower our compensation target of 68% but maybe we have some soft expectations that we do better if we can continue to grow revenues but there are other things that are coming into play next year as Paul talked about that could impact that line item as well.","But most of the reason the comp was up for the quarter obviously relates to the increases in the related revenues. The communication information processing was a little bit below our $70 million for quarter guidance but it did finish the year almost directly on at $280 million for the year. Going forward, I think our -- I would tell you that our guidance on this would be something like 10% higher, somewhere in the $7 million to $80 million range per quarter and the biggest driver of that is the systems work that is already underway related to the DOL rule; and the work we're having to do to comply with that which becomes effective in the middle of fiscal '17 for us. So that's the biggest driver, there are other projects of course as well. So that's just -- where we are we think it will be somewhere 10% higher going into next year.","I mentioned the occupancy expenses just briefly, even though that wasn't way off of expectations, obviously we're going to have -- we have 16 more branches with the Alex Brown acquisition. So we'll have some increased occupancy related to that and we're also at the point where we are going to be considering some home office expansion space which may well start hitting in '17 as well, hard to quantify that one but I would expect it -- that may have some modest impact.","Most of the other expenses were closed, I'll talk about the bank loan loss provision; it was only one -- only -- I'd say only $1.2 million for the quarter which was much lower than expectations. I mean that loan growth was just over $400 million but the growth for the year and for the quarter is -- has become more balanced between the commercial loans and the rest -- we'll call it retail loans, the residential and securities-based loans which carry lower provisions with them.","So we have to kind of look at about the mix of loans but coupled with that -- where we had some downgrades during the quarter, you can see the increase in criticized loans on the last page of the press release -- but we also had some very nice pay-downs and pay-offs, particularly the more harshly criticized energy space which freed up some reserves of energy credits; the portfolio of energy credits definitely improved over the course of the of the year, and those more than offset the downgrade. So as the net results -- the provision was a little low even though the overall reserve remains pretty close to the 130 basis points level.","And other expenses; last quarter really we told you they were little bit elevated because of some legal and regulatory expenses or dejavu [ph]. I would say that this quarter again there -- we're seeing elevated legal expenses of provisions I should say, then Paul will talk maybe a little bit more about that later on but that that -- I don't know -- but I can tell you this maybe sort of the new normal for now with the regulatory environment that we're in. So just accordingly, I suppose.","Acquisitions expenses were about $19.4 million for the quarter and $40.7 million for the year. Most of those related to Alex Brown, some relate to the 3Macs acquisition as well and going forward we're looking at somewhere between $12 million and $15 million of additional expenses to hit that line item over the next two quarters. We expect to stop using that line item at the end of the March quarter. So we expect most of those incremental cost to be complete by that time.","As we talked about in the press release, 'the biggest variance in the quarter and -- which all of you noted in your early comments was that it's abnormally low effective tax rate of 27.4% for the quarter'. The three biggest factors which we also mentioned in the release related to the tax benefits associated with the planned divestitures of our Latin American businesses, they are all under contract at this point or most are under contract at this point. We have been providing for taxes on repatriation of earnings from those entities but that obviously will not be happening now, so we had to reverse that tax associated with that.","We had a very good quarter on the firm's corporate on life insurance portfolio which is closing in on $300 million in terms of size and even though the S&P might have up 3% or so during the quarter, it's more diversified than that and it's been a lot of long midcaps and stuffs from international and other things that -- that portfolio had a little over a 4% return for the quarter, so that was a big non-taxable gain for us in the quarter. That one set us in prior years and prior quarters as well and -- but I just wanted to give you a feel for the rough size of it. So that will continue to impact us in both directions going forward but long-term it's been -- certainly been beneficial to us.","The third item we mentioned was a favorable resolution of some state tax issues which was -- we're able to resolve favorably and release some of the reserves we had related to those items. So all those things led us to what I would call an abnormally low rate and I would tell you that going forward I guess that would steer you sort of towards a 36% type effective rate going forward, it's a little lower than we've guided in the past, we have an increasing number of -- increasing amount of tax exempt interest income as the bank builds its portfolio of tax exempt loans to municipalities. That's becoming a bigger factor in the bank, also for CRA purposes as investing in certain tax credit funds, and that's starting to give us bigger tax credits as well. So just for my link purposes, I guess they've used the 36-ish.","So we -- all that -- when we're just all that down we generated a pre-tax margin of 17.5% on non-GAAP basis, well over our 16% target. I gave us 15.6% for the year which is good relative to where we started the year certainly but it -- it's just below our recently adopted 16% target that we have kind of on our pre-tax margin basis going forward. And my guess is right now we would be -- will probably leave that target intact as we do pretty comfortable in that 16% target for all of fiscal '17.","Just a couple other points and I'll turn it back to Paul. One is the weighted average shares, you can see that's having an impact on EPS, it's lower this year's fourth quarter than last year's, given the share buyback that we did in the January\/February timeframe where we purchased about 3.2 million shares for $145 million. One of the things that kind of jumped off the page to me was our total assets for the quarter increased $2.8 billion in one quarter and we really want to get to the bottom of that and the biggest factors of course were our $800 million bond issue, $700 million of growth in the bank between the security loan portfolio and the securities portfolio which I'll talk about in the second.","And the rest really was the client cash balances and margin loans brought onto our balance sheet from the Alex Brown and 3Macs transactions so we don't expect that rate of growth for the overall balance sheet on a quarterly basis going forward; this was of an abnormally big jump. Because of that increase in assets and some of higher risk-weighted -- risk weighting assigned to some of those assets such as advances to FAs, intangibles and things that came with the Alex Brown transaction, we had a slight decrease of about 80 basis points in our total capital ratio. So we're still well over comfort level, we're at 21.5%. So we're not concerned about it but that's just again is something that has -- pointed out that's the reason there is balance sheet growth during the quarter even though capital increased.","I mentioned the securities portfolio previously at the bank, it increased about $300 million during the quarter, we have decided to modestly increase the securities portfolio; agency mortgage-backed securities primarily, a short duration under three years. The deal is somewhere between 1.5% and 1.6%, we just think that's the prudent way to invest some of our excess cash balances and capital at the bank while we maintain the liquidity there. So we're not taking any credit risk but we're taking some modest duration risk and that will have the effect of increasing the bank's earnings increasing their ROE because this doesn't take a lot of capital to do as we're buying high quality paper. But it will impact in NIM somewhat negatively going forward. So it will offset some of the loan growth -- the NIM creation from loan growth.","And I've talked about the interest rate sensitivity; I don't know if anyone is building that into models but if that happens it's about like I said $4 million for every basis points of additional spread that we keep for the next hike.","So with that I will turn it back over the Paul to talk a little bit more about the year-end and some macro trends going forward.","Paul Reilly","Thanks, Jeff. I know there is a lot to go over on the annual call but I'll try to get through this is quickly as possible. Private Client Group segment, let me start there; record annual net revenue of $3.62 billion which is 3% over fiscal 2015. And note, it's the second best pre-tax profit of $340.6 million, down just $2 million for last year's record.","Driven by really advisor recruiting, it was record independent advisor recruiting; and the employee group, probably the second best year. So very strong organic growth, it's not just the acquisitions. We also in the Private Client Group, the segment was helped by higher assets and fee-based accounts during the year, as well as higher fees earned on cash balances in the Raymond James Bank deposit program following the increased rates of last December. However, revenues were negatively impacted by declines in transactional revenues, especially new issue credits, really attributable to the market slowdown in underwritings. And retail equity commissions was a result of lower client engagement, religious training through the year. And we think we'll see a continuation in the fee-based accounts which will be pushed by the DOL [ph], sure it will.","The revenue growth of 3% was lower than our asset growth during that transition year and we should note -- we also had elevated regulatory expenses in the Private Client Group segment for the year which Jeff talked about, continued into the fourth quarter. And capital markets generated record annual net revenues of -- I don't know why it can't stay a $1 billion but 99 -- $999.9 million for pre-tax over 20015 and record annual pre-tax income of $139.2 million, up really 30% over 2015; driven really by record revenues in our fixed income division and record revenues through agreements in tax credit.","Our fixed income division had a fantastic year, institutional fixed income commission is up 11% and varies all in net trading profits. Our net trading profits which include other divisions was actually up 57% this year to $92 million. Now I also want to note that we didn't have the same phenomenon that the big banks with this explosive fourth quarter, it's been very, very steady through the year; we are variation fee driven business and those profits are like little pieces traded at time. So it's been very steady, very different than what other people have reported.","Offsetting some of the strength in fixed income and tax credits plus the equity capital markets division -- as equity revenues were down 27% -- underwriting revenues were down 27% from last year; actually little better than the overall market. And institutional equity commissions were down 8%, so it's been a tough year I think for everyone in underwritings. M&A fortunately had a strong fourth quarter resulting in M&A revenues only being down 8% from last year's record. Additionally, we're happy to welcome [indiscernible] company to Raymond James family expanding our cross border M&A activity.","Asset management segment generated record annual net revenues of $404.3 million, up 3% over last year and at a second best pre-tax profit of $132.2 million, down 2% from last year's record. As I mentioned earlier, financial assets under management and it is $77 billion which is up 18% over the last year. So again, very good results. The asset management division has continued to benefit from the growth in the Private Client Group segment, as well as increased utilization of our fee-based accounts. In fact at the end of September, fee-based assets and PCG totaled $231 billion, up 29% over 2015 and represents about 40% of our total client assets in PCG.","Eagle was challenged by an institutional net outflows during the year which I think is consistent with the macro-trends. We're still believers in active management which seems to be out of favor right now but have continued to focus on augmenting both, our portfolio management sales team and Eagle. The bank records annual net revenues of $494 million, 19% over last year, recorded annual pre-tax income of $337.3 million, 21% over fiscal 2015. The record results for the bank were typically strong on loan growth, net loans ended at -- up 17% at $15.2 billion. And the bank's net interest margin for the year was relatively stable at 3.04% compared to 3.07% for the previous year.","With short interim rates increasing in December '15, you may have expected them to an increase more broadly but primarily that decrease had to do with excess cash in the bank as well as the loan mix growth outside of the C&I portfolio. Most importantly, our credit quality of the loan portfolio remained very solid through the fiscal year despite increased provisions we took earlier, largely due to the precipitous drop in oil prices. The other segment -- that generated $21 million or 31% decline in revenues, mostly due to lower private equity gains this year.","So overall, a fantastic year; record revenues and profits fueled by record revenue in all of our segments and record or near record profits in our core operating segments. ROE for the year is 11.3 on a GAAP basis and 11.8 on a non-GAAP basis which we're very pleased, especially given that our capital ratios have stayed over 20% throughout the year. The outlook certainly with the political and economic and regulatory with DOL, uncertainty is always hard to predict coming this year. But in the private client group, the records and assets should bode well to a good start for the year; both in client assets under administration and the balances in our cash suite programs.","We're excited about the high quality advisors and people from the Alex Brown and 3Macs acquisitions. But if you remember us through Morgan Keegan, we don't expect those to be big contributors to profits this year because we're going to be very deliberate through our integrations and keeping support levels high until the transaction is fully -- you know that is down and people are very comfortable with our systems. We also have about $35 million of additional retention from Alex Brown running through the P&L this coming year. Further, we expect legal and regulatory expense to remain elevated as we comply with DOL and other regulations. So that's going to have an impact.","We also -- by no questions will come up with the DOL, we've been very clear from the beginning that our focus has been complying with the rule of giving the maximum flexibility for our advisors to serve our clients and have clients have choice. So we fully expect to offer commission-based accounts to the big and comply with the rules. In the capital market segment, we're cautiously optimistic but investment banking making a return familiar -- very hard year for everyone in the market. But again, that's hard to predict with the political and economic uncertainty.","Our fixed income business had a record fiscal 2016 held largely by trading profits but as we've said, we have a flow business and we can expect trading profits to indefinitely stay at this level. So we wouldn't be surprised that the contract is somewhat during this coming year. The asset management segment, we expected continued growth as we grow our number of advisors and increase utilization of fee-based accounts. Raymond James Bank, we believe is in position to continue to grow to the extent we can find loans that meet our criteria under risk-return. We expect the growth, we -- if you ask us, we'd expect a slight expansion of the NIM as we invest some of that cash but we think the bank is in very good shape.","So in closing, we're entering 2017 with a lot of uncertainties but that seems to be lately the last couple years have been like that. But we're convinced that we continue to focus on our mission and helping our clients and advisors in this challenging environment, we'll continue to deliver good results.","So with that I'm going to turn it back to the operator and open it up for questions. Raquel?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities.","Devin Ryan","Good morning. Maybe just starting on the deal while I appreciate some of the comments but obviously a lot of moving parts there. And we're hearing from some that they're looking to apply kind of the fiduciary requirements across all brokerage assets; and then others are talking about going to level commissions for similar products. So I appreciate you're going to offer choice but I'm curious maybe where you stand on those? And then also you'd spoken about the overtime here, renegotiation that could occur with products manufacturers, just around the economics of the sale. And I'm curious if any of those have already occurred and kind of how you see the economics changing?","Paul Reilly","So first from an advisory standpoint, we will be leveled fee in those accounts. So we will be moving -- but that we're already there and our employee division and we will have to move there on fee-based accounts for our independent contractors. So we believe that the -- we're lots of discussions with our partners that we think most of the revenue impact if any will be pushed off into next year as we get through the transition fiscal year '18. So on the DOL impact, so that's hard to quantify; and I believe that to the best of our knowledge right now that in our operating technology in operations kind of cost guidance that we have the cost of that transition building for next year or so. So we'll see more as we go. But also the DOL is going to release the questions -- answered the questions that they've talked about releasing in the summer -- so late summer this year has been warm around the country. So we expect those times to -- and that maybe some weeks -- some of our response but we fully expect to offer a range of options for advisors to help their clients.","Devin Ryan","Got it. Okay, that's helpful. And maybe the increase in the securities portfolio in the bank and I think some people will like to see that you're moving in that direction. I'm just curious if you can put in more context around how much more you look to expand that? And then just in terms of the economics, so you're picking 150 basis points in a ballpark in the securities; what's the current give up on that -- I guess, I'm assuming it's coming from the third-party bank deposits, so I'm just starting to think about the net benefit there?","Jeff Julien","Yes, we think the overall securities portfolio -- it's been $400 million type range already, we're thinking about growing it to by about $1 billion. So over the course of the year just to put a frame of reference on it. In terms of the give up, we're still earning a little over 50 basis points from the banks we programmed. So to redeploy that cash -- we'd be picking up about 100 basis points by doing this -- and deploying a little bit of capital.","Paul Reilly","We're staying mainly with all agencies in the short-term. So our portfolio will probably be more short-term.","Jeff Julien","Yes, the duration down as [indiscernible] itself three years on what we've been putting on over the last quarter.","Jeff Julien","Yes, Devin. The -- as a reminder, we have a lot of our corporate loans to have LIBOR floors as such -- about $4 billion of our corporate loans have floors so they would not enjoy the benefit of that LIBOR increase until we really get over 100 basis points in LIBOR. We also have a mix of 30 day in LIBOR based loans; loans that are based on 30-day and 90-day. There has obviously been a lot more increase in the 90-day rate over the last year as compared to the 30-day rate. But that would be beneficial to the us in general but the impact is not as great as it may appear on the surface because of the LIBOR force.","Devin Ryan","Got it. And just one last quick one here; just on FA recruiting; you still seem to have some pretty good momentum, I'm just curious is that shifting at all with the uncertainty around DOL where FA's may be waiting to make a move or even you would think about slowing -- just to kind of get some better perspective around what the real revenue implications could be?","Jeff Julien","Surprisingly not. We've kind of expected that but we haven't seen it. And the pipeline is robust, this month's a little slower but it always is going to go through the year and we -- our backlog is very strong and we have not seen a slowdown, it doesn't mean it won't happen as we get closer but we haven't seen that yet.","Devin Ryan","Got it. Okay, thank you guys for taking my questions and congratulations on the strong quarter.","Jeff Julien","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Harris from Wells Fargo.","Chris Harris","Thank you. So the margin in private client; I thought it was particularly good. It sounds like you guys still have some elevated legal expenses running through there. So can you maybe talk just a little bit how the margins were so good? And related to that, is Alex Brown coming through at a higher margin; maybe that's providing some advances [ph]?","Paul Reilly","Unfortunately Alex Brown -- actually for the month it was been because the amortization starts hitting but it's not going to provide -- it's going to provide some pressure on the margins because it's more of a breakeven business before we -- on our internal accounting. So that's how allocate cost between advisor retention and costs -- but it generates a lot of activity, both in the bank and the cash sweep and other things that make up a good investment. And we've got great advisors, so the -- we don't -- we think that both 3Macs and Alex Brown, if anything we'll put a little pressure on the margin, the other way.","Jeff Julien","As well as the impact of DOL, whatever it might be \u2013 extend the expenses.","Chris Harris","So what I mean -- so margin was up 200 basis points from last quarter in that segment, I'm just trying to figure out what happened there?","Jeff Julien","We just had a lot higher fee billings in that quarter than we had in the preceding quarter. We -- and we did enjoy most of the quarter, some of the interest spread on these balances, we got one from one-third of the quarter, things like that -- but we haven't really looked at what the margin target is for PCG next year but maybe between that 10% to 11% range we got to look at what it is and if there is another interest rate hike it may go up from there. But I don't think this was -- and any one thing you can really point to is saying that it was really strange. So it was just more solid and a little help from the acquisition and the interest earnings from those balances.","Chris Harris","Very good, thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.","James Mitchell","Good morning guys. Maybe just quickly on -- Jeff, on your commentary on rate sensitivity; I think if you think about 25 basis points, you said about $4 million per basis point, I know you're not assuming -- you recapture 25 but that would be about $100 million if you did capture 25. I think you guys have been targeting about $80 million for the next 75. It seems to me you should be able to get 25 out of another 75. So are you taking up the rate sensitivity because of Alex Brown or something else or how should we think about that?","Jeff Julien","That's exactly right, our cash balances the loan at $43 billion now which is -- was $34 billion a year ago. So it's obviously a big delta there and so our sensitivity is much higher. We get the $12 million to $15 million a quarter saying if the rates get up 25, and if we pass 40% through, that's 10 basis points, we keep 15 at $60 million a year; as such $15 million a quarter. If we pass-through 13, the client which roughly have -- we keep 12 which is $48 million, which is the $12 million quarter. So it's kind of how we get that range. I think from the next -- if that's true and a lot of that depends Jim on what the competition is doing. I mean we're trying to be fair to clients and then we have to look at the alternatives the clients have if -- money market funds or competitors etcetera are much more aggressive than that in terms of passing rates through declines and we probably would have to respond accordingly. But so far we've kind of been leading the pack, and my guess is if we pass-through 10 or 15, we still be leading the pack of the next hike. But then the next two rate hikes if and when they happen \u2013 there would be much less for us to retain I believe.","So definitely that total capture from the first 100 basis point increase is very, very front-loaded here.","James Mitchell","Fair enough. And just maybe on your pre-tax and large a target of 16%; I think you guys are sort of indicating the acquisition are net depressing for margins but you still feel comfortable with the 16. Is that relying on an improvement in banking which tends to be higher margin or do you just feel good about the rest of the business that you had with [ph] Alex Brown?","Jeff Julien","I think to realize it's an improvement in all three of the other segments. I mean at the bank we expect to continuing growth in the bank, we do expect I think better results in equity capital markets for the year than we've just saw in the most recent year. We're hopeful fixed income can come close to matching this year but at least within year short and we've already talked about the tailwinds that asset management has with the balance levels at the beginning of the year. So we actually expect some nice improvement in all of those. The acquisitions themselves -- yes, you're right, the Alex Brown acquisition particularly will not be help the PCG margins. It's very difficult to have a good operating margin when virtually a 100% of the advisors are on transition assistance deals which starts hitting. As Paul mentioned, $35 million, next year roughly of amortization of those retention deals, that's hard to overcome, at least have a big party of margin.","James Mitchell","Okay, great, thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Conor Fitzgerald with Goldman Sachs.","Conor Fitzgerald","Good morning. First one just on DOL, I know you mentioned continuing the migration towards the fee-based accounts. One of your competitors when they stopped offering commission-based retirement accounts offered; fee released to customers who might have been a little -- had a little bit of a sticker shock coming from the advice based account pricing. Do you think that's something you would consider cutting fees in advice-based account that hope migrate customers over to that channel?","Paul Reilly","I think our whole philosophy is to offer kind of products -- roughly flexibility with clients and advisors. And I know that others believe they want to put them totally on fee-based platform and they are pushing them that way. And then when you do that you do get some misallocations where you discount. I -- we're not looking to force anyone under any platforms. So with the pick [ph] or maybe some more limitations in that we have to make sure that everything complies but our goal isn't to force someone onto a platform and kind of lower the fees and induce it. And I'm not saying there is anything wrong with that but it's not our strategy; our strategy is to offer the flexibility. So our pricing is not done, when we're through, the DOL is going to impact the client and advisor, and firm; and we're still going through that but right now our plans aren't to push people -- try to push people or heavily influence them under our fee-based platforms.","Conor Fitzgerald","Got it. And then on the 16% pre-tax margin guidance; can you just help us understand what you're assuming for in terms of interest rates? I mean you think about that and if we did get a Fed hike in December, how would that impact that assumption?","Jeff Julien","Well, if we took -- if we did get the benefit of another 25 basis point rate hike based on what we're assuming we would keep and that would probably lead to another -- probably lead to 1% percent increase in the pre-tax margin, and roughly $6 billion type revenue base. So if we make $60 million, that's another one. So we would probably up the target -- internal target by about 100 basis points if we get that.","Conor Fitzgerald","It's very helpful. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. This concludes the Q&A session for today. I would turn the call over to management for closing remarks.","Paul Reilly","First, thank you all. We appreciate your taking the time to follow us. Another -- lots of earnings is coming out last week and this week. So we'll continue to stay hard focused on the long-term and talk to you next quarter. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes the Raymond James Financial fiscal fourth quarter and fiscal year 2016 conference call. You may now disconnect."],"18176":["Raymond James Financial (NYSE:RJF) Q1 2012 Earnings Call January 26, 2012  8:15 AM ET","Executives","Jeffrey Paul Julien - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President of Finance, Treasurer and Chairman of Raymond James Bank","Jennifer C.

Miller - Sidoti & Company, LLC","Daniel F. Harris - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Operator","Good morning. My name is Brooke, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Raymond James Quarterly Analyst Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]","To the extent that Raymond James makes forward-looking statements regarding management expectations, strategic objectives, business prospects, anticipated expense savings, financial results, anticipated results of litigation and regulatory proceedings and other similar matters, a variety of factors, many of which are beyond Raymond James' control, could cause actual results and experiences to differ materially from the expectations and objectives expressed in these statements. These factors are described in Raymond James' 2011 annual report on Form 10-K, which is available on raymondjames.com and sec.gov.","In addition to those factors, in connection with the Morgan Keegan transaction, the following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking or historical performance. The possibility that regulatory and other approvals and conditions to the transaction are not received or satisfied on a timely basis or at all. The possibility that modifications to the terms of the transaction may be required to obtain or satisfy such approvals or conditions; changes in the anticipated timing for closings -- closing the transaction; difficulty integrating Raymond James and Morgan Keegan's businesses or realizing the projected benefits of the transaction; the inability to sustain revenue in earnings growth; the changes in capital markets; and diversion of management time on transaction related issues.","Thank you. Mr. Reilly, you may begin.","Paul C. Reilly","Great. Well, good morning, and thank you. And now that Brooke has explained that we can't forecast the future, we'd like to talk about really the first quarter of this year and what I would call kind of a difficult quarter for the capital markets overall in our industry. But I think solid results given where we are.","As we said, we reported net income of $67,325,000 or $0.53 per diluted share. Again, as compared to a record quarter a year ago, obviously down but fairly flattish with the last quarter, as we put in our release. ","We go through the business, different business units, I think you could see where kind of the headwinds were. Starting with the Private Client Group, our wrap fee assets were down 6% coming into the quarter. And as you know, we bill in advance on our retail accounts and those fees, and that gave us a headwind. In the PCG group, we just weren't able to make that up on the commission volume. But if you look at this quarter, with the S&P up 11%, we'd estimate we'll reverse that and be up 6% or 7% this quarter as a starting point. So although we had a -- not over robust because of our beginnings, we could make it up in the commissions area. ","In the Private Client Group, we should be up, reversed to a better start this quarter. As you can see, our Financial Advisor account was up slightly in all of our segments, as we continue to recruit. So I think going into the quarter, we'll get a better start there.","Probably really the story of the quarter was the Equity Capital Markets business. As you know, the industry didn't have the best quarter in the world, and we weren't any different. We kind of had a lot of pieces going against us. This isn't really reflective of backlog, but just, I think, of a more uncertain market last quarter. Underwriting fees in the U.S. were down slightly but down more significantly in Canada. We had -- last year, our commission volumes were down, and ECM is a -- were overall in the market. ","And M&A was down. It was down, really, because it's just a lumpier business for us. I don't think, again, in backlog, anything really stands out. But the quarter -- they were down for the quarter.","And our Tax Credit Funds last quarter had a very big quarter, and not as good of a quarter this month -- this quarter. So if you add that all together, we had a lot of headwinds into the Equity Capital Markets segment. But again, not backlog related, but I do think market related.","Fixed income kind of started to recover from a poor quarter, the previous quarter, as it was in the industry. And especially, December was pretty strong, and January was off to a good start also. So -- but -- so most of that Capital Markets numbers you see are really focused on the Equity Capital Markets segment. ","On the Asset Management business, again we had a slight down-draft because of our billings. But you can see that the assets under management are up 9%. So a reasonable quarter given the start, we do, as you can see from the earnings from the segment, do have leverage in that segment. So as the revenue's up, we get a leverage up or down on the pretax profits from there. So I think, again, we should bode well a good start on the Asset Management business.","Also, if you start to move to the bank, very, very good quarter, probably our second best quarter of earnings. And everything was kind of a positive for the bank this quarter. Our assets were up $467 million or 7%, both from loan origination and kind of secondary loan purchases. You could see that we reported that the net loan loss provision was really related to growth. That doesn't mean we didn't have some ups and downs in the portfolio, but credit was very -- still solid. And really, the net part of that loan loss provision had to do with booking the new loans.","Now that $467 million did not include the Irish -- the Allied Irish Bank loan purchase, which we do expect to happen in this quarter. And the reason we're more comfortable with that approval process is we finally have had our approval to convert to a national bank from the OCC, and that will result to us in becoming a bank holding company and then a financial holding company under the Federal Reserve. And we plan that to happen on February 1.","So all in all, I think given the markets, a decent quarter, we should have some -- where we had headwinds coming into this quarter, we should have some tailwinds in our favor. Coming back to this quarter, Capital Markets are still uncertain, but we feel very good about the -- our position.","Now you can almost say, if there's a seasonal quarter in this business, I'm not sure the last few years have showed any season, it is the fourth quarter of the calendar year, so I think the markets may have taken a little vacation. But the management at Raymond James didn't take any vacation, as we were working on the Morgan Keegan transaction. And I will save the comments talking about that until after Jeff gives us some more color on some of the numbers.","So Jeff, let me turn it back over to you.","Jeffrey Paul Julien","Okay. And looking at the overall financials, margins actually held up pretty well relative to the previous quarter, in fact, even higher. It just was really more a matter of lower revenue generation. When you see the actual reported results next to last year, you need to bear in mind that last year's first quarter was our all-time is, our all-time record quarterly earnings of $81.7 million, so that one's going to be a tough one to compare against.","A couple of other comments. The book value per share ended the quarter at $21.34. Tangible book value ended at $20.76. There wasn't a whole lot of bouncing around in the equity this particular quarter. It was pretty much earnings minus our dividend, which the board elected the whole flat this year, by the way, as you may have seen, versus a $0.02 raise in the prior year, and minus some stock repurchases that we did at the very beginning of the quarter, about 394,000 shares in October, for $10 million. That math works pretty close to where we ended equity.","ROE for the quarter was about 10.3%, trailing last quarter's 10.7% and last fiscal year just by comparison, inclusive of the ARS charges, about 11.25%, 11.3%. And exclusive of the ARS charge on an operating-type basis, it was about 12.25%.","Two things that are going to fluctuate pretty much regularly with our revenue in pretax income generation up and down are the comp ratio. As you can see, comp ratio is measured as a percentage of revenues, while a lot of the variable comp is self-adjusting as the revenue items rise and fall. We do have a fairly good level of embedded compensation expense. So as revenues decline, that ratio's naturally going to creep up, and that's sort of what happened this quarter is it crept up versus last quarter. Again, it was mainly a revenue-driven decline.","The other thing that's going to sort of have the same effect is the tax rate because within our tax calculations, there are a couple of items that are relatively fixed such as ISO expense and nondeductible meals in entertainment and things like that, that don't vary as much as the revenues bounce around. So -- and that's also why the tax rate crept up. So those 2 things. And of course, they would work just the opposite in a robust revenue-type quarter.","I would -- the one other thing I would mention on the  comp ratio is that for comparison to peers, I've mentioned this before, didn't do the exact math this quarter. But just by rule of thumb right now, based on our relative mix, to adjust for peer comparison purposes, you have to adjust it downward by about 6 or 7 percentage points to account for the higher payout that we have to independent contractor financial advisors.","The last thing I would really like to talk about is net interest. It was actually up $7.6 million versus the preceding quarter, back to the mid-80s in terms of millions for the quarter. And this particular quarter was virtually all due to do bank, where we had some higher level of fees recognized once again, but we also were benefiting from some of the corporate loan growth that we have put on really starting the previous quarter, not the December quarter, where we're starting to see some good net loan growth again. ","And just as a final comment, if there are questions, granular questions, on the bank's results, Steve Raney is with us here as well. Paul?","Paul C. Reilly","Yes. I just like to make some quick comments kind of updating you on the Morgan Keegan transaction, although I think this is around the ninth business day since the announcement, which does seem like months ago because of our work. That whole process has gone very well. The top 13 managers have agreed to stay with us through that. ","I know that there was one group that made a comment they wondered if we'd have sufficient management for this and that we take little responsibility that we probably didn't give them enough information pre-transaction. So we have their total management team and our total management team. If you wanted to follow it, say we're kind of overmanaged in this process. But again, as we told you, we were very, very focused on the transitions, getting people on board and moving forward. The integration process is going well. We had 85 of 85 branch managers meeting with us for Morgan Keegan, understanding our platform, going through the fit. And what we find, both in payout structures and cultures are very, very strong fit.","We've had our top 6 [ph] fixed income managers on both groups have met here already and then had a further second meeting going through where the integration challenges may be there. Management teams have gelled very, very well and I think performing well. ECM has made a tour of most of the banking groups already and has met with them one-on-one and then going through the process as well as in Memphis. And we've had our techs and ops group. I think 19 people down going through the various areas of integration from compliance to regulatory to ops to tech. And again, means are going very well in a good cultural fit.","So we're very, very early in the process, and I'm sure there'll be bumps along the road. But so far, very, very good. And all indications are the culture fit that we were anticipating has been spot on, as well as I've been to Memphis addressing 800 of their people on the process.","We're going through our filings from the Hart-Scott -- the DOJ filing, getting ready in the Fed, not really approvals but going through the process of showing them where we are in this in the process and why we think it's a good fit. ","So on that, all on board, early days. And we feel very good about it. And we realized it's a lot of work. And we're making sure that management is focused both on continuing to deliver results as we go through this integration. So we are very, very busy. And we hope to close it at the end of the quarter as our target date because it fits in nicely with the quarter and what we think the various approval, timings and integration processes will be.","So with that in the room, you've heard from Jeff, we have our Chairman, Tom James; Paul Matecki, Legal, returning from the back; and Jennifer Ackart, our Controller, all here. And let's go ahead, Brooke, and open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Joel Jeffrey.","Joel Jeffrey - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Can you just -- I appreciate some of the color you gave on sort of what was going on in the Capital Markets business. Can you give us a breakdown more specifically on the revenues that came out in the fixed income business versus the equities business on the trading side?","Paul C. Reilly","On the trading, almost all of our trading profits more than -- usually, more than 100% of our trading profits are fixed income. We don't take proprietary positions. So we just have facilitation losses in ECM. And so the profits, if you look at trading profit numbers, more than 100% is fixed income. But I can tell you, it was skewed to December, too. The market started picking up and have continued to pick up from a slower start at the beginning of the quarter, and it continued to gain speed. But it's almost all fixed income.","Joel Jeffrey - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I'm sorry, I probably should have said brokerage, not itself as trading.","Jennifer C. Ackart","Joel, you're referring to commissions or...","Joel Jeffrey - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Yes, the institutional commissions for fixed income versus equity.","Paul C. Reilly","Equity Capital Markets was relatively flat with last quarter, so is fixed income. But not really a big variation versus the preceding quarter.","Jennifer C. Ackart","Commissions in capital markets were generally flat overall.","Paul C. Reilly","So it was really more on the shortfall from the previous quarters on the banking side, not on the brokerage side.","Joel Jeffrey - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just thinking about the...","Paul C. Reilly","And I'm sorry, one more point. There's another operation within capital markets called Tax Credit Funds, which you've heard us talk about in the past, which had a very, very big quarter in September. It was pretty normal as they build throughout the year in a much -- the clients' probably $10 million swing in revenues between the last quarter and this one, and that's just that operation. But that exacerbates it to some extent.","Joel Jeffrey - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just thinking about the growth you guys have had at the bank in the loan portfolio, like can you talk -- are you doing anything differently in terms of the strategy on how you're growing the loan portfolio? Is it still more acquired loans? Or is there a push to do some fort of a organic origination?","Paul C. Reilly","The strategy hasn't changed. And we've been an organic originator, but when we find times, we go into the secondary markets and get good loans. And usually to add on the positions, we continue to be opportunistic in that. So...","Jeffrey Paul Julien","The only change I would mention is, as you've heard us say, is we're trying to get ourselves more into a lead position in some of these, particularly with our own Equity Capital Markets clients to get into more of a fee-generating type of role with respect to some of these facilities instead of being just a participant.","Paul C. Reilly","And Joel, we are doing more mortgage loan originations, residential mortgage originations on our own platform now, too. We had our biggest quarter ever in December in that business. And that led to us a residential loan thing roughly flat quarter-over-quarter. So that new production replaced the runoff in the quarter.","Joel Jeffrey - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","And then just staying with the bank, I apologize if I missed it earlier, but what was the reason again for the pickup in net interest spread quarter-over-quarter?","Jeffrey Paul Julien","Average loan balances were higher quarter-over-quarter. We used more of the -- of our cash that was sitting there, earning a very, very low spread. And then there was incrementally some additional corporate loan fees that were taken into income as a result of paydowns and payoff of loans. So those 2 factors contributed to the higher net interest margin.","Joel Jeffrey - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","And is this sort of a sustainable level? Or do you think the fees were sort of onetime? Does it come back down a little bit?","Jeffrey Paul Julien","Yes. There's been a little volatility in that, Joel, quarter-over-quarter. The December quarter was higher than September, but it was actually about equal to the prior December 2010 quarter. Loan balances for this quarter, for the March quarter, actually, is going to be higher than the prior quarter. So we've been intentionally putting some of our liquidity to work. I would mention that I would not expect our corporate loan growth absent the closing of the Allied Irish purchase that Paul referenced that we're anticipating closing later on this month. Absent that, excluding that, we would anticipate loan balances to grow at a lower rate this year -- this quarter.","Joel Jeffrey - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","And then just, I guess, lastly on the Allied Irish. Are you guys still expecting to take an upfront provision, I think it was $7 million, you talked about?","Jeffrey Paul Julien","Yes. That will be impacted by the final loan balance that we're going to be closing on. I think that the loan balance may be a little bit lower now as it's taken more time to get this close. It could be below -- it could be between $6 million and $7 million at this point, Joel.","Operator","Your next question comes from Daniel Harris.","Daniel F. Harris - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So as the transition happens to the Fed versus your prior regulator, I was wondering if you see any changes in how you guys evaluate your loan portfolio, your capital -- or your ability to upstream capital in any way? I mean one of the things we saw last night in a bank that moved from the OTC -- OTS to the OCC was a pretty big qualitative adjustment. I was wondering if you can comment on anything like that.","Paul C. Reilly","Yes. First, we are -- -- we have -- we're already under Fed jurisdiction as a holding company, so that's not really the change. It's just the form of going from a thrift holding company to a bank and financial holding company. As far as the OCC, you have to remember that most of our loans are shared national credits and have been reviewed by the OCC always. And the OCS has taken kind of those ratings because that's the Fed's most secured national credits of the originator. So the Fed's been in here in a pre-exam. They're back in. I'm sure there'll be slight differences. But I think philosophically, we don't anticipate really any changes of significance.","Daniel F. Harris - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's good. Switching gears here to the recent transaction, how does that deal do 2 things: first of all, impact your aggressiveness in pursuing new advisors this year and what could be a decent environment given retention bonus roll-offs; and then two, thoughts about the -- any potential acquisition in the Asset Management which you guys have been focused on for the last few years?","Paul C. Reilly","I think we looked at both of those as independent. I mean, I'm not going to say there's going to be a 0 management distraction through the integration, but our goal has always been organic growth. We have our home offices that are up. And we continue to bring people through. We're very focused on recruiting. And through this -- after -- through this transaction and after, we're going to focus on organic growth, as we always have. So this was just an unusual opportunity to bring it in. So we're going to continue to recruit on both sides, both the employee side, which is what Morgan Keegan really is, and the independent side, where management is not really involved as much on the integration. They're continuing to recruit. So our focus on recruiting really hasn't changed.","Daniel F. Harris - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Is it right to think that this year should be, on a relative basis, better versus last year as the maturation of those retention bonuses sort of hits 3-plus years that were really granted in 2009, and if anything, we should see an acceleration off of what seem like a little bit of a decline in this current quarter in headcount?","Paul C. Reilly","Yes. We -- this current quarter, we're actually up in headcount. But the home offices, its numbers are up. So we would anticipate that's usually a leading indicator of recruiting. The people sign on, and so we would anticipate it being improving this quarter over last quarter -- I mean, this year over last year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Hugh Miller.","Hugh M. Miller - Sidoti & Company, LLC","I had a couple of questions on the bank. I guess, first, Steve, you sort of talked a little bit about the sustainability of the NIM given the loan portfolio expansion, maybe some nonrecurring benefits from the paydowns in the quarter but also just an improvement in the level of nonperforming assets. I was wondering though, can you -- I don't think you really mentioned about what your view is about the sustainability of the adjusted NIM from the current quarter.","Steven M. Raney","I think that it's -- there's some pressure on it that we've talked about. I think that it's within 10 or 15 basis points of that over the next 12 months is...","Paul C. Reilly","Which is higher than we did before, and the Canadian acquisition will only help that.","Steven M. Raney","Yes, that's correct. That will help our yield.","Paul C. Reilly","We, again, had to try to be conservative in our modeling, but it's held up higher than we would have forecast.","Hugh M. Miller - Sidoti & Company, LLC","Okay. I appreciate that. And I guess as we think about the dynamics of your operations working at a single office, your ability to kind of purchase loans and participate in some of the shared national credits, we're obviously seeing some improvements in the operating margin, both from the leverage and also the improved asset quality. But how should we be thinking about the incremental operating margin as a bank and kind of takeout margins as you look at that business?","Jeffrey Paul Julien","I don't see a material change from this point forward. We are going to close on the Allied Irish purchase. We had a pretty dramatic growth in the December quarter. I think that we're going to intentionally -- I think the growth pattern's going to be slower going forward over the next few quarter. We're going to obviously be integrating this Canadian acquisition. We've already, as I've mentioned in prior quarters here, we've started doing some business in Canada. We have a handful of loans to Canadian-based companies that we have an institutional relationship with. We are growing our mortgage business. But I think that it's going to be relatively nominal growth from this point forward over the next year or so. And I think that our operating margin should be relatively consistent. And we've been able to leverage a very unique business model. We have a very low FTE, and therefore, our operating efficiencies are pretty high at this point. But I don't anticipate dramatic improvement in that going forward.","Paul C. Reilly","We are kind of targeting a net growth of $1 billion in loans for the year. And we -- you've seen for $450 million of it in the first quarter, and Canada's going to be another $400 million. So it won't take much in addition to that to get to our budgeted levels.","Hugh M. Miller - Sidoti & Company, LLC","Okay. I appreciate the insight there. I guess moving to some questions in the retail segment, I know last year in December, you kind of had a substantial lift in retail commissions from the rollout of your annual best ideas product. I was wondering, how much of a fact did that kind of played for this December, whether or not it was a strong benefit?","Paul C. Reilly","That was actually down slightly. So it's not a huge impact. But it's about half of what it was last year.","Hugh M. Miller - Sidoti & Company, LLC","Okay. And then I realized that there's typically kind of a lag, and we see a reduction in market volatility and when you might see clients start to kind of improve their interest in kind of taking on some risks and possibly getting a little bit more positive about equity investing. I was just wondering whether or not in January, if your hearing anything from your advisers, if they kind of sense that this may be on the cusp of starting to happen, or if that's not really much of a factor.","Paul C. Reilly","I think that's really the call. The investors are conservative and have been investing not to lose money. And certainly, up markets help and you see an increase. But I don't think you're going to take 20 days and change the attitude after people have been through last year, certainly. I think the election's adding a lot of uncertainty, and people are waiting. So we're just anticipating kind of this zone of range of market. And so I think things get sorted out.","Hugh M. Miller - Sidoti & Company, LLC","Okay. And last question I have is on the Capital Markets business. I mean obviously, you talked about the backlog. You talked about the climate having to kind of improve in order to see some improvement in that business. I was wondering, I guess, what areas within the Equity Capital Markets do you really see poised for a rebound ahead of the others? What are you more excited about? And what do you think has to happen at this point now in order to kind of get the ball rolling?","Paul C. Reilly","We've got -- obviously, our energy and our REIT markets have performed relatively well. And the better the markets, even the better the activity in there because we're very well positioned. We certainly made a bet on tech. And those markets aren't robust to the extent tech rebounds will do better there. I think it's just really across the board, in the M&A business we're pretty broad. And that backlog looks good. And obviously, the better the market, generally, the better activity there right now. So we -- and the course, with the Howe Barnes, we've made a bet in the big space. And this is in the price range. What happened in the last quarter, if you look at banking pricing, a lot of banks didn't want to sell at that price. And a lot of banks didn't want to raise equity with that pricing. So the extent that market, which has picked up since then, continues to be solid, I think we'll get better performance there, too. So...","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Devin Ryan.","Devin Ryan - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Almost all my questions have been asked here, but just maybe a couple of follow-ups to some prior questions. So the Allied Irish portfolio acquisition, I think the yield that you guys had been given before was a little bit over 7% on an unhedged basis. Is that still the case given a little bit of shrinkage there? And how much hedging do you guys can speak to in there?","Paul C. Reilly","Yes. Devin, I would still say that's approximately the yield that we're anticipating in the portfolio on an unhedged basis. We're going through, as we're now getting a lot closer to closing on this, finalizing all of our hedging strategies. We've been talking to some hedging consulting firms, relying on some expertise that we have because we do provide some hedging for our borrowing clients with our Capital Markets professionals. So we're working through that right now. So I don't really have an answer in terms of -- the execution of that hedging has not been finalized yet. But the yield is still approximately in that 7-plus percent range.","Jeffrey Paul Julien","I think it's fair statement to say we would hedge -- hedge is pretty substantially because we're not anxious to have FX gains and losses in the $5 million to $10 plus million range bouncing around every quarter in the banks or loans.","Paul C. Reilly","Yes. We're having to go through and forecast what we anticipate paydowns and new advances to be in new business. And so there's the...","Jeffrey Paul Julien","Part art, part science.","Paul C. Reilly","Yes.","Devin Ryan - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","And then just in terms of moving from the OTS to the OCC, is there any added or onetime expenses as a result of that? And then will that also free up any capital, just given how some loans will be classified?","Paul C. Reilly","I think it will, first, run on really onetime expenses outside of what seem like a perpetual filing cost -- professional expenses. So there are no real changes in levels of expenses from there. And in terms of capital, it's actually because we really have been operating more like a commercial bank that does free up capital, because we got into some thrift real estate test that actually added to capital. But that frees up.","Jeffrey Paul Julien","We're actually in the middle of our safety and soundness exam right now, Devin. And as you know, we went through a pre-conversion exam in the fall. And we went through one a few years ago. So we've had a lot of prior dealings with the OCC. And now it's a merged agency, and we actually have some of our former examination team on the OTS that are still involved with us. So not a terrible amount of change, and we're certainly prepared for any of -- we're well aware now of what to expect and how we'll be working with them.","Devin Ryan - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Got it. And so I'm assuming that, that amount of capital that's freed up was already contemplated prior to the Morgan Keegan deal and the capital raise plans for that.","Paul C. Reilly","Yes, yes.","Devin Ryan - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Got it. Okay. Great. And then just within other expenses. I know that item can bounce around quite a bit from quarter to quarter. But it looked quite a bit lower than it has in recent quarters. So I don't know if there's any color you can give there, whether or not that's sustainable or that should kind of pick back up in maybe the upper 20s or $30 million a quarter where it has been.","Jeffrey Paul Julien","You got us scrambling.","Jennifer C. Ackart","Devin, I would tell you, it's running a little bit lower than the first.","Devin Ryan - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. That's fine. And then just lastly, another cleanup item here, just within the minority interest. I know that there's a number of items that can impact that. But just wanted to see if there's anything given that, that number was fairly high again this quarter. I want to see maybe what's in there.","Jeffrey Paul Julien","We're looking again here, Devin.","Jennifer C. Ackart","Yes. That wasn't coming because, Devin, that was particularly out of line.","Paul C. Reilly","That's the same as the last -- as the preceding quarter. But that's the minority holder share losses in Latin America and the U.K., some of the consolidated Tax Credit Funds, those 3 businesses. Last year, we had some big banking fees and things in Latin America that caused us to actually go the other way, more than we have in recent history. But these are all add-backs to earnings, as you can see.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Steven M. Raney","Let me make a clarification while we can. There seems to be some confusion in the room when Joel Jeffrey was on the line and asked about capital markets commission volumes. We had said they're pretty flat. We actually were comparing it to the immediately preceding quarter, not to the last year's first quarter, which was a much more active equity underwriting environment, et cetera. They're down over 20% from last year's first quarter, but they're about flat with the immediately preceding quarter. I can't remember which one he was asking about, but we answered it relative to the preceding quarter.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions.","Paul C. Reilly","Well, great. We thank you for joining us this morning. I think that we have some tailwinds starting this quarter, but the market is certainly uncertain. Our businesses, I do think, are operating in good shape. We're focused both still on delivering the numbers this quarter in Morgan Keegan. So we're busy over here, but we're optimistic, really, about both. So thank you for joining us this morning, and we'll talk to you again soon.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes the conference.

To the extent that Raymond James makes forward-looking statements regarding management expectations, strategic objectives, business prospects, anticipated expense savings, financial results, anticipated results of litigation and regulatory proceedings and other similar matters, a variety of factors, many of which are beyond Raymond James' control, could cause actual results and experiences to differ majorly from the expectations and objectives expressed in these statements. These factors are described in Raymond James' 2012 annual report on Form 10-K, which is available on sec.gov.","In addition to those factors, in connection with Morgan Keegan transaction, the following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking or historical performance: difficulty integrating Raymond James and Morgan Keegan's businesses or realizing the projected benefits of the transactions; the inability to sustain revenue and earnings growth; changes in the capital markets; and diversion of management time on integration-related issues.","To the extent Raymond James discusses non-GAAP results, the reconciliation to GAAP is available on raymondjames.com and the earnings release issued yesterday.","Thank you. I will now turn the call over to your speaker for this morning, Mr. Paul Reilly, Chief Executive Officer of Raymond James.","Paul Christopher Reilly","Good morning. I have in the room, Steve Raney from the bank; Jeff Julien, our CFO; Jennifer Ackart, our Controller; and Ken from Legal. So we've got a good group here for your questions.","First, obviously, a good quarter for us. I caution you against multiplying it x4 as a run rate, as you know, we have a number of unusual items. We recorded a net revenue of $4.5 billion for the year, up 18% year-over-year and recorded net income of $367 million, up 24% year-over-year, with our diluted GAAP EPS of $2.58, up 17% year-over-year and our diluted non-GAAP of $2.95, up 18% year-over-year. And I start with the year because, we noticed it's been a big year for us, with the Morgan Keegan combination. And I'm really proud of our group, having come through the combination. You can see the synergy results showing up in the numbers this quarter as we talked about a year ago. And all 4 of our operating segments really had record years. So given the market, the uncertainty and the combination, which the integration is essentially over, it was quite a year for us.","On the quarter, our revenue is $1.15 billion, or up 1% sequentially. Net income was $117.5 million, up 40% sequentially. And there -- this is a very good operating quarter, but there are a number of kind of unusual items in that. And I'll roughly break it down, these are rough numbers. So the income of $117.5 million, it's roughly $30 million to -- $35 million to $40 million over estimates, GAAP or non-GAAP. $15 million of that number was really tax driven. And I'll let Jeff get into that as he -- I'll go through the segments and he'll into some of the details. Almost up to $10 million was kind of bank driven. And then $10 million to $15 million were really operating results, which we on the back of record investment banking revenue, driven by great M&A activity, trading profit recovery and fixed income, not only a recovery, but a very solid quarter. And operating costs and synergies that you can see flowing through the P&L now.","For the Private Client Group, the year-over-year revenue was up 18%, but the pretax is only 7%. And that really had to do with the IT spend and integration cost that were flowing through. You can see now that, that's reversing as we were through the integration. The quarter revenue was flat, but the pretax was up 7%, as you can see the IT cost coming down and the integration cost really getting through. We're in solid shape. Our Private Client Group assets under administration of $402.6 billion or a total for the firm of $425.4 billion, and this is a record. And I'll talk about that a little more when we get into outlook.","Capital markets drove much of the beat this quarter, and our stronger equity underwritings and fixed income investment banking revenues were both up. The real driver was M&A, up 65% sequentially. In fact, if you take the December month, or December quarter as we report, and September month but September quarter, this quarter as we report, much of that activity was very concentrated in those 2 periods.","Trading profits and fixed income went from a negative -- trading profits went from negative $1.5 million last quarter to $18 million plus this. And that was a positive surprise, given this environment and lower inventory levels than we've historically operated. So a very good performance from both capital markets divisions. The capital markets revenue was up 15% year-over-year and 35% up on pretax. And the revenue, up 7% for the quarter and 152% sequentially. So a very strong capital markets quarter. But we know that business tends to be lumpy, and I'll talk about the outlook a little later on. In our asset management division, revenues, up 23% year-over-year and pretax, up 43% year-over-year, driven by market and appreciation inflows and MK assets, such as migrated on to our platform. Our revenue was up 5% sequentially and our pretax, up 28%. But that pretax number and margins were aided by a $1 million comp adjustment as we look to outlook, and some of the comp going forward. So a little higher margin and profit, when you look at a normalized rate. We did have record assets under administration of $56 billion.","RJ Bank revenue, up 3% year-on-year and pretax, up 11%. Revenues, up 10% sequentially and pretax, up 15%. The bank was aided by a negative credit provision of $2 million. The good news is that criticized loans, when they pay off, you release the provision. The bad news is you can't run on a negative provision forever. Because we are in the business of making loans, and the only way to have a consistent negative provision is to run off your good loans. So that certainly has an impact on some other items that Jeff will get into. Loans continue to grow and have done a great job, but spreads continue to stay under pressure. And Jeff and\/or Steve will get into that as we go.","You can see that the synergies, as promised in this quarter, are coming through the P&L. And in fact, one of the good things as CEO, I get to declare arbitrary things, and one of those is that the MK integration is really over. And that we're now going to focus on just moving forward with our business. And you're going to see that line item kind of disappear as we move forward. So even with the adjustments, a good quarter, some of that driven by -- a lot of that driven by capital markets, and I'll talk about the outlook for our business segments after Jeff goes into a little more detail. So Jeff?","Jeffrey Paul Julien","Thanks, Paul. Just to add some color to some of the figures. This quarter was record earnings for the firm and -- but it was not our -- interestingly, our best-ever net revenue quarter. We trailed the quarter in March this year, which had the large private equity transaction that -- you'll remember, a large part of which the profits came out through noncontrolling interest. But still a record on the earnings side. Pretax margin, a number of you have already written reports and have noticed that on the face of it appears that we've kind of reached our margin target already, that we cited at the Analyst Day. And I would say, it's somewhat driven by some of these factors that Paul has talked about, and I'll talk about in the future. So again, I don't necessarily think we would conclude that we've reached our targets on a sustainable basis yet.","The comp ratio dropped to about 67.3% and 68% for the year. We have seen improvement, no question about it, in the comp ratio. But at the end of the day, we think there's still a little bit more to come between now and, say, the end of fiscal '14. And that's -- some of that is going to come through what we project as revenue growth with some scale built into it. But this does -- this is largely reflective of most of the synergies that we expected to get out of the integration of Morgan Keegan, which -- a large part of the headcount reduction happening in the June and September quarters. The tax rate, obviously, very little explanation.","We have a -- had a very low rate for the quarter, 27.5%, really driven by 2 major factors. One is that we have been providing taxes for future dividends from our Canadian subsidiary. But we've now altered our strategy on that and no longer have to provide those taxes. So even though that reversal, which, in fairness, to quantify, it was $10.7 million, occurred in this quarter. Obviously, it relates to a cumulative provision we've made over time for the earnings in Canada. So really, you can really say it's not really this period, but keep the current entry relay to the cumulative effect of that.","And then the other piece in this quarter, about $4 million related to the gains in our corporate-owned life insurance. I'm not sure would call that a nonrecurring or one-time event. Obviously, we have COLI fluctuations every quarter, and generally, they've been more positive than negative to our provision for the year, for every year. But there are about $4 million tax benefit for this quarter and about $8.7 million for the year, and just because of the appreciation and the corporate-owned life insurance investments.","GAAP ROE was 13. Non-GAAP ROE was 14.7. I will -- I think, I agree with one of the comments that we got that said, arguably, we could have put this nonrecurring tax benefit into the calculation of our non-GAAP earnings because we certainly view that as a nonrecurring type item. But we -- at some point, we don't know where you stop. So there's a lot of little things that are nonrecurring every quarter. So we chose not to do that. But the math was easy, and all of you have done it in your reports that I've seen so far.","Book value closed at $26.40; tangible, $23.86; and shareholders' equity, $3.663 billion, of course, all records. And Paul has talked about assets under administration and assets under management, both hitting records as well. For the year, we obviously had record revenues and earnings for the year. Again, 12 months of Morgan Keegan this year, 6 months last year. Pretax margin for the year on a GAAP basis was about 12.6% and non-GAAP 14.4%. So again, just because we achieved this quarter -- Paul will talk a little bit about the outlook and why maybe that's not the right thing to do, but I'll make a couple of comments myself on that before I turn it back to him.","Comp ratio for the year, I mentioned 68.1 and tax rate, 35%, again aided by both COLI and the one-time tax benefit. ROE, about 10.6%; non-GAAP, 12% for the year. My comment would be with -- my comment, before I give it back to Paul, for next year -- I'm sorry, I need to talk about that bank just for a second also. A number of you commented, yes, net interest was relatively flat, but they showed pretty dramatic improvement in results, sequentially. In the other revenue line at the bank are a number of items which were negative last quarter and flipped to positive this quarter. The 2 biggest ones were, we do have some ForEx gain and loss at the bank. We have about $35 million or $40 million of loans at RJ Bank, U.S., that are not hedged. And the ForEx was a negative $2 million in the June quarter, and it was a positive $1 million in this quarter, so a $3 million swing in that item. And then there is the SBA loans that we house on the bank's books, and then later, package and sell. We had a negative mark because of the state of the fixed income market in the June quarter. So we had a negative $2.5 million mark on those loans at the end of June. And when those loans were subsequently sold in the current quarter, that mark substantially went away. So we ended up with a $2 million, writing it back up by over $2 million, so a $4.5 million swing on that. So sequentially, it looked like a big jump in those items. But the fact is, last quarter was abnormally penalized by a few million dollars and this quarter just reversed it.","In terms of my take on the outlook is -- well, I have a little page here, I call it \"adjustments to reality.\" If you look at our year and try to forecast next year, in my opinion, the things that I would certainly take into consideration are the low tax rate for the year. COLI is not necessarily nonrecurring, so it depends on what your outlook for the market is. But if you have a flat market outlook, it really won't have much impact. But we certainly won't have that credit again. So certainly, if you adjust the tax rate for the year to a more normalized rate, adjust the bank's loan loss provision -- $2.5 million loan loss provision for the year, given the loan growth and the amount of turnover we had, and the portfolio and all is really abnormally low. We're happy to have experienced it, but I'm not sure we would forecast that to continue.","And then the third thing for the year. If you remember, 2 quarters ago, we had a very significant private equity transaction, which -- again, a large part went out to noncontrolling interest, but a large part -- a reasonably sized piece was our profits. We had about $30 million of profits from that over the course of the year, pretax profits, hitting our books. I would -- and there wasn't much activity and private equity in the fourth quarter, which now is consolidated into the other segment. So I would say, if I were to try to normalize it again, I'd probably look at the June proprietary capital segment and discount that to some extent. So when you do all that, and then you put some kind of reasonable growth rate on it, in my opinion, it doesn't make next year's current consensus look all that out of line with what might be reality. But Paul has got some thoughts on that, that he'd like to share as well.","Paul Christopher Reilly","Well, thank you, Jeff. Let me give you a little color by segment. And like Jeff, I'd caution anyone using this quarter for a base. Any quarter that's capital markets-driven is -- always has some risks.","In the Private Client Group, we've had -- the numbers and commissions with the MK integration and some of the changes, and people leaving and through all that have been a little less steady. But I think, if you look forward now, that we are steady. Billable assets were up 6%, going into this coming quarter, which should bode well for that part of the business, and the course of the commission part is yet to come. Recruiting has picked up substantially in both businesses over this last quarter. I think we're going to start seeing better results, both by, I think, some market movement. As the market gets choppy, we see more recruiting activity. The up market we had in the beginning year, I think put a downward impact on that. And secondly, we're a lot more focused now. We're focused outside versus inside. And so recruiting is up substantially and retention is holding very, very well.","And the capital markets, as you all know, is volatile. EC and ECM, the underwriting window is still open. But that's always a hard one to tell when it does close. M&A had a very big year and a very good record, but that's a lumpy business. And again, just December and September made up most of that activity. Backlog looks good, but it's lumpy. So it's hard to predict.","Fixed income, commissions are very challenged still. Again, another sequential drop in institutional commissions in this interest rate environment. And as we said, we didn't see that picking up until there is a change in the rate structure, which has seemed to settle back down after the government reopened. And the trading profits for the quarter were very good on half of the inventories that we used to carry. And we don't take that because we're really -- we size our inventory for our business and they just had exceptional results, especially given our competitors. So in this environment, I'm not sure that this quarter run rate is what we should expect every quarter. I think, it was a very, very excellent performance for the quarter.","Our asset management is in good shape. This margin -- our margin this year was inflated. I mean, based on -- if you looked at -- on a normal run rate, the comp reversal, we still expect good performance, and the target of 30% margin, we think, is, they are not the margin that appeared in the quarter. But 30% is a very solid margin. I wish all of our businesses had that. And the bank is going to stay under pressure. Loan growth is very competitive. The bank has done good job of growing in a very competitive market. And the loans and the credit range that we want to take, and we're sticking to our credit discipline. But there is still spreads and interest compression. And I think until interest rates really move, and loans stay competitive, we're going to stay under that compression threat.","And the loan provision of $2 million negative isn't normal. Last year, we had a mid $25 million provision, and you look for growth and underwriting, certainly somewhere closer to that range versus where we are if you have any kind of negative credit at all, and your portfolio is more normalized. Although the credit right now seems very, very good still, and the trends are good, I think, that's not a normalized environment.","We still expect -- we're still trying to hit our 15% target by the end of the fourth quarter of 2014 this fiscal year. So this quarter was aided by a bunch of other factors. We don't view ourselves as there, that we want our businesses to increase their margins to hit our target. Then if you take out the exceptional items, we are not there yet. But we're still focused, like we've told you, to attain that margin by the -- that run rate by the fourth quarter of 2014.","Our integration is complete, only because I guess I declared it. The cost synergies are showing up, so you can see them. Now we're focused, really, on organic growth, niche acquisitions in running our business and any cost adjustments we'll do going forward will be based on our business and our strategy. So given the uncertain environment, I'm kind of with Jeff, that the kind of the consensus earning outlook is probably in a ballpark that's reasonable, given where the markets are today. And we just can't predict the capital markets.","Jeffrey Paul Julien","And if I can just make one more comment. The integration expense line was a lot higher this quarter than we had anticipated, and I think probably The Street as well. I would tell you that we basically underestimated some of the costs related to some of the real estate consolidation that we -- either in the process of or have planned to do in the near future, in several of the big cities, mainly institutional offices.","And secondly, we had some lingering IT expenses that we had not recognized, that hit this quarter. So overall, from start to finish, where we had predicted at the beginning of this exercise, $110 million over the 2-year period or 18-month period of integration expenses, we actually ended up with just a little over $130 million. So we actually did misestimate that particular figure. But on other side, we probably underestimated the synergies as well. So -- and some of those are starting to come home to roost. And there'll be some others drifting in over the year as some deals burn off and things like that. But the material portion is out at this point in time.","Paul Christopher Reilly","So I think good operating results. We've got a lot of work ahead of us this quarter, driven largely by capital markets. If that environment continues, it'd be nice, but that's -- it was an awfully good quarter. So I would take a x4 if someone will give it to me instantly, but I don't think it's that easy, and it tends to be lumpy on a very strong quarter. And great performance by our equity capital and fixed income colleagues, given the market.","So with that, Brook, let's open up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Joel Jeffrey with KBW.","Joel Jeffrey - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Just a follow up, Paul, on your comments about the integration and the comments that it's relatively -- I guess it's fully complete, actually. In the past, you guys have talked about carrying higher support levels for an extended period of time. Is that part of your integration costs, or are those still in place? And if they are, how quickly do you think you can run those down?","Paul Christopher Reilly","I think a lot of those have run through. You're not going to see a big drop in integration. We think, over time, we can, but some of that is going to have to be systems driven, too, so it's going to take some time. So we think we can get more synergy in the operating. We did do a number of -- in our 2 risks, plus a restructuring, we had kind of a management risk and operations last quarter. So we think, you're going to -- you've seen of that in this quarter. We don't see a lot of change in there going forward. We do think, as we get in some of these technology enhancements we're putting in, that we can hold the operation cost study as we grow. But IT, as you know, we've brought the cost down, and it may come down a little bit more. So you'll see it probably a little bit in the IT lines and -- but in our overall ops line, I don't think the dollar amount is going to change much. And part of that isn't synergy in the operating part. I'll tell you, the biggest increase in our operation support has all been around regulation. It's been around cost basis. So we went from 2 to 75 people in order to support it. And so until we get all that automated, that's not going to go down, and we don't see it going down because we keep having to add more items. So a lot of this regulatory driven changes have added to support levels. And as we automate that, we think we can get some synergies. But I wouldn't look for them in this year. I think we're pretty well, with the small decrease in IT coming, that we're pretty well where we're going to be at an operating for the near term.","Joel Jeffrey - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then in terms of just the M&A markets of late, I mean, if you look at sort of the industry-wide data, and they indicate that this -- the markets have been pretty weak. But looking at some of the results of -- from yourself and some of your competitors, a lot have posted pretty strong quarters. I mean, are we at a point in time where it's really just a market that's very driven by sort of specific transactions that people are involved in? It's just -- it's not as important to take look at sort of the broader picture in terms of what's going on the market?","Paul Christopher Reilly","That's been a weird segment because backlog has stayed good even through these cycles. And what we've had is a backlog, and then a rush to close everything in December. So then you have the first quarter, maybe into the second quarter, that was down. And now we're seeing deals close again, and still a good backlog. And the feeling is that M&A activity should be good. Now they're driven by specific transactions, and I think the small to mid -- middle market business has probably been more active. And if you look at the indicators of the big deals, it looks weakening. The middle market has tended to follow the big deal trend, but we don't see that right now. So we had an exceptional quarter, and they were deal-specific and good-sized deals for us. I think we'll continue to do okay in that. I read the commentary like you that it's going down, but it seems like the people in middle market business had a pretty good quarter and they're experiencing what we're experiencing, which is good backlog and good activity for those companies.","Jeffrey Paul Julien","And it seems like the overall environment is still good. There is -- people still have a lot of cash and if they don\u2019t, financing is still available at a very reasonable cost. And the targets are still reasonably priced in the marketplace in several sectors. The pieces are in place, I think, and what's holding it down, if anything, are these people's outlook for the near term in terms of the economic environment, et cetera.","Paul Christopher Reilly","On Sunday, someone will write a Harvard Business School case on what happens in M&A in this environment, with cash, debt cost, and what drives it because it's -- I think everyone expected more activity that we've got this year. And it seems to have been picking back up in our -- and at least in the area that we compete in.","Joel Jeffrey - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then just lastly for me. I apologize if I missed this earlier. But in terms of the sort of quarter-on-quarter decline in comp ratio, I mean, is that primarily attributed to better revenues coming out of the lower comp capital markets business? Or was there something else all factoring into that?","Paul Christopher Reilly","Yes, you've had revenue both from the bank and their adjustments and capital markets. And a lot of that is M&A, which is less costly than banking overall, usually, and commissions were are even cheaper, but they weren't up, so. I think it's just volume over the fixed cost in that business, and our capital markets -- in our Equity Capital Markets business, we have research as a big fixed cost, in that we're a research-based firm. So revenue certainly expands the margins, so you had a big improvement there. And in fixed income, trading profits, again, we make more money off of trading profits then commissions. And we lose more money, and we don't get the benefit [indiscernible] last quarter. So I think it is the capital markets' activity in volume that really drove the drop in comp ratio.","Operator","Your next question comes from Hugh Miller with Sidoti.","Hugh M. Miller - Sidoti & Company, LLC","So I guess -- following on the capital markets theme, I was wondering, obviously, you guys have talked about doing some cost rationalization within the Equity Capital Markets space, given that we are starting to see some signs and glimmers of a better environment there. Is there more to go, from your perspective from, that cost?","Paul Christopher Reilly","Yes, there's -- there may be some. But I -- we took at a lot of those actions, but certainly at the Morgan Keegan integration. And we've been, quarterly, looking at the rationalization of bankers. And we've also made some investments last year on our technology practice, which have done very well from a standing start. So you got a lot of factors that I think will help the comp ratio, the -- so you may see some more, but a lot of that's through, unless revenues start trailing back down. But right now, if we can keep this kind of market revenue -- this kind of market, I think, our cost seems pretty good. If the trends back down, then we'll have to adjust it.","Hugh M. Miller - Sidoti & Company, LLC","Sure, okay. And I guess, looking at that, too, it seems like, obviously, you guys are cautious about potential for these levels to continue for the ECM business. But then -- I think you also mentioned that the backlog still seems like it's strong, and that you're not really drawing down on it, is kind of the way I took it. But can you just -- is that a good way of looking at it, though? It's not as though you're seeing that pull-forward and drawdown on the backlog in this particular quarter ?","Paul Christopher Reilly","So I would say that, M&A, yes, but it's lumpy, right? So I mean, if you look at just -- we publish by quarter. But if you look the actual monthly activity in September and December, it's in awful lot of the business. And so, I think that just falls when it gets closed. And this doesn't always make sense, but if you look at the underwriting business, it's harder. The window is open. But it seems like the month after every quarter, business is slower. And so we just finished a very strong September, October, traditionally, would be slower. The same in December, it tends to be strong, and January seems to be slower. So it's harder to get insight. But if you look at the market, underwriting window is open, there's activity, but it's awfully hard to project that business just because it's up and down. And for us, too, there is a good flow of deals, but whether we're the lead or a co-manager makes a huge difference on how many deals during the year in terms of income. That spread is a lot bigger than it's ever been, traditionally. So it's just very, very hard to predict. I would say, the markets, if you ask me for a snapshot right now, look good, but they're certainly lumpy, and just any change in the market hits that business pretty hard. So we look at it as a very strong quarter, and then probably look at it as a -- a better-than-average quarter as a base.","Hugh M. Miller - Sidoti & Company, LLC","Okay. And looking at the fixed income commissions for the institutional segment, obviously, we saw the contraction there, relative to last quarter. But can you talk about -- from a month-to-month standpoint, it seems like, obviously, it was a very volatile quarter from yield curve perspective, and that the bond market rallied in September. Did you notice any type of change in commissions from that business as we headed into the latter part of the quarter?","Paul Christopher Reilly","No, not really. I think commissions have been challenged where we really did well is because we're-- we weren't taking bets. So I think other people that were taking bets in the inventory, some dislocations happened. We kind of -- were in the market and profited from that. And so, really, the trading profits really drove the quarter. Commissions still stayed soft. And I think an awful lot of people -- we've benefited in the quarter from repositioning of books. I think if you look at the overall market commissions and what everybody else has reported, everyone is reporting, a lot of softness, and we're still seeing that softness. And again -- without a change in the yield curve or in absolute rates, I think it's going to stay soft. Having said that, they've done a great job of rightsizing the business. Our comp and almost of our fixed income business is very variable. So -- and the guys just actually did a great job, the salespeople on the desk, of not really taking risk in generating good trading profits. So -- but I can't tell you that I -- we see any surge in commissions right now. I wish we did, but I don't see it yet.","Hugh M. Miller - Sidoti & Company, LLC","Okay. And just a question to -- at the bank, for Steve. Can you just provide us a little bit more insight into the dramatic drop that we saw in the criticized loans and kind of, what's fostering that? Should we be expecting to see charge-off reversals in future periods, or the trends there from an asset quality standpoint?","Steven M. Raney","Yes. We did have some pretty dramatic improvement in asset quality during the quarter, that was really related to about 9 or 10 loans that were sold, paid off or there are few upgrades as well. But most of it was just related to payoffs and the loan -- or a loan or 2 being sold. We'll continue to be proactively managing that number. Out of that number that was disclosed to you, out of the $356 million, about $250 million of that are commercial loans, with the balance being residential loans. Those tend to take a lot longer to resolve, that our criticized residential loans peaked at about $125 million. So we whittle that down by about $25 million over the last couple of years. There is still room for improvement, but we had pretty dramatic results in the September quarter. As a reminder, it tends to be lumpy. We could have a large loan that are criticized, or a couple of loans that are criticized in the quarter. They can influence that number upward also by $40 million or $50 million. But we have -- we've been on a nice trend for the last 2.5 to 3 years of improved credit metrics and enjoying that environment.","Hugh M. Miller - Sidoti & Company, LLC","Okay. And then the last question would be just, if we take a look at some of the growth we saw, targeted in the CRE and securities-based lending portfolios, if you could just talk about what you're seeing there. And is that dispersed, at all, between strength in Canada versus the U.S., one or the other or both?","Steven M. Raney","Yes. A couple of comments. Yes, that was a little bit unique, in that we have lot of activity in the C&I, in our Commercial and Industrial loan portfolio, but it wound up remaining relatively flat. We continue to be predominantly focused on commercial lending versus commercial real estate on the corporate lending side of the business. We're going to continue to focus on that arena. There's a lot of activity in backlog, particularly in Canada. Right now, we've got quite a bit of new loans that we're working on in Canada, that will materialize over the next 90 days or so, and continued growth in our securities-based lending business. Each month, we've been adding the loan balances as that product has now been in place for about 18 months. So -- and our residential loan business continues to grow. We grew that business in the -- quarter-over-quarter as well. So activities, the levels are good. You did see some of the margin compressions that materialized, that resulted from loans going on in the prior few quarters. We do expect, as Paul alluded to, continued pressure on margins, although we have seen, the pace by which rates have been coming down has slowed somewhat. So...","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Allen with Evercore.","Christopher J. Allen - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Paul, before you alluded to recruitment trends picking up, I was wondering if you could provide more color on that, maybe where -- whether you're seeing in legacy Morgan Keegan regions' opportunities or by the different FA buckets? If you could give us some more color, that would be great.","Paul Christopher Reilly","I think, first, the recruiting from both sides tends to be Weyerhaeuser brokers, specially set by a couple of them. As retention deal comes off and a lot of them are legacy acquisition firm people that are still seeking what they have before, and I think we are kind of the -- one of the last -- one of those Private Client Group firms that grew up with that regional feel, that have full service that are really around, so that's been the attraction. If you look at the independent channel, it wasn't as slow. They had in a better year, but it has picked up. We are seeing real increases in RJA activity, and that's both Morgan -- some at the Morgan Keegan branches and some are just other branches, we don't -- we kind of designate less. What I think you're seeing is a focus on re-recruiting people, when you go to the integration like that now to looking outside those people on platform, they're on the systems. They are productive again. They know how to use the systems. It's one thing to put them on, and we have almost a flawless conversion, but everything they did is new, and that takes a while than it used to. And I think, now they're focused more outside of growing the business and recruiting. So we've seen the significant pick-up on RJA side, the employee side, and I think a lot of that is both market improvement, in terms of people are looking again to come outside in, and our focus, being much more outside than it was before.","Christopher J. Allen - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then, just kind of following up on that a little bit. On the productivity side, you talked about the legacy Morgan Keegan advisers kind of closing the gap, and they utilize Raymond James' product. Any idea what inning you're in from that perspective?","Paul Christopher Reilly","We're a few innings in. And I think you're seeing good asset management flows as they get more in managed product to certainly help our Asset Management Group. The reason I think it's early -- so we're seeing good moves on that and the recurring revenue has been in good shape for the firm. But you're also getting that period where people are getting used to the system. And we do have summer seasonality in the business. If you look at the number, that shows an awful lot of our Chairman's Counsel, President Counsel, Leader Counsel trips, meetings. So we're getting through all that in season. I think we're back down the business. And so as I've said before, the productivity thing I thought was kind of 2-year project and we're -- they joined us in February, so we've made a lot of ground. We still have a lot more we can accomplish. And I think we will.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo Securities.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So a few questions around the margins and kind of the sustainability we may expect here. What's really interesting, when I look at the performance this quarter, is that capital market's revenues were actually down from last year, but you had 85% plus growth in pretax income. And I just want to make sure I'm catching all the variables here. But I mean, is that big drop in expenses primarily driven by comp and sales commissions? Or was there something else in the expenses in Cap Markets that kind of contributed to that phenomenon?","Jeffrey Paul Julien","There are 2 things. The biggest piece is the business mix. This quarter -- you're talking about this quarter versus last year's quarter?","Daniel F. Harris - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Right. Yes, exactly.","Jeffrey Paul Julien","Last year's -- this year's quarter, obviously, was heavily M&A-driven and trading profit-driven. And as Paul mentioned earlier, those are generally higher-margin segments of the business for us, the way it's structured. Then the commission revenues and fixed income, which were very large, are in almost $100 million in last year's September quarter and the investment banking revenues. So it has partly to do with business mix. And the second piece is, fixed income, as we've talked about has been on a -- an endeavor to rightsize their business. And then they were just one of the areas we got some additional synergies from the integration. And actually, beyond synergies, because of the business environment, actually, this year, as we've talked about in the last quarter, has been taking some steps to whittle down costs and support cost in that operation.","Paul Christopher Reilly","And they've done a good job. And I'd say it was through the Morgan Keegan integration. We're really through kind of rifts and changes. Anything we're doing are tweaks that we've made up. And we'll continue to tweak and try to become more efficient.","Jeffrey Paul Julien","We had not really even begun that process in the fixed income side a year ago. And I think the early integration of those businesses really started on October 1, last -- of this past fiscal year, October 1 of 2012.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, good. So it sounds like a couple of good things happening there. In PCG then, I'm just wondering if -- maybe -- follow my logic here, and see if this kind of makes sense. But -- so it seems like you guys are going to get some revenue uplift heading into Q4, assuming markets continue to stay robust as billings kind of catch up with asset growth. And if we're assuming like kind of a steady-state on noninterest expense, it just seems to me that you guys have so much momentum happening there that you're going to get well above your 9% margin hurdle in that segment, kind of next year, if those assumptions are correct. Is that kind of a good way to look at it? Or am I missing something there? Should we expect some cost inflation on the noninterest expense line -- or excuse me, non-comp expense line?","Jeffrey Paul Julien","It can be, particularly if recruiting's active. That engenders a lot of costs -- not just the cost of the hiring transition assistance to the hired financial advisers, but there's a lot of recruiting costs involved in that. I don't think there'll be a big jump in non-comp expenses. If anything, we think IT maybe has leveled off, or could even decline a little bit from here, which is part of that segment, the way we categorize, it's IT and ops. Other than the part that serves Capital Markets, IT and ops is included in the Private Client Group segment. So they should continuously lift. And again, I think we're optimistic that we'd get to the margin, certainly, by the end of the year, if not for the whole year.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Yes, okay. And yes, it definitely seems like you guys can get there. All right, then, in asset management -- and you guys have called this out, and sorry if I didn't quite understand it fully. But the Comp catch-up you had -- or comp adjustment, excuse me, is that just kind of a one-time item that affected this quarter? Or should we expect kind of a higher level of margin at the segment going forward?","Paul Christopher Reilly","I think the 30% target is still a good target for that business. This quarter was aided by an unusual adjustment.","Jeffrey Paul Julien","It wasn't even that big a number. It just it as a big impact on the margin and that $1 million","-- so it drives -- $1 million drive the margin a lot for a quarter. So I would call that a nonrecurring, And even in the annual comp adjustment, it was just -- it was an unusual item based on a number of things. So I would shoot toward the 30%. But I think we'll continue that good growth. We've had a good growth there. So, again, I wish all of our businesses were at 30% margins, my job would be a lot easier.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Yes. It looks to us that the organic growth looks really, really strong in that segment. All right, last question, then, for me. Just specifically on the bank, any update on what you guys think NIM might shake out for fiscal '14?","Steven M. Raney","Chris, once again, continued pressure and there's a lot of variability, a lot of market factors that will contribute to that. Once again, I think that the rate by which we've seen the decline in net interest margins is slowing somewhat. But I would say that 20 to 25 basis point compression for fiscal '14 over fiscal '13 is kind of a good number to be using at this point.","Operator","That was our final question. I will now turn it back to the presenters for closing remarks.","Jeffrey Paul Julien","Well, great guys. I appreciate you being on the call, and you adjusted the numbers,we were trying to communicate as clearly we can. The book is bigger, but it seems like you picked up most of it on your own. But I'm hopefully applied -- supplied more clarity on the call. So we're back to work, and we'll talk to you soon."],"18307":["Raymond James Financial Inc.

Paul?","Paul Reilly","Thanks Paul, and good morning everyone. Paul told me this morning that we are going to have huge \u2013 there is really huge crowds on this call. So I don't know if that is based on real facts or alternative facts, but as I read some of the analysis of our release, I want to make sure that we get as clear as we can [Indiscernible] the real facts there.","First, I am very proud of the quarter and the accomplishments. I think the underlying businesses maybe safe. Capital markets in a tough quarter have done very, very well. We had record quarterly net revenue of 1.49 billion, up 17% over year ago quarter and 2% sequentially. We had second best quarterly net income of 146.6 million, up 38% over last year\u2019s quarter and down 15% sequentially due primarily to a lot of adjustments that our legal reserve will talk about a little bit, and that results in a dollar per fully diluted share.","During the quarter, we had the Alex Brown and 3Macs acquisitions close and integrate. At Alex Brown we are still over 90% of the advisors and 3Macs 100%. That is an easy one to calculate \u2013 had come over and are with us. If you take out those integration expenses our adjusted net income was 155.6 million, up 45% from last year\u2019s quarter down 16% sequentially, or $1.07 per fully diluted share.","So we had a lot of positives going on. We had a record quarter of net revenue in the private client group, asset management and RJ Bank, and we had record quarterly pretax in both asset management and RJ Bank. Maybe more importantly as our key future revenue drivers ended up with new record client assets under administration of $116.9 billion, financial assets \u2013 $616.9 billion, I guess I mispronounced it. Thanks Jeff. Financial assets under management of $79.7 billion, and net loans of $15.8 billion and we have a Fed interest rate hike that really came in December that hasn\u2019t really come through the quarter, which should impact us positively next quarter.","I think it is just showing a solid execution of our business strategy and our long-term focus. Two items that hit really the quarter before I get into the segments that Jeff will cover first is the [effective tax rate] of 29% that was really due to stock comp accounting, which he will go into, and a legal reserve, which could have been a more explicit increase, which is over $30 million that impacted the quarter kind of the other way.","With that let me get into kind of the segments. The private client group had a record quarter of net revenue of 104 billion, up 19% over year ago and 8% sequentially, really driven by organic growth. Recruiting remained very strong and retention as well as the 3Macs and Alex Brown acquisitions.","We had quarterly pre-tax of $74.3 million, up 6%, but down 31% sequentially, again legal reserves and some overhead during the Alex Brown and 3Macs acquisitions. We had a footnote, but probably it could have been clearer. We ended advisor count at 7128 advisors, up 441, and it could have appeared without reading the footnote that we are down 18, but as the footnote referred to we actually refined how we counted advisors, and more of a focus on branch managers when they were producing versus non-producing branch managers. And if you really look at an apples to apples we were up 80 in the quarter versus the adjustment we did in the account. So again, we had a good increase of advisors of 80 for the quarter.","Client assets under administration $585.6 billion, up 24% over last year's quarter and 2% sequentially. Prior to that client group assets and fee based accounts actually rose quicker at 240.2 billion, up 26% over last year\u2019s quarter and 4% sequentially. So a tailwind both in assets and again the Fed interest rate rise in December not really fully impacting that number yet.","It was a disappointing area with certain capital markets. Our net revenues of $233 million were up 3% over a year ago\u2019s quarter, but down 18% sequentially. Interesting in the number, institutional commissions and trading profits were solid. The institutional commissions got a positive impact over the changes after the Trump election, but investment banking revenues were hit hard down 42%, primarily part of it structural, part of it cyclical with the IPO market certainly off last year. We had some bumps in tax credit, which we will talk a little bit with great business and a great backlog, but we also had proposed tax changes after the Trump election where it took some time to kind of sort out and get through that system. With that impact really as a result of that down revenue the pretax income was 21.4 million, down 15% over a year ago and down 60% from a record quarter in the previous quarter.","Asset management, record net revenues of $114.1 million, up 14% from a year ago\u2019s quarter, 7% sequentially. Record pretax income of 41.9 million, up 26% over year ago\u2019s quarter and 19% sequentially, and with record assets under management, as I said previously of 79.7 billion. This was driven by the growth of the advisors, certainly equity market appreciations and even some net positive \u2013 small net positive flows for [Indiscernible] Eagle. Under the bank, record net revenues of $138 million, up 27% over last year's quarter and 3% sequentially, record pretax income of $104.1 million, up 58% over last year\u2019s quarter and 7% sequentially really driven by across the board balanced loan growth and consistent net income margins.","We had record net loans of $15.8 billion, up 15% over last year\u2019s quarter and 4% sequentially, and credit quality really improved between pay-offs and even selling some criticized loans, where criticized loans were down 18% from a year ago\u2019s quarter and 26% sequentially. So overall we are very pleased with the bank results and really very pleased with the first fiscal quarter.","So with that I will turn it over to Jeff to have him get into some details.","Jeff Julien","Thanks, Paul. Let me talk about some of the line items and the variances from what we will call a consensus model that you all have provided to us. Actually our biggest revenue line item, the commissions and fees, were pretty close. We did a little better as we had a little better quarter in terms of commissionable product sales than were anticipated, but all in all we were very close. I would say you all did a very good job of anticipating the impact of a full quarter of Alex Brown and 3Macs on that line item.","Investment banking was the biggest miss in terms of percentage for the quarter. there is detail in the press release that shows the weakness in underwriting, M&A and the tax credit funds business compared to the preceding quarter, particularly those businesses all are a little bit lumpy as you all know, and as Paul mentioned, we think that the businesses have a lot of upside from this current quarter, but December is kind of a seasonally weak quarter anyway, but this was a little bit weaker than we had expected as well.","Account and service fees, we were a little higher than the model and what that really reflects is the immediate impact of the interest rate hike on the bank deposit program and the fees we received from the banks participating in that program was a little over $3 million impact for the quarter.","Trading profits, I know we steered you downward in our operating statistics releases during the quarter and fixed income trading profits, and indeed in November, post-election when we had athen the hand rate spike, trading days were very difficult there and we \u2013 but they had a very, very good December, which pulled them out and for the quarter $20 million that we showed was a fair amount above the consensus that you all ended up with and that we sort of steered you towards.","Other revenues, again as detailed in the press release, showing a private equity valuation gain for the quarter of about $10.6 million, which was also lumpy and we don't know when to expect it, but some of the private equity funds and things that we are still owners of had valuation gains along with the rise in the stock market during the quarter.","On the expense side, comp was reasonably close. I would point out that our comp ratio for the quarter was 67.4%. So comfortably under our 68% target that we are still operating under. Communication information processing was a little lower than we had been guiding you towards. I think we are giving guidance in the $75 million to $80 million a quarter, and I think we will reiterate that guidance for the balance of the year.","This quarter was unusually light. It had a lot to do with the timing of when projects come on-stream and begin amortizing and how much of the project work is being capitalized versus expense and things like that. It is a little hard for us to predict with great accuracy, but I think the 75 to 80 is probably still a pretty good number. And if we don't spend the IT resources on regulatory, we will find other things to use them for. We have a long list of items that are requesting attention. So I don't think it will go down even if regulatory demands abate somewhat.","Investment sub-advisory fees interestingly were higher than you had projected and the real reason for that is the fee-based assets that were brought it from Alex Brown, particularly they already had relationships with outside managers, and a lot of them were already on our platform and some we added.","So they came over \u2013 [mapped over] just sort of directly and stayed with those outside managers. So, a lot of those fee-based assets that came over continue to use outside managers as opposed to our proprietary managers. That is what gives rise to the outside managers sub-advisory expense.","The bank loan loss provision, a credit for the quarter in the face of $618 million of net loan growth in the quarter does look unusual. Paul pointed out the declining criticized loans. We had payoffs, paydowns in some sales. Actually some of our criticized loans during the quarter as well as one nice recovery that we had previously charged off \u2013 again like I said that is us getting ahead of the game somewhat but a lot of those things came home to roost in the December quarter, and so all of those things were enough to overcome the provision that would have been associated with the $618 million of net loan growth in the quarter to give rise to a small credit.","The other expense we have talked about that Paul mentioned is some significant legal reserves in there this quarter. We hope that is a non-recurring thing, but we always have legal reserves of some magnitude, but this was a particularly large quarter for that. Paul mentioned the tax rate of 29%. I assume that the analyst community at least is aware of the change in equity accounting for the \u2013 I would call it the windfall that you get when equity awards are deductible when they invest as opposed to when they start amortizing in their books from grant date forward, but then they are deductible when they invest and typically that is five years later typically for us.","The stock is higher than it was at grant price, so you have a bigger tax deduction than you have run through your book, expense over that time and that gives rise to this tax windfall in the past that amount was simply a credit to book value, a credit to equity, but now the guidance that that will run through the tax provision but there truly is less taxes that you will pay in the quarter the divesting occurs. So most of our awards are made at the end of the fiscal year in the November timeframe and typically like I mentioned have a five-year vests associated with them. So the amount that \u2013 it will typically be a December quarter phenomenon for us to see this tax benefit as long as the stock price is higher than it was five years earlier.","This year it was a particularly big number because of the stock price versus where it was five years ago. If the stock price were not to move from where it is today for the next couple of years that number would be about a $10 million type tax benefit in the next two years in the December quarter. But a lot of it depends both on the stock price, and it also depends on how many units are outstanding based on who is still with us at that time, but the turnover has not been a big factor here.","So those are the line items. Some other points I would like to mention. From a big picture standpoint and I have read the comments that have come out starting last night and I would say that generally they are pretty on point. I would say if you try to strip out all the noise that we had in the quarter with the tax benefit, with the unusually high legal provision, with the bank loan-loss provision being a credit, of the PE gain and all those types of things.","I think your comments are sort of right. We are not too far off from where the consensus was on what you would call an operating run rate basis. But as I will talk about in a minute, we still have a lot of tailwinds going into the next quarter. Other ratios I will mention that are in the press release, the pre-tax margin non-GAAP was 14.7. Well below our target, but obviously that relates to the legal provisions taken during the quarter.","Otherwise we might have been closer above our target there. The non-GAAP ROE was 12.4% for the quarter, which we think is acceptable given the climate, but again that included the offset of all of these factors I mentioned before. Shareholders equity, by the way, crossed $5 billion for the first time. So a little bit of a milestone there for us, and I will point out that our capital ratios all improved slightly during the quarter as we had earnings and equity credits that from other stock compensation expense, another thing that affects equity, that grew faster than our total assets.","So going forward a couple of comments. The impact of the rate hike, as I mentioned, it was a little over $3 million in the December quarter. That is a little bit of guesswork still in terms of going forward, but at this point in time based on what we are seeing in the competitors and the rates on money market funds et cetera, I am anticipating above and beyond the December quarter an additional $15 million to $18 million to pre-tax earnings split between interest earnings and the account and service fees.","We have raised rates to clients. So since that rate hike and I am guessing we will probably do so again during the quarter sometime, but how far and how fast is the unknown. Going into the March quarter, we do have some headwinds. We mentioned this last year, we do have a [FICO] reset that has typically cost us somewhere between $8 million and $10 million versus December [Indiscernible] March quarter to December quarter and then that number drifts down lower throughout the year as people get over the [FICO] limit.","So we are guessing that that will have a negative impact on comp expense in March. We also have a lot of our year-end mailings of 10-99s, our annual reports, et cetera, et cetera and that number was somewhere between all the printing and mailing cost for that was somewhere around $2 million and that will hit in the communication info processing line.","We do anticipate about another $5 million to $10 million of integration cost from the acquisitions we've done and then we are hopeful that the numbers going forward will be so immaterial that we will stop using that line item after the March quarter. But that should be about the number to wrap up Alex Brown and 3Macs.","And lastly, we mention the tail winds on the fee-based assets and those are disclosed as well. That the billings and the again in the March quarter going to January, we're somewhere around 4% higher than they were in October. So, that certainly a good starting point for the commissions and fees going forward into the March quarter.","Those are my comments I want to point out. So, with that I'll turn it back to Paul.","Paul Reilly","Great, thanks Jeff. I'll make a just a little bit of kind of outlook on where we see the businesses for the quarter. First the private client group. We're continually driven by strong recruiting and a strong retention. We always focused on retention first, the fact that we're not selling coals to people like the firm and stay here as the most important fill in and that helps us recruiting or recruiting pipeline and results are continuing to be very strong as we've been kind of a destination for the people of this last couple of years.","So, that combined with the record client assets starting the quarter that you have talked about and the rising short-term interest rates last quarter should be very positive. Jeff talked about our communication and technology lines will be there. We continue to invest in seaborne technologies and some things we don\u2019t spend a lot of time talking about is our capabilities or advisors can do most of the things on their iPhones, through industry leading apps today.","We'll announce early what we're doing on the client side. We had a plan three years ago, but everyone seems to be going robo, but we believe in electronic delivery to clients always been in our plans and we'll talk about how we're addressing that in this week. And I believe we have a very good solid technology platform going forward. And we continue to add solutions for on loans and other products and high network solution. So, we continue to invest in our private client group business and the outlook looks very strong.","Capital markets are headwinds and tailwinds. Fixed income and public finance have done very well, well positioned. Preliminary look at public finance shows that certainly in the top, then maybe number eight for credit delay and underwritings last year. Doing very well. The problem and the challenge in that business is that is a business with inventory and rising interest rates, there is a buy up that inventory virtue. So, we can hedge part of it from the look we can.","The quick turn and the credit quality and the movement of that inventory remains very important. It's easier and downward markets for trading profit than it is in upward markets but I believe they continue to do a good job. Equity underwriting came off of very slow quarter. So, it should be up this quarter. But there are some challenges both structurally in that market, is more competition and more book runners and syndicate members in terms of share of fees for that type of business.","M&A backlog looks good but it's a lumpy business, so we can't tell you which quarter that will fall in. Tax credit business, we believe we're the largest underwriter of tax credit deals now. Our backlogs very good but certainly proposed tax law changes, certainly have an impact on the business that sells both really based on CRA credits to banks and effective after-tax shield after-tax credit. So, that is created from re-pricing and I think this flows since last quarter.","We feel very good about that business but there is going to be, there might be a little bit of a interim challenge here as like the three price, but it looks good. Asset management are very strong. Recruiting and retention continue to give a strong asset flows and the market certainly has been in our favor. They're trying to then to move to more to fee-based accounts which has also has helped that business. So, the record assets under management is a big positive going into the quarter and I think our net recruiting should continue to help drive that business.","RJ bank continues to do well, solid discipline loan growth. We had growth over seen in mortgage and or tax exempt lending. Certainly we're always cautious such a credit environment, it's been very constructive lately. But we've seen good in credit, good and bad credit cycles. We've been through it, so we stay very diligent on what we're adding to the portfolio and the management of the loan portfolio and again our focus is when we like the credits we will continue to grow and then the market moves away from us, we will slow it down.","So, net I think our forward drivers, all up here positive with record AUA. Asset under administration record, assets under management record, net loans and the fed interest rate changes should all have positive momentum for the quarters. Certainly, despite statement mailings and 99's and all those first quarter expenses will come though which will be a drag. Although we weren\u2019t planning on doing any walls, we were looking at building a building for expansion and we end up buying three buildings on our campus to expand our growing needs, which have a little bit of an impact but not huge.","Last thing, I know people are going to ask about the Department of Labor. All indications are that the administration is moving to certainly suspend the role, delay it and maybe rewrite it. So, we have moved and continue to move to be in compliance should we have to be. I would say the indications today is that we will be delayed and if you ask me to guess more likely change, I do believe even though well intended that there are some issues that really impact clients and the building for clients to get advice.","And we certainly welcome at least an improvement to the role and maybe a different approach to it. But we'll find out more as the administration continues to sign many orders of [AML] in the last week. So, with that I'll appreciate you joining the call and I'm going to turn it over to Kaela for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities.","Devin Ryan","Hi guys, good morning everyone.","Paul Reilly","Hi, Devin.","Jeff Julien","Hi, Devin.","Devin Ryan","So, you increased the securities portfolio in the bank, which was discussed last quarter but capital just continue to build throughout the quarter. How should we think about the trajectory of maybe continuing to do that in the bank and any other kind of thoughts around capital utilization and that would be helpful. Thanks.","Jeff Julien","Those are multiple fronts. We're continuing the overtime build the securities portfolio and that plan hasn\u2019t changed. We continue to buy more securities. Again, more conservatives and kept the duration very short. So, we do go have a board offsite and in a month and in February and we will discuss capital deployment at that meeting whether it to be the bank and some of the opportunities and not so. We continue to look at potential acquisitions, I think we're very disciplined.","We focused really in M&A space, so we did an acquisition in Europe for merger for an M&A business and have looked at other opportunities. And we've looked in asset management even though we know the markets challenged, we believe there are certain segments of the business that active management still valued and we continue to analyze those. So, we keep looking at capital deployments that offer the right opportunities.","Paul Reilly","Just to be clear, Devin, and growing the securities portfolio in the bank is not particularly capital intensive. The kind of securities we're buying are governments and agencies typically that are 20% risk where it didn\u2019t rather acquire a whole lot of capital growing the loan portfolio more quickly, other things would be more capital intensive.","Devin Ryan","Yes, understood. Thanks, very much. And then within accountant service fees, you had some upside that you kind of spoke through. But when we look at Alex Brown and the 3Macs deal, are those being optimized yet in terms of how they run into account service fees, meaning al the customer cash balances that were brought on from those deals, are they already deployed in the kind of third party bank sweeps or is there any upside from third party mutual funds or manufactures just around, the on the bus fees or things like that.","I was just trying to think about if there is a tailwind, maybe still account from those acquisitions in that line.","Jeff Julien","And the balances. The balances we deployed pretty quickly into the suite programs and other vehicles. So, that there -- so the assets are pretty much, that part of it's optimized at this point in time. So, I don\u2019t think there's a lot to begin there, like the game going forward is going to be from rate changes and shreds, not from further deployment of the assets.","Paul Reilly","Look at those businesses to remind you because the amount of retention were all the advisors really coming over have retention on both of those deals that it's really not going to help TPG margins, it's going to challenge them in a short term. But from a firm standpoint, certainly the cash and very active lending business and very high network plans is going to have a positive impact on that side.","So, Alex Brown is really settled in now and starting they're recruiting to fill up their offices. So, it's going to take some time as we set during the acquisitions that really make it accretive.","Jeff Julien","Yes. This type of conversion we did here when we mapped all the Wrap fee accounts mapped over to our asset management platform and the cash mapped over to suite progress. There wasn\u2019t as all we're bringing in on advisor by advisor and they had a mega bunch of elections and then things moved after the fact. And this was all done pretty much on conversion day September.","Devin Ryan","Got it. Okay, that's helpful. And then just a last quick one here. So, I appreciate the color on the legal reserved. I know that came kind of about for quarter-to-quarter, but there's always use your some levels you mentioned to me. How should we think about, I mean, how much it was incremental would you say relative to then what's normal to kind of think about from ROA perspective, given that there's always something in there?","Jeff Julien","Yes, that's we had -- a lot of it is driven by a particular issue. But that rise we said three main list, what we call above normal, that it doesn't mean there can't be other charges or other cases or issues that come from time-to-time. But that certainly, most of that incremental rise which itself what I call historical what we expect run rates. But there are challenges and that can bounce up and down.","Devin Ryan","Got it, okay. I'll hop back in the queue. Thanks a lot, guys.","Jeff Julien","Okay.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura.","Steven Chubak","Hi, good morning. So, Jeff, I -- on the last call you had spoken of 17% margin benchmark or expectation with a benefit of the December rate hike. And clearly this quarter you fell a bit short in part because of the timing and the hike and also the elevated legal charge. I was wondering giving some of the tailwinds that you highlighted in your prepared remarks, where there 17% was still the appropriate jumping off point or benchmark we should be contemplating for the remainder of this year?","Jeff Julien","I don\u2019t remember that say. I remember that we were at 16, I remember at the last half of last year was our -- or again.","Steven Chubak","Is it?","Jeff Julien","You're saying with this rate hike, we would be at 17?","Steven Chubak","Yes, that's exactly right. So, the guidance for '16 was out the rate hike. And then about a 100 basis point benefit when you saw the benefit of the rate hike in December which ultimately materialized.","Jeff Julien","Yes. But the rate hike at December barely hit the numbers in the quarter.","Steven Chubak","I'm thinking about the remainder of the year.","Jeff Julien","Yes. I mean, I don\u2019t think that's an unreasonable goal. There are a lot of factors at play obviously and the market being the biggest one. But based on where everything is right now, again this quarter would have been significantly different without the elevated legal charges which is a pre-tax item. But we had some other things going in the other way as well with the bank loan loss provision and private equity gain.","So, but it wouldn\u2019t have been way off, so with this additional rate hike, it really adds $15 million to $20 million per quarter going forward. And if we get equity capital markets and that's quite a fund and others back to what we call more normalized margins and levels. Do I think that's attainable this year? Absolutely. Do I think I would take it to the bank? There are too many things that can happen to be that certain about it.","But based on the dynamics of what we got in place, absolutely, that's a reasonable target.","Steven Chubak","All right. And maybe just focusing on the NII contribution again, Jeff you mentioned on the last call in terms of the all strong guidance, $30 million benefit for the full-year on a core rise basis, this should have added about a $7.5 million. On top of the significant sequential uptake that we saw in loans and securities. Now tell me if you could speak to some of the factor that may have dampened the pace of NII growth, since it only increased about $7 million this quarter.","And maybe how we should be thinking about the jumping off point as some of those benefits show through in the March quarter.","Paul Reilly","Sorry, what increase we're having?","Jeff Julien","I think Steven, when you talk about the guidance for the Alex Brown contribution, you have to look at both the NII and the account service fees for the cash that left off the balance sheet to third party banks that going impact accountant service fees not interest income.","Steven Chubak","Okay so it is $30 million rate benefit which shows up in both, got it. Okay. Understood and just last one from me and might be a better question too for Steve but just given the duration profile and the securities look can you remind us what's the net yield take up that you are getting on the securities today given the steepening of the curve versus the what you are running on the cash rates?","Steve Raney","Yes it's Steven. It's about 100 basis points. It's obviously security specific some of that lower, some of that bit more but right now it's been 100 basis points. So that negatively impacts our imported net interest margin percentage but obviously increases our interest earnings.","Steven Chubak","Okay and how much excess capacity do you have at the bank in terms of the internal binding constraint that you think about whether it be liquidity or some of the capital ratio, it's actually support continue bankrupt. I know you Jeff actually mentioned it wasn't capital intensive but cheer want to leverage is also another constraint you have to manage to and I was hoping you could maybe quantify that access that\u2019s available to support future growth plans?","Jeff Julien","$5 billion to $6 billion.","Steve Raney","Yes, it's a big number because of the risk ratings of those assets, we have higher capacity, but as of then we\u2019ve agreed deal on, we are going to review at the board meeting but we are well short of $2 billion I think in our poll, but the capacity is probably $5 billion to $6 billion.","Steven Chubak","Got it. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse.","Christian Bolu","Good morning Paul, good morning Jeff. So I guess firstly Paul congrats on the announcement that you will be taking as Chairman, as you think about taking over this role I am curious what it means for kind of how the firm is managed?","Paul Reilly","Well, I don't think there is a lot of difference. Tom sitting next to me and he is, can\u2019t say we really thank. He is hard bound client focused and what we are doing is, founding board so I would actually think it's the genius move by Tom to give me more work but he still get around too what he did before. So it's been a team effort and I don't think that will change though Tom is spending little more time as we see him in staff but he is in the office every day. So the dynamics this has been a shift 09 from the day Tom has asked me to come in to slowly moving stuff over and I think we will see still it\u2019s slow move and hopefully by five years from now you will be asking me the same question and it's just a more natural transition so it's all hands on deck and it's been a transition has been happening over a seven years and I think textbook one, so far this is what I think the succession planning does and I will have to go through at some point too and hopefully I can do it half as well as Steve has. So I don't see any dramatic change and certainly not strategy or anything else.","Christian Bolu","Okay. Got it. And then just on Alex Brown maybe progress update on how the integration is going and then more specifically how far long just getting to what that 10% margin target?","Paul Reilly","Yes, so Alex Brown we are not really projecting 10% margin target for a while and it's really due to a number of factors first and it's something we have talked about whether we should publish acquisition retention and give you guys more insight. We have every one of those advisers on the retention package so without that good margins, with that you really stop the margin. So it's going to be a long process over a number of years for that part of the business to hit those targets. Certainly there are some bigger swings and parts of that business on when transactional volumes come out because of the semi-institutional ultra-high network the family office type of business that has impact when that type of business is up and we got to recruit, sell the branches we had to move out of every location or slip locations and we added room for recruiting and we are just recruiting takes a while we are going to get people through the pipeline.","So you shouldn't look at the business in the short term having the margins, we looked at the long term strategic investment and we want to be profitable we don't want to do things, we don't think we are going to make money on though, we have got a lot of work to do still to get it there.","Jeff Julien","We have talked before that it's not going to be accretive to the PCG segment but you got to understand that they brought significant assets into the asset management segment. They have also introduced loans of all types through our bank so they are radiating throughout the rest of the organization even if those results aren't measured specifically in the private client group. The only thing that's really left of magnitude is one or more two real estate moves that they have to accomplish that they\u2019re going to have in a period of time post close to vacate certain premises currently under Deutsche Bank under leased. So net-net, I think we are little better certainly retention where we thought we would be. Revenue would nay be little more challenge given last year just because of the markets and syndicates and everything else. But I think we are probably ahead on the people side and everything combing along. It's just these integration take a few years to really get out and running and Morgan Keegan was no difference and it's been accreted and we have got work to do on Alex Brown, great group of people. I think they are settling in well and we just need to keep working at it.","Christian Bolu","Great. Thanks for the color. And then just a follow-up from question that has been asked a number of times on the potential for you to grow the AFS book of the bank. I just can you just help us with how to think about how much excess capital you have? I guess that the total firm level should we think about tier one leverage or risk based capital constraint and then maybe any sort of numbers in terms of the minimum ratios you would want to run the format?","Jeff Julien","This is the debate that I think a lot of people our view of excess capital is different in most. This is broker dealer space versus financial. There is a lot more of liquidity, risk and demands and so we tend to keep extra liquidity and it's looks dump until you hit 09 or period then you look smarter than you are which is just conservative base. The banks certainly has leverage in the securities portfolio of the leverage capital just because the capital charge is low, both regulator like the liquidity and the security portfolio because they believe it's a secured type of environment because the agencies government oriented short term are less concerned about that investment than we would be if they were longer term or more risky securities. So yet, we have room yes in our capital base but it's not as extreme as I think other people think.","Paul Reilly","I think from a regulatory perspective the tier one leverage ratio would be the one that trips first, but we have got internal constrains so we have talked about before that would trip even earlier that percentage from capital that we have want to have allocated to the banking segment as well as the percentage of client cash deposits that we want in our own institution. So those would actually trip even before the regulatory ratios would trip.","Christian Bolu","And maybe just quick can you remind us you said the cash internal target, can you just remind what that is and for the bank and you talked about sort of capital being at the bank but as you move in towards things like securities which have very low risk rating does that is there a potential for that constraint to changing anyway?","Paul Reilly","Yes. I think there is the chance there but we\u2019re discussing with our board meeting about allocations. So, yes.","Jeff Julien","We have got a little over $40 billion in the bank this week program and we don't want more than half of that going through our own bank and our banks currently a little under $15 billion. So we have got $5 billion run way in that constraint.","Christian Bolu","Okay. Perfect. Well it seems like a very important board meeting ahead.","Paul Reilly","Well, they are all good and challenging. I don't see drastic changes but I think the discussions and the challenges are all good and again if you this is the balance certainly lot of things we could do to raise earnings very quickly in the short term I am not sure it's good for shareholders in the long term. So we keep that balance of making sure that now we have looked at acquisitions and other things that would make the number look very good short term but we asked ourselves long term is that a good returns for shareholders and we are reminded all time it's not our money and we are investing other people's money. Some of it is because we are shareholders but we try to keep that balance, the boards challenging us and I mainly look for to our offsite it's a lot of work and a lot of challenging but it's very good discussion.","Christian Bolu","Great. Thank you so much for all the color.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from the line of Conor Fitzgerald with Goldman Sachs.","Conor Fitzgerald","Good morning. Maybe a two part question on corporate tax reform. First just one thing, you said to be little corporate tax rates should we think about that having a one for one flow through onto your tax rate and then two, if we do get corporate tax reform how should we think about that in competition in your industry some management teams have indicated things of vast majority of the benefit would be away but curious for your thoughts on if you think being increased competition in your business and benefit of tax rates could be considered away?","Paul Reilly","I know a lot of people said that they think that the lower tax rate will pass it through the loans spreads, I don't know if that's the case. We are certainly more diversified than that. 10% drop in the tax rates what $90 million somewhere there. And if you did some math somewhere in that range so I don't know we get arbitrated away or not. I certainly, our portfolio is a piece of our business, big numbers but it's certainly diversified across the businesses and a lot of people focus on the rate but how you define that income taxable incomes are important too and what deductions are there or not there so there is a lot first they got to get through Congress, and secondly we don't know what it is but we focus on the headline rate. So\u2026","Jeff Julien","Impact on some of our businesses. Tax credited funds or tax exempt landing at the bank has been municipal bond trading that \u2013 all those businesses will be impacted.","Paul Reilly","Certainly yes. And then, you got the onetime net charge for the deferred tax assets too. So there is pretty complicated topic until it's hard for us overtime. So honestly we look at that but we spend most of our time making sure we are running our core businesses well and the things that we don't have in control we left about although we do look at what the impact would be.","Paul Reilly","As we sit here today and favor to lower rates effective immediately by 10 percentage points from 35 to 25 our deferred tax asset revaluation were offset most of our first year benefit from the lower range than we obviously benefit pretty much on a straight pass through basis going forward depending on the impact on our businesses.","Conor Fitzgerald","That's helpful color. Thank you and then on the 15 to 18 million of growth from the Fed hike are you still assuming the same deposit bid in that 40% to 50% range or have you changed your assumption there?","Jeff Julien","We have changed it to a little low lever declines payout than our ultimate our original target of the 60:40 split and we are basing pretty much what we are seeing in the competition. Our strategy there is to stay at the kind of the top of the group and we are there already. No one else has moved since the Fed rate maybe one other party had moved but the rest have straight ones and twos all the way down in terms of basis points what they are paying to clients and all level. These are advertised rates. We moved twice from the old rates move and the first rate move and once now from this one we are \u2013 our lowest rate is comparable to government money market fund rates and if they are higher cash balances or higher client relationships balances I should say we have been our system the rate scale up from there so at some point I think it's at the very front loaded game which is now how we thought was going to be. And so we are recovering our most of our spread before we start passing through the clients at this point of time and candidly that maybe the new model firms may end up keeping more of the interest spread to help pay for regulatory compliance legal these other cost IT better out there. It may just be a new dynamic in the model from what in place prior to the economic crisis back in 08 and 09 I mean that was bit, we maybe in a little bit different environment but so to answer your question, is yes we are changing that and we are expecting to keep a little bit more of the spread than we had originally intended.","Paul Reilly","Although it hasn't changed our long term philosophic view of sharing with clients. So I think the question overtime is how do you get there what happens to money market funds given all the things that have happened to money market funds what happens to rate. But as the future regulations and sometimes regulation comes, money market funds maybe more competitive in rates go up so there is a lot of dynamics there and impacted but we ultimately believe we have responsibility to share with clients but we want to be also competitive in the rise and be deliberate in our rate. So I think we are through a transition period right now for this year.","Conor Fitzgerald","That's helpful and just a quick follow-up on that if your deposit rates are materially higher than peers do you think your competitive advantage?","Paul Reilly","It's hard to say I mean we are talking about basis points here. It's not, we are not talking about huge dollars on a per account basis. So I don't think it gives us a huge competitive advantage in the recruiting world. It certainly puts the economic disadvantage so I don't think it's \u2013 it's not something that recruiter live with let\u2019s put it that way.","Jeff Julien","Yes. But I would say tangible part is our advisers and our retention is viewed on a environment of being straight to them and our client so I agree we don't say we are paying too more basis points to your medium accounts. It brings people over but I do think the additive of pureness and equity to advisers and clients is the big reason people stay here and that is \u2013 it isn't just that it's the piece of it and that story is a piece of it. So we try to be very balanced and we are not way ahead of market but we are ahead for that reason.","Conor Fitzgerald","Thanks for taking my question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Harris with Wells Fargo Securities.","Chris Harris","Thanks. Hi guys.","Paul Reilly","Hi Chris.","Chris Harris","Are you guys seeing a much of a behavioral change among your private client customers following the election and really just trying to wonder whether we could see some better activity rates, better sales cycle, there is nice uptake in confidence here.","Paul Reilly","It might be too early to say I would say. People are optimistic and scared at the same time so the only thing we could see is the little bit more movement of fee based accounts so I guess I can't tell you. Certainly it's been a better equity flows if you look at mutual funds it's not just us. It's certainly some field actions only the positive versus more positive versus the previous trends but I think it's still early days and I would say only a very slight risk but it's not a significant shift.","Chris Harris","Got it. Okay and then in capital markets, you sound like you guys are little positive about the pipeline but to speak to commercial customers are you getting the sense that activity levels could potentially be delayed somewhat if you got companies wanting to wait to see what sort of changes will occur with tax and regulatory reform but it was really the election kind of the big unknowable and now that that's behind us potentially we should see activity pickup depending on obviously what the market do.","Paul Reilly","The M&A activity a big impact it seems like it's still going well. I think the biggest challenge if you look at structural challenges the market is just the rise of private equity and companies thinking regulatory burden too much to go public and the private equity versus IPO market when you look at the close to 12 year, lower or something and IPOs has been impacted by that when you get companies as big as Snapchat, Facebook. They get evaluations where they go public it's just the private equity as they lower cost less feasible alternatives and so I think that's impacted kind of the IPO and what the other thing is it's impacted secondary\u2019s as the balance sheet and bought deals. So it makes it much more difficult to compete so I think the sheer of the market is gone down because of that we are bullish I think we are saying off December number we think there is the positive trends as we have already been book runner in the couple of IPOs and we see something in the pipeline but I don't know how real buzz that business is what the impacts going to be. I do think that regulatory change if and when it's coming if it favors capital formation, if it takes regulation off of IPOs and stuff may help that market but that's \u2013 that remains to be same. I think that part of the reform hasn't come up after tax rate, law and all sorts of other stuff has seen to be in front of that. But that's the special\u2026","Chris Harris","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Ann Dai with KBW.","Ann Dai","Hi, good morning. I was hoping to get a little deeper on the D well and just kind of looking behind the scenes on some of the changes there happening as you work towards, can you outline some of the more meaningful changes that you have made lately product structure commission structure or really any pricing in anticipation of the rule?","Paul Reilly","Yes. I am not really in liberty to talk about really kind of those changes. We have highlighted some potential ones to advisers but frankly we are waiting really on the rule if it's coming or not before we pull the trigger on them, and I believe that there are something in the rule but and looking at the rules we said we could do this better where this makes sense or other parts that we think is just a burden to clients and we take advice and frankly waiting.","So it's just as we have been slow to announce our changes not because we didn't want to tell people what we were doing but we certainly didn't want clients and our advisers to go through the pain of doing things to undo it. We are lucky maybe but so far we have been right and we are still not ready to kind of push that out with advisers till we know and I think there is more and this is going to be delayed so we are waiting to see first of if there is a delay although we are -- to go if there is and second if there is delay and changes are made we certainly don't want advisers to make changes they didn't have to make or to go back and undo them with clients. So we are in a analysis mode which we have been in for a long time.","Ann Dai","Okay. Thanks for the color. The other thing which is on loan growth you continue to grow -- during the quarter and I think it was maybe the last earnings call when you had given some guidance around expecting that growth to moderate over the next couple of years or maybe just not continue it kind of the case it happened so was there any impact from Alex Brown this quarter on loans and if you could just give us an update on your thoughts around the next year or so, year or two and if that guidance has changed?","Paul Reilly","I would say that we are looking out \u2013 we would still think kind of low double digits intended 12% would be kind of good annualized run rate. Our product suite is just changed ever since slightly. We are doing some larger mortgage loans to ultra-high network clients not only in the Alex Brown channel but in general we have been recruiting more productive advisers that are dealing with larger families or more families so that product has changed just ever since slightly. So the loan growth of the last quarter was around 4% once again it's little bit opportunistic the corporate loan market in particular is the most volatile part of the business. We have seen periods when and right now as a matter of fact since the election the corporate market has gotten extremely aggressive. We have seen some pricing, the secondary markets have looped up probably 100 basis points in price so we have taken other periods, pull back to be more aggressive when we think rates and the risk relative is and the rates are more attractive but in general I think 10% to 12% is a good number going forward.","Ann Dai","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Mitchell with Buckingham Research.","James Mitchell","Hey good morning guys. Maybe quick follow up on can you just give us the total number of client cash balances at this point appreciate any material change?","Jeff Julien","Yes, Grant told us about $46 billion but there is fair amount of that $5 billion or $6 billion in various types of stage specific money market funds and things like that and then about $40 billion in the banks suite.","James Mitchell","Okay. And the deposit in the bank what do you?","Paul Reilly","Deposits in the bank right now are about $15 billion from the banks suite program and they have to continue to draw on those balances as to support the growth of the loan and\/or securities portfolio.","James Mitchell","Okay. So that's embedded in the 40?","Paul Reilly","Yes, correct. Part of the 40, correct.","James Mitchell","So should you still think we should think about every basis points around $ $4 million at the short end?","Jeff Julien","$4 million per year. Yes. About a million per quarter.","James Mitchell","And that was always guidance around the short end this is the steepening yield curve give you any additional upside and then high in the bank securities look or?","Paul Reilly","Possibly may not I wouldn't say materially from that I would vary it materially from the previous guidance based on that.","James Mitchell","Okay. Maybe just a broader picture it seems like you guys if I try to take a step and market impact you very strong growth in fee-based assets can you kind of I guess, a discuss what\u2019s the geography there, how much is maybe just transitioning from brokers accounts to fee based versus net growth from current customers new customers and how you think about the recruiting dynamic in those flows going forward.","Jeff Julien","I think part of it is recruiting certainly large, our recruiting has gotten larger I would say, we tend to have more fee-based and their platforms so that impacts. The other thing and mainly the part of this is DOL we had a lot of other more accounts for advisers as we looked at the rules just said they were getting out of commission accounts because as we look at the deck and everything else just they [indiscernible] demand manage in our fee-based platform. We did open up a smaller account kind of solution fee-based to help advisers and there has been a lot of that movement there too. So it's just and it's kind of across the board.","Paul Reilly","Geography and the financial there is a shift from a commission based account to fee-based account is that the most of the revenues stayed in the same line item than the commission and fee line item to the advisers. There is a small piece when it goes to a rap fee account it goes to the asset management segment for the administration of the account. In terms of the overall magnitude it just depends on what the account was generating on a commission basis versus what the fee is that's assigned to that account but geographically not a big change in the statement but since you brought that up we will point out that we did also set a record high for recurring revenues this quarter at 68.75% so closing in 70% of our revenues that we could call recurring fee type revenues.","James Mitchell","Right. And as we look at the recruiting pipeline you mentioned it's still very strong. I mean how long do you think there is going, I think you have been growing at headcount for close to 5% plus or less year or two do you think you still have that kind of momentum?","Jeff Julien","There seems to be it's hard to recruit at those levels and certainly there has been supplemented by not huge acquisitions but meaningful both of Alex Brown and 3Max joining us but recruiting pipeline looks very good. And there seems to be a changing landscape year or two or one or two firms or people are now happy with the circumstances there whether strategy or movements or grader pushing out small accounts or something we have got a large flow in it and it is continuing right now so we think it happens for ever no, maybe there is cycles but it still looks very good for this year.","Paul Reilly","I would say that net growth of 350 headcount without acquisitions just mean, brick by brick recruiting and training programs. I think would be a little bit of stretch for us but that's a lot of bodies to recruit but it's certainly doable.","James Mitchell","Okay. Thanks for all your help. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Hugh Miller with Macquarie.","Hugh Miller","I just wanted to follow-up on the prior conversation on the recruiting side of things. I was wondering if you could just give us little bit color on just level right now of competition with the front line things like that and if we get into environment where we get more relaxed regulatory climate would you anticipate uptake in that competition or would you think maybe some of the larger peers would divert capital to other business lines and you can we wouldn't see that type of scenario?","Paul Reilly","I can't say what other people would do. I can tell you what the market dynamic has been ironically we have all historically specifically versus larger firms offered less front money transition of system. It's with the DOL proposed rules most of the major firms drop their back end bonus which was the significant delta between ours and theirs and we haven't changed ours so in a way we have become more competitive we have always based ours on what we thought was the fair reasonable returns to the firm and fair to the adviser so we have been very competitive. There is some indications they maybe raising there a little more. But I think it's below as it was year ago but this is the highly competitive market. It has been a highly competitive market. It continues to be. So right now I think the dynamics are still positive and are in favor based on technology kind of the culture we have created here and so we still have a lot of demand I don't know how that changes. Last year we certainly you could make more money going to other firm up front that was certainly the highest but we did pretty well and it's a positive we lose some people that we would like to get but net people come for the right reasons when they are not coming just for the check they are going for the environment I think it's a positive to the people we are trying to recruit.","Hugh Miller","Certainly fair. That's very helpful. And then one other question just in terms of obviously we are very focused on the potential for changes and with DOL as you look at on things are there other regulatory changes that could be meaningful for you business if there were some changes on the horizon I don't anticipate longer would be much of difference for you guys but are there any other things that we should be keeping eye on in terms of the any type of enhancements?","Paul Reilly","Yes I think that certainly all regulations and even has an impact and first we should be regulated. I mean we are regulatory industry that has other people's money and regulation it's not negative I think the amount and type is important. We get a lot of discussions about regulatory enforcement where there is not rule there is interpretation of rules so I think any time there is clarity, it makes it better for everybody and some of that reforms would be helpful. It does have some positive impacts and certainly changes the private equity and investments all sort of things not as big as us as other people so the regulatory cost is continued to go up for everyone if that moderates that would be a positive but regulation alone in and go away. We do believe that maybe there are areas that should be modified and DOL again but I believe well intended business and advise and that's one example and there some other areas too.","Hugh Miller","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And at this time there are no further questions.","A - Paul Reilly","Great. I appreciate everyone joining the call today and hope we could give you little more clarity than we maybe did in the release on some of the numbers and we are very positive and on the future and where we stand today and look forward to talking to you next quarter. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen that does concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line."],"18179":["Raymond James Financial (NYSE:RJF) Q1 2013 Earnings Call January 24, 2013  8:15 AM ET","Executives","Paul C.

My name is Felicia, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Raymond James Quarterly Analyst Call. [Operator Instructions] To the extent that Raymond James makes forward-looking statements regarding management expectations, strategic objectives, business prospects, anticipated expense savings, financial results, anticipated results of litigation and regulatory proceedings and other similar matters, a variety of factors, many of which are beyond Raymond James' control, could cause actual results and experiences to differ materially from the expectations and objectives expressed in these statements. These factors are described in Raymond James' 2011 annual report on Form 10-K, which is available on the raymondjames.com or sec.gov.","In addition to those factors, in connection with the Morgan Keegan transaction, the following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking or historical performance: difficulty integrating Raymond James and Morgan Keegan's businesses or realizing the projected benefits of the transaction; the inability to sustain revenue and earnings growth; changes in the capital markets; and diversion of management time on integration-related issues. To the extent, Raymond James discusses non-GAAP results, the reconciliation to GAAP is available on raymondjames.com and the earnings release issued yesterday. Thank you.","I would now like to turn the call over to your speaker for this morning, Mr. Paul Reilly, Chief Executive Officer of Raymond James. Please go ahead, sir.","Paul C. Reilly","Thank you, Felicia, and good morning. As I looked at kind of some of the price targets this morning, we're reticent to ever give guidance. But we are making a prediction: Our prediction is 70 plus. And that's not the stock price, but that's the temperature here in St. Petersburg today for those of you in New York. So if anybody wanted -- wants a challenging career in great temperature, we're here in St. Petersburg, give us a call.","I'd like to start the release in kind of taking a high-level view, and I think our first big accomplishment is 100 consecutive quarters of profitability, which is a big milestone. And I think it's really a testament to the management philosophy that Bob and Tom James have built here. It has been since Black Monday that we -- that quarter where we had our loss, and that loss was due to that we kept the trading desk over that -- open that day and recorded  a little over an $800,000 loss, some 25 years ago. So I think that the story of Raymond James continues to be a strong, long-term ROE with a buffer to the downside because of our management philosophy, which should translate the value to our shareholders and our associates.","This quarter, I believe, was a good solid quarter given the marketplace. We recorded record net revenue of $1.1 billion, up 4% from last quarter and 42% from last year. We also turned in a record net income of $85.9 million, up 3% over last quarter and 28% over last year. GAAP EPS was $0.61, up 2% from $0.60 last quarter and 15% from last year. And our non-GAAP, excluding the integration cost, of $0.69, flat with last quarter and up 30% from last year.","And I go to those highlights from one thing, that our story has been very consistent since pre-acquisition, that we're going to focus on revenue growth and retention during the Morgan Keegan combination, and I think we're accomplishing that. We -- our retention levels stay high, we can see it in our revenue numbers and, I think, in the faces of our financial advisors as we go through this integration. But that is also consistent with elevated compensation, expenses and often technology expenses through the integration. We do not see those expenses diminishing over the next couple of quarters, as we go through this integration, and I'll give a little bit more color as I talk about that through some of the business segments.","Our assets continue to grow. Although the S&P was down 1%, our assets under administration were up 8.6% for the quarter and 33% over last year. Now of the $3.7 billion increase in our assets under administration, 31 -- $3.1 billion was from our ClariVest acquisition. A little bit of [ph] accounting, we acquired a 45% interest in ClariVest, and because of the control features in that, it is a consolidation. So -- and 3 -- the full $3.1 billion is in our $3.7 billion number. Assets under administration grew to a record 39 -- $392 billion, up less than 1% this year, but up 45% over last year.","As we get into the business units, the Private Client Group turned in good revenue growth at 3%, sequentially, up 35% over last year. Pretax income over 5%. The top line story is: Retention remains high in the Morgan Keegan advisors. Over 95% of the Morgan Keegan production offered retention is still with us, so we have good retention. Again, very happy with the advisors staying. If you look through the attrition and the decrease in Financial Advisors, the majority of it was caused by lower-end producing Morgan Keegan advisors. In fact, many of them were under $100,000 of production. We had 3 in that group that we considered regretted [ph] losses, and they were in production of $400,000-ish plus. One was by death, unfortunate, which we usually retain the books, and 2 did go to competitors. But almost all of the other attrition was really by the lower-end producers.","The recruiting pipeline remains very robust. The December quarter is typically a slower quarter for bringing people over, people don't like to change through the year end, both because of holidays, because of retention agreements here and payouts. But the pipeline is very good and recruiting continues to stay strong.","Our productivity per financial advisor has hit highs in Raymond James and Associates, their employee side, and Raymond James Financial, our independent advisors. And the Morgan Keegan advisor productivity is about 15% lower than our RJA advisor. Our -- we will be converting the Morgan Keegan advisors over to our platform starting mid-February into our technology platform, and that gap between the Morgan Keegan advisors and Raymond James advisors we feel we can make up over time. That will not be an instant, that will be a process over a year or 2, where we think we can -- our systems and products and services will help bring them up to the Raymond James Associates' productivity levels.","I said that the conversion of our systems will begin in mid-February. We will bring all of our advisors over. The expenses will remain elevated through second quarter and most of the third quarter. We are committed to getting the efficiencies out, but I think we're really looking that into our fourth quarter event, after not just the conversion into our technology systems, but also to make sure there's a smooth operating transformation of the advisors onto our platforms.","Our technology expense has remained elevated for 2 reasons: one, high conversion expenses, which we anticipated; but also, we've continued to upgrade our systems really to very -- almost regular reviews by our advisors of our new technology. And also validated by our recruits, who see our technology and are very surprised that the platform we're offering to our advisors. And we continue to commit -- we are committed to continue to upgrade our financial advisor-facing and client-facing systems.","Capital markets turned in a good growth quarter. And it really is the tale of really kind of 2 businesses, as we said last quarter, but flipped. We had a record quarter, and our Equity Capital Markets division really up, to give you magnitude of almost 30%, sequentially, driven by record M&A volume. Now the M&A volume probably was somewhat accelerated by year-end deals -- I don't think were generated because of year end, but accelerated by year end under the uncertainty in tax law. So being a lumpy business, you get some acceleration. Our pipeline is good, but we certainly had an acceleration into December. In fact, our M&A volume was almost 60% of our total M&A volume last year. So a very, very strong quarter.","We also had strong underwriting. And just to give you an example, 1 week in December, we had to price 11 offerings and we were left with 5 of them. So it was a very robust quarter in December almost, as we closed out the year very, very strong.","Conversely, in the fixed income business, which was down 15% sequentially, both commissions were lighter, but trading profits were off. And that's mainly due to sudden rate movements in December, which caused us lowering our trading profits because of our muni book, both by offerings we were in, in our inventory at that time.","The business is in good shape. We expect fixed income to return to a more, kind of, its traditional operating levels. We'd the Capital Markets business to continue as it was last quarter, but that was a very strong quarter, and we expect that likely to be softer than it was last quarter.","Asset Management revenue up 7%, pretax up 18%, 16% over last year. Again, good, solid, steady results in Asset Management, as we've had for a number of years. And again, assets' grown totally in that segment by the ClariVest acquisition.","Not sure what to say about the bank, just another very strong quarter, highlighted by an increase of 5.9% in net loans, $468 million. And I'm sure you'll want some color, and Steve, both on our originations and some of the volume in the secondary markets. You saw a lower provision because credit quality improves as loans pay off that have reserves, you release those reserves. And so the net number is lower than you've seen, but it's a combination of just strengthening credit quality. And those loans that reserve when they pay off, you have to release the reserves. So the bank has continued to perform well, and we're happy with its positioning and it's credit quality.","The integration will continue through the third quarter, where we think we can get it behind us, essentially, a little bit more in the year, which I think is a great testament to the management here. We are committed to the cost efficiencies that we've given you before. We're about halfway, with halfway to go. And we think most of those we'll attack later in the fiscal year, but we're committed to reaching those numbers once we have an integration. I'm very comfortable that we have a stable operating platform after combining the whole Morgan Keegan franchise onto our system. The integration has gone so well that we made a commitment to Morgan Keegan that we would keep some dual branding in businesses. For 2 years, they have asked us to drop the Morgan Keegan name in February after the integration and to operate under Raymond James. And I think it's -- that their request, which I think tells you the cultural integration and the satisfaction of the advisors, and I applaud both sides for really reaching out and working together.","And as you look at the results, even in Capital Markets, a lot of those M&A deals were generated by what we formally call Morgan Keegan bankers who are on our system, as in early-on when fixed-income combined with a lot of the [indiscernible] of it, they were -- their public finance group was a much stronger group, a lot of the big deals were generated by former Raymond James bankers. So we've gotten good integration on both sides, good teamwork. Happy with the integration so far, and we should complete it over the next couple of quarters.","So with that, I'll turn it over to Jeff with little -- for a little more color.","Jeffrey Paul Julien","Okay. A few comments to add to what Paul said. First, I'd like to make sure everybody is aware that we did beef up the press release this time. We've added some additional balance sheet data, including tangible book value per share. We've added ROE for each period, both GAAP and non-GAAP. And we've added a breakdown of commission and fee revenues and, similarly, a breakdown of investment banking revenues. This particular time, we put in a trailing 5 quarters. So those of you who model our earnings can update your models accordingly. Going forward, we'll probably put in the comparative periods similar to the way we present the P&L in the quarterly press release.","Secondly, let me talk about the comp ratio, which we analyze as a percentage of net revenues. It was 68.73 this quarter versus almost 70 last quarter, so we actually had 123 basis point improvement. I'd say that was a couple of factors, small pieces that was results of some of the rightsizing we did toward the end of last fiscal year starting to manifest itself. But also, there was a surge in revenues, as we've talked, about particularly in Equity Capital Markets -- although that certainly has variable comp associated with it, as well as a modest amount of bonus reversals, which we have every year in that first quarter, nothing like Goldman Sachs. So -- and that we improved 122 basis points. We think there will be more to come post-conversion as long as revenues hold up at these levels. This is the area that the cost efficiencies will primarily be recognized, and so we're hopeful that, that trends lower as we go through the fiscal year.","I'm very disappointed to tell you that I don't have anything to talk about with respect to the tax rate. It was normal at 38.3%. You get -- that's sort of what happens in a flat market when you're COLI values don't bounce around much.","Similarly, recurring revenues, we talk about that every time we present at conferences, et cetera, and it's been holding pretty steady here at about 55% of revenues, up for us.","One thing that we tried to estimate this time, we typically start out -- have, in the past, started out our MD&A saying that our results are very highly directly correlated to the direction of the domestic equities market. So we decided to put that to the test a little bit and just see how much of our revenues really are equity market-sensitive. We know it's a lot lower than it used to be, as the bank has grown and fixed income certainly is much more significant operation than it was. So when we do the math, we actually think that probably a little less than half of our revenues currently are equity market-sensitive. And another factor is Asset Managements -- assets under management, have gravitated more towards fixed-income and our retail clients have gravitated more to fixed income as in asset allocation. So with all those factors at play, we're not as sensitive to the U.S. equity markets as we have been in the past.","So just as a quick recap, skimming around the segments. In the PCG, our FA account was down 41 for the quarter. However, average gross and average assets per FA hit record levels. Client assets, as Paul reported, hit a record level, about $370 billion of the $392 billion is Private Client Group related. However, the segment margin for PCG is still at 7.4%. And again, this is, again, an area that we should see some of the cost efficiencies toward the end of the year. Remember, we consolidate into that segment our IT and ops areas, which predominantly serve the Private Client Group, and that's where we expect some of the efficiencies to be realized later in the year.","In Capital Markets, obviously, we had -- the record investment banking core, that Paul mentioned, we're hopeful that at least activity continues at the brisk level, even if it doesn't match this quarter. And we'd expect fixed-income to somewhat return to the normal profitability levels, particularly in the trading profit line going forward.","Asset Management, we hope there's continued steady growth. We did add capacity both with the small mid-cap team as well as ClariVest. We -- assets under management, I think Paul reported, up 1.4%  organically this quarter and $3.1 billion added from ClariVest. But we also anticipate that once the conversion is completed and some of these asset management products now are available to the Morgan Keegan sales force, that there may be a little more of a surge into professionally managed product from that sales force.","Bank, we kind of anticipate steady results going forward, maybe even a little higher in the revenue side. We're going to start seeing some impact from the loan growth that we've had here in the last 2 quarters. As Paul reported, credit metrics continue to improve. And so far, our interest spreads held in there, it's still around 3.5%. I think we've guided between 3.40% and 3.50% for the year.","And then one thing that has swung our results a little bit each quarter here lately has been Proprietary Capital. And that also impacts, as was correctly pointed out in at least one report this morning, impacts the noncontrolling interest to some extent. Just about every quarter, we've got about $5 million to $6 million of, what I'll call, operating losses from consolidated Tax Credit Fund partnerships, consolidated due to the ownership structure or the fact that we have a guarantee in place. So that's a consistent add back in noncontrolling interest, and that's what you saw in the September quarter and the December quarter a year ago, because they were very few other significant factors.","The one that swung it around lately has been the consolidation of our merchant banking fund, Raymond James Capital, which has one investment left in it, and it's had some significant valuation swings lately, all positive, and that happened again this quarter -- actually it's a dividend distribution from that entity. That factors into other revenues on that line item and the portion that we don't own becomes a net deduct from income in noncontrolling interest, which is what happened this quarter. So that's going to bounce around. We can analyze that in any level of detail that anyone wants to, but net-net to RJ is, as reported, at a record level.","Paul C. Reilly","Okay. We'd like Felicia to turn it over for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Joel Jeffrey with KBW.","Joel Jeffrey - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","If you could just give us a little bit more color on, sort of, your expectations for pretax margins in the Private Client business going forward. I mean, I know you've done about 7.4% this quarter, and just like sort of the period right before the deal was done, is a little bit above 9. Is that the kind of level we should think about once the integration is done? Or given what you've said about getting increased productivity out of the Morgan Keegan guys once they're on the platform, should we expect kind of a higher number going forward?","Paul C. Reilly","I think, Joel, you're going to see a drag. The Morgan Keegan margin were slightly lower, if you really look at effective payout, it's going to take time to get them up, our payouts. We went to a kind of a new grid we announced, which was really neutral, so we're not going to really get any pickup there. So we expect them to improve, but I think being back to 9 would be very difficult short-term. We also have -- the other impact was the amortization of the retention bonuses for Morgan Keegan which impacts that line. So a lot of money being run through on the amortization of retention impacts that ratio also.","Joel Jeffrey - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, I mean, thinking about the loan loss provisions, again, clearly came in a bit below what we were looking for. I mean, when you think about it going forward, are you guys targeting a specific, say, like allowance-to-loan ratio percentage? Or is this really going to kind of vary based on how many loans are paying off in the release of reserves that you have?","Steven M. Raney","Hey, Joel. It's Steve Raney, good morning. Yes, it's really loan-specific, there's not really a target per se. Each loan is rated -- one of our -- each one of our corporate loans is rated individually. We've been pretty aggressive at taking actions against loans that early on we perceived to be potentially problematic. Even this quarter, we sold loans, a couple of loans, a couple of positions that closed to par when we had rather significant reserves much more so than what we were able to sell the loan at. So we're trying to be as proactive on that as possible. But -- and as we're booking loans, as we've shared with you, in general, we're adding about 150 to 160 basis points of the new loans on the corporate side, it's a lower amount on the residential, and our securities-based loans are lower than that even. So it's really constructed at the loan level, and there's not really a set target per se. We are comfortable with where we stand in terms of our total allowance to non-accrual loans, non-performing loans relative to our peer group and other institutions that we look at. So...","Paul C. Reilly","So the noise you're going to get every quarter is -- our reserving, is pretty consistent for grades. But as loans pay off, whatever reserves we have, we have to release them, and it's this thing that make it move around in quarters.","Steven M. Raney","We actually added $0.5 million to our allowance. But on a percentage basis, it did come down 9 basis points in terms of allowance to total loans.","Jeffrey Paul Julien","I guess, we had to have a target for the allowance to loans that the -- having no classified loans of any kind, and having 150 basis points of commercial and whatever we have on resi now.","Steven M. Raney","Joel, that's my boss. I've got a pretty high bar to meet now. So...","Joel Jeffrey - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","5% and you're [ph] up that way. And then just lastly, I mean -- and looking at sort of the December commission fee revenues, it looks like it came in a bit above our expectations. And just wondering, could you comment on it if these kind of trends continued into January?","Paul C. Reilly","December was a little on the institutional side because of the syndicate. I mean, they were slightly elevated because of there's a lot of the syndicate business. In January, I don't think is --  has been a bad month so far either, but I think it got a little elevation from the Equity Capital Markets business. But you're down in the fixed income business, I think will -- it'd pick back up. So I don't see anything -- I can't -- I haven't looked close enough at the January numbers to tell you where we stand.","Jeffrey Paul Julien","We have set slightly higher fee billings than we did October 1 for the quarterly stuff, despite that's down 1% S&P 500 market and the December quarter.","Paul C. Reilly","Which will give us a little bit of a tailwind going into January also.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alexander Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. So a couple of question on expenses. Maybe as you guys kind of look through this year, I guess the first question is, what do you guys see sort of the normalized comp rate settling in, still right now, kind of like in the high 60s? So isn't it 60 still, I guess, the number we should be thinking about for comp?","Paul C. Reilly","We can see it coming down, but I don't know mid-60s, if you mean 65%, if that's mid, then it's no. We can get improvements, and the -- but there's only so much you're going to get out of operational and overhead synergies. If you can get improvements, it's going to be have to be in payouts, and you're not going to see reduction in the Private Client Group are really payouts overall. We're looking at a number of things, including our client net pay pricing. We're studying it right now. We're doing other things that could impact margins. We've said we're looking at the Equity Capital Markets, we're operating heavy there, and there'll be some. But with the independent contractor division being 2\/3 of the PCG, you're not going to get it down that low.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got you. That's helpful. And then, I guess, on the non-comp side, it seems like, especially in technology, there's 2 things going on, right? On the one hand, you're still converting the platforms, but also, it sounds like you guys were doing a few upgrades that feels like might be also temporary in nature at least for now. Is there a way to quantify that? And how much of a non-comp relief you guys would get once everything sort of settles down?","Jeffrey Paul Julien","Yes, I think that there's 2 pieces. One, we have elevated technology for improvements, and -- but there is certainly elevated technology costs for integration. And honestly, we are pretty conservative on what we call acquisition-related. And I think until it all settles out, you can't really get a good number. We've given you $60 million to $80 million target, we think we've gotten half, although we think there's another half. A lot of that is in ops and tech. Then, we're just going to have to wait till we settle through. But our technology spend is up, it's not sustainable at the level we have out, but -- because of the integration expenses. But it is up from prior, and will continue to be, as we look to actually strategically position our technology as a leader, which I think we're getting good results so far.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. Very helpful. And then, Steve, I have a quick question for you on the bank. So loan growth is obviously very good, can you give us a sense of where the organic loan growth is coming in from? And at the same time, revenues down a little bit sequentially, I'm assuming that's because net interest margin has come down. And I just want to clarify if you guys think that this is probably the run rate NIM we should think about? Or that it's more kind of an incremental compression to go? In other words, if we continue to see decent balance sheet growth, should the revenue growth be kind of going in line with that?","Steven M. Raney","Yes. Alex, related to the loan growth, it was across all of our loan classifications, but the bulk of it was in our corporate area. The December quarter we enjoyed some pretty robust opportunities in the marketplace, both in the primary market and also we added some positions in the secondary market. I would say that we're seeing -- those opportunities have kind of waned a little bit this quarter. We've seen continued pressure on margins and also structure. So I would not anticipate our loan growth to meet that close to 5 -- close to -- actually it was over 5% for the quarter. I would not anticipate that for the next few quarters. Although, we're growing at a slower rate, I would anticipate over  the next couple of quarters. Related to our revenue number, there was a couple of things that impacted our net revenues. Our -- we have a bank on life insurance policy that is about a $65 million investment that had about an $800,000 swing, a negative swing between the December quarter and the September quarter. And also, while the vast majority of our Canadian loans are in our Canadian enterprise that are hedged against the Canadian currency, we do have some legacy Canadian denominated loans in the bank itself that are unhedged, and that had about a $2.5 million impact negatively between the December and the September quarter. So those 2 things in combination with the slightly lower net interest margin contributed to the reduction in our net revenues for the December quarter. In terms of our NIM going forward, I know Jeff alluded to this, we are seeing some pressure. I would anticipate, although it really hung in there this last quarter, it only came down 3 basis points. I think over the next few quarters, you're going to continue to see some slight reduction, maybe over the next 12 months, a reduction by as much as 10 basis points or so on a run-rate basis.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with Sandler O'Neill.","Devin Ryan - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Just want to follow up on the strength of PCG results. And I guess, specifically in December, was that driven by year end client repositioning, just given looming tax hikes or was there something else driving that? I know that sometimes you have some onetime maybe boost related to selling in a product related to analyst top picks. Just trying to get a sense what really kind of boosted that earn improvement on that in there in December. And then, it's kind of a part 1 in the question. And then, secondly, with the equity mutual funds seeing some inflows the past couple of weeks here, are you seeing similar positioning within your client base and any signs of changes in engagement levels?","Paul C. Reilly","Yes. Two things. Certainly, December had packed harvesting and held positionings and yes, both.","Jeffrey Paul Julien","Tax loss and tax gain selling.","Paul C. Reilly","Certainly, the syndicate business was a good month. So you had positive spend in December that certainly boost the business. But having said that, January appears to be a good month too. So, it's certainly, you have factors like that impacted. And so, yes, we've had -- we had some boost from those factors. And I think the business is still very solid and continues to grow very well. So we'll see. Your second question, I'm sorry?","Devin Ryan - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Yes. So essentially, just -- we've had some positive flow trends, and I know it's only been a couple of weeks. But just wanted to see if you're maybe seeing some early signs of improvement in retail investor engagement now? Clearly things were, in the year end, I would say, were -- investors were less engaged. Just want to see if there's been any maybe shift in engagement levels?","Paul C. Reilly","No. We see -- I think that our investors' sentiment and our sentiment -- investor sentiment survey is up. We haven't seen a massive move to equities. I know a lot of the funds are showing big inflows. I think we've been more with our investors, we try to keep them engaged, maybe they've been a little more engaged in other places. So I haven't seen a big movement yet. But having said that, the commission levels in January have been pretty good so far. I'm a little bit behind in terms probably up to today. But I mean, I can't say we've seen a huge flood into equity since the beginning of the year.","Devin Ryan - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. Got you. And then just following up on expenses. When you say that you're halfway there on expenses, does that mean that essentially half of that $60 million to $80 million targeted cost, say, at run rate from Morgan Keegan had already been reflected in the results that we've seen? I just want to kind of clarify what that comment means.","Paul C. Reilly","Yes. My -- I think that's where we are. And I know that CEOs, as a breed, aren't patient and I have an expression that patience is a waste of time. And so we look at that expenses and want to get at them. But I think our strategy from the very beginning was focused on retention and to let operating expenses run at a level that support the integration. So we're committed to get them out. We can't zero on them yet because frankly, we're focused on flipping the switch in mid-February and getting the integration done and making sure that goes as smoothly as possible. All of our testing shows it's going very well. But it won't go perfect, it never does us. But we anticipate it will go well. Like any new systems, we have almost 500 advisors on a totally new system on a day. We're going to have operational support just because they're not used to the system. Doesn't matter where they came from with their own people, we would have that. So we're going to be running elevated for a while, and we think there's savings there. And I know you guys want a harder quantification. We think we've gotten half and we'll get half more, but to pinpoint it, we can't yet but we're very focused on it. And after the integration, as we get through this second quarter, I think in the third quarter, we'll be doing a lot of work to position ourselves to do that.","Jeffrey Paul Julien","Yes. That's the majority debt of what we've realized has been in the Capital Markets area where we've combined the departments. As an example, on equity capital markets, hopefully your retaining most of the revenue-producing individuals. At the same time you're eliminating duplicate research analysts and financial analysts and et cetera. Some of the support level people, so both in ECM and fixed income, there's been -- that's where most of the duplicative costs have come out. So the ones that are left are primarily going to be in the PCG support and ops and IT.","Devin Ryan - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. Great. And just within investment banking, your underwriting revenues, clearly an improvement from last quarter. But let me just get your perspective on -- not an number but just kind of what the upside is to that business? I feel like there's improvement there, but you're probably still hitting well below your potential. And then clearly, we don't have a functioning IPO market at this time. So, well, just to get some perspective on kind of where we are relative to what you think is maybe the more normal level for you guys?","Paul C. Reilly","Well, that's kind of a crystal ball question. So we're either overstaffed or the markets aren't performing enough. But one or the other. So it's a measure of potential. It's very, very hard. Certainly, in a robust market, we would -- we have a lot of upside. Now the question is, \"Do we really think the markets are going to turn that quickly?\" So I think we've seen some improvement. Our view is December was an extremely, unusually good quarter. Almost. And that business will be better and we predict the business will be better than last year in our budgeting process. Having said that, I think we've got some cost capacity issues and we're going to have an improving market. So hopefully, over the year, will get pickups in both. But you tell me how good the market is and I can tell you how well we'll do. We're certainly impacting upside if we get a functioning equity capital markets business. But I don't see any vast improvements short-term.","Devin Ryan - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly, within your investment advisory fees, was there a meaningful performance fee within that? I know that this is a quarter where you can record performance fees or a higher number of performance fees. So I just want to get a sense of that boosted results in a little bit and how much.","Paul C. Reilly","There is nothing -- no unusual stuff like that.","Jeffrey Paul Julien","Nothing this year. I think there was a small one last year.","Paul C. Reilly","I guess that's good news and bad news, right?","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Chris Harris with Wells Fargo.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just a quick follow-up on the synergies here from Morgan Keegan, not to beat the dead horse here. But it sounds like we're pushing it out or it's going to -- start to be realized here in the fourth quarter. How should we think about the pace of those synergy realizations once we get there? Is it going to be something that we might see a lot of them accrue fairly quickly. So like in the fourth quarter and then queue on the next year? Or is it something that's going to kind of take a gradual process to actually fully realize what we have remaining? So it's more of a next fiscal year type event where we see the bulk of those kind of kick in.","Paul C. Reilly","No. I think there's 2 pieces. One is in our view we haven't pushed it out, so we've been on a schedule. I think people have always taught that we're being very conservative and people think we're going to be doing it quicker. We've been pretty consistent that through this integration process, we're going to run elevated. I think people thought there'd be more fallout. Maybe we even thought more people would leave on their own, they've stayed the course. And so, our view still is that through -- certainly the second quarter and into the third quarter, we'll be running on those levels. And then we will get at them the third quarter and fourth quarter, my guess is we will get a lot out by the fourth quarter. It may not be fully reflected until the first quarter of next year in the normal run rate. Maybe in the fourth quarter will be some of it will be reflected. So somewhere in there, but our commitment is to get the synergies out this fiscal year. I just can't tell you which quarter they're going to hit. Some of those are the efficiencies, what I call the synergies, you get over time. And I do believe either getting the Morgan Keegan advisors and the PCG side more productive, synergies and kind of cross-selling the business. The good news is, I think, we've gotten a lot of people in the other businesses a little more focused on the marketplace. One of the risks in any combination as you get a little internally focused and hopefully, we'll get a lot more of that when we get through the systems conversion and the last adjustment in the op and tech part of the business. But I think that will focus in the next year. So net-net, I think it's still a great a combination. It gives us great market position, a great platform. And it's just going to take us this year to get it done.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Great. That's helpful. A few questions then on Capital Markets. We've talked about M&A being very strong this quarter. A lot of folks are kind of predicting that this year will be very strong for M&A. Curious to get your thoughts as to how the margin in that business is affected by revenue mix? So in other words, if we get a very strong environment for M&A this year and maybe commissions aren't as robust, is that mix better for you guys from a margin perspective than maybe having the year shape out the other way where you get a stronger commission revenue and less on the M&A and underwriting?","Paul C. Reilly","They're -- the 2 assets. First, I hope they're right, and this is a record M&A year. Part of this business, too, especially when you're a research-based firm is you have a big fixed cost called research. And you are paying that whether it's over the desk commissions, whether it's underwritings or its M&A. So if you look at M&A as a pure business because it's less research-oriented or the payouts maybe a little more advantageous at some more profitable business. But if revenue goes down in one area and goes up in the other, you still have your fixed cost recover. So if you say a switching of the business from revenue, I don't think helps us a lot of. A pickup in M&A would be very, very helpful to us. So the commission payouts for salespeople are lower than M&A payouts for bankers. But we don't expect the over the desk trend of decreasing although it was up this quarter over the last year, we don't think that declining trend or over the desk commissions has been one for a while now for years. And we don't see it looming back up. But if that loomed up, our payouts are lower in that area than in some other areas. So it depends on the mix.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then on staffing in Capital Markets. I think on the last call you guys were mentioning you were in a kind of exploratory phase of taking a look at your headcount there, and I think it was during a kind of up fairly weak period in the markets. Now that things looked to be picking up or they improved this last quarter, are you guys putting those plans on hold? Or is that something that you're still kind of monitoring at this point?","Paul C. Reilly","Yes. We're looking, I'd say we believe there's some structural changes in that business. If you look what's happening to over desk commissions, our people are paying you for research but we do have to make changes, whether there are a number of people or in payout. So we are still looking. Certainly, we were so busy in December, we didn't do anything but execute, and I -- and that's the better answer. But there are still some structural cost side that we have to achieve, even in -- if markets continue to be good, we've got to make some changes and we are still working on that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Hugh Miller with Sidoti.","Hugh M. Miller - Sidoti & Company, LLC","I guess kind of a question in the line of the recruiting environment. You guys have talked about how you feel as though the opportunities are robust. I realized December quarter is always a challenge to really bring on advisors. But just want to get a sense of kind of what's driving that strength, because from what I'm hearing with brokers, production that's been improving, overall for the industry, most firms' satisfaction levels amongst those brokers has improved and is fairly high at most firms and I've always found that, that kind of -- it makes more of a challenge to get people to make a move. So what is it that you guys are seeing that gets you confident about the recruiting environment? I mean, I know that you can gauge by home office visits, but what are you seeing now that really get the advisor to make a move?","Paul C. Reilly","Thanks, Hugh. Though it's just a study done, I forgot who it was by, of financial advisor satisfaction and that's when Edward Jones really ranked high and if you look relatively, one of the wire houses had pretty good scores. The other 2, I believe the study said 20% or plus of their FAs yet the numbers has been expected to be there within 2 years. So I wouldn't call that high satisfaction. And a lot of that was driven by premerger and I can tell you by the visits here that the biggest question most people have is that we aren't given -- getting rid of all this front money and being in a place I like to work versus being trapped at a place where I'm at for money. I mean, so, I would not call satisfaction at number of the big firms high. In fact, the survey shows just the opposite. So we continue to get 2 strong pipelines from especially 2 other firms and brokers that are very unhappy in the environment they're in. Took checks, don't like the environment, and they're looking to make the change. So now people take their time, they don't always come when they look, but our backlog of home office visits and the high-traffic volume indicates very positive momentum for us.","Hugh M. Miller - Sidoti & Company, LLC","Okay, yes, I'm actually looking at that survey right here in my hand. And I think it was one firm in particular that had some 50% satisfaction where all the other ones were 70% or above. So basically, the handful of or the firm or 2 that doesn't have that satisfaction that you guys are seeing those opportunities from?","Paul C. Reilly","Yes. I think that if you're going to look and say how many clients will be there in a few years, I think, there -- yes, there's 2 firms I think we're getting strong pipeline from. So, particularly -- so -- but we're getting -- and honestly, I think a few other things have happened for us is that the Morgan Keegan acquisition I feared would might scare people off. It's increased interest. We've rolled out some new things on our independent platforms and models and pricing that just -- which is -- got a lot of interest. And our technology news is really getting out now. We've mobilized a lot of our apps. We have advisor technology or advisor platform. And our client platform are looking at very strong reviews. And I think people will get surprised when they see us. So part of our issue is to get advisors to see what's really here. I don't think a lot of them even know what's available, and when we get them in the door, which is the test, they're very, very positively surprised. And honestly, there's only a handful of firms left that have what I call that original broker\/dealer culture but the financial advisors. And I'm not saying it's good or bad, it's just different. We offer a different environment. A lot of people grew up in the environment we offer, and when they come in see that they can get paid reasonably well and competitively. They can get leading technology. They can get the culture. We get a lot of interest. So usually, we find them, we get them in the door, we get pretty good success rate. We just got to keep getting them in the door.","Hugh M. Miller - Sidoti & Company, LLC","And you guys have commented on the new product, neutral compensation plan. It was supposed to be effective later this year. And we're just wondering if you really expected that to have a substantial influence on product mix and the comp ratio that in and of itself with comp ratio and retail segment or is it just kind of very modest?","Paul C. Reilly","We modeled it to be neutral. And part of it was to get the Morgan Keegan integration then we're on a different grid than we were. And though the view was just to make it simple, very transparent. And I think we have to see over time if it causes a movement in product. We can always change pricing or change the grid if there's adverse effect. We're very clear to our advisors, 2 things. That most people announced in December there's a new grid in January. We announced in January that it was effective October 1. So we give a lot of notice, we don't want to surprise advisors. And then we're very open about changes. We change it very seldomly but we tell advisors that for it to be fair -- that's to be fair to clients first, then it has to be good for them and for our shareholders. And we're very open in the communication. So -- but we modeled it to be neutral.","Hugh M. Miller - Sidoti & Company, LLC","Okay, I agree. And then the last question, it was -- just with the -- within the capital market segment, you talked about some of those opportunities. So I was wondering if you could focus in a little bit with the addition of the Howe Barnes franchise and looking at the financial segment within capital markets. And your expectations there and how discussions are going with clients and companies you work with and the prospects we're seeing in improvement in that space in the coming year?","Paul C. Reilly","We -- first, we've had great retention. We've got good leadership during that Howe Barnes acquisition. It's a -- very happy with position of the client space. We're really happy as the markets stinks. I mean, bank acquisitions has not been robust. Recapitalization of prices, last year I think surprised everybody that the market just went silent. So it's picked up some. We believe there'll be consolidation will pick up so we like the people, we like the positioning. But if you look at that isolated financially since the acquisition, it wasn't the best of timing just from a pure financial standpoint. But we've got very good bankers, very good people and when that market picks up, we think we'll realize that investment.","Hugh M. Miller - Sidoti & Company, LLC","Sure, sure. And then -- but are you getting any sense? Do you feel that now is you're going to potentially get that change in dynamics in the coming year or so? Or is it just a wait-and-see?","Paul C. Reilly","I think you're starting to see some movement but whether to say it's robust or not, I can't tell you. It's going to come, I don't know when.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Douglas Sipkin with Susquehanna.","Douglas Sipkin - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","So a question for Steve and then a retail question. With respect to the bank, obviously, I know the firm's philosophy is not to release reserves. But I mean, is it possible you would find yourself in a position where the loan growth does slow down and it sounds like that at least going to happen in the near term, but the credit quality continues to improve? I mean, how do you avoid the situation where you may have to release reserves? I mean, is that a possibility over the next couple of quarters if credit quality continues to improve?","Steven M. Raney","Good morning, Doug. Yes, that's absolutely a possibility. We can have a situation where you have no loan growth at all and we can -- we do have and then we disclose what our criticized asset levels are and then have higher reserves. Obviously than our pass-rated loans. You could have continued improvement in credit that would cause us to release reserves. And you can have a situation where, for whatever reason, in that quarter your charge-offs also exceeded your provisioning. So that can happen.","Paul C. Reilly","I think that the key thing to remember is that the reserves are loans specific. You would say it's bad news when you get the criticized loan to pay off, it's good news, too. But the problem is you have to release that reserve and there's no choice. So we don't do general reserve releases when loans pay off. You have to release that specific reserve.","Douglas Sipkin - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Yes. Okay. Because I mean effectively it looks like that took place this quarter, right? Because you did have pretty nice loan growth and as you indicated, it was more on the C&I side, so that has a higher upfront provision. So if that didn't happen, obviously it did, but if didn't happen, you probably would have had a negative number.","Steven M. Raney","That -- no, that is correct. That's right. I would say probably -- just if you isolated just the loan growth itself, our provision expense is probably $2.5 million or virtually all of what -- a big chunk of what our actual provisioning was related to loan growth. Now behind that, there was a lot of noise, upgrades, downgrades, sales of criticized loans and the likes. So...","Paul C. Reilly","Sixth or seventh. Maybe it's seventh and 1.5. Yes. Wait a minute.","Jeffrey Paul Julien","1.5 and 406 to go.","Steven M. Raney","Well, we had $2.5 million in all categories of just loan growth. I mean, it was not just incorporated. So...","Paul C. Reilly","But that sounds a lot. I agree with that.","Douglas Sipkin - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then second question as it relates to the private client. Obviously, you guys have been tremendously successful, early adopters of managed products, fee-based models. I mean, as you bring on the Morgan Keegan advisors to one platform I'm just trying to get a sense, whole company, how much more room is there obviously at the broker advisors discretion to move to a greater population of your retail franchise to those managed account fee-based models versus the historic traditional commission based model?","Paul C. Reilly","They are if you look at their productivity, it's about 15%, 14% lower than our employee productivity. And a lot of that is the percentage of fee-based models. And we think over time, they will move there. Now we don't tell advisors they have to use our product or they have to use the platform. So we go through both education which they are already attending on the products and on management of portfolio. And yes, over time, we think that my guess is they will move up there, because they'll see it's good for them or it's good for their clients. And so, we believe we'll get the room on those advisors, that they will catch up. But that's not overnight, that's over a year or 2, we think they'll -- we all get there.","Douglas Sipkin - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","And just a follow-up on that, have you guys had internal studies to sort of show how much more profitable over a cycle, over some measurement period that type of account is for Raymond James versus the traditional?","Paul C. Reilly","Actually in some cases, it's less profitable. If you get somebody that has a new issue oriented or pretty heavy trading volume, that's probably the most profitable, especially when you add margin to the overall complexion of the analysis. The philosophy behind fee-based for us early on is to put the advisor in the same basis as the client as their comp and their success went up and down with the client. So it wasn't really driven by profit. And we're a short over a cycle, which relates much more philosophy in putting the client first. Having said that, the steady markets means a steady income for the advisor. But as Tom pointed out, that as someone is the -- you have a client that would like to trade a lot you have a lot of activity that can generate a lot of commission revenue. So, and we wanted to avoid that kind of mindset, too, where people are focused on trading versus advising. So a lot of that drive in the early adoption with the philosophical adoption.","Douglas Sipkin - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Got you so it's really...","Paul C. Reilly","Assets that you can actually handle. And you can find a lot of our financial advisors with $0.25 billion assets now with a small team of support. And that's happened because of the asset management services platform that we have, and you were quite what correct in pointing out that over time, because of the support we give people not in putting individual investments, but in teaching them how to use professional management has a levering capability to build their annuity business. You will see over extended period of time that they will adopt it just because it's easier for them and better for the client as Paul said.","Douglas Sipkin - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. Great. And then just one final, I know you guys provided a lot of detail on interest-rate sensitivity. I'm assuming no change in sort of the pro forma impact, obviously rates would have to go up for that to happen. But you guys still comfortable with sort of the interest rate guidance that you provided in the past in the rising rate scenario?","Paul C. Reilly","Yes.","Jeffrey Paul Julien","Yes. Haven't changed much in the last quarter.","Paul C. Reilly","That's correct. We're just waiting for them to go up. But we're so -- and as the government get to the interest rate management business, we think we will see some benefit.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from the line of Bill Katz with Citi.","Neil Stratton","This is actually Neil filling in for Bill. My first question is you earlier mentioned record productivity for the advisors. Is there a particular metric you focus on here?","Paul C. Reilly","Their trailing 12 productions. What they","were producing over the last 12 months.","Jeffrey Paul Julien","You'll find if you try to compare that across, everybody calculates it's just a little bit differently. They include or exclude trainees or people that have only been with them in a short time, et cetera, et cetera. We don't count people until they've been with us for a year so we can hire some significant producers and they won't factor into that number for a year. But that just shows a manifestation of the people that we hired in the past.","Paul C. Reilly","We measure it consistently, and it is a record and this will continue to go up. So I think it is a reflection of more productivity for advisors.","Neil Stratton","And my final question, can you provide any color on the other revenue line? It saw a nice sequential pick up this quarter?","Jeffrey Paul Julien","Again, it would have to do with that proprietary capital where were we consolidate. That's also why you saw a net deduct from earnings related to noncontrolling interest. It had to do with the consolidation of our merchant banking fund, which had a significant valuation adjustment in the quarter, and some -- the majority of which does not belong to us. Which is why it came out to noncontrolling interest.","Paul C. Reilly","So it's the net.","Operator","And there are no further audio questions at this time.","Paul C. Reilly","Great. Well, we appreciate everyone joining the call. Again, we're still committed to the integration. I know people are really trying to focus on the synergies to get the numbers are. We're focus on the conversion, retaining advisors. And the synergies, the cost efficiencies will come. But again, I would tell you that they will be late in the year which is probably our target unless we have a perfect conversion. But I haven't seen one of those yet.

My name is Challis and I\u2019ll be your conference facilitator today. This call is being recorded and will be available on the company\u2019s website.","Now, I will turn the conference over to Paul Shoukry, Head of Investor Relations at Raymond James Financial. ","Paul Shoukry ","Thanks [Terese]. Good morning and thank you for taking your time out of your busy schedule to join us this morning. We certainly do not take your time or interest in Raymond James Financial for granted. ","After I read the following disclosure I will turn the call over the Paul Reilly, our Chief Executive Officer; and Jeff Julien, our Chief Financial Officer. Following their prepared remarks, they will ask the operator to open the line for questions. ","Certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements.

","In addition, words such as believes, expects, anticipates, intends, plans, projects, forecasts and future conditional verbs such as will, may, could, should and would as well as any other statements necessary depends on future events are intended to identify forward-looking statements. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements.","We urge you to carefully consider the risks described in our most recent form 10-K and subsequent Forms 10-Q which are available on the SEC\u2019s website at sec.gov.","So with that, I will turn the call over to Paul Reilly, our CEO of Raymond James Financial, Paul?","Paul Reilly ","Thanks Paul and thanks for that rousing opening to get us all awake and going here. I want to make a few comments over the year and quarter and then I am going to turn it over to Jeff who will go into details and then talk a little bit about looking forward after Jeff\u2019s finished.","So let me start with the year, lot of records, record net revenue of 5.2 billion, record net pretax of 798 million, record net income of 502 million or $3.43 per diluted share. Record net revenue for each one of our core segments and record pretax earnings for all of our core segments except Capital Markets which had its second best year ever behind 2014. So if you look at the year in kind of summary, net revenue is up 7%, pretax up 7% in really a difficult market. As one of our directors said on the conference call just another Raymond James year as I believe continue to perform in difficult times.","By segment, the private client group segment which ended up with a record number of financial advisors of 6,596 which were also -- is our record net increase excluding acquisitions of 331 advisors over the prior year. That results in almost 225 million of trailing 12 production while keeping our [gradable] attrition less than 1%.","And as you know advisor count and growth is a driver of our business, not only does it impact PCG but our Asset Management and Bank segments as well. The strong recruiting results enable us to grow client assets both in the private client group and asset management and despite a 2% to 3% decline in the equity markets; we were up 1% in assets. And as you know from other firms reporting we\u2019re a very small group that was able to grow assets, I think one other so for. Just proves that we continue to gain share by offering a robust platform and keeping this great Raymond James culture.","In Capital Markets, little more mixed. On the positive side, record M&A revenues for the year, record tax credit funds syndication fees and a record year on our public finance business. And this is despite the challenging markets that everyone has talked about in fixed income, our institutional fixed income commissions actually increased 15% in 2015 and our trading profits remained resilient especially compared to what we've heard from other firms. ","On the other hand the equity underwriting was challenging. Industry volumes was down, particularly for us with very strong energy in real estate sectors that which were even harder hit, the weakness caused underwriting revenues to be down 26% compared to last year. And you have to remember as you know that equity underwritings also negatively impacts our institutional commissions which were down 5% despite an increase in over-the-desk commissions. Furthermore decrease in equity underwritings negatively impacts private client group as new issued sales credits in the segment were down 15% compared to 2014. If you add those impacts that underwriting impact was nearly $15 million negative to our comparison in fiscal '14.","At the Bank, record net loans just under $13 billion which represented growth of 18.5%, in fact just in the September quarter we grew by almost 8% which should help future results. But as you know in the accounting conundrum of banks as you put on loans you put on loan loss reserves and that 13.3 million impacted short-term results although the credit quality continues to improve. Non-performing assets declined nearly a third now representing 39 basis points of total bank assets versus 46 last September.","So overall we were able to grow both net revenues and pretax by 7% and hit almost all of our financial targets. Pretax margin was 15.3% better than our 15% target. Our compensation ratio to net revenues was 67.8% better than our 68% target. And the only target we missed was ROE of 11.5% short of our 12% target and this was driven by our high capital levels which I know we\u2019ll discuss later whether I discuss them or not because you will ask but in the environment we think 11.5% ROE is attractive return for our shareholders particularly on a relative basis and believe overtime putting this capital to work can even elevate that return.","Let we touch on the fourth quarter, record net revenues were 1.34 billion, net income of a 129.2 million or $0.88 per diluted share. Record net revenues for private client group asset management and RJ Bank segments and the second best net revenue year for the Capital Markets segment which missed a record by only 537,000 behind the quarter set a year ago September.","Pretax margins 15.4% with all segments showing sequential increase in pretax except the bank which again was due to the large loan loss provision. So overall our revenues exceeded expectations in the quarter and we are able to keep our comp ratio below 68% although our expenses did grow faster and that was really driven by two items, to sound like a broken record once again a loan loss provision in the bank and the other is our communication information processing expense of 70.4 million and that was up year-over-year and sequential. And that's attributable really to two factors, as we're continuing to invest in our technology systems which we think has really been paid off in our recruiting and we have increased some of our regulatory systems and [our early] streamline that process as well.","In the private client group, recruiting remains very vibrant. We had an 89 net financial advisors which really enforced our investments are paying off. Despite the strong accreting results client assets were down 5% on a sequential basis due to a decline in the equity markets. Before we've seen some recoveries this month but as you know our fee based accounts are built in advanced and the balances are getting in the quarter in those fee based assets such were down 4% which should provide some starting headwinds starting next quarter.","In capital market segments all of our businesses performed well except equity underwriting again, in fact M&A and tax credits had record quarters. Asset management, financial assets under management declined by 7%, this was a decline in the market and the market declines particularly were punitive to small in midcap products where we have a focus on equals and we had some outflows in the quarter accentuated by a large loss in the last week of a quarter of an institutional account. Once again this will impact the December quarter to approximately two thirds of managed assets are built in advance based on the balances.","So and then at the bank again very solid quarter of growth. I want to remind that we have a very disciplined and opportunistic loan growth. I know it's not growing in straight line and while the production was good this quarter, really the payoffs were significantly down which drove a lot of net growth in the quarter. So I believe a very good evening quarter to a very good fiscal year.","And now I'd turn it over to Jeff to provide a little more detail on some P&L items. Jeff?","Jeff Julien","Thank you, Paul. We appreciate those of you who share your models with us it enables us to put together kind of a consensus model for the quarter which helps us determine which things we need to focus on this call so please continue to do so for those of you haven\u2019t, please adopt the practice because it's help us to know what you're thinking. ","I'll talk about some of the significant deviations from the consensus expectation model for the quarter and I'm [calling] significant things that are 5% or more away from expectations. Within the revenue section virtually all the revenue items were ahead of expectations with the exception of our largest which is securities, commissions and fees which really showed no growth from the preceding quarter, whereas some growth was anticipated. ","Again not a 5% deviation but as our biggest line item worthy of mention. That was kind of a result of a mixed bag of items, equity secondary market commissions were up institutionally given the volatility in the equity markets towards the end of the quarter. Fees in the private client group were up as the billing dates was about 2% higher than it was in the June quarter when we built it in the beginning of the September quarter. And then on the negative side fixed income institutional commissions were lower, mutual fund trails which are based on average assets for the quarter and adjusted downward and underwriting which impacted both institutional and private client group was weaker. All in all came at about flat with the preceding quarter.","Investment banking came in well above expectations, you can see in some of the detail provided in the press release it was really driven by the strong M&A and record tax credit fund quarter at $20 million, somewhere offset by the client in equity underwriting fees. But very strong in terms of M&A and tax credit fund enough to overcome the underwriting weakness.","[indiscernible] profits came in kind of consistent with prior quarters, recent quarters at least, although for some reason perhaps based on others results was projected down or came in pretty much in line with where it had been at little $5 million or $6 million per month and so our fixed income trading has been fairly consistent throughout this market and these market cycles, so nothing spectacular there to talk about, just its continued its current trend. ","And then in other revenues, again we had some private equity valuation gains that were not projected, this is a little less than the preceding quarter and obviously the preceding quarter had pretty good sized gain from some ARS redemptions that did not recur in this current quarter but nonetheless still a reasonable quarter in the other revenues section.","In the expense side most of those unfortunately were also higher than expectations, first I'll talk about -- Paul talked about comp, came in pretty much right on expectations and under our target comp ratio for the quarter and year. Communication info processing came in a little higher than we had thought as well, we continue to incur some consulting fees on numerous projects, some developmental and some regulatory related, we're starting to see the amortization of some of the previously completed projects start to hit the books and when those come online [technically] for purchase software and things like that we end up starting with the maintenance fees as well, so we would -- I mean as Paul talked about going forward we would certainly probably steer modeling towards the current run rate versus where we were in the prior year. On average we were between 66 million, 67 million a quarter last year, with this probably the most recent quarter is more indicative of a run rate going forward for the present time.","We talked about the bank loan loss provision. I know we put out the monthly statistics and you saw $300 million in bank loan growth through two months of the quarter and we ended up with $935 million for the quarter. So obviously we had a very big month of September and that caught everybody by surprise in terms of the provision expense related to that growth. But in our way of thinking that's a not bad way, not a bad expense to miss as long as its growth related and not credit related. ","And we had several other expense categories that were 3% to 4% higher occupancy business development and other expenses and things like that and again we might steer the occupancy is going to creep up as we open new locations as we continue to spread into the west and the northeast. Business development is indicative of the high levels of recruiting that we are continuing to experience and others kind of a mixed bag of a lot of things but again most of those categories we might steer you toward the current run rate as seems somewhat indicative going forward.","Couple of other points I would like to mention. We mentioned the comp ratio that was very pleasing to see that under -- well under 68 for the quarter and for the year. Paul mentioned the pretax margins above our targets 15.4 for the quarter 15.3 for the year. Tax rate in this quarter, as you know we had an equity market decline towards the [Audio Gap]","Gains are non-taxable and losses are non-deductible in that portfolio. So with the equity losses that elevated the tax rate slightly for the quarter but for the year 37.1% was pretty much in line with the 37% guidance I think we gave at the beginning of the year. ROE Paul mentioned also I think 11.5% for the quarter and for the year the one target we didn\u2019t really achieve and I would certainly add that it was not an R problem it was more of accumulation of E for the year that gave rise to that, as you know we had very good earnings for the year.","Our capital ratios which are set forth in the press release remain very strong. Shareholders' equity has now surpassed $4.5 billion for the first time. So that's both indicative of our capital and our liquidity position also remains very strong.","I would be remiss not to mention that interest, it didn\u2019t really deviate much from expectations but at a 113.5 million for the quarter, another record for the firm, that's indicative of the past bank growth and going forward we will have additional bank growth of course plus because of the equity market declined toward the end of the quarter we had a lot of customer cash flow in as some people exited the market and reallocated their portfolios to more to cash, cash went up about $3 billion in the last five weeks of the year to a $35 billion number for the firm overall, still just about 8% of private client group assets and that\u2019s indicative of stress times in any way. But that certainly will boost interest earnings going forward even if we don\u2019t get rate increases.","And then lastly I think everyone is aware the repurchase of 1.1 million shares late in the fourth quarter which had very little impact on this past reporting period but I have big impact going forward either but we did opportunistically exercise the repurchase committee and that $56 million were the shares at these capital.","So with that I have got a list of things, talk about looking forward but I am going to let Paul do that and I will jump if he doesn\u2019t cover everything on my list.","Paul Reilly","Alright. Good Jeff. You are correct, if I don\u2019t get everything on.","Jeff Julien","Addition.","Paul Reilly","Correct me if I am wrong. So little bit kind of outlook into the future. If you look at where we are today first the private client group segment as you guys noticed rides a lot of our business not just that segment but certainly impacts asset management and the bank. Our retention really remains best-in-class and we think our advisors are choosing to stay with us and really keeping this great culture alive.","The activity in recruiting remains vibrant. So we came off of our second best year ever in terms of number of advisors best year and net advisors and we see a lot of high quality teams still in the pipeline and I think both our platform is growing across all channels both the employee, independent, our financial institutions divisions and RA divisions, from what we see right now that growth should be very good this year. ","Approximately 75% of our revenues of this segment are recurring in nature. It's a greater model for advisors and clients but are also dependent on market levels, about 50% of those client assets are exposed to the equity markets and about 50% of PCG security commissions and fees are derived from assets and fee-based accounts. So with the quarter being off 4% in assets December will be a little handicap starting out. Assets grow should recover both from recruiting and hopefully the market but then I will see where that goes.","In Capital Markets, M&A and public finance, still very robust, in fact most of one month isn\u2019t a greater indicator but we are off to a good start. We are hopeful that significant additions to our investment banking platform made during the year will start to bear fruit this year also.","Our fixed income business continues to generate I think what is exceptionally good results given the market. Of course the big question is what happens to markets in 2016? If anyone can provide us a chart on market volatility, market direction, commodity prices and interest rates, we can be pretty precise on what will happen next year. So given that I think our model is very flexible and we seem to do well in those [tall] markets.","Asset management should continue to benefit from our strong recruiting and recruiting momentum and even past recruiting if assets continue to move over from people who have recently joined.","Our gross sales have been healthy but net flows were challenged by the cancelation especially of a large account at the end of the year, hopefully that's not recurring. The market decline in September is going to give us some headwinds. Our financial assets under management started the December quarter 7% lower, so that will certainly impact the start of the quarter. ","Raymond James Bank we believe is well positioned for growth, I think any quarter we try to give you what loan growth is going to be we are on but balances grew 18.5% over last year, portfolio remains strong, credit remains strong, our net interest margins we think are resilient around 3%. And for planning purposes we're looking at low -- I am sorry high single-digit or low double-digit growth say 10% but that will depend on what's available in the marketplace in terms of good quality credits.","A lot of people are going to ask about regulatory deal well and despite how active we are and I have to say kind I don\u2019t know the good news on this is we have had almost 400,000 comments as an industry received by Department of Labor as Secretary Perez has openly said last week that he is going to considerably revise the proposal but frankly this is one or two provisions that have the most impact on us and those are changed. They won't have much impact on us, my guess is they will not all change and there will be some impact I just can't tell you what that is until we see the final draft of the re-proposal in January and February. Good news we are seeing to have congressional support on both sides to modify the rule but I think that rule is going to pass in the way it's written no matter what we do from a political standpoint I think Congress will be focused on other bigger fish to fry.","On capital, I talked about capital deployment. You know that, that being, we have excess regulatory capital. We have also acknowledged we want to use it to grow our business. We have been active looking for things that have first a good cultural fit; second, a good strategic fit. But we will only pull the trigger if it's also good economics for shareholder. Our goal isn\u2019t to be bigger; it's to have to invest our capital wisely for good shareholder returns.","We have also said we would be prudent in the use of excess capital and you could see this quarter we did our first opportunistically purchase of about 56 million of common shares which is basically our first opportunistic purchase after financial crisis.","Our management team and our Board specifically proactively manages and we discuss in our point cases. So kind of in rollup I am kind of proud of what our advisors and associates did for the quarter. I think it was a good result and we know that there may be challenging markets ahead of us but while as we focus on the clients and their wellbeing which has been the history of Raymond James it ultimately that will be payoff for our clients, our associates, advisors and our shareholders.","So Jeff I don\u2019t know if you have any other corrections or additions before I turn it over to questions?","Jeff Julien","A couple other additions, thanks. Was looking forward, we had another very, very good year in private equity gains; we had about $48 million. Certainly I don\u2019t think we should expect those levels to continue going forward, so I counsel people to be cautious on what they project there. We really think the growth going forward is going to come from our core business segments. We added a lot of headcount in ECM and certainly in private client group that we think will become productive here this coming year as well as the bank loan growth kicking into interest earnings and coupled with the bank loan growth with these elevated cash balances which if the market recovers may moderate somewhat but should be -- should average the year quite a bit higher than they did in the preceding year. So even with -- gain without boost in short-term interest rates we should continue to see improvement in the net interest income lines. ","Paul Reilly ","Thanks [Jonathan]. Terese let's turn it over to you for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes, thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Steven Chubak with Nomura.","Steven Chubak","So, I wanted to spend a little bit of time to talking about the excess capital question which I know comes up on every single call, but Paul I know in the last update or one of the more recent updates that you've given, you talked about really liquidity being the constraint on capital return and you noted about that you retained excess of above 400 million or so. I just wanted to understand is that a regulatory constraint or is that a self-imposed constraint that you're managing to?","Paul Reilly ","Well, a little of both, I mean our self-imposed into that the extent that we don't go to the regulatory minimums, we've always tapped the excess capital to save above regulatory minimums, but that's the number that we feel we can freely invest without any strain on our liquidity or operated model.","Steven Chubak","Okay, so in the context of some of the ratios that we found on liquidity side that the banks are managing too and I recognize you guys are in a CCAR bank specifically, but I know liquidity coverage ratio is something that many banks refer to, I didn't know if you guys knew where you stood on a metric like that, given your balance sheet composition to that.","Paul Shoukry","Hey Steve, its Paul Shoukry, yes we are, as you said are not required to disclose it publicly but as you know some of the rating agencies look at that so we do look at that internally. We're not going to disclose it publicly, I don't think it's still a requirement but as you can imagine we are well above the 100% kind of requirement that the big banks are held to. So, I guess that's all I'll say on that.","Jeff Julien","And let me add to this, when you look at capital, I mean if we're purely a bank, we wouldn't be operating at these capital levels, so I think that you have to recognize the broker dealers have significantly more capital fluctuation, I mean liquidity fluctuation than banks typically do in stress periods, whether -- on banks. So, you got to be careful applying pure bank ratios to a broker-dealer from.","Steven Chubak","I understand, and well Paul one of the things you have referred to also in the past is that the management team itself is also tied to ROE target. So, are you sure you that your intentions are properly aligned with the shareholders. I don't know if you guys have -- if you can remind us what those ROE hurdles are today?","Paul Reilly ","Yes, we've talked about them before, our long term one has always been 15% in these markets, they've been 12% and so this year, our ROE, our restricted stock will be unhinged by 11.5% versus 12%, it's an index scale, so we are aligned but again I think this management team looks long-term and view is still we can put the capital [rework] and we'll see if we can otherwise we'll have to figure out a way to return it to shareholders, but that our 12% target has been the target the board has set the last couple of years given the environment and I doubt they'll reduce it.","Jeff Julien","When interest rates are what we call a more normal level that target will increase probably back to the 15% level.","Steven Chubak","And then just one more final one from me and apologies if I missed this in the prepared remarks, but I did see as a financial service fees, I know that there's a seasonality component there and if they come in, if it's stronger than expected. I didn\u2019t know if you could speak to what drove some of the strengths in the quarter and how we should be thinking about that heading into your next fiscal first quarter?","Paul Shoukry","That bounces around from quarter-to-quarter as you know, just depending on accruals of fees from mutual fund companies and other type of fees, for example client transaction fees and fee based accounts were up this quarter just given the market volatility, so that, that bumped up that line item for the quarter. So, there are a lot of different items in that line item, so it's hard to kind of isolate any one single item but we do know for example client transaction fees were up this quarter just given the heightened market volatility. ","Paul Reilly ","So, some are asset based, some are account based like [IRAC's] and things like that, just based on having an account or small account fees, we actually have to fee for accounts that are under economic level for us to maintain and some are asset based. So, it's kind of a mixed bag over the fees in that line item, plus the fees from the mutual fund that he's talking about are constantly trying to put new mutual funds on [anonymous] platform which is higher revenues to us and constantly renegotiating the contracts that we have in place with existing funds.","Operator","Your next question comes from Will Katz with Citi.","Brian Delly","Hi, this is actually Brian Delly filling in for Will this morning. How's it going? So, I guess coming back to the capital discussion, just wondering what your appetite is for the deals and maybe how we should think about the size and then some recent news article about recently as well I'm not sure if you can speak to them.","Jeff Julien","Yes. First we never talk to rumors about us or anybody else, so I can't speak to those but the size is almost irrelevant to the quality of the yield first. Morgan Keegan was our best acquisition in history kind of by a long shot which is a $1 billion that was a big deal for us. So we tend to do things that are more modest and they have to be cultural fit, strategic fit and then price, so we actively are in the market, we have a corporate development function we talk to a lot of people, we've talked about a lot of focus on asset management as an area and some M&A. So we're active and we want to deploy capital but only if it has a good fit, so we are not going to spend it just to be bigger. And we\u2019ve been consistent on that, so we do believe we can deploy it on the right opportunity when we find it, but we just haven't found that opportunity yet.","Brian Delly","Got it. And then can you give us any indication to activity levels into 4Q in particularly around [PCG maybe client flows]. ","Jeff Julien","[Client flows] have been pretty steady, I think they were down 1% on the equities, so that latch was last month I think it was the month before when I saw the report but that's valuation driven alone, but it's actually during the big sell off, I forget how long ago it was now in August that I was actually surprised pleasantly that client selling market advisors did their job of not having people panic. So I haven't seen any huge movement in client flows.","Paul Reilly ","I think if you look at overall flows we don\u2019t calculate that necessarily for all PCG client assets but one proxy for that is the flows into the nondiscretionary fee based accounts in the asset management segment which serves our private client group segment. We haven\u2019t finalized those flow calculations for this quarter yet but for the first three quarters of the fiscal year they were annualizing at around 15% or 16% flow for those nondiscretionary assets in the asset management segment. ","Operator","Thank you. And next question comes from Joel Jeffrey with KBW.","Joel Jeffrey ","I apologize if I missed this earlier. But can you give us some color on the pickup in the criticized loans. I know last quarter you talked a little bit about that having some impact from [indiscernible] but just wondering that why we're continuing to see that and if it's just a function of loan growth?","Steven Raney","Hey, Joel. Steve Raney, good morning. There was not really a general theme, we had some upgrades in the quarter where we had three corporate loan downgrades that drove the increase in criticized loans, they were in different industries, so several themes as you we review each credit on a quarterly basis and we see a deterioration in performance we proactively downgrade into that and that reserves so accordingly.","Joel Jeffrey ","And have you seen any degradation in the energy loans that you made and can you give us a sense again for the size of that or the portion of your portfolio?","Steven Raney","Yes, Joel. That portfolio has been pretty stable over the last few quarters and this quarter is consistent with that as well top $450 million in loan outstandings in across a broad spectrum in the energy space. As we've communicated before we've really shy away from I would say the more risky and many of the loans that have been criticized at some of the other banks and the expiration and production [E&P] faced really have one credit in that sector and actually there is no loan outstandings to that investment grade borrower so it's a very broad and cross section many of those loans are to -- what we think is less risky, less volatile and less susceptible to the true commodity price risk where there are more midstream nature take or pay contracts are in place. We watch that very closely, we had added reserves really kind of across the board in that sector despite what we think is actually a well-constructed portfolio. One of the criticized loans that got added in the quarter I mentioned three one was in the energy space.","Joel Jeffrey ","Okay, great. And then in terms of just the pick-up that we saw in the tax credits syndication revenues, is that just the seasonal thing but does seems to be a bit higher than what we've seen even in recent past quarters.","Jeff Julien","It's seasonal when it closes because when funds close we get the fees and they are just doing really well, we believe we are the largest syndicator of tax credit funds right now that's not syndicating them for internal use in banks and its doing well and its backlog is very-very good. They are very good at what they do. But it is lumpy.","Joel Jeffrey ","Okay. And then just lastly from me and again if you have mentioned this before I apologize but I think last quarter you described the public finance pipeline as exceptional, is it that still the case given the rates you haven\u2019t pushed out.","Jeff Julien","Yes, the public finance has been really had the just their strongest quarter this last quarter and backlog looks good in the particularly the M&A backlog looks very good, healthy even stronger so.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Hugh Miller with Macquarie.","Hugh Miller ","Good morning. Couple of questions I guess one first one the PCG we were hearing about kind of a large peer that was considering kind of a garden leave clause in their pay plan for 2016. I was wondering, are you guys seeing any benefit on the recruiting side for the pipeline because of that or brokers from that business kind of considering make me a change or is that not been impactful at all?","Paul Reilly","I think that I know that someone was considering it; I don't think it\u2019s been done. But anything like that is great for us, so we can add a garden leave provision except that we tell the advisors, they own the assets, they can leave anytime they want. So, it\u2019s not pretty attractive for us. But anytime we see competitors trying to put in clauses like that or what I call so institutionalize accounts by indirectly pushing products, or product goals for managers, it\u2019s all been great for us and great for our recruiting because we\u2019ve been boring and have kept the same kind of attitude and platform throughout our history of the -- that the advisors own the clients and that we\u2019re here to help them. So I can\u2019t specifically address that one. I\u2019ve heard it come up that recruits from places that there\u2019s been discussion. And certainly it doesn\u2019t hurt us when they do that.","Hugh Miller ","Am I thinking about it correctly, initially you potentially see a benefit as people re-explore their options. But I guess I would have to think that it would be extremely difficult to them transition your book of business once that was in place; for the longer term, does that -- could that create a meaningful headwind for people having a flexibility to pick and choose and move to new locations?","Paul Reilly","Sure, if it was instituted well and people had to sit out, I don't know for how long and people actually sign the agreement and there wasn\u2019t an out because they changed pricing and fees in such a way that was a change in contract or we can go on and on and on and on. So hypothetically, yes. Just like some institutions thought we\u2019re giving 250% retention bonuses would anchor their advisors down. When those came off, that hasn\u2019t been the case. So, I would say theoretically, yes. One, I don't know if they can implement it without a revolver; and secondly, what they do, what the terms or breach or changes would be. So conceptually, it would be something that helps people stick, hasn\u2019t helped a lot in investment banking which is common in Europe to have those for a long time; it\u2019s worked its way over here. But in the private wealth, I think it would be a barrier people can successfully put them in.","Hugh Miller ","Got it, that's interesting color on the dynamics there. It\u2019s helpful. And then shifting to couple of questions on the bank, obviously we saw very strong growth on CRE and CRE construction. I was wondering if you can talk about if there is one of those two that was seeing stronger demand. And you also mentioned the impact of kind of lower prepays -- or repayments during the quarter. Can you just help us quantify the differential in the net loan growth and what that difference was between new originations versus slower repays?","Steven Raney","Yes, good morning. It\u2019s Steve Raney again. The real estate growth is really split, really evenly between our loans to REITs and then loans to individual projects. As it relates to the repayments in the quarter and the growth, we actually only made about 250 million more in loans in the September quarter versus the June quarter. And as Paul alluded to the pay off and the run off in the September quarter was substantially lower. Part of that run off in the June quarter that was maybe our highest ever, was somewhat self-imposed. There was a very large wave of re-pricings in the market. And some of those loans we just decided to exit because we didn\u2019t think that going forward rate was the appropriate interest rate that we should be earning on that for that asset net the risk. So, our runoff was down. The annualized runoff in the corporate portfolio in June was 44% and this quarter last quarter was about 15%, which was actually abnormally low; it\u2019s usually about 25%; that's what we\u2019ve seen historically over the last few years. So highly unusual; I have two quarters linked together that were that different in terms of runoff amount? But that drove the substantial increase in loan growth for the quarter. Although we grew loans in all categories, our residential mortgage business, -- tax exempt loan business, growth in all categories.","Hugh Miller ","One other, what are you guys seeing I guess in terms of the Canadian operations relative to the U.S.?","Paul Reilly","A tale of probably two businesses up there to the private client group that\u2019s doing good recruiting and margins are holding and similar margins actually here, which is unusual; I think it\u2019s unique to our competitors in Canada. And the investment banking business, obviously it has been challenge in the commodity based economy. So, we see a little bit of improvement but obviously at the tougher market we\u2019ve -- building an M&A practice there, which we haven't had a specific one, recruited a leader last year and continuing to hire in a market where you can hire people.","So private client group, we expect to see some continued growth and the investment banking I guess, although will be better when through a challenging period.","Hugh Miller ","And then on the IT or on the expense side, you mentioned that some of the regulatory items were driving up some of the IT investment and also some of the consulting fees. Can you help us quantify that and as we think about heading into next year, should we continue to see an acceleration of that investment or should that level off?","Paul Reilly","We think -- Jeff I think said earlier that the run rate is probably a good rate, I think somewhere between we were in that number, but I would urge the number we\u2019re running at.","Jeff Julien","There are no shortages of projects, it\u2019s just a matter of how many we can undertake at once. I think the most recent quarter\u2019s probably a good run rate to use going forward. We can control enough and not let it accelerate much from there.","Hugh Miller ","And then you mentioned that there seems to be a handful or very key provisions within the DOL proposal that would make kind of the most meaningful impact. Obviously you mentioned that you\u2019re uncertain which way they\u2019re going to go with those. But can you just help us understand the handful that you feel are the most important to focus on have the largest impact on clients and the industry?","Paul Reilly","First, the big exception for product commissions is the way it\u2019s written; it\u2019s almost unworkable for a lot of sized accounts. I think the DOL is focused on that. The concern is even if they adjust it, do they really understand the impact since they\u2019re not in the securities business for a living. But do they really understand the impact it\u2019s going to how on the broker dealer; can we work under it? The other is that level fees is certainly there has been a discussion DOL is that to be level across the firm for all products, which if you look at trails and on the bus and omnibus and all the fees associated with mutual funds, it\u2019s more complex especially around share classes, there has been some discussion that that may imply only to the advisor level, certainly a lot easier to deal with and dealing with across the firm. Also an implementation timeline of this about eight months, which is almost impossible to rely on some of exemption, because our fund families tell us, they can\u2019t provide the information, much less, thus providing that in the detailed format they want. So those are probably the provisions on overall basis. To the extent all of those are workable, that\u2019s great; to the extent that they are better, but at the end in order to comply with the exception, you have to do most of the work anyway has the bigger impact.","Hugh Miller ","And then last for me, you guys mentioned I guess about seeing with any asset management segment kind of a substantial client loss of assets, maybe someone moving those assets. I think you mentioned an institutional account. Can you just give us a sense of what was driving that decision and was it all in one particular fund?","Paul Reilly","We have a great relationship or we\u2019ve have great net flows and we had some outflows this year. I mean that\u2019s kind of a normal course of business. We have the Eagle Boston last year that group left and we had half those assets that had an impact. And then we had a client that just in the end of the year, a 20-year client focused on the small and mid-cap shut us to go with different manager, so that was probably the more surprise but that happens. And we get good surprises and bad surprises. We just had a couple surprises going against us in the last month at the end of the year. I\u2019m sure a term notice was probably the harder one. But I think fundamentally the business is in good shape and we had good strong flows until that happened. So we just have to keep chipping away at it. And we\u2019re certainly institutionally in lots of proposals and if couple of those come through, it\u2019s good and if you lose some, that\u2019s bad. And that\u2019s part of the business.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.","Jim Mitchell","Good morning, guys. Could we maybe just talk a little bit about operating leverage? I think recruiting over the last two quarters has I guess probably been the strongest since the merger or acquisition of Morgan Keegan. And we\u2019ve seen obviously investment spending upfront is pretty high and so revenue growth. Earnings growth has been slower than revenue growth as expenses have grown a little faster. So, how do we think about the payback next year? You mentioned that recruiting still remains very vibrant. Does that mean we still are going to have to wait for returning to positive operating leverage at least, how do we think about I guess that dynamic of investment spend versus return?","Paul Reilly","I think we can't give you expense guidance, what we can give you is the market guidance. So generally in a flat market alone recruiting should drive growth. So, what happened this quarter obviously is a big drop in the market. The recruiting -- it\u2019s hard to recruit at those levels to overcome that kind of market adjustment, even though they\u2019ve recovered some this month. So, our view if the market grows at some kind of rate, our recruiting should drive good numbers. If we continue recruiting pace but the market continues\u00a0to fall obviously, we can't overcome that since half the assets are tied are influenced by equity markets. ","So, that's the challenge that's protecting the market. So, we're kind of keeping our operating targets the same right now and as the market is really good we'll do better, interest rates rise, we'll do a lot better, if the market goes down it's hard to chase it, but we'll be above of a lot of people. ","Now a lot of the operating expenses too, we can cut costs, I mean we haven't at this point we've chosen to kind of keep the numbers we'd given you but certainly if the market goes down we have 68% of our revenues that you can see are variable pretty much are in most businesses and certainly we could cut back on a number of initiatives to save cost, but we haven't pulled that trigger yet.","Jeff Julien","Tim, I would say that in a flat equity and interest rate environment for the next year that -- if we recruit at the same level as we did this year we should see some pretty modest operating leverage improvement. And this is not true just in PCG, I mean capital markets had some significant hiring this past year as well and those people have not yet been as productive as they should be in the coming year. Because we do have a lot of -- some, we do have a fair amount of fixed cost that we should gain some operating leverage on but given the scale -- be fairly modest again in -- under those assumptions, also with the help from the equity markets or interest rates either one, we'll do much better.","Operator","Your next question comes from Devin Ryan with JMP Security.","Devin Ryan","You've always been very disappointed around deal, and I know there's a very high bar internally and you spoke to cultural and strategic and financial thresholds but when you think about the financial attracting this as a deal, what metrics are you guys looking at or is there a hurdle rate or how should we think about what makes the deal attractive financially?","Jeff Julien","Our goal is always to generate a 15% ROE and that's under -- reasonably conservative assumptions we want to be able to bring the business integrated and generate that kind of return of our investments so, I know lot of people will go a lot lower saying it's a strategic initiative or that revenue synergies are going to create all sorts of stuff, we tend not to do that, we're pretty -- look at the cost, look at realistic retention rates and what we can grow the business and if we think we can generate a return and its strategically fit we'll do it. We're just not [well on the rope] [indiscernible] hope. So, I don't think our returns are out of line but we're not trying to shoot for 25% ROE but we're pretty fairly conservative in the assumptions and there's a good business we can grow and we can hit that 15% plus target, it's something we'll do.","Devin Ryan","Maybe just shifting back to the recruiting momentum, is it still primarily wire houses or you can give us any sense of the mix over the past year or so kind of how has much has been wire houses versus other independent and the trailing production, [are not seeing] yet in results for the trailing production of the [financial advisors] have been hired. How does that compare to the existing -- call it average production of the platform?","Jeff Julien","Primary driver is wire houses and it seems to move around that -- that the one with the honors tends to move a little bit and in the last year we've had one that's been significantly better, I am not going to name names, but and seems to continue to provide us opportunities as they make changes. But the independence, in the independent channel we've had more from non-wire houses that's increased, but the significant driver has been kind of wire house. The averages have continued to stay over our averages. So, they've been that and the increase in average production as you've seen in the improvement, I think it's driven by both our advisors becoming more productive and are recruiting to be above our averages.","Devin Ryan","And maybe a last one for Steve, with respect to the net interest margin in the bank and you maybe speak to some of the puts and takes in the outlook. You had a great quarter of loan growth, so how will that play on the forward NIM relative to -- obviously [indiscernible], so I'm just trying to put that all together to think about whether that interest margin maybe goes from here in the near term and then kind of longer term deal.","Steven Raney","[Technical Difficulty] in some stabilization I think and we -- hopefully that's going to continue and as I've mentioned even in the prior quarter we're going to be really disappointed around it and if we have to forego some opportunities because margins -- in the right that are being afforded to us are acceptable we'll have to take some path on some loans. So that being said right now we're pretty encouraged by what we see in terms of the stabilization after a period as you know of pretty significant compression. So, right now pretty stable outlook at least for the next couple of quarters. ","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Dan Paris with Goldman Sachs.","Daniel Paris ","Hey, good morning guys. I just wanted to get maybe your updated thoughts on growth of the bank and onboarding of the excess client cash. I noticed this quarter in particular there were some good growth in securities book, I'm sure some of that is mark-to-market but I wanted to know if we should read that as you are getting more comfortable deploying cash and securities essentially extending duration.","Jeff Julien","Let me first -- we're doing a little more at the bank but we do not believe it\u2019s a good play to leverage our balance sheet and the securities and take a lot of interest rate risk and create more leverage in the bank and we saw that movie in '09, we're glad we weren't in it, and that we could watch it, we couldn\u2019t totally watch it, we had the few chapters ourselves, but we stayed out of it, the big theme. And we know we can do it, we know we can increase leverage in the banks, we know we can get some positive margin short term by taking some modest securities duration risk and we just try to stay neutral on interest rates to the extent we can and we're not interested in doing that, we'll be doing a little more of it and I call it very modest it's not a strategy that inflates the balance sheet and onboard cash and try to leverage up the balance sheet. ","Daniel Paris ","Got it, that's helpful. And then maybe a follow up, so I want to hear your thoughts on what's the right way to think about the loan loss provision from here. I mean it seems like the reserves the loans have held pretty stable. Should we just assume the provision it's time to plug in that equation or if credit remains benign, can we expect that kind of reserve ratio to migrate downwards?","Paul Reilly ","Well as the balance sheet mix stays about the same as it is I think the 130 basis points type of reserve levels going to be pretty consistent if we slowdown the commercial production side and some of the mortgage and [SPLs] become a little more dominant, they may dip downward a little bit but as far as based on our production estimates going forward I think the mix will stay about like it is, but I'd say 130 is about correct.","Daniel Paris","Okay, got it. And then maybe just last one from me. So I want to make sure I have the message right on the non-comp side obviously you are investing heavily in the business which is good for the long term growth, I just want to get a sense of how kind of quickly you can turn on or off those investments depending on the revenue back drop. I know the risk can we get kind of non-comp leverage regardless of the revenue backdrop?","Jeff Julien","Yes. We are not going to -- we can if we thought there is marginal compression but is a good strategic initiative, we know we don't operate quarter-to-quarter in our strategies, so we are not going to do it. If there is a bigger downturn in the market we'll be much more aggressive about it and so our view is I know you guys have to focus on quarter-to-quarter, we're kind of focused on the year and five years and building a franchise and value for the shareholders, [but it's not] my quarter so I would imagine in our numbers with our anticipation as that we're giving your guidance because we are not going to react to this the one quarter of margins. If we think there is a continued trend or continued cut, then we will react as we have in the past.","Steven Raney","Yes. We went [indiscernible] went through this in the '08, '09 period and as we definitely have room to honker down if that came to that and there is a whole lot of things you can do, but they do impact at the levels of service or the levels of investment that you are making and the platform or as delaying projects or doing things and then God forbid you sample trips or conferences and you started being the culture to some extent. So we're very cautious to do any of those things. ","Jeff Julien","We think a lot of the our success especially on large teams and some of the teams in our pipeline are the largest teams we've ever recruited is a direct function of being able -- or a platform now. The technology platform will put up against anyone, it's not perfect and that thing with the best in all areas, but it's certainly from an advisory standpoint at the top of the class. So we are not going crazy, if we went by [refresh] from the business units that number would be a lot higher, so I don\u2019t want you to think it's not managed, we think it's balanced. ","But we could delay or slow projects and not all the projects are productive, some go discounting nature and other things that you have to do to run your business, but they don't impact the business, but most of our business [indiscernible] we can adjust a lot of numbers if the market comes down are right now [our intention] is to kind of stick with our run rates and think it's a good bet based on what we feel right now.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo.","Chris Harris ","Thanks guys. I know this call is running long. I really just had one question and it's on the recruiting and PCG. When you guys are talking to your advisors the new advisors that have locked in on boarded, what are the biggest reasons those advisors are giving you as to why they are joining Raymond James. And then I'm curious have those reasons changed at all over the last couple of years? Thanks.","Jeff Julien","I would say the reasons, the consistency is culture in the way we treat advisors. And more than anything, I would say one of the big -- if you look at the -- so, that's being consistent, what's changed there too especially bank based advisors fee or like our institutions or trying to compete more and more with them and dictate how they do business, [we ever proceed] but they feel that the multi-channel approach and product kind of as they feel push has accelerated in terms of people looking to us an open platform that doesn't do any of that. ","The second Pete, is technology I think that's the change -- we always had very good technology for the little market advisor. I think today we have excellent technology for the high network advisor, I am seeing these large teams. So, that difference has been a big differentiator in the influence also. So, I'd say it's a lot of the same with some additional tools that's made the difference to bring people over.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Andrew Del Medico with Autonomous.","Andrew Del Medico","You mentioned the two discussions around level fees at the advisor and the firm level, is the way you guys read the rule currently, do you see that's being [indiscernible] at the firm level or the advisor level?","Jeff Julien","No, it's a certainly the way that rule was written, was arguably above. I think the clarification is it wasn't meant to be as constraining and we don't know the answer yet, until we see the revised rule, so I would say that the deal well has a had a lot of meetings and discussions with us, but the fear was that it would apply to both four IRA accounts.","Andrew Del Medico","And I guess, if it doesn't change -- how would that impact on some -- that you mentioned a lot of the revenue streams that you see with the mutual funds, on how that impacts that and I guess are there any offsets you could use the way you sell to clients etc. on to regain those?","Jeff Julien","Yes, I think what it would have to be -- funds are also very concerned. I mean this wasn't a broker dealer versus funds, both sides were against us and I think that what you're going to see are new product classes and from our internal asset management from funds that meet the requirements for IRA. So, it would I'll call a little bit of retooling for both sides in order to meet the strict definition which could be done, it won't apply to all their products but the products [sold to] IRA accounts. But that remains to be seen, we understand that from our discussions that that's going to be lessened and not be an issue or as much of an issue but I can't tell you until we see it.","Operator","Thank you. And at this time, I'm not showing any further questions.","Jeff Julien","Well, great. I know it's a lot going on especially at year end and a volatile quarter in the marketplace but net net we think we've got a very solid year and a good quarter given the market and we -- the most important thing as our advisors are growing, our loans are growing, assets were down, but that's really a markets phenomenon for the most part and we're very confident that with any kind of reasonable market that we'll continue to leverage this platform and with a great work of the great advisors to keep the culture here up. I'm very positive so, that's to your time, we really appreciate your interest and we'll talk to you next quarter. Thanks Terese.","Operator","You're welcome. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining today's conference. I thank you for your participation that does conclude the conference, you may now disconnect.

My name is Desean and I will be your conference facilitator today. (Operator Instructions). Now I will turn the call over to Mr. Paul Shoukry Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations at Raymond James Financial.","Paul Shoukry","Good morning. First on behalf of our entire management team just want to thank all of you for joining this morning for fiscal third quarter 2014 earnings call. We certainly do appreciate your time and interest in Raymond James Financial, so thank you. After I read the following disclosure I will turn the call over to Paul Reilly, our Chief Executive Officer and Jeff Julien, our Chief Financial Officer. Following their prepared remarks they will ask the operator to open the line for questions.","Certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements.

Paul?","Paul Reilly","","Thanks Paul. Good morning everyone. Jeff and I and Steve Raney actually are calling you from the beautiful city of Asheville. We have our Summer Development Conference which is the conference for our traditional top advisors, our employee advisors and if you don\u2019t think it's a unique event, us and the advisors and the 700 kids are here Aqualand [ph], I think it's a testament to our family culture that we still have not just spouses and others but also children attending the event. We just finished the Summer Conference for Independent Contractors Conference in Washington, D.C. and again it was fantastic with 2000 people also.","I will now provide a brief overview of our results and Jeff will give you a little more of detail. We achieved many new records in this quarter, net revenue of 1.2 billion, net income of a 122.7 million, earnings per diluted share of $0.85 and client assets under administration of 479 billion all records for us.","Our largest segment, the private client group generated record revenues pretax income this quarter also. So there is a lot to be proud of. However this quarter also benefited from certain favorable items that don\u2019t necessary recur every quarter. The major ones we highlighted were the $8 million in private equity of valuation adjustments and exceptionally strong quarter for tax credit funds the business that tends to be lumpy but having a very good year and a continual beneficial tax rate.","You guys can do the math but even without those numbers we had a very solid operating quarter. Just as we said in the last quarter\u2019s earnings we had many items going against us, we think it's more valuable to look at the three quarters of fiscal year in aggregate to evaluate our performance and quarter-by-quarter because of the noise inherent in any quarter. If you do that you will see we generated a 15% pretax margin on net revenue and delivered 11.9 annualized rate of return against the 12% ROE target in this current interest environment. We think with interest rate changes we told you that the 15% targets in range we get a 100 basis point rise where we get the majority of our benefit in short term interest rates, overnight interest rates which should give us another about a 150 million per year in pretax income.","Meanwhile we think the 12% ROE is very reasonable compared to other firms in our industry especially considering our very conservative capital position, a total capital to risk weighted assets ratio of over 20%. So going back to this quarter we generated record net revenue of 1.2 billion, up 9% compared to last year\u2019s June and 3% over the preceding quarter. Record net income of a 123 million, 46% over the GAAP results in June\u2019s quarter and 33% over the non-GAAP results of last year\u2019s June which did include some adjustments related to expenses associated with the Morgan Keegan acquisition.","So a quick view by segment, the private client group segment generated record revenues and pretax income as I\u2019ve said driven by record levels of assets under administration which reached 454 million client assets under administration. 454 billion in the segment. Net revenues of a 187 million grew 10% over a year ago, June quarter and 1% over the preceding quarter. The revenue growth has really being led by a growth in assets and fee based account in the private client group which now accounts for 37% of our client assets in that segment as equity and fixed income activity in the segment remains tough [ph].","Despite the rising equity markets we think that many clients are still waiting on the sidelines although our average cash balances even to our historic mean per client are down. Those shows that the advantage of our recurring revenues now has reached 70% of total revenues this segment. Another thing we\u2019re very proud of is that the advisor front, we continue to be extremely effective in retaining and recruiting the highest quality advisors. During the quarter we added 49 new net advisors growing our total count to 6251.","Activity levels which we measure by home offices it's a leading indicator for recruiting are still robust. We expect the trend to continue as deals -- retention deals from other firms till the financial crisis burn off.","I also have to talk about the profitability of these segments since pretax income of 81.5 million grew 39% over last year\u2019s June quarter and reached a new record. The segment is benefited from operating leverage and discipline expense management which has enabled us to hit our 10% pretax margin on net revenue for the quarter sooner than expected. We previously had told you by the end of the fourth quarter.","I know that sometimes people get confused on our pre-margin target of 7% it seems much lower than our competitors but then Dennis [ph] explained at our Analyst Day, almost all of it\u2019s a trigger to just different economic -- not the economic measure but how we count the beans. So for example most of our peers would include their bank earnings in their segment. Raymond James Bank is not included in our private client group nor is our asset management which is accounted for separately.","Now turning to capital market segment we generated net revenue of 237 million and pretax income of 28 million for the quarter representing 11.8% pretax margin. That\u2019s below our 15% target but given the fixed income environment with head winds and the trading activity which is being tapped in the equity capital markets. We don\u2019t expect much improvement in the short term until -- especially in fixed income we need rising rates and\/or interest rate volatility to really generate more activity there.","On the equity capital markets division underwriting revenues grew 24% on year-on-year basis and 17% sequentially. A lot of that is driven by Canada but really offset by weaker M&A markets in the segment for us in this quarter. The M&A activity was softer than last quarter although our backlog still appears very strong and building.","It's really the same story this quarter for our fixed income division, low interest rates and low volatility continue to drag on commissions were down 22% from last year\u2019s June quarter.","So I don\u2019t expect much upside in the short term for fixed income again until rates start to move. Probably the big surprise to many was the number in capital markets for our tax credit fund business. It is a lump business as syndication fees increased by more than $10 million over the preceding quarter but you know we account before this deals close and we just had a good closing quarter especially in the month of June.","The asset management segment continues to benefit from record levels of assets under management, we reached a record of 65.3 billion this quarter, an impressive 25% over last year. Net revenues of 91 million grew 19% over the prior year and pretax of 31.3 million grew 31% over the prior year. This business should continue to perform well because of net inflows partly of the market but also because it's a strong private client group recruiting.","Raymond James Bank, it's going to generate strong results. Total net loans of 10.4 billion, grew 19% over prior year and 3% over the preceding quarter driven by growth in the C&I and securities based loan portfolios. Compared to the preceding quarter, the bank\u2019s net interest income in the quarter was almost completely offset by higher loan loss provisions which is due to grow not the issues. I know a lot of you are concerned about the OCCs annual review of our Shared National Credit Portfolio and you can see by the release that we had very good results. The review reinforced that the vast majority of our loans were in great condition and we had additional provision expense of 1.6 million compared to 5.6 million in the prior year.","The bank also experienced a few positive items this quarter, (indiscernible) pretax results by about $8 million which Jeff will explain in a little more detail. So with that overview of the segments I\u2019m going to let Jeff get into some details into the line items. Jeff?","Jeff Julien","Thanks Paul. I know that we typically talk about segments but all of you do models and we report obviously in line items on the P&L. So sometimes it's a little difficult to translate the segment info into the line item. So I thought this time we would -- I would walk down some of the line items as they deferred from the -- what we put together which is a consensus of your models those of you who that are the kind of not to supply them -- we actually do a consensus by line item so we can see where we\u2019re not giving enough guidance or color and then we can help explain some of the differences. By the way I guess we\u2019re doing pretty well at it because about half the line items are within a $1 million of the consensus to actual. So we seem to be doing something pretty much right.","Running down the line items quickly, securities commissions and fees are -- we are pretty much right online and you\u2019ve the detail in the press release on page nine and you can see it's the usual mixture that we have had so far this year which has been a steady improvement in private client group offset by some more difficult times in the capital markets commissions and this trended during the monthly operating specific releases, so no big difference there. Investment banking line, we did better than year consensus projections. As Paul mentioned it's primarily driven by the Raymond James tax credit fund syndication business $10 million swing from last quarter to this quarter.","Excluding that investment banking revenues were pretty flat maybe down slightly which again on page nine is detailed where you can see underwriting revenues up and M&A actually down slightly from last quarter. Investment advisory fees didn\u2019t -- we came in below your expectations. One of the things I guess we didn\u2019t do very well at because we didn\u2019t mention it last quarter is if there was a couple of million dollar performance fee in Canada that came in the March quarter that was -- came in and then -- a bunch of it was paid out as subadvisory fees. Couple of million dollars total. So it was kind of an in and out on both sides of the P&L but that distorted last quarter a little bit. We spent most of the time last quarter talking about the difference because of the performance fee in the December quarter but this factor obviously makes the difference in looking at June to March. So we\u2019re taking that couple million dollars out that -- annual fee.","It was more in-line both on the revenue and the subadvisory expense side. Interest we were just slightly below projections. Paul mentioned client cash balances, actually -- versus a year ago our cash balances are up about 75 million -- sorry our total client assets are up about $75 billion but our cash balances are actually lower than they were a year ago. They were 8.4% of assets a year ago, they are down to 7.1% now. So clients are certainly a little more invested in lease holding less cash here or in short term cash equivalent such as CDs or very short term bonds and other things for the time being.","Account and service fees were pretty much in-line trading, Paul already addressed. In the other revenue line we did better, obviously driven by the private equity valuations and other factor in there compared to last quarter at least is one of the (indiscernible) items at the bank that drove their gain and there were really two items at the bank level while net interest -- a net interest improvement of 3 million was roughly offset by a $3 million higher provision for loan losses. There were two items that\u2019s changed quarter-to-quarter that has caused the bank to have a pretty dramatic improvement.","One was in the March quarter, there was a foreign exchange loss and in this quarter there was a foreign exchange gain. We still hold $30 million to $40 million of loans in the U.S. bank that are dominated in Canadian dollars that we so far have not hedged, so that\u2019s been a little bit of a volatile item but from quarter-to-quarter about a $4 million swing and the other item that\u2019s in there has to do with a charge and a liability related to unfunded loan commitments which is not part of the provision in loan loss reserve but it is part of the P&L as a charge and it's in other liability account.","There was one particularly large item that was a special mentioned credit that still was not in covenant violation and we had taken a bigger charge in March related to the potential of them drawing on that line and us having to take a reserve provision at that time, turns out that loan either we are no longer are in that credit. We sold that loan out in the June quarter, it was about a 1.7 million charge in March and we reversed that in June. So that\u2019s about $3.5 million. So those two items make up the vast majority of the bank\u2019s swing. But going back to line items the foreign exchange part and also the reversal discredit charge are in this other revenue line. I\u2019m sorry the reversal charge and other expense, my apologies.","On the expense side compensation, we\u2019re pretty much in-line with everybody\u2019s expectations a little higher maybe because of revenues were higher and we did achieve the 68% comp ratio for the quarter but I guess people can say while it was only because of some of these extraneous revenue factors like proprietary capital and things like that. So we probably on an operating basis weren\u2019t quite there but we still have that as our objective for our run-rate in the fourth quarter to get to that 68% total comp ratio, we\u2019re getting very, very close.","Data comp you remember last quarter we talked about some seasonal factors such as the mailing of 1099s in that an unusual item which was a move to a new data center in Denver. Most of you had adjusted that correctly and it actually came in a little better than your projections and probably our expectations as well. We had some projections wrap up early in the quarter so we got ended some of the consulting agreements and things but my guess is those will be replaced with other projects going forward. So I would say we\u2019re still kind of guiding for the mid-60s per quarter on that which is where you had us this quarter.","Occupancy clearance and flow [ph] brokerage business development were all right in line with year consensus. Investment subadvisory fees I talked about the loan loss provision we talked about, now we\u2019re down just to other expense which a lot of which is and there is a detail of this of course of page nine in the press release as well. It has to do with the consolidated tax credit partnerships, a lot of those losses come in there every quarter now it's not a once a year thing, we\u2019re going to have a number like that in our expenses most of which comes out through non-controlling interest which is another line item that was pretty fair off from where the consensus chart was.","So you can see that was about almost all the $12 million expense from these partnerships came out through non-controlling interest.","The tax rate -- I know we have been guiding you a little higher than it's been because we don\u2019t typically project a 5% a quarter market increase. We have been experiencing that and so we have been benefiting from the corporate owned life insurance appreciation that\u2019s a non-taxable gain to us. So in a rising market perhaps you could if you want to be precise back to that a little bit into the tax rate. It's been about a 1% - 1.25% boast to us so far in the tax rate this year, it's running about $7 million a quarter. We got about $200 million in corporate owned life insurance, it's not all in equities. So it's not all impacted by that but it's been about 7 million a quarters so far this year.","A couple of other things I will point out, we\u2019re frequently asked about the asset mix. We have seen a shift from a year ago. Equities were a little under half of our client positions a year ago, they are up to about 53% now and that\u2019s 5 percentage point increase came about 4% on a fixed income and 1% out of cash as I mentioned earlier. I would also like to point out that our firm wide recurring revenues for the quarter were over 62%, for the year-to-date they are 61% and so we\u2019re nicely over that 60% plateau. I\u2019m not sure if I would say we like to stay -- we would like to grow it or not because if it shrinks back under 50 it's because we had a whole lot of transactional revenues and that\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing if there is a really active trading environment or investment banking environment.","And lastly I just point out that it was nice to see our shareholders equity top to $4 billion mark for the first time.","With those comments I will turn it back to Paul.","Paul Reilly","Thanks Jeff and just wanted to make a few comments before I open it up for questions. First maybe the preempt question I know will come on kind of our targets. I think once as I have said earlier we think that 15% margin and the 12% ROE targets are good targets for now in this operating environment. Certainly we\u2019re affected by the market. People have been waiting for market correction for a while and it may or may not come and for us it depends when it comes, if it comes in the middle of a quarter and rebounds it doesn\u2019t have a lot of impact, it's on quarter end and it has more impact.","But we\u2019re well positioned and we think these targets are good targets given this interest rate environment, until interest rates move I guess if they move. We\u2019re maintaining kind of that outlook. Our private client group business is really been doing extremely well, I\u2019m proud not just for the recruiting but more importantly the retention. We\u2019re getting great retention coming from both of these conferences, the spirit of our advisors are very, very high and a part of it is the market is good, people are happy but a lot of it is -- they are very happy with all our investments in technology and our continued high level support people just believe the firm is really helping them with their business which is kind of our model.","We believe that that\u2019s kind of our unique position that we have advisors continue to move to what we call independence and whether they are independent or the employee channel we give our advisors a lot of freedom to practice business the way they want within our guidelines and as deals on the wire houses [ph] tend to burn off and our recruiting pipeline stays very robust. So we expect this recruiting continues to grow, and in the decent market that -- the private client group business should do very, very well.","The capital markets business is kind of the tail on the other side that certainly over the (indiscernible) commissions challenged across the industry. We have been in underwriting certainly you know one of the segments that we\u2019re really strong and do well, we do well. When the segments we don\u2019t participate and do well we don\u2019t participate as much which I would say has been in the last quarter or two. We have had good syndicate activity but not high this quarter what I call lead activity. Although July has been so far a good month.","Fixed income, like I say you know I got an A franchise, I would say an A plus franchise operating in a D market until volatility and rates move, they are doing a good job of double-digit margins and really one of the toughest markets you could have. So I\u2019m proud of what they have done and our public finance service we have actually continued to look to recruit in this tough down market as we are solidly in the Top 10, I think we\u2019re number eight year-to-date in the lead tables in our public finance. I\u2019m proud of that group.","Asset management, because of inflows partly because of the recruiting and the market increase our year should be pretty well set, they should have another good quarter since a lot of their assets are already built in advance. So they should have another solid quarter. And the banks continue to perform well. The challenge for us is we have been very clear to the bank. If you can find loans that need our conservative underwriting standards that are reasonable yield continue to grow and if you can\u2019t don\u2019t make loans, and they have been very good so far in finding good credits that meet our standards. And this market is unpredictable but the banks have done a great job.","So overall we\u2019re in a good position. Proud of what we have done, I think this quarter I would characterize as not as good as it looks but very good, where last quarter we told you it was better than it looked and I think the average if you look at nine months running. So I think if you look at our first nine months operating and average it out you can see that -- I think that\u2019s our operating level and feel very, very comfortable about where we\u2019re.","So with that operator I would like to open it up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Chris Harris from Wells Fargo.","Chris Harris - Wells Fargo","Great quarter for recruiting, you kind of talked about that a little bit. Just wondering Paul, you guys are getting the benefit of some of these legacy retention bonuses rolling off, based on your conversations, based on the flow you\u2019re seeing how long do you expect that trend to kind of persist. Is this something that could go on for quite a long while or is this maybe something that might be just kind of a quarter or two benefit?","Paul Reilly","Remember what Tom said and Tom is the master of phrases and openings. So when recruiting close down we just wait for some of the big competitors to do something else stupid which does makes sense for them but sometimes the advisors don\u2019t like what they do is the institutionalization of their business but banks tend to look at doing more products direct, relationships direct, we seem to get the benefit also. So I think there is an awful lot of people still because the merger activity is pretty fresh that grew up in firms like ours that don\u2019t like that kind of operating environment that tend to become and I\u2019m sure the big banks own firms from their strategy it makes sense because they are trying to institutionalize and maybe overtime they will get the advisors that fit their business and their business model but I think we will continue to be the beneficiaries for a fairly decent period of time here.","Jeff Julien","I think that\u2019s probably caused a little bit of a way generally when the markets are as good as they have been lately, you don\u2019t see a lot of movement. So that\u2019s probably what\u2019s driving some of that but as the markets ever do slowdown that just shows that what the potential is here because we\u2019re really in a pretty sweet spot. I have been talking to a lot of managers and regional managers here at this conference and they say it's just a little bit out of the ordinary, how many incoming calls we\u2019re getting from people because they like the story, they like the stability, they like that we\u2019re a private client group focused firm, they like to own their book. You know they like all the things that we have talked about as our differentiating features and I think that is sustainable the market environment and all is what\u2019s going to change.","Paul Reilly","And the other thing is that if you look at our record year results \u201909 and we were just kind of a haven. We were the firm out of the news and a terrible market, right? So this has been a very, very good market for advisors. So to get this kind of flow, most advisors don\u2019t want to upset their business when it's doing very, very well. I think it's just showing that there are lot of people searching a platform like ours.","Chris Harris - Wells Fargo","","Maybe just if I can ask a follow-up question or two on margins and I appreciate you guys already gave us a lot of color there. As it relates to the bank Jeff, you called out a few items. Is it safe to assume then that under reasonable set of circumstances that the bank margin might drift back down from the level we\u2019re at now and any comment you could maybe give us about potentially extra cost you guys might have to absorb when your bank trips to $10 billion asset threshold?","Steve Raney","We\u2019re over 10 billion now. We\u2019re actually over 12 billion and subject to all of the regulatory changes once we go over that 10 billion. So that\u2019s really in effect now but we have I would say over the last few years added to compliance and audit and oversight, you being some of those regulatory changes but it's not a material difference at the bank. It's clearly inside our Raymond James Financial, we have had to add expenses being a bank holding company. We have added two risk management in that enterprise as well. So but really I would say in general a lot of those expenses are already kind of in our numbers over the last couple of years. In terms of net interest margins we continue to see some pressure on margins and as Paul indicated we\u2019re not under any pressure to grow loans just for the sake of growing loans and we have been even more selective on credits particularly it's not meeting our return hurdle.","That said as we provided our comments in the past I would expect some slight net interest margin compression to continue over the next few quarters. It was down a 9 basis points this last quarter. I would say the bulk of that is in our corporate lending area, most of the other areas there maybe some slight deterioration in net interest margin but it's primarily in our corporate lending and commercial real estate book. But frankly we\u2019re just passing on deals where we don\u2019t think that the net interest spread that we\u2019re being offered is commensurate with the type of credit they were extending.","Paul Reilly","So my only add to that is that in looking at the new production we\u2019re not really doing much new production at rates that would compress this what\u2019s happening is even if the new production is at steady rates or steady spreads, the fact is that older loans are what are running off or are being refinanced. So you still have -- that's what is driving it down. It's not the new production coming out of lower and lower rates going forward.","Steve Raney","I would mention, we shared a line item in our numbers, our supplemental information on the bank that I have mentioned to you in the past but we have gotten into the tax lending business. The net interest margins are actually on a tax equivalent basis, are actually a little bit higher but without the tax adjustment that will potentially have a negative impact on our net interest margin. That business is just under a $100 million and outstanding as of the end of June. So it's still relatively small but a growing part of the bank now.","Chris Harris - Wells Fargo","Steve if I can maybe get you to kind of identity a number for us or maybe a range what would you say that the bottoming of the NIM, what that number might look like assuming kind of rates don\u2019t change from here?","Steve Raney","We have been provided some guidance I would say maybe over the course of next couple of quarters, maybe another 15 to 20 basis points.","Jeff Julien ","I would say 270 (multiple speakers). We don\u2019t have any economics to support that.","Paul Reilly","So far we have been able to use loan growth offsetting NIM compression to keep earnings flat. We don\u2019t know -- our production has been good.","Steve Raney","Yes it's interesting. They are embedded in the net interest margin, it's fee recognition. The March quarter for example we had an exponentially high fee recognition quarter where loans were paying off where we had unamortized fees that we took into income that actually kind of artificially inflated net interest margin in the March quarter relative to the June quarter. So that can contribute a couple of basis points. But as Jeff said I think -- you kind of bottoming it out 270 or maybe even little bit higher than that is probably a reasonable number for us to expect over the next few quarters.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steven Chubak with Nomura.","Steven Chubak \u2013 Nomura","So Steve, I think I\u2019m not ready to let you off the hook just yet. I do have a follow-up question on expectations from loan growth and what I\u2019m trying to do is reconcile -- some of the comments you had made in actually the last monthly metrics release highlighting a reduced level of -- or increased risk aversion within the commercial or C&I space given the deals that were coming across and I wanted to -- I just wanted to understand what our expectation should be for loan growth particularly within that channel going forward and maybe if you can give some context on the other channels as well, that will be really helpful.","Paul Reilly","Every time we give you guidance on loan growth, it goes the other way. So Steven -- going down. It's so hard to get visibility and we look credit by credit; so with that it's just -- I wish we could give you guidance but it's basically on the flow. If we like the loans we will participate. If we don\u2019t, we don\u2019t. So go ahead Steve.","Steve Raney","I was -- up that we diversified the business over the last few years. As you know we are doing business in Canada. That business is growing actually a little bit more rapidly than our U.S. business. I mentioned the tax exempt business, the business that we weren\u2019t in six months ago that we\u2019re now in. We do some project finance infrastructure type lending. Obviously we have got a commercial real estate business as well that we have selectively grown. So we have got a lot of different businesses and obviously a lot of different industries inside of our peer commercial and industrial portfolio, energy, healthcare, technology, consumer, a variety of different industry. So in those businesses they don\u2019t all run the same and they are -- some of them are counter cyclical with each other and we have been able to pick and choose across this broad spectrum.","We have been able to grow the C&I book, we have got the tax exempt business now growing. Growing our residential business and our securities based lending business will go through a $1 billion and outstanding this quarter. So we have got a lot of different businesses that can contribute to being able to selectively grow. As you saw we grew loans 3% this last quarter. I think that growth in the 2% to 3% range per quarter is an achievable number given that all of our businesses that we\u2019re in. But as Paul mentioned if -- in one or two quarters if there not enough deal flow that we liked, it's in our sweet spot from a credit selection standpoint then we can run flat or shrink the bank potentially.","Steven Chubak \u2013 Nomura","Okay. Then moving over to the expense side of the bank. It's a follow-up to one of Chris\u2019s question\u2019s. If excluding the provision we actually saw the core expense come down \u2013 it's pretty meaningfully to 24 million versus 28 million last quarter and I just want to get a sense as to whether there is an seasonality that\u2019s driving that decline and it seems as though you have already invested in terms of regulatory and compliance or have made the necessary investment. So how should we think about that expense run-rate going forward from a modeling perspective.","Steve Raney","I know Jeff mentioned before the foreign exchange as well as the other revenue --","Steven Chubak \u2013 Nomura","I guess just on the expense side.","Steve Raney ","Yes I mean we have --","Jeff Julien","That provision for the --","Steve Raney","The unfunded -- that was a big number, it was almost $4 million change right there in terms of our unfunded commitments. We have a reserve for unfunded commitments, the unfunded portion of lines of credit. We have a credit size loan that actually we exited in the June quarter so in effect released unfunded reserves that had a material impact to that line item. So our true expense run-rate is relatively stable. There is no seasonality to it.","Paul Reilly","But the trough is probably in between the last two quarters or maybe trending a little more towards the March quarter actually.","Steven Chubak \u2013 Nomura","And I guess switching gears and moving over the investment banking side. the business that show growth in the quarter, the pace of growth has wide [ph] some of the results that we have seen at your bulge bracket [ph] peer and looking at the M&A business specifically and maybe taking Paul\u2019s comment and constructive comments I should say on the M&A backlog into consideration here. It does appear as though that the recent M&A surge has been concentrated in larger deals and I wanted to see if this is potentially limiting your participation in the recovery that we\u2019re seeing.","Paul Reilly ","I think two areas, in the banking areas our flagship practices historically have been reach downstream energy because of the MLP business. Healthcare, bull markets and bioscience or industrial or stuff we don\u2019t compete as much because those aren\u2019t our strongest spots and we\u2019re building out some space in consumer and others right now. So on the banking side when banking activity in our sectors do well we outperform and when they are in the other sectors we probably underperform the market just because that\u2019s not our sweet spot and the same on M&A. I think our M&A backlog is good but you\u2019re right on -- the headline numbers are very, very big or very big deals and they tend to hit the money centered banks and the very, very large M&A firms.","So as those big deals headlines come or market share is going to be down because we don\u2019t participate in those.","Steven Chubak \u2013 Nomura","And then just one final one from me on the trading profits line. I suppose given the subdued volatility we have seen in fixed income markets, the revenue stream there has actually been quite resilient and I argue it's really back to trend that we have seen at some of your larger peers and I was hoping you could explain the factors that are driving that resilience. I would have expected that higher volatility backdrop would in fact be better for that business but we have also seen some favorable inventory marks particularly in the month of June and want to get a better sense of -- maybe whether that provides some incremental support.","Paul Reilly","I would say there are few things happening and which is, we -- part of the acquisition strategy of Morgan-Keegan was that we had a good fixed income department -- we had a great fixed income department and I will tell you they are better than we thought. The inventory -- the reason we can get still good trading profits on our inventories because it just turns and that the profits are just little pieces of lots of transactions. They have a very good sales force. We don\u2019t keep inventory long and all, we turn it rapidly and it's just a very, very good management and sure you know rates come in a little bit and we make more money because whatever we\u2019re holding is more valuable but we do hedge a lot of the pieces of it. When hedges work without big movements in certain areas and so they continue to consistently perform and rates come in on some months it does better but they have consistently every month, the exception was last June, a year ago when everyone got it and everyone -- we did a lot less and traditionally carried bigger inventories than our competitors.","They just do a good job of turning it, hedging it, moving it and it's been pretty consistent. It's been consistent for a number of quarters but that\u2019s what I say we have an A franchise in a D market. I don\u2019t see in the short term that changing much. Now if we get steep rise in rates that will probably hurt us.","Jeff Julien","If the commission volume grows in the institutional fixed income side you will see trading profits grow with it as there will be more transactions.","Paul Reilly","And we just don\u2019t like this gradual growth, and if it steep rises we can get a hurt a little bit inventory valuation but it's well managed and I think well hedged and they just do a good job.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.","Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research","I just want to follow-up on you mentioned the capital ratio is improving and I know you talked about it in your Investor Day about looking at both on acquisitions and asset management. Do you have any color? Do you see any opportunities out there? Or is it still? You haven't really seen a deal? Are you struggling to find acquisitions? Just want to get a sense of if you feel I guess more optimistic or less about the prospects of adding on to the asset management business or other acquisitions?","Paul Reilly","Yes. I would say the acquisition areas we have highlighted are both asset management and M&A opportunities both in North America and Europe. I would say I\u2019m more optimistic and I think it's a market where there are a lot of people in businesses that we like that are willing to talk but it's hard to handicap. We have a screen on culture and we have found people with the right culture but a lot of those cultures are independent and typically independent firms don\u2019t trade. So it's a longer term process, so discussions are good and if we get the right firm who is willing to join us and join the team we will do something. If we can\u2019t you know -- it is very lumpy.","So I would say I\u2019m more optimistic just because there is more activity and I\u2019m more optimistic but I can\u2019t give you any guidance or probability or timing.","Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research","And maybe just on the wealth management side, it appears like if I can back into some numbers that flows in your fee based assets continue to be very strong and can you just help me think through is that a conscious effort on your part to move more assets into fee based versus more traditional commission based or is that just more of a demand from your client base, it's that\u2019s where they are putting their money into more and more into the fee based account. So just want to make sure I know if it's sort of push or pull on that front.","Paul Reilly","Yes we don\u2019t, with our FAs we let them choose the kind of business but I would say a lot of it is driven by the recruiting that we tend to -- a lot of the big teams that we recruit tend to be more fee based and it's interesting that before we got a $1 million team that was a big deal now, we are talking to $5 million and $6 million teams and a lot of those tend to be fee based businesses. So I think that\u2019s driving a lot of the numbers. We see a lot of the more traditional Morgan-Keegan advisors also who are more transaction based slowly moving to little more fee based, that\u2019s helped some in those numbers but I think a lot of it's driven by recruiting.","Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research","And with the recruiting, seems like you\u2019re being flat for about the last year, you ticked up about 1% in net asset advisors outstanding. What sort of the -- how long does it take to sort of get them ramped up once they come on. Is it pretty immediate? Is it a couple of quarters until you see the full impact of the new hires, just want to get a sense of the timing?","Paul Reilly","We say the full book is over a year so the first two quarters I think a good chunk of the book moves over. So a couple of quarters to get a bulk of it maybe a year to get them back up and running. So that\u2019s not the lead time, so that should continue to drive results.","Operator","Your next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alex Blostein - Goldman Sachs","First question I guess on the retail business, clearly you guys are retention levels are good and asset gathering is very strong. I was wondering if you can comment on the retail activity trends in the quarter at all because it looks like when you look at just the PCG Commissions, They were up about 1% sequentially presumably majority of that is endured just higher market values and higher asset values. So can you talk a little bit I guess about the level of activity within the channel?","Paul Reilly","I think the results are driven partly kind of recruiting in the market but the truth is that the transaction level is down just like it is in fixed income and ECM over the (indiscernible). So if you look at the whole market transaction business is down, it was true in PCG. So the 1% growth was net so the fee based business was actually up and it was brought down by lower transactional business. So this environment I think our competitors that are more transactional based will have lower results just because the activity in the market is down and our model has been continues to perform in this environment.","Alex Blostein - Goldman Sachs","And I guess at the Investor Day you guys pointed out the fact that the amount of retail cash or so in side lines, it's quite low towards the low end in historical ranges and it's the same kind of dynamic we have seen with some of the other retail -- brokers. Do you see that drawn down still happening over the course of the quarter or do you think we have kind of dropped out and those will be more challenging to find kind of incremental dollars for retail investors to sort of put to work?","Paul Reilly","If you look at the shifts, the shift has been two equities. We have had a pretty good shift to equity really over the last year. A lot of it is out of fixed income and as Jeff mentioned it's some out of cash. I think there is more activity because it's hard to tell in our numbers but I think cash is down, it's steeper or tighter earnings 1 or 0 bps wherever they were and I\u2019m not sure all that money, part of the equity growth has been the market growth so the share changes. I think people are just putting using short term bond funds and other vehicles. I can\u2019t prove it. The part money because I want more of a yield. So, I can\u2019t tell how much -- there has certainly been some move to equities but I\u2019m sure if it's dramatic as it looks and I\u2019m not sure if the drop in cash is as dramatic as it looks.","And this is the problem with -- anytime somebody fixes something in an environment and escapes the government and interest rates you get all sorts of behaviors that are hard to figure out. So the rate protection comes off and you see the market normalize. So a good question, but it's difficult to answer accurately.","Alex Blostein - Goldman Sachs","The last one for me is just I want to follow-up on Steve\u2019s question around the fixed income trading, the way I\u2019m trying to guess characterize it is we have been in a -- to your point a D type of environment in fixed income trading for quite some time. You guys are not alone at it, your fixed income commissions have been kind of like in the low $60 run-rate for the last fourth quarters or so. I was wondering if you were just to think about no inventory marks, no big changes in interest rates, is this effectively kind of like the trough level of activity that we could expect. If you just kind of show up and turn the lights on like that\u2019s kind of the amount of run-rate revenue you think the business is capable of generating without the environment getting better?","Paul Reilly","Yes we hope so. First our guys work really hard, so we just turn the lights on. They work hard to generate that and work hard to keep the relationships and I think whereas the trough, we have thought so for a couple of quarters but it's going down a little bit. You know we get some really good days and then it flattens back out. So I think we\u2019re at this run-rate level until something happens in the market. I don\u2019t think it will deteriorate much from here. I think we\u2019re probably at a trough level. I already hate to say that because something happens that you don\u2019t anticipate but I think this has been a tough environment, they are doing good job and I think this is kind of the run-rate so if something happens in the commission.","Operator","At this time there are no further questions.","Paul Reilly","Okay. Well thanks very much. I think in summary we\u2019re very pleased with the operating results of the quarter. I think it shows strong underlying businesses especially crowded [ph] dynamics in the private client group and I know that sometimes due to last year people said, well, where is the results? We\u2019re kind of low steady long term producer and I think it's showing up in private client group and as the management, of course we\u2019re subject to market fluctuations like anything but I think our model is strong. Hopefully we will get some rate movement which I think will help both -- will help all the capital markets business and activity flows but feel good about where we\u2019re going. We\u2019re well positioned and we will continue chugging along. So appreciate your time this morning and we will talk to you soon.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen this concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect."],"18184":["Raymond James Financial, Inc. (NYSE:RJF) Q2 2014 Earnings Conference Call April 24, 2014  8:15 AM ET","Executives","Tom James - Chairman","Paul Reilly - CEO","Jeff Julien - EVP, Finance and CFO","Steve Raney - President, CEO, Raymond James Bank, N.A.","Analysts","Steven Chubak - Nomura","Joel Jeffrey - KBW","Devin Ryan - JMP Securities","Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research","Alex Blostein - Goldman Sachs","Paul Reilly","[Call Starts Abruptly]","..that went our way and Jeff will remind us of a few in a minute. This quarter, we think we had very strong operational metrics. But, we have had another factors going against us this quarter. We had three fewer trading days, few fewer calendar days which effected interest and numerous branch closings. You have to remember our concentrations in the Southeast and then the Midwest; we had a lot of branch closings due to weather. The transaction-based businesses were a little slower M&A was off, although not a horrible quarter.","Tax credit funds was low, but that is a win deals close, good backlog, public finance has been challenging the whole market with new issuances. On the expense side, Jeff, I will leave those for Jeff whether its FICA, our data center move, which was planned, but over budget, but it was very successful had an impact, TV advertising and other expenses actually weighted down the quarter and some of these are seasonal, some of these are unique events.","If you look at this quarter versus last quarter last year or the first two quarters, our first six months combined versus the first two quarters of last year, revenue was up 3% or 6% respectively, but net income was up 31% to 33% on a GAAP basis. So we believe the \u2013 we are in good position, the average of the two quarters has really been more indicative of our operational run rate for the first half of this year.","Going forward, we have record client assets under administration of $458 billion record assets under management of $62 million. Our bank loans crossed $10 billion record advisor productivity and advisor count is growing with good backlog. We think we are in good position.","By segment quickly, and I will let Jeff get into the details after this and I will give you a little outlook. The private client group had excellent results especially with the weather and trading days, record net revenue of $812.2 million up 12% over prior year and 5% over the preceding quarter, record pre-tax is $77.1 million, 44% over last year, 8% over the preceding quarter very good results again with record private client assets under administration of $434 billion, average productivity up, advisor count up 24, everything very, very solid quarter, the private client group [is well-positioned] (ph).","The capital markets business net revenue of $224.4 million really flat from a year ago and down 7% sequentially, pre-tax $165.5 million up 20 \u2013 I'm sorry about \u2013 up 26% year-over-year down 8% sequentially. ECM had a good underwriting quarter with revenue up 16% in the preceding quarter, up 19% from the preceding quarter. M&A was softer, now was softer than a good December quarter which was softer than a great previous September quarter, but it wasn't a bad quarter.","Backlog still looks good in that business and again, timing is important in terms of when deal closes. And if you look at the backlog we feel the M&A business which was \u2013 we had a very good year last year probably will be up this year. Institutional commissions were flat.","Probably the most challenged business because of the market is fixed income, commissions continued to be challenging down slightly this quarter. We continue to have very solid trading profit. They have done a good job with good risk management of generating trading profits for us.","Public finance although the \u2013 we are up slightly and new issuances is just down and it's a tough market. So as long as the low interest rate environment hangs around the public finance market \u2013 the segment will be challenged, but we have a great franchise, it\u2019s well-positioned. So I think we are performing well given the market.","Asset management with net revenues of $87.5 million up 26% year-over-year down 9% sequentially because of the performance fee last quarter. Pre-tax was $29.9 million up 43% year-over-year down 6% sequentially, but up if you factor out the performance fee from last quarter. Again, with record assets under administration of $62 billion up 22% year-over-year, 3% sequentially very good performance very strong inflows and we are well-positioned.","The banks, I know we get a lot of questions, I will just make some general comments, great growth, production was about the same but payoffs were slower this last quarter. Looks like the rate compression is slowing down which has been a challenge hopefully we are near the bottom.","Credit quality improved so the provision was low due to group credit quality both due to payoffs and we fold some loans. So we are \u2013 really the credit quality is really very, very strong there.","So with that that's kind of the overview of the highlights for the quarter, I'm going to turn it over to Jeff and I will close it up with little outlook by segments. Jeff?","Jeff Julien","Thanks, Paul.","My walk around our segments really is that as Paul pointed out, PCG was kind of the star performer this quarter, number of records, average production client assets, record revenues, pre-tax, rev free assets, whole bunch of metrics also 9.5% margin in that segment which we sort of expect to continue with that rate for better at least for the rest of this fiscal year, so that we should exceed our target that we said at the beginning of the year. Our asset management as you would expect sort of follows the market up excluding the performance fee they also had record performance for the quarter excluding the performance fee in the prior quarter which led to the records.","Capital markets, there is a good detail on that on Page 9 of your Press Release with some of the selected metrics, I think you will see, it was sort of a mixed bag within the capital market segment. Overall, I would say sort of a good quarter, but not stellar and not terrible. So it's kind of in the middle of where we would expect in this kind of market environment.","And the bank, the loan growth is good, but we had a nice reduction in criticized loans that has helped, can expect provisions to stay at these levels and definitely as we continue to grow loans. We are optimistic that the NIM compression is in the bottom.","And then the other segment for the quarter looks weak compared to the prior quarter and the prior year quarter I will remind you that prior year quarter included the sale of the Albion Investment within our private equity portfolio and the immediately preceding quarter also had about $10 million of private equity proprietary capital type gains.","In this quarter we had no such gains, so and also in the prior quarter \u2013 previous quarter we had the ARS redemptions for about $5.6 million. So comparatively, it doesn't look good. But it's not as bad as it looks.","We talked about a number of factors, if you will remember just by way of reminder last quarter we had, as I just mentioned a private equity gains ARS redemptions, we had the Eagle performance fee of almost $10 million and we also had some tax benefits that caused us to have a fairly low tax rate.","So all those things were in our favor, we didn't really have any unusual items that went against us in that particular quarter. So although we reported $0.81 in December, we sort of cautioned that when adjusting for some of these items that were unusual either in character or magnitude that we are really pretty close to where the consensus estimate was for that quarter.","Although, we will say the same thing about this quarter, it just worked the opposite way. We have a number of factors some seasonal that always hit on the March quarter and some unique to this particular quarter. Some of the recurring ones include the resetting of FICO, which is a bigger number than we had focused on.","The difference in FICO expense alone from the December quarter to the March quarter was $9.5 million that increment will dissipate over the course of the year as people hit the now $117,000 FICO limit as they go through the year that actually added eight tenths of a percent to our comp ratio for the quarter versus the preceding quarter. So that was a big factor that will hit every March.","We always have elevated nailing costs in the March quarter for two reasons, one is we have the printing and mailing of our annual report and proxy for our annual meeting in that quarter. And we have the 1099s that we mail at the end of the year to our several million accounts. The total cost of production in mailing of all that is in excess of $2 million it always hits in the March quarter.","Another thing that hits in the \u2013 while it is symptomatic of the March quarter is some revenue related items \u2013 finished expense related items, I apologize. Some unique items we had elevated television airing of our commercials that was also a couple of million dollars. We have one necessarily go to zero in future quarters. But we typically will not run that level in any given quarter this is sort of an abnormally high period.","Paul mentioned the data center relocation. We moved our primary processing center from St. Petersburg to Denver. There was actually most of the costs were not people picking up machines and putting them in trucks. Most of the cost related to testing of systems to make sure we could accurately and continuously process the business from a new location, which was a big undertaking and that as Paul said was incurred a little bit more expense than we had anticipated.","And then another thing unique to this quarter on the revenue side, we had the weather related branch closings, hard to quantify, but clearly had some impact on the business as retail branches were down because of weather for several days at a time. We do have a shorter quarter, three fewer trading day this quarter, two fewer calendar days that both has an impact that's an always item in March and then the lumpy businesses that we talked about. M&A which was not weak was weaker than it had been running in the preceding couple of quarters and tax credit funds and private equity were not big contributors at all.","So when you add all those things together, which is roughly $8 million to $10 million of elevated expenses that will be \u201cnon-recurring\u201d going forward by using one quarter of the FICO amount although it will probably burn off faster than that.","We are incurred in this quarter roughly 50% data comp, 25% business development with the TV ads and 25% in the admin line with the FICA. That coupled with the revenue impacting items that I mentioned. When you look at all those things, I would say again, that when adjusted we are pretty darn close probably to the consensus estimates again for the quarter.","And as Paul mentioned we sort of view the six months as a good picture of our current run rate to give you an indication of that. For the second quarter, the comp ratio was 68.9% but for the six months it was 68.5% again, probably a [chewer] (ph) number. The pre-tax margin on net revenues was 14% in the second quarter, but when you look at the six month period it was 14.6%.","ROE for the March quarter 10.9% for the six months 11.7%. EPS came in at $0.72, but when you look at the six months its $1.54 or $0.77 a quarter back to my comment about normalized if there is such a thing basis being pretty close to consensus.","We are happy to see the advisor count go up this quarter. In PCG, we do have good recruiting momentum and Paul will talk about that in the going forward comments. One other thing, I do want to mention that is not in the press release, but that we follow very closely and talk about whenever we present at conferences is our level of recurring revenues. We reached the new milestone this quarter was over 62% of our revenues this particular quarter. And which brought over 60% about 60.5% for the six months. So that's a new high for that metric and we are glad to see that going forward.","So I will turn it back to Paul for some going forward comments.","Paul Reilly","First, I will \u2013 I'm going to make some going forward comments. But since there has been so many questions on order flow, I want to hit that one head on before I do that. The first, we do not direct order flow based on hot dollar payments received from market makers instead our order flow is directed to firms that provide the best execution.","Now, there is some times, we do receive nominal benefits than our cash equities and payments in our options business that they are very minor and small in the overall scheme of things. So a lot of people have asked the impact of payment for order flow and it really doesn't have an impact on us financially.","Jeff Julien","Kind of like doing one more comment before Paul goes forward, I apologize. With respect to the impact on EPS of our outstanding shares two things, one again is a seasonal factor. Our biggest equity issuances are in the December quarter when we do year-end equity awards or portions of bonuses that are paid in equity et cetera. So you will always see a little spike in shares in the March quarter versus the preceding. But what really impacted the dilution when you look at the six months this year versus last year outstanding shares were up 2.7% that's a big increase.","It has \u2013 our normalized dilutions about 1.5% a year, the reason for that increase is the stock price going up, you know we used factor dilution, you used the treasury stock method and obviously you are buying a lot fewer shares when the stock prices at those highs. So that the elevated stock price is a positive and negative, I guess in that regard. But that did impact dilution. I'm sorry.","Paul Reilly","I have Tom James in the office, do you the stock prices is more positive or negative. So let me just really kind of look forward a little bit. Our asset management business is in a great position, we have not just going out for the record AUM because of the market, but we have great inflows and part of that's really driven by our private client group business also with record client assets under administration. Record productivity and we have got a very good recruiting pipeline.","So we have added not only we have a lot of people coming in, a lot of large advisors, and I think we really kind of cracked being a place that people from \u2013 with large books and big firms look at us as a great destination. So take time, we work hard in recruiting everyday but those businesses I think if you can look through the short to mid-term are in great shape.","The bank, we have had good loan growth. Now the cautionary part there is spreads have compressed, we see the compression slowing, if a stock compressing or expand that's good but usually those cycle take a bit. And the other is the provision we have had because credit quality has increased. Our provision is pretty low this quarter given all the loan production and of course that's not going to continue forever.","So we think that with the growth of the loan book and those two factors and maybe kind of flattish in earnings there but on the bank and it really depends on spread. But we would expect to hit some growth and but we will have those two headwinds and we will see where they balance given what happens to the spreads in the marketplace.","On the capital markets side, we like our franchises, I think done a great job of building them and we are well-positioned. If you look at pipeline alone, we got a very good pipeline in M&A. Last year was kind of a record year for our M&A and we could do better. And same with the equity underwriting business but that's going to be very market dependent as we go forward.","So the pipeline is there, but the market has to cooperate in order for us to be executing on that. In the fixed income, we love the franchise we have. The commission rate, commission volumes challenged in the market and we are not immune from that. So I think we are doing a great job with our accounts. But volumes are down. We don't see any short-term release on the commissions as long as this rate environment is what it is today.","So I think moving rates will help us but we are going to have to wait for that. In the meantime, we continue to generate good solid trading profits I believe with good risk management and cost control.","Public finance, we have been rated a top 10 issuer in these last couple of years, but issuance as well. So we have got another very good franchise good location. We continue to grow, but again that's going to be market dependent and the tax fund credit business, I will consider our backlog vibrant. It's been a great business. This quarter was off just based on closings that business we feel very, very good about and think will continue to perform.","So with that I just want to remind you of our guidance I think our first quarter got people forgetting that our guidance had been that we thought by the end of this fiscal year, we would be at a 68% comp ratio as a run rate and 15% net margin. We still believe that. I think the first quarter people thought we have checked the box and we try to warn we hadn't yet. But, we believe if you look at the average of these quarters, we were making great progress. And that is still where we expect to be by the end of the fiscal year.","So with that I know we spend a lot of time and a lot of items going in this quarter but now we would like to open up for questions. So Jodi, could you open it up for questions please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes, sir. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Steven Chubak from Nomura.","Steven Chubak - Nomura","Hi. Good morning.","Paul Reilly","Good morning.","Steven Chubak - Nomura","So I just wanted to start with a couple of questions on the bank. We have seen core expenses at the bank excluding the provision actually raised fairly steadily over the last couple of quarters. Historically you have been running within a pretty high range of $18 million to $22 million a quarter, it steps up to $25 million last quarter and actually in the most recent quarter it increased to $28 million.","And I didn't know if the increase was simply a function of higher regulatory in compliance made in for those banks in excess of $10 billion such as yourselves of assets. And should we be assuming this elevated run rate persists on a go forward basis?","Steve Raney","Hey, Steven. This is Steve Raney. Good morning.","Steven Chubak - Nomura","Good morning.","Steve Raney","Bulk of that increased expense is related to additional FDIC charges for the higher deposit level that we have given the size of the balance sheet. And there is also an internal charge, the bank expenses are based on the deposits that we have. So the bulk of that increase is really just related to the overall size of the banks balance sheet.","Jeff Julien","And variable so it will grow as the bank grows.","Steve Raney","Yes. Quite exactly.","Steven Chubak - Nomura","Okay. Thanks for that. And \u2013","Steve Raney","I mean, Steve we do have I would say slightly elevated expenses that I would attribute to the regulatory framework. Our audit and compliance departments are bigger now. But it's relatively nominal. We are at 170 FTE at the bank now. So it's relatively small and on a comparative basis. Our expense levels and FTEs are very low relative to the size of the enterprise.","Steven Chubak - Nomura","Okay. So presumably what's going to be driving expense rates going forward something going to be the growth of balance sheet?","Steve Raney","That's correct.","Steven Chubak - Nomura","Okay. And I suppose focusing more on the credit side now, clearly the credit trends have been impressive, if you look at the dollar allowance, it's been stable for the last few quarters, while you have added $1.2 billion of loans. I suppose what I'm trying to glean is what through the cycle charge-off or provision rate should we be contemplating? And that's what you have been modeling in the near term versus the longer term?","Steve Raney","Yes, couple of comments on that. We did have substantial improvement in credit quality that trend continue. There is really not a whole lot left in our credit side category. We actually have 8 commercial loans that have a loan balance currently that are in our credit advisor category. So it makes it challenging to \u2013 I wouldn't forecast more release of reserve related to our criticized assets at least maybe normally but it won't be significant. So if we continue to grow loans, I would expect we will actually be adding to our allowance on a relative basis. So\u2026","Jeff Julien","And based on our loan mix that might be at 130 or 140 basis points on average increase in loans something like that.","Steve Raney","Yes.","Steven Chubak - Nomura","Okay.","Paul Reilly","The wild-care, I want to remind you all, if we do get a sneak example \u2013","Steve Raney","That's right.","Paul Reilly","This quarter and that comes in we don't know what it will be. Sometimes we agree, a lot of times that we don't but it is what it is.","Steve Raney","Yes. Historically, if you look back in the last four or five years every year in the June quarter, we get the shared national credit exam results. There are usually a handful of loans out of 400 that are subject to the shared national credit exam that we have difference in the ratings, sometimes ours are more harshly rated. We don't upgrade them based on the shared national credit exam. We do always have a handful of loans that are more harshly graded by the regulators. And we got to downgrade those loans. So we usually have some provision expenses and some allowance related to those downgrades in the June quarter.","Steven Chubak - Nomura","Okay. Thanks for that. And just one more on the loan growth outlook and Paul, I appreciate a lot of the detailed color you had given earlier in terms of the general market backdrop in pricing. What we heard from a lot of the big banks was that they were beginning to retrench a bit given that they felt they were not being adequately compensated for taking the credit risk on the commercial side at current pricing levels. And assuming the backdrop stays, on a go forward basis, system work to the current market. How should we be thinking about loan growth trajectory on a go forward basis?","Paul Reilly","You know that one is hard to say. We are hoping that people having this view which we share that spreads comes in you got to get paid for risk slightly have the effect of maybe spreads coming out a little bit, so which we hope the impact is in terms of loan balance growth our production has been pretty steady in the last few quarters. And it's not so much this quarter just because payoffs and refinancings are down as well.","Steve Raney","I would also just mention that this quarter really shed the power of the diversification of our various business units inside the bank. We did made our first tax exempt long-term the March quarter that business, it's directly referred to us by our public finance practice. So its loans to high credit quality municipalities, large not-for-profit higher education, hospitals and like.","Our Canadian business grew by $100 million in the quarter. Our loans REITS in some project finance real estate along with our normal C&I, our commercial and industrial loan book grew. Our SBL, we closed 450 units in the March quarter of loans in our securities based lending business for $330 million of loan commitments. And we closed a 170 mortgage loans during the quarter.","So we got a lot of different businesses inside the bank now. So we are not really relying on anyone business to drive it.","Steven Chubak - Nomura","All right. Thanks. That's it for me. And thank you for taking my questions.","Jeff Julien","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joel Jeffrey from KBW.","Joel Jeffrey - KBW","Hey, good morning guys.","Jeff Julien","Morning, Joel.","Paul Reilly","Good morning, Joel.","Joel Jeffrey - KBW","Thinking about, I mean you guys have done a really nice job of growing your sort of Tier-1 capital on the ratio continues to improve. And just \u2013 in terms of the growth in that just wondering, is there a point in time where you sort of start to thinking more about returning capital either through buybacks or increasing the dividend or you really focus more on building a growth capital.","Paul Reilly","I don't want to sound like a broken record, Joel. But, I will go over again. Our view right now is, first, we tend to be more heavily capitalized lot of our competitors that's a philosophy. But, at some time, if we have cash, we can't deploy. We will have to look at returning it. And our view right now, as we have opportunities to invest the cash in niche acquisitions we talked about some of the areas we have looked about \u2013 we have looked at particularly asset management. And we feel over a reasonable period of time, we can deploy it. If we can't we will have to focus on how we return it. Our goal right now is we think there are opportunities to deploy that capital inside the business.","Joel Jeffrey - KBW","Okay. And then just \u2013 I appreciate the comments you made in terms of the outlook, particularly ECM being kind of market dependent. But just wondering given the volatility we have seen and coming off the strong quarter you had in ECM, have you seen any kind of issue or hesitancy in terms of bringing deals to market or has the outlook changed at all just given what's gone on the markets over the past month or so?","Paul Reilly","I don\u2019t think so. I think we had \u2013 that's a ridiculously strong market over the last year and we got a little bit correction this quarter. But I think that our read right now is the issuers are lined up just waiting if there is a good market, they will go. So I don't see any difference when we saw it a quarter ago.","Joel Jeffrey - KBW","Okay, great. Thanks for taking my questions.","Jeff Julien","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan from JMP Securities.","Devin Ryan - JMP Securities","Hey, good morning guys. How are you?","Paul Reilly","Hey, Devin.","Devin Ryan - JMP Securities","So it's a question on fixed income obviously it's kind of continued to be soft and appreciate the commentary around the need for, I guess higher rates. And then I get that you guys are putting nichey fixed income business with a lot of focus on depositories and municipalities.","But just trying to get a little bit more color, I mean is there anything else here that you think could drive better activity. And then just outside of that or anything else going on behind the scenes of the company where you are trying to boost growth within the fixed income business broadly whether it would be, you adding into other areas that you may see is a better growth drivers or is it more just stay in the course and hoping that we get a little better environment that could drive better claim volumes?","Paul Reilly","Yes. I would say that first rates and volatility are \u2013 and yield curve are the big drivers of fixed income. So volatility has been kept in a pretty short range. And rates have stayed low. So we need both of those. And I think moving rates, changing environment would help that business significantly.","We have looked at growing the business. We are pretty committed to keeping our risk profile the same. So we don't need to expand and if you look at our core franchises whether its bank deposits or a muni sales or the [gov] (ph) sales, we are pretty comfortable in our position.","So as we look at other businesses outside, we are looking at a number \u2013 they got to step within our risk profile as they go. Some of the businesses we look at or the opportunities we look at the marketplace outside of our risk profile. So I don't think you are going to see us expand much more what we are doing now. But we are looking at adjacencies and just haven't found anything compelling at this point.","We are expanding in the U.K., I can't say it's a huge profitable venture right now. We have got a good team. And we have got the base and it's fired up. And we are \u2013 we have had that initiative on since pre-Morgan Keegan and continued to try to grow as we have in our both, in our capital markets and our private client group where we have equivalent of an independent kind of franchise there in London and looking at growing that also.","Devin Ryan - JMP Securities","Good. Thanks. And then with respect to FA recruiting and a nice quarter it sounds like you are pretty optimistic there. So can you shed any more light, I guess into the outlook for additions and maybe how they'd like to play out over the years just based on the conversations you guys are having. Are the office visits up over the last year; is there any color with respect to that?","And then what other areas at the firm outside of the financial advisor, private wealth management area, are you looking to add people?","Paul Reilly","We have 150 opening right now in our company. So we are a hirer. If you look at the recruiting pipeline and say it's up from last year and it's very, very good. First of the year is the time when is probably the most active time in terms of people coming down, if it's a year end change and it's a nice place to come visit in the winter. That pipeline still looks good. And it is better than last year. Our results are better than last year. Our pipelines are better than last year.","Our RAA initiative is relatively new in that pipeline is good without a lot of results. We have had a couple of joints. We are hopeful that and our hybrid select model will both increase. So that pipeline has been growing but it takes a while to actually close, it's a year \u2013 probably a good year across the time you bring someone in the time they sign-up just for a lots of reason.","Most really good advisors are slow because they are worried about their clients. And I think they are in a transition. But the pipeline looks good and it's been good.","Areas outside the firm as I talked, asset management we feel it's a growth opportunity. We like the M&A days whether its in Europe, Canada or the U.S. continue to grow and if we see opportunities there. And there is some others that we look at in and out. So we have a good corporate development effort now. I can tell you, we looked and talked to a lot of people but we are very selective in that pipeline is actually pretty good now too. But, we are not \u2013 we don't count on it and nothings the size of Morgan Keegan. They are much nichier types of opportunities but there were much more active and aggressive in sourcing, selecting and talking to people there.","Devin Ryan - JMP Securities","Great. Appreciate all that color. And then just lastly, apologize if I missed this, but I guess a question for Jeff, just on the number the accounting service fee bumped in the quarter was at driven just by more accounts, more assets or is there something else going on there, just trying to gauge the sustainability of what was a really nice quarter for that line?","Jeff Julien","No. Predominantly is that. We renegotiated some of our arrangements with some of the providers that we share fees with in that regard and had to elevate our accruals in that level. So I think that what you are seeing is that coupled with the implementation of some of the accounting service fee that we talked about couple of quarters ago was some of the client fee changes had it been implemented and will be continued to be implemented throughout the year. So I think that it's a \u2013 its more of a higher run rate than we had been out in the past.","Devin Ryan - JMP Securities","Okay. Great. Thanks for the color.","Jeff Julien","I will just make one comment on the number of 150 job openings, I will make a comment that that some number though it's not a majority but some number those would be to replace some consultant that we are employing particularly in some of the technology areas. So it won't necessarily result in pure incremental expense as bring some people on.","Paul Reilly","Or we have turnover to. I mean we got to replace.","Devin Ryan - JMP Securities","I was assuming that 150, the majority of that's probably non-producing type of roles, is that right?","Jeff Julien","Correct, correct. We don't post for financial advisors.","Devin Ryan - JMP Securities","Okay. Thanks guys.","Jeff Julien","Thank you.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell from Buckingham Research.","Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research","Hi, good morning.","Jeff Julien","Hey, Jim.","Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research","Two questions. First on the comp ratio, I think Jeff if I look back in the third, your fiscal third quarter last year. I think if you suggested if you hit your targets of 15% pre-tax margin et cetera that would imply, I guess on a flat revenue base, the comp ratio nearly 66.5%, you did 68.1% last year and now we are just looking to hold it flat this year despite revenues being up.","Do you think there is more opportunity there over time or is it just maybe you stepped up investment spending? How do we think about where that comp ratio could come out as revenues grow?","Jeff Julien","The comp ratio bounces around based on where we hire people obviously contractors that they are having good recruiting and a good production period. They have a much higher pay out. Based on our current mix of businesses and the current sources of revenues to get that 15% margin we need to at about 68% comp ratio by the end of the year.","The one ratio that we are really I guess in our minds now changing our internal target on would be the private client margin where we start the year with a 9% target. We would be pretty disappointed if it ended up at 9 now given the run rate currently. But, we also need that on the increased revenues to get to that 15% margin. So 68 is our target for the end of the year and I can't tell you exactly, some I had work a year ago went into that, a number I don't know really remember at this point.","Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research","Okay. Fair enough. And maybe just going \u2013 getting onto the retail, the private client side. Can you give a sense on the commissions in fees line which jump nicely is that more kind of annuity like fee based revenues or was it more trading, how do we think about that line going forward?","Jeff Julien","Within the private client group segment almost 70% of their revenues are recurring. So they have a very, very heavy fee emphasis, trails, things that are not transaction oriented. Most of the trading volume when we record number of trades which we have to record to the exchanges and report a lot of those are occurring in (indiscernible) fee accounts. So not really generating revenues.","So clearly the biggest driver was \u2013 has been the increase in assets. We had a good increase from October 1st to January 1st in billings, which everyone was aware of and dealt into their models as well as continued our recruiting and people bringing in new assets going forward. So it's really as to do more with asset levels and it does trading volume.","Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research","So most of the sequential improvement was asset level, is that what you are seeing?","Jeff Julien","That would be yes.","Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research","Okay. If we kind of do the back of the envelop, it looks like you might have had close to $5 billion plus in net inflows, is that a fair number to think about?","Jeff Julien","Don't know that on the top of my head. We have had new FAs and we have had new \u2013 versus you are talking about versus appreciation?","Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research","Yes.","Jeff Julien","Don't know the break down in total client assets of that number. I know within asset management. But I don't know within private client.","Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research","Okay. That\u2019s fine.","Jeff Julien","Certainly you can assume that it didn't rise. Generally it rises about 50% of the S&P because of little over half of our client assets are equity related.","Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research","Great. Okay. Yes. That's kind of where it comes out.","Jeff Julien","It would, it mean it's mostly flows this particular quarter, right?","Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research","Right. That's helpful. And just one big picture question, I mean your sense of retail engagements seems like its been picking up but what's your sense of where we are from a risk taking perspective among your retail clients?","Paul Reilly","Cash is a percentage of assets was actually down, which is interesting for us, the cash balances have been kind of flat this quarter and we are used to them always going out. So if you look at where they are flowing, you would say equity kind of large and mid-cap and fixed income short durations, but having said that I would still talk about the retail and investor, the individual investor is cautious.","So trying to get some return on their assets but cautious in the marketplace so it's up that I wouldn't call it, they are all in.","Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research","Right. Okay. All right. Thanks for taking my questions.","Jeff Julien","Sure.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs.","Alex Blostein - Goldman Sachs","Great. Thank you, and good morning, everybody. Hey, apologize if you guys covered this already but I wanted to kind of run through the expense structure just one more time. So I guess if we think about the truly seasonal impact, Jeff, I think that comes out to be somewhere around $10 million that we should expect to come down. Is that going to happen I guess all in the second quarter or sorry, your fiscal third quarter or kind of like over the course of the year.","And then I was hoping you guys could quantify the actual dollar amount you spend on data center reallocation?","Jeff Julien","The $8 million to $10 million range number I gave you, stuff that should disappear right away. The FICA, I took one quarter of it just assuming it dissipates ratably over the rest of the year. But that wasn\u2019t all necessarily seasonal. It also included running of a television add and data center relocation which don't happen every March. But the rest of it does happen every March.","The data center relocation was about $2 million total costs to us.","Paul Reilly","Out of total costs but just kind of an over time testing cost that was elevated to data center cost a little more than that.","Jeff Julien","Obviously, we are going to have cost of running it going forward. And we have the cost of building it in the past. But this quarter that was the elevated relocation expense.","Alex Blostein - Goldman Sachs","Okay. I got it. Sorry to dump it down like expenses step down by about maybe $8 million or so next quarter?","Jeff Julien","That's my belief based on these factors.","Alex Blostein - Goldman Sachs","Great. Thanks.","Jeff Julien","I'm not saying nothing new can arise that we don't know about today. But based on what we know that would be correct.","Alex Blostein - Goldman Sachs","Jeff, now I get it all else equal. So the second question, I have three guys around, the fixed income trading environment. I mean it looks like muni funds flows have gotten better this year. I think they are positive on net year-to-date basis for the industry and obviously you are a very big player in the public finance space, in the muni space, what impact is that having I guess on the fixed income business for you guys. And if the strike continues, what kind of results I guess, we should expect from fixed income trading?","Paul Reilly","As a muni, if you look at the retail trading because of the interest in muni \u2013 its actually performed fairly well. The institutional, the corporate and the corporate that kind of other businesses that are really did. So I think that you are seeing what you are seeing in the run rates right now, we see its continuing until there is a change in the market. So the retail, I call retail kind of commission part of the business okay on the institutional part very tough.","Alex Blostein - Goldman Sachs","Got it. And then the last one for me guys. Obviously, lots of focus in the market on the higher interest rate backdrop potentially down the road. You guys have provided sensitivity to \u2013 I believe somewhere around 100 basis point raise interest rates. Presumably that could be some further net interest margin expansion of the bank if rates continue to rise beyond a 100 basis points. Have you given any more thought on what the ultimate upside to pre-tax income or revenues could be for the franchise as a whole be on the first 100 basis points?","Jeff Julien","Yes. In the first 100, it's hard to quantify it depends on what free cash holding, we obviously would earn more on our own corporate cash as rates continue to rise from there. But beyond that, it's a fairly nominal number say somewhere between $10 million and $20 million for the every 100 basis points beyond that for the next \u2013 talked about 300.","Paul Reilly","Banks going to operate of a spread more than just what the rate it. So \u2013","Jeff Julien","Yes. It's not overly material after the first 100, its really the biggest factor is the earnings on our own free cash.","Alex Blostein - Goldman Sachs","Got it. Okay. Great. Thanks so much for taking the questions.","Jeff Julien","Yes.","Operator","(Operator Instructions)","Paul Reilly","Are there no further questions Jodi?","Operator","Yes, sir. There are no further questions.","Paul Reilly","Great. Well, again, we think this was a good quarter and we know that the first quarter and the second quarter they have bumped around, but it's an average. I think we're about where we would expect it to be. Well-positioned markets are with us. We feel good about where we are. So thank you for joining us and we will talk to you again soon.","Operator","Thank you. That concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"18186":["Raymond James Financial (NYSE:RJF) Q4 2014 Earnings Call October 30, 2014  8:15 AM ET","Executives","Paul Shoukry - ","Paul Christopher Reilly - Chief Executive Officer, Director and Member of Special Committee","Jeffrey Paul Julien - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President of Finance, Treasurer and Chairman of Raymond James Bank","Steven M.

My name is Felicia, and I will be your conference facilitator today. This call is being recorded and would be available on the company's website.","Now I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Paul Shoukry, Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations at Raymond James Financial.","Paul Shoukry","Good morning, and thank you for taking time out of your busy schedules to join us this morning. We certainly do not take your time or interest in Raymond James for granted, so thank you. After reading the following disclosure, I'll turn the call over to Paul Reilly, our Chief Executive Officer; and Jeff Julien, our Chief Financial Officer. Following their prepared remarks, they will ask the operator to open the line for questions.","Certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements.

Paul?","Paul Christopher Reilly","Thanks, Paul, and good morning. So it's always a little weird, little scary releasing the day before Halloween. And even though the ghouls and goblins seem to come out in October, I think we ended up with more of a treat than a trick for the quarter. It's a great quarter to close out a great year. 33 records as we counted them, so we're not going to go through them all. Hopefully, I'll try not to use the word through them all. The fiscal year, again, great, with $4.86 billion, 8% increase year-over-year, $480 million net income, which is a 31% increase before all the adjustments, 15% after. EPS of fully diluted, $3.32 a share. Those are all records for us.","And the September quarter, $1.29 billion of revenue, up 6% over last year. I mean, sequentially. Net income, $136.4 million, up 11% sequentially and $0.94 per fully diluted share.","So our record annual net revenue for all 4 segments, we all -- I think that people focused on M&A, but if you look across the firm, we actually had a record year and revenue for all 4 segments and a record pretax in 3 of the 4 segments, except for the bank, which had really a second best year and very good performance. So 12.3% ROE to our shareholders on an over 20% capital, I think a good return to the shareholders.","I want to pause here a second just to say how extremely grateful I am to all our advisers and associates who worked hard. I think this validates our combination with Morgan Keegan a few years ago, which has been seamlessly integrated now. And based on the culture here that Bob and Tom James have built, honestly, it's kind an easy firm to run and hit -- point it in the right direction as people have executed extremely well.","I'm going to talk for a few minutes about the segment and then Jeff Julien is going to go over the more detailed items that have affected the results. In the Private Client Group for the September quarter, net revenues of $861.1 million, which is 16% over the prior year quarter and up 5% sequentially. And the pretax of $100.2 million is up 55% over the prior year quarter and 23% sequentially. Annually, $3.27 billion of net revenue, up 12% over the prior year, and pretax income of $330 million, up 43% over the prior year. Now these were all driven by a number of factors. Certainly, market appreciation helped, but we had our second best recruiting year ever. Certainly, our great recruiting is driving that, and our client-pricing initiatives all at it. And Jeff is going to add some commentary especially for the quarter on IT and fees, which certainly helped the numbers. IT may well be a little bit more temporary help for the quarter as we're in transition between projects, and our new fee schedules also would have some adjustments on an ongoing basis.","Private Client Group asset is up $450.6 billion. It's up 11.9% for the year, down slightly for the quarter. And I'm going to address that a little bit later. Advisers now stand at 6,265. We're always proud when we have robust recruiting, but the key for our firm is retention, as we focus every day on retention of our great advisers. That's been the key to our financial success. We reached the 10.1% marked target -- we beat the 10% target margin for this segment. Both divisions, RJA and RJFS, our employee and independent advisers, performed very well; and also our IRA division, which we've started to aggressively roll out is showing promising recruiting results.","Capital Markets, a big story for the quarter, $263.6 million, 9% over last year's quarter, 11% sequentially up. Our record pretax profits of 39.5% for the quarter, down 2% really from last year's quarter, which is very good, up 41% sequentially; and they hit a 15% pretax margin for the quarter. Annually, the $966.2 million, up 3% over the previous year. Pretax of $130.6 million, up 28% over the prior year. This is really strong in investment banking results for the quarter of $115 million, $340 million for the year driven really by M&A. M&A was $150 million for the year, up 19%; but $57 million of that hit this quarter. Underwriting, $100 million, up 14%. Fixed Income banking of $55 million, up 15%. And Tax Credit Funds at $34 million, up 40%. So a lot of factors contributed across that brought a strong quarter in Capital Markets. Somewhat muted by the Fixed Income performance, which we believe our Fixed Income team did an exceptional job in a very tough margin. We had headwinds. Fixed Income institutional commissions were down 25% over last year, over $80 million. But the trading profits doubled holding profitability very steady for the year, so great performance on a very tough market. Public finance continue to grow in recruitment builder franchise, and again, we had a Top 10 ranking on our way to another Top 10 ranking in public finance this year. Asset Management, similarly, very, very good quarter and year, $94.9 million, up 17% over last year's quarter and 4% sequentially on the revenue side. And record pretax of $35.3 million, up 15% over last year's quarter and 13% sequentially. Overall, if you look at the year, though, with revenue at $369.7 million, up 28% year-over-year and the pretax of $128.3 million, up 33% over last year. It's a very strong performance.","The AUM year-over-year is up 15.4% and down slightly this quarter. I know people that had questions on flows, but when you really look at the net flows, we're up 7.7% for the year. That's 15.4%. If you look at the quarter, although the S&P was somewhat flat, the small-cap in International segment was down about 5%, which had a little more drag on this segment given our concentration in the small cap space in our Eagle division.","RJA Bank. Revenues are $93.1 million for the quarter, up 4% over last year and 2% sequentially. Pretax of $64.1 million, down 12% over last year and 1% sequentially. Record revenues of $351.8 million for the year, up 1%. Pretax down 9% at $242.8 million. The story of the year was just great net loan growth. We ended up with a record net loans of $10.96 billion, up 24% over last year and 5.7% sequentially. This is a great accomplishment given our conservative underwriting standards to be able to drive that loan growth. And the offset to that loan growth was NIM compression. If you look at through the year, we almost had a 27% drop basis -- point drop in the NIM. The good news, it looks like the NIM has improved this quarter, and Jeff's going to comment on that a little bit. Credit metrics continue to be strong and improved.","All in all, quite a year, quite a quarter, and I want to congratulate our team.","And now I'll turn it over to Jeff Julien. Jeff?","Jeffrey Paul Julien","Thanks, Paul. Given that it can be a little bit difficult from that segments to line items, we started the practice now of me actually walking through some of the line items, and I'll comment on some of the factors within those line items and kind of give you our take on or feel for those line items going forward as best as we can. Not a lot to say about securities commissions and fees, I think you all know the drivers there in PCG. I can tell you that the billings on October 1 were flat to slightly up from July 1, which is indicative of the billings happening before we hit the low point here in this recent 9% mini-correction. In addition to that, for next year, we are anticipating some continued good recruiting. We hope that continues to -- at roughly the rate that it's been going, that would be wonderful. Also, the recent volatility, actually both in interest rate and in the equity markets, that will help on the institutional commission side. Although, during the year, it was pretty benign in terms of volatility, but we certainly seen some to start this current fiscal year.","Paul has talked about the very, very strong investment banking revenues. This is probably our most difficult line item to budget in the revenue side. We averaged this year around $85 million per quarter. Perhaps, that's a reasonable baseline for looking forward and whatever you're projecting for your pure Investment Banking clients in terms of change for next year, maybe you assume something similar for that division within our company.","Net interest income is interesting. It's nice to see it surpassed $100 million for the quarter. The biggest driver there, of course, was the bank. We did see that 14 basis point net interest margin improvement. We've been talking at least the last couple of quarters about how NIM was -- the NIM compression was slowing down and, I guess, I'll go and stick my neck out a little bit and say it looks like it's bounced off the bottom at least for the very near term. The 14 basis point improvement sequentially was really a combination of factors. Some of it was additional corporate loan fees that were recognized because of some payoffs. But also, we were able to put some of our cash for our investments of the bank to work in the loans, and -- but around all that, there truly was some net interest margin improvement in the outstanding portfolio of about 4 basis points, and we have made a comment in the press release that it appears that new productions being done at higher levels, and I can certainly attest to that as part of the Loan Committee. So looking what's in the pipeline, it looks like we're off the bottom there.","Going forward, we're not projecting a dramatic rebound in net interest margin. We are projecting some pretty healthy loan growth, and I'll let Steve Raney, who's here with us, talk about that shortly. But we are just kind of projecting NIM to hold flat around 3% for this year. Again, we're not projecting any interest rate hikes either this year.","Account and service fees, I think caught everybody a little bit offguard in terms of the 10% sequential growth throughout $112 million for the quarter. Some of that relates to, I guess, I'll have to say some sort of some catch-up entries as we negotiated some contracts, we brought in some outside assets under the billing process and things like that. Some of it actually relate a little bit to the June quarter, but we didn't have the numbers in time to record them there, didn't know what they were at the time. So in terms of our run rate, looking forward, probably about $108 million of that $112 million is probably about the true run rate of where we are at this point in time.","We talked about trading profits. The only thing I'll remind you of is when you look at the year-over-year comparison, remember that last year included that May-June muni-market swoon that impacted trading profits quite negatively for the year. Other than that quarter, they've been pretty steady at that $14 million, $15 million per quarter rate. So that's, again, given the market environment, that's a pretty good accomplishment.","Other revenues, I think you know the main driver in that line in the past has been private equity activity. We did have a lot less gain in that than we did in the preceding quarter. We also have other things hitting in there. We talked about foreign currency gains and losses in the past at the bank. We did actually have a gain in the June quarter and a loss in the September quarter in that line item, so that was about a $4 million swing or $3.3 million swing quarter-to-quarter. I'm happy to report that between maturities and us transferring the remaining Canadian-denominated loans to our Canadian-financing sub at the bank, we won't be talking about that factor going forward.","On the expense side, comp obviously gets a lot of discussion. We did achieve the run rate that we were hoping to by the end of the fiscal year. We hit the 67.7% for the fourth quarter, and we actually end up with 68.1% for the entire fiscal year. I don't know that we're moving the benchmark a lot but we -- if we can stay sub-68% for the coming year with some revenue growth, I think that we'll be -- see some margin improvement.","Paul mentioned the data communications expenses. We did kind of take just a little bit of a hiatus this quarter, this past quarter as we completed some projects and just decided not to launch right into a bunch of new ones for a couple of months. So we did see -- and some of the projects we completed that we've been working on now hit the capitalization phase. That's a little bit hard to predict. So while we think the mid-60s number we've been guiding you to is probably still right on an annual basis. It's a little bit lumpy. It's not always going to be a consistent number, so we're still sort of expecting that run rate spend -- it was $63 million per quarter this year and $64 million for the quarter the year before that, so I think that, guidance-wise, we still think that we'll average that. We certainly are not going to abandon our investments we're making in technology to help support our financial advisers.","The bank loan loss returned to what I'd call somewhat more normal levels, still a little bit low relative to the 24% loan growth. But last year's was just abnormally low. Obviously, at $2 million given all the credit enhancement we had. We had some of that this year, some credit improvement which caused some declines in growth. But going forward, we don't have -- as you can see, our criticized asset balances are coming down dramatically, so there's not a whole lot of additional credits to be gained from credit improvement. There's still some but we're -- we would expect a more normal 130 to 140 basis point charge on loan growth for the next year.","The other expense line item, there's many small items that come in that, the only one of any magnitude, and it wasn't particularly large, was some legal expenses that hit during the quarter, bigger than the preceding quarter. That's another one that bounces around a little bit, but still at a very reasonable rate in terms of total expense.","I will talk about the tax rate just for a second. It came in at a little under 36% for the year. And a lot of that versus our 37% to 37.5% guidance for the year, at the beginning of the year, had to do with the strong equity market and the tax-exempt gains realized on our corporate-owned life insurance portfolio. I guess, guidance-wise, I'd say that we're still probably at 37% to 37.5-somewhere-in-that-range percent taxpayer in a flat market environment given the various factors that we have that impact our rate. In an upmarket, I think you can sort of assume that rate's going to be 100 to 150 basis points better with the corporate-owned life insurance swing; and that in a poor market, just the opposite. So what rate you use, I guess would depend a little bit on your outlook for the market.","A couple of other factors, we did, did a 13.4% ROE for the quarter and 12.3% for the year. I'll remind you that 12% is somewhat our target rate for this interest rate environment. We'll have a very different target when we get to -- if and when we get to a more normal interest rate levels.","Shareholders' equity got to $4.1 billion. That's up 13.1% over last year, notwithstanding the almost $100 million et cetera that went out in dividends.","And I will lastly mention our leverage ratio, which actually has improved, as simple assets to equity leverage ratio was 6.3 a year ago, and now it's down to 5.6. And those factors have continued to drive a very positive regulatory capital ratios as well. So all looks very strong on that front.","Paul Christopher Reilly","Okay. Thanks, Jeff. Just the outlook Jeff kind of touched on our go-forward PCG building starting in the quarter. I think the key for this quarter is volatility, and certainly, as asset levels stayed down, they've recovered and that's where they're heading now. It'll affect next quarter, but the volatility has opened some of the trading side, as you know, a big chunk of our Private Client Group is fee-based.","The recruiting pipeline is still very, very strong. We're hoping to surpass last year's recruiting. From a goal standpoint, this last year was our second best year ever to '09 when there's kind of a slight -- some, yes, certain players that were in the paper, certain that weren't and we were certainly beneficiaries of that. But our recruiting pipeline stays very strong, and also for a very high producing advisers both in terms of assets and revenue, with multi-million dollar team visits are common every day here now. And we'll continue to focus recruiting throughout the country, but we've expanded with particular focus out West and in the Northeast where we gained progress.","Asset management. Again, assets should grow as we recruit to PCG. Market volatility may create some headwinds in AUM. Certainly, the market impacts that but we think we're in good shape. As we've always said, we continue to look and our actively looking for niche acquisitions to grow that business.","The capital markets side. The equity side of the business certainly had a strong year. And just that $85 million average might be a number, but this was a record year for us, and you never know what the market -- where that number goes. As he said, probably the hardest one to predict, and -- but we have expanded our tech practice starting a few years ago broaden our consumer team and expanding into another SDU as we're looking, so we're continuing to make investments and very happy with our backlog. It's strong and with our people. But again, the market's going to play a big factor in that.","Fixed Income, the headwinds will continue. October started very volatile in the markets, which was tougher on trading profits but was positive on commissions, so who knows where it'll settle out as the market settles out. But we have a great team, and they're well positioned.","In public finance, we continue to grow. We've done a great job in California and other states adding bankers and continue to stay a Top 10 banker, and we'll use this downturn to recruit good people to build the platform.","Bank loan growth looks very strong. Runoff has dropped from 30% to 20% and production's up. We also have a contract to purchase $235 million of 5\/1 adjustable resi loans that should close in December as we finish our due diligence, and we expect that will close, and that'll happen near the end of the quarter. But I think you're going to see strong loan growth as a start in the quarter. And again, I think, every time we predicted loan growth, we're -- the market changes, and the next quarter may be different, but we look like we're in good shape there.","So all in all, I think a strong quarter, a strong year. And Jeff has something to add before we turn it over to questions.","Jeffrey Paul Julien","Yes, when you look at the year-to-year results, which are as shown in the press release, the GAAP results, I just want to remind you some of the comparative factors that play into that. If you remember, last year included about a $74 million in revenues from the sale of a private equity holding, which -- majority of which was not to our interest, which obviously impacted noncontrolling interest, but that was an item that drove that other revenues last year.","Secondly, we had that May-June muni swoon I talked about in trading profits last year, which certainly impacted that comparison.","And on the expense side last year, we were still showing $73.5 million of integration costs, which we're no longer showing as we're fully integrated.","And last year, we had that abnormally low loan loss provision despite some pretty strong loan growth in 2013.","So when you put some kind of reasonable adjustment, all of those out of the ordinary type factors, I think that you would say that on adjusted basis, the revenue, which we recorded an 8% increase actually increased more than that on operating basis. But on the other hand, while we showed a 33% increase in pretax profits, as shown on the bottom of the segment page for the year, pretax income growth, I think that when you adjust for all those factors, it probably wasn't quite that good, but it was still a very, very strong performance year-over-year.","Paul Christopher Reilly","Okay. And with that, we'll turn it back -- we'll turn it over to you operator, Felicia, for question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Bill Katz with Citi.","Ryan Bailey","This is actually Ryan Bailey filling in for Bill. My question was regarding -- I know you mentioned it. I was wondering what your outlook is for the investment banking business. We know M&A has been pretty good over the last couple of quarters. Do you have any color into that going forward?","Paul Christopher Reilly","I wish I did. As we said, it's the hardest one to predict. I would just say that we came off of a kind of a record quarter for M&A and very strong for banking. Backlog is very good. The market in October certainly on the underwriting business pushed some deals back, but they didn't cancel. We think the pipeline is strong. But you have to remember, this was a very, very strong quarter, so I wouldn't anticipate -- I hope we repeat it and grow from here. I wouldn't anticipate that though. And Jeff gave you the average for the year. That might be good for the next quarter given where we were, but again, the market changes by the week or by the day sometimes, sometimes by the hour.","Ryan Bailey","Sorry, if you don't mind, another question just kind of on, I guess, a different topic. Just wondering -- I know you mentioned again the asset management business kind of looking for tuck-in acquisitions there. Do you have -- anything that you're looking at in particular? Or anything on the pipeline?","Paul Christopher Reilly","We've been aggressively looking for 2 years, and we're just very conservative and cautious, so we've talked to lots of firms, and it's always a -- part of it's a timing issue sometimes. You like each other, and it's not the right time. Sometimes, we don't agree on the price. And if there's not a culture fit, we won't even start. So we've been actively talking, and we don't have anything to announce. But we're -- I'm proud of the effort they're making in the market and the due diligence. When we do talk to people, it's pretty heavy. And if we find it, we'll close. If we won't, we don't. And the ones that have been nearer term were more active than a little smaller, but that could change tomorrow, too, so...","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.","James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Can you talk a little bit about -- you've noted for the last couple of quarters record recruiting, but it looks like this quarter, the number of new updates kind of slowed. Is it just sort of a timing issue? How should we think about that? Because I think as we looked at it sequentially, it was up couple -- maybe 20 basis points in terms of growth. Do you think we should expect that to pick up?","Paul Christopher Reilly","Yes, there's 2 pieces to it. First is it's a net number when you see it. And unfortunately, it's not just regretted attrition. I mean, some is regretted. We've had a number of deaths. We have a number of retirements as an over FA force. We do have occasional regretted attrition, although, that's low. And we do have times where people leave the industry just because at the lower end, they're not making it, so it's a hard net number. But if you look at productivity per adviser, part of that is market driven, but a lot of it is a higher end FAs coming in. So the number is a little lumpy. It was -- 2 quarters ago, it was really large [indiscernible] This quarter, it looks flattish. But if you average it out, I think it's pretty steady. And where people sign -- when people join us, it can be lumpy.","James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","And would you expect, I mean, just on the flow side, it looks like obviously it's a volatile quarter in terms of the market, but if you kind of look at your fee-based assets, they did not a lot of -- it's any net inflows this quarter versus a pretty strong flows in the last few. Is that just market volatility? Or any other color on flows?","Paul Christopher Reilly","It's driven by both. Certainly, the market impacts the flows. But recruiting and people bringing assets in impact the flows, too. So again, given last year, you -- we got -- we're impacted by both. I don't know if I could break it out for the quarter how much was due to what. But net-net, we think we're having good flows. And from advisers and from productivity of existing advisers, and certainly, the market has an impact. So it's all of those that were impacting that number.","James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Great. Okay. All right. That's Fair. And last one for me. Just if I look at -- you guys have had very strong loan growth. You're now over the last 2 quarters, loans -- your loan-to-deposit ratio is now over 100%. Do you -- with that dynamic, do you start to -- I guess what could strain you in terms of growing the loan book in the balance sheet? Is it deposits? Or is that not an issue? And you're just listing to keep growing?","Paul Christopher Reilly","Our only internal -- we have 2 internal constraints. One is we don't want more than half our cash, client cash, to be in the bank, and that's not a constraint for the foreseeable future.","Jeffrey Paul Julien","It's under 1\/3 right now.","Paul Christopher Reilly","Which is under 1\/3. We don't want to be half. We have an internal guideline, and we don't want it to be -- we're targeting them around 35% of capital, which we're at but not to exceed 40%, but the bank's earnings, too. Right now, the biggest constraint is just if we get good credits with acceptable spreads, we can grow. And the times we slowed the growth is when felt we weren't getting good credits or the spreads for the risk weren't acceptable. And it looks like the environment right now looks promising. But again, that's even throughout last year. I think every quarter the dynamics are a little different. But right now, it's in good shape.","James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","So do you still feel like you can get pretty good spreads just funding it in the wholesale market without deposits?","Paul Christopher Reilly","Without deposits, we're...","Jeffrey Paul Julien","Client cash.","Paul Christopher Reilly","Yes. We have plenty of client cash to fund our deposits. We -- the bank takes what it needs, and then we sweep it out amongst other banks, and we're not constrained on deposits.","Steven M. Raney","Jim, I would also -- would just offer up that we have ample liquidity still at the bank, and we also have contingent funding sources, borrowing availability at Federal Home Loan Bank and the Federal Reserve, so we manage that very conservatively in terms of making sure we've got plenty of cushion from liquidity for funding. And as Jeff and Paul mentioned, we do have about 1\/3 of client cash balances currently deployed in the bank.","Jeffrey Paul Julien","And my 2 cents on that is we don't have a very good track record of predicting the bank growth or spreads or anything else.","Paul Christopher Reilly","For interest rates.","Jeffrey Paul Julien","We've generally been on the conservative side, but we've -- that's why we -- that's where our feelings are today.","James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay. Great. And if you can predict what rates are doing, and that would be also great.","Jeffrey Paul Julien","Yes. If we could do that we wouldn't be working now.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Douglas Sipkin with Susquehanna.","Douglas Sipkin - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","So just a couple of questions. A bit nitpicky on comp. I know you guys, you came in a little bit here in the fourth quarter. Can you maybe refresh us a little bit? I just recall there were a couple of items which may start to ease in the comp ratio. Maybe it starts in '15. Maybe it relates to a little bit lower payouts and some of the trading businesses, I mean, Fixed Income. And maybe some RSUs, which I think are done running through the system in '15. Can you give us an update on that?","Jeffrey Paul Julien","Yes, there were 3 pieces from the Morgan Keegan acquisition that were impacting the comp ratio. The first was the management piece, which was adding about $6 million a year. That will end at the end of March 2015. Then there's a 5-year piece that's costing us about $6 million to $7 million a year that relates primarily to the Fixed Income Capital Markets group that obviously runs through the end of March 17. And then the third piece was the Private Client Group, which was a 7-year deal, which was costing us $18 million to $20 million a year, which obviously has only run 2.5 years of that 7-year life.","Douglas Sipkin - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Got you. Okay. So there's probably a touch of relief in '15 but nothing yet really major until we get a couple of years further out?","Paul Christopher Reilly","That's probably accurate.","Jeffrey Paul Julien","And then we put in place new retention along the way anyway, so...","Douglas Sipkin - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Right. Right. Okay. Great. So a question for Paul, I mean, obviously, shareholder can't complain, a 13.4% ROE and practically 0 interest rate environment, very impressive. That being said, you guys -- the balance sheet looks so strong. I mean, what would it take for you guys to do something a little bit more, I would call it, unorthodox for you around capital return policy. I know you guys have been looking to grow the acquisitions, small stuff and the asset managers, but it's been a while and the earnings continue to go up and the balance sheet continues to get stronger. So I'm just curious if there's any change of thinking around the capital policy for you guys.","Paul Christopher Reilly","I think we're holding firm that we believe that first, we're always going to be conservatively capitalized, I hope, if something goes wrong, but that's -- so we're going to be conservative. But we have been looking and working very hard and looking at acquisitions and niche acquisitions. And I know for some investors, a quarter is forever. For us, our horizon is a little longer, and we think we can deploy the capital. If we can't, we'll do something else with it. But we think we can deploy the capital, and -- but we're not going to close on a deal just to deploy the capital. We've had those opportunities over the years, but if we don't think it's a good investment, we're going to keep it on the balance sheet. So at this point, we still believe we can deploy it, and I know people aren't going to believe us until we do. And if we can't -- the other thing is we're not going to deploy it just to deploy it. If we can't do it, then we'll deal with excess cash, but we don't believe we're in that position today.","Douglas Sipkin - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Great. And then -- and I apologize if this has been hit on already. I know you guys obviously gave pretty clear interest rate guidance. Obviously, who knows if interest rates ever go up. I mean, how do we think about that now with the sense -- maybe the client asset levels are up, maybe $20 billion, $30 billion or something like that from maybe the time you provided the guidance. I'm thinking around, like, Analyst Day. You've provided it before, but I think you've articulated it well at the Analyst Day, so I mean, does that -- can we think about that changing all that much? Or the client assets continue to go up meaning in terms of the actual impact on 100 basis points? Or is it too early to think about changing that guidance?","Paul Shoukry","Yes, I mean -- this is Paul Shoukry. While the asset levels for the client asset levels are up since we gave that guidance, if you look at the cash balances, a lot of it's been redeployed into the market and obviously, they don't benefit from market appreciation like the other assets do. So actually, cash balances have been pretty steady, and when we do our projections, it's still pretty constant with what we told you at around $150 million pretax impact on an annual basis when interest rates rise, 100 basis points simultaneously. That doesn't change much, Doug.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Christian Bolu (sic) [Chinedu Onwugbolu] with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Chinedu Christian Onwugbolu - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just back to the M&A strengths. You mentioned some of the investments you've made in that business, and I appreciate it's hard to predict, but I would like some color on the backlog. I mean, is it contrary to the certain industry verticals? And how broad-based or lumpy is it?","Paul Christopher Reilly","Well, first, it's always lumpy by definition. And if you look across the industry, it was a good quarter for M&A, so it certainly wasn't just us. And why deals all tend to close near the same period of time? I don't know. The factors still seem good both with equity market outlook and certainly achieved financing cost for M&A. The backlog's good, and in fairness, a lot of the activity in the segment both in underwritings and M&A was kind in kind of a life-science based this year, which we didn't participate in since we're not really in that space. So it's pretty broad across our sectors. They've all kind of contributed, and I can't say it's focused on one area. The backlog is still very strong, and I don't think we're going to hit the level we hit this quarter every quarter, but I think we anticipate a reasonable quarter this year. And again, timing is everything on these deals. So we can't predict when any deal will close and it is lumpy.","Chinedu Christian Onwugbolu - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. Okay. It's strong, so that's good. Just a bit on Fixed Income. You spoke into one of your initiatives being driven to asset manager client base from your traditional sort of bank client base. So first, just an update on that and how that's progressing. And then secondly, when you think about some of the rules impacting banks, going forward, like the LCR, do you have any impact on the long-term demand, say, for munis, from deposit institutions?","Paul Christopher Reilly","I think on both initiatives that the focus is on extending the client base, the total return client bases. It's been a focus of ours, and we're making good progress. But as a percent of our revenue, it's still small, so we're very focused on it. And I think as we look at some of the rules, which they have changed for the banks and liquidity calculations for munis, I think actually the new rules we're feeling very comfortable. The demand will continue. I think at a period of time there, we wondered with some of the liquidity calculations based on the latest rules. We think those business will be fine. Now I can't tell you what's going to happen to regulation day-to-day because they keep changing, but we feel good about those spaces. The thing that's inhibiting that business the most right now is rates. And most of the bank deals really aren't muni deals, so there's a lot of tax. They were holding on the taxable instruments in our bank franchise to...","Jeffrey Paul Julien","Agencies.","Paul Christopher Reilly","Agencies, particularly. So the munis distribution is really separate from the bank space.","Chinedu Christian Onwugbolu - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly for me, I guess, on regulation. I know you're not formally -- I believe you're not formally subject to kind of a set of liquidity rules at the bank or the HoldCo. But just curious if you have us a sense of where you would be on the LCR? And if the regulators care at all about that number for you guys.","Paul Christopher Reilly","Every calculation we've seen and done as we've gone forward is, if you look at our capital and liquidity position under any rules, we're still well over, so...","Chinedu Christian Onwugbolu - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Even on liquidity?","Paul Christopher Reilly","Liquidity, too. We're extremely liquid right now. So as the previous question said in excess capital, it's not just capital. It's in cash. So we're very liquid right now, and it's kind of nice to be liquid when there's opportunities and day-to-day fluctuations, but we certainly have more cash than we need to operate this business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura.","Sharon Leung","And I'm Leung for Steven. Just had a quick question. Some of the bigger banks that have reported earnings this quarter have noticed that they've seen -- given the loosening set underwriting standards, they've seen some more aggressive pricing, which has resulted in lower loan pricing. Just wondering what you've seen that's kind of given the opposite effect at RJ bank.","Jeffrey Paul Julien","Yes, we've not seen that. We've actually experienced a little bit of the opposite this last quarter. Actually, I would say that secondary prices on corporate loans have actually come down maybe 100 to 150 basis points, and I would say that the market plays both banks and institutional investors that invest in commercial loans has been pushing back against the declining margin, and we've seen improvement in that space, not huge, but some improvements so...","Paul Christopher Reilly","And in fairness, we play in a small segment on the C&I loans with a certain credit rating and -- so they could be getting some pressure at the high end.","Jeffrey Paul Julien","And the risks here are -- or the risks...","Paul Christopher Reilly","We have a very less risk within our risk less, but -- yes.","Operator","And the next question comes the line of Devin Ryan with GMP Securities.","Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","I just want to dig in a bit more on the recruiting momentum and, I guess, the backlog. I mean, I guess, outside of contracts that have been rolling off of the wire houses, I wanted to get some perspective on what else has changed to make the recruiting back drop so strong right now. And I know that you guys have done a great job upgrading your technology and adviser offering over the past handful of years. So just trying to get some perspective around how much might -- maybe the environment versus how much you guys think is Raymond James specific based on what you're seeing.","Paul Christopher Reilly","I thought you said they wanted to because of us and not because of -- the -- I think honestly, you get in the momentum plays in recruiting, and there's a number of factors, it's not just one. First, I do think that our culture has been very steady, and a lot of advisers that grew up in regional firms like ours that are at the wire house. They went to the wire houses by waking up, and their card changed. Those deals have rolled off that seat to find a place like ours, and that certainly has been a big factor. The second piece is I think that other people did even grow up at the wire houses as many banks and private institutionalize our clients through credit and relationships and also eliminating lower accounts and putting pressure on fees and teaming with people that like their semi-independence and then grown up and looking for alternatives, and we're certainly a very, very good alternative. And I think the other 2 factors that have helped us, certainly, our technology, which we believe is competitive with any of the big banks or custodial firms. It's never perfect, but we think some areas we excel in, especially when it comes to the advisers' desktop that our technology is certainly is not a limiting factor in many cases against even some of the bigger firms, a positive. And last but not least, I think the Morgan Keegan combination added a kind of renewed interest in us given our size and scope and just made us more people, more market aware. Our surveys always say if you leave, where do you go? And we do blind surveys, and we always finish on top. And other competitors are there too, but whether it's a good destination, and all those factors plus the recruiting momentum has just added to it. So our focus is windows don't stay open forever in recruiting. You can look at the market times where it gets very active and then where it's slows down. Right now, it's an active time, and we're just in a great position, so we're trying to take advantage of it by just getting as many good advisers as we can during this process. We're also opening up in regions we didn't recruit in. California, it's so far away for us, and now we've got boots on the ground there in terms of management. We're expanding it. We've increased the number of advisers by multiples, but we're still a small factor in that market. And the same in the Northeast. So we just really stayed out of New York and the employee side and surrounding areas and we've grown those businesses. So we've opened up. I think the status are there are more advisers between the Philadelphia and Boston and the rest of the country, and we weren't active -- really active in those markets. We are now. So that's also opened up our recruiting availability. So there's a lot of things going on that is driving the number.","Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","Okay. That's really helpful color. And then just staying on maybe the technology side. I apologize if you addressed this. But the low in technology investments within product line that you guys mentioned in the release. Can you give any perspective around the magnitude of that? And how much that helped? And then did that imply there's going to be some catch-up -- there could be a catch-up quarter. I'm just trying to understand the comment in relation to the impact.","Paul Christopher Reilly","No, I think what happened is that -- I'll oversimplify it but it's human nature a little bit, too. So we've been on a fast pace. We're a little ahead of budget in terms of spending and then slowed it down in the fourth quarter as projects ended to come within the budget. And our budget for next year, we think that range were giving you of that around $65 million-ish is the right -- it's our budget. Technology people like to spend their budget. They usually don't want to give back dollars. They've always got 20 more projects to do that you cut from the budget. So we've increased our technology spend. We're focused. We got great delivery, and I just think it was 2 factors: one was a little budget catch-up; secondly, the projects rolled off, so it's just a matter of, \"Did you buy the software in September or October or some of the products? Or do you have a consultant show-up at September 15 or October 1?\" And it's not really much of what was the budget catch-up. It's not a deferral. I think they spent their budget through the year, and I'm sure they're going to do everything they can to spend their budget this year.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","First question on the trends you guys seeing on fixed income trading. And I think you guys have done a great job on your Investor Day, a couple of times now, describing the nature of that business, who your clients are and the environment in which we could actually see some recovery there. I was curious to get a better sense of whether or not you think it's the shape of the yield curve for one of the level of interest rate that matters here because I think increasingly the content of the issues become the what the rates of the short end might go up a little on action that would affect yield curve, so just curious how you think your fixed income trading business aside from the trading profits fees would perform in that environment.","Paul Christopher Reilly","Yes, it's a factor of everything. I think just gross interest rates. No one's just forgetting the yield curve. No one's rushing to buy 30-year bonds anywhere, and that's where you get paid the best. So certainly, a general rise in interest rates and QE makes the long -- go up a little bit. I think it's helpful. Secondly, certainly, the yield curve is a positive. So flat yield curve will not be a positive across the total industry. And the third is then the biggest factor is all solely on commissions. I mean, a lot of our trading profits are just a little piece on inventories returning quickly. If there's no volume, it's harder to do. And certainly, if there's no volume, there is commission. So in October, we -- the early weeks, trading profits are down a little bit because we had good days and bad days, but I think well-managed. The commission volume was way up as people looked whether it was the market or movements in -- because of changes in TIMCO and other things, there was activity. Who knows what's driving it, but volatility is a big help on the commission line and if we manage our inventories well, I think we'll do fine. So it's multiple factors.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. That was my follow-up on the commissions and how the increased volatility in October has impacted the Fixed Income Business because it sounds like it's been a fairly good lump on that front.","Paul Christopher Reilly","Yes, the front end was very, very good. So we'll see where it settles out whether it will continue. Now again, if rates stay flattish and nothing moves and there's no market for us, I think you're going to see a slowdown in commissions where people are just waiting again. So they like volatility. And the trading businesses, the sales businesses all like volatility. The same with equities. They like the volatility. It's people picking up the phone and making calls and making bets, and without it, people sit on the sidelines and just wait and watch, so a little volatility will be helpful. If you look at last year, I think we really didn't have much.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, makes sense. And my second question was around the asset management business. Just looks like you guys obviously don't break out the net flows in that $60-ish-or-somewhat billion number, but it sounded like -- it looked like you're just backing up the market. The flows were softer. Maybe even a little bit of outflows over the course of the quarter. I guess, a, is that a fair assessment? And b, maybe you can talk a little bit about the source and your outlook for flows and asset management business.","Paul Christopher Reilly","Yes, so our flows for the year were good. I mean, they were probably half our gains, so -- and we've had good flows. The only thing that impacted the fourth quarter and the asset management business is again, even though the S&P was flattish, small caps were down 5% depending on how you measure it and we've got and equal especially the large concentration of small caps. And mid-cap, good product, but that's in international, and those products weren't in favor. So they probably got a little sequentially hit in that quarter in that segment. But long term, I don't see any major issue. We tend to -- the segment is a whole outside of Eagle, which had a good year in recruiting. A little more outflows not net but in the normal. The net flows were positive. The asset management segment, the internal part has been very strong because of recruiting, so just to get more advisers. Those advisers choose to put some of the assets on our platforms and that grows. So we're not negative on it even though it was again choppy at the end there because of small caps.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time. Presenters, are there any closing remarks?","Paul Christopher Reilly","No. I just want to thank you all for joining, and it's great to have that you're in. We got about 5 minutes of celebration and then go on to the next meeting. We keep operating the company. So thanks for your support.

A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures may be found in the schedule accompanying our press release.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Paul Reilly, Chairman and CEO of Raymond James Financial. Paul?","Paul Reilly","All right. Thanks Paul. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. As usual, I'm going to give a brief summary of our results for the third quarter 2019 and then I'll turn the call over to Jeff, who will give more detail. And then I'll come back to discuss our outlook and open up for questions.","Overall, I am pleased with our results for the third quarter, despite some elevated expenses and decline in Investment Banking revenues that were both largely timing-related, business metrics were strong and I'm encouraged by the solid performance in a number of key areas during the quarter.","Quarterly net revenues of $1.93 billion increased 5% over the prior year's fiscal third quarter and increased 4% over the preceding quarter. We generated quarterly earnings per diluted share of $1.80, lifted by higher Private Client Group fee-based assets and higher net interest income, primarily at Raymond James Bank compared to a year ago period.","We ended the period with record results for client assets under administration of $824.2 billion, financial assets under management of $143.1 billion and total Private Client Group financial advisers of 7,904, as well as record net loans for RJ Bank of $20.7 billion.","Annualized return on total equity for the quarter was 16.1%. And while it isn't a metric that we use, the world does seem to be moving towards measuring and reporting on return on tangible common equity. And if you looked at our discussion in our last Analyst and Investor Day in June, our adjusted return on tangible equity on annualized basis for the preceding quarter would have been approximately 180 basis points higher than the adjusted return on equity. Given a fairly consistent metric, we think that same result would be similar this quarter.","Through the first nine months of the fiscal year, we generated record net revenue of $5.72 billion, which was up 6% net income of $769 million, which was up 29% and adjusted net income of $784 million, which was up 10% over the first nine months. And notably all four of our core segments generated record net revenue during the first nine months compared to last fiscal year.","Now turning to the segment results. In the Private Client Group, we generated net revenue of $1.35 billion and pre-tax income of $140 million during the quarter. Revenue growth of 6%, over both the prior year's third quarter and the preceding quarter, was largely driven by higher assets under management and related admin fees, as we continue to experience very strong growth of the Private Client Group assets and fee-based accounts.","These fee-based account assets ended the quarter at a record $398 billion, representing 51% of total client assets in the segment and reflecting growth of 16% over June of 2018 and 5% growth over March of 2019. This growth has been driven by strong net additions of financial advisers, equity market appreciation and increased utilization of fee-based accounts, which we believe is a long-term trend that our industry will continue to see.","Most importantly, financial adviser retention and recruiting remain solid, resulting in us achieving a record number of financial advisers of 7,904 at the end of the period, healthy net increases of 185 over June 2018 and 42 over March of 2019. Even in the increasingly competitive recruiting environment, our client-facing culture, multiple affiliation options and robust service solutions continue to resonate with existing and prospective advisers.","Now let me touch on some headwinds for the segment. First, our client domestic cash sweep balances of $38.2 billion declined 9% from the prior quarter, largely due to quarterly fee payments, tax-related seasonality and increased allocation to other investments. We believe the decline in cash balances was slightly elevated this quarter as the conversion of the money market sweep option in June caused advisers and clients to increase their allocation to other investments such as positional money market funds.","Cash sweep balances have decreased in July with quarterly fee payments that are made during the first month of each quarter. The segment also experienced elevated business development expenses this quarter due to the timing of conferences, recognition events for advisers and increased advertising expenses reflected in the Other segment. This resulted in similar sequential increase in business development expenses that we experienced in the year ago period which Jeff will touch on.","The Capital Markets segment generated net revenues of $251 million and pretax income of $24 million for the quarter. While Fixed Income had another relatively strong quarter the segment's results were negatively impacted by large sequential decline in M&A revenues. As you recall, the M&A -- M&A had a record first half of the year and even after this quarter has a record all-time, we believe that the M&A pipeline remains very strong and the timing of closings is inherently lumpy, but we're optimistic about this business.","The Asset Management segment generated record revenues of $177 million and record pretax income of $65 million during the quarter. Financial assets under management ended the quarter at a record $143.1 billion, an increase of 6% over June of 2018 and 3% over March of 2019.","Overall, the growth of financial assets under management continues to be largely driven by equity market appreciation and positive inflows associated with the increased utilization of fee-based accounts in the Private Client Group segment, which has more than offset the net outflows experienced by Carillon Tower Advisors, given the extremely challenging market for actively managed products.","In the bank, Raymond James Bank generated record quarterly net revenues of 215 million and record quarterly pretax income of $138 million during the fiscal third quarter. Record net loans of $20.7 billion grew 9% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. The growth in loans during the quarter was driven by the C&I portfolio, residential mortgage loans and securities-based loans to our Private Client Group.","RJ Bank's net interest margin modestly expanded to 337 basis points in the fiscal third quarter, up seven basis points over a year ago third quarter and two basis points over the preceding quarter. Jeff will get into more detail on what affected the NIM. Importantly, the credit quality of the bank's loan portfolio remains strong, including the payoff of a handful of criticized loans that contributed to the loan loss benefit of $5 million this quarter, despite strong net loan growth during the quarter. So overall a strong quarter, a record first nine months for the fiscal year.","Now, I'll turn it over to Jeff, who will provide more color on the financial results. Jeff?","Jeff Julien","Thank you, Paul. On the revenue side of the P&L, virtually all line items had only minor variances from your consensus model this time which is pleasing to see I guess in that we've gotten the story across accurately particularly with the new line items from a year ago. So, I'm going to limit my comments to adding color to a couple of the larger dollar changes from the preceding quarter.","First is our largest revenue line item with the asset-based fee revenues that we saw that nice double-digit gain of 12% from the -- sequentially which was exactly in line with the growth in the PCG fee-based assets in the March quarter which is the relevant time period as these are billed quarterly in advance.","Implication there of course is that the 4% growth in these assets for the current quarter, the June quarter should be indicative of Q4 growth in that line item, although it won't always be a perfect correlation like it was this time.","The other large variance dollar-wise was the Investment Banking revenues which again, I think all of you estimated fairly closely. The sequential decline of course was more due to the fact that we had a record M&A quarter in March not that this current quarter was weak, it was just coming off of a record which was a hard act to follow.","So that was actually down. M&A revenues were down $40 million for the quarter. The details of course are in the press release on Page 11, if you have the same pagination as I do in the Capital Markets P&L. The bottom line for revenues is that total net revenues of $1.927 billion up 4% sequentially were just smack on line pretty much with the consensus model.","On the expense side, I've got really two positives and two negatives to talk about. I'll just go in the order they were presented in the P&L. Compensation, our comp ratio was up to 66.3% which is a little higher than it has been in recent quarters. There are a couple of factors involved in that one of course is that drop in M&A revenues that we just talked about and that have a very high incremental margin as you add the productivity from those bankers.","Second would be, we're starting to see a little bit of the effect of the fairly aggressive hiring we've done over the last year or so in the compliance supervision areas. This falls into the PCG segment predominantly. That hiring pace of course has slowed by now, but it's starting to -- we're getting the full effect of the previous hiring now in our P&L.","And third, a third factor is the independent contractor portion of our Private Client Group segment which is somewhat larger than the employee portion as you can see by the relative FA counts in the press release. Actually it grew faster on a percentage basis, even though it's larger to start with it grew faster on a percentage basis this quarter than the employee side did as well.","So that has a much higher pay out attendant to those revenues which is going to have an impact on the comp ratio. And all these things are part of the reason that we didn't really change our target at the most recent Analyst Investor Day last month. We left that 66.5%. So we're still under that of course for the quarter and for the year.","Communications and information processing, that's continuing to trend well below where we had guided at the beginning of the year. We had talked about it averaging in the high 90s or so for the year. It looks like, it's going to be more to low to mid-90s or low 90s on average.","It's not that we're necessarily spending significantly less than we anticipated, but it's really that more of it's being spent on large capitalizable projects that we had expected. And you can sort of see that. If you look at the fixed asset detail of our balance sheet and our Ks, you can see that we have a capitalized software number that's grown pretty steadily over the course of these last few years. And of course the amortization of those comes into the P&L guidance that we give in the current period and future periods.","But I will also mention here that in keeping with our principle of conservatism, I would tell you that we only capitalize what we have to for GAAP. And when we're assigning useful lives to the sometimes purchased, sometimes developed software we do try to err toward the low end of any reasonable range. So -- but future amortization of course is going to be -- continue to be a factor in earnings.","And then business development, well above our guidance, I think we had talked about this somewhat exhaustively a year ago. We had a similar experience, but for different reasons. At that time we said, we really kind of expect this line item to average between $45 million and $50 million per quarter for the year. And it would be on the low-end of that in the first two quarters and the high-end of that in the second two quarters. Well I think our annual guidance is still pretty accurate on that, but the range is just wider than we thought. In the first two quarters, we were below the $45 million. And this quarter, we're well above the top end of that little range. So really, I think our guidance is right, but the range is probably more like $40 million to $55 million rather than $45 million to $50 million.","So things impacting this quarter of course as Paul already mentioned, we had multiple FA recognition events as well as our largest conference of the year. And then we also this year had $5 million worth of advertising time compared to virtually none in the first two quarters. And we're expecting a similar number in that advertising line for this coming quarter. So bottom line, I think that we'll be right on it for the fiscal year just like I said a wider range than we had initially anticipated.","And the other positive for the quarter was the bank loan loss provision. We actually had several criticized loans pay off during the quarter. Effect of that more than offset the provision related to the $550 million of net loan growth that we had during the quarter. And now you can actually see that decline in criticized loans. If you look at the bank detail again on my page 16 of the release, where we have some of the bank statistics they're down about $50 million for the quarter.","Net interest, which Paul touched on a little bit. The bank net interest margin actually improved a little bit by two basis points. And again on page 17 of the release, there's detail about the bank's net interest margin. But one of the main factors was when we changed from crediting clients' cash balances based on their aggregate assets with the firm to based on their aggregate cash balances with the firm. The bank turned out to be the primary beneficiary of that as they are generally the first bank in our waterfall and they have -- so people that have small accounts or smaller cash balances are almost always in our bank first.","So they've got the majority of the small accounts, which obviously engender a lower crediting rate than the larger balances. So they actually had a nicer decline in cost of funds than we experienced in the overall firm. Another factor in that though you may see it and you'll see a decline in the yield on the corporate side of loans. And that has to do with LIBOR. Really LIBOR being predictive of a Fed rate cut and moving down pretty substantially during the quarter. And that in our commercial loan portfolio is largely tied to LIBOR.","The callable loans hadn't repriced, but those that did and the new ones came on we're tied to a LIBOR that had moved whereas our cost of funds side other than this change in methodology had not really changed. So the slight improvement was really the net of those two things for the quarter. I will comment that our spread on funds swept to unaffiliated banks still remains about where it was a little under 200 basis points. And that I will remind you is reflected in account and service fees not in net interest.","Cash sweep balances dropped 8.5% in the quarter. I think we talked about this again at the recent Analyst Day where we had given our sales force and clients about four months' notice that we were going to be eliminating the money market fund sweep. And as that date in June approached, a number of people took the opportunity to reposition to generally the -- mostly to positional money market funds. So those came out of the sweep balances. That didn't take effect on June 11.","And although the total sweep balances are down the one that we track really probably the most closely right now is RJBDP line of that which finances our bank's growth and happens to also to be our most profitable sweep option. That actually grew a little bit because of this conversion that I mentioned net of the runoff to other investments and positional funds.","As Paul mentioned, we continue to see some runoff of sweep balances, although it's moderating a little bit now, which going forward obviously will affect both account and service fees and possibly to a lesser extent net interest earnings going forward.","So we'll have to see if some of the speculation is right that hopefully we're getting near a bottom in terms of people who are moved what they would call investable cash in our sweep balances really are constituted primarily of what we would call operational funds.","A common question we get, of course, is what would the impact of a Fed rate cut be? I would just tell you that we intend to maintain our competitive position at\/or near the top of our peer group in virtually all of the strata of account sizes. So our impact is going to be largely dependent on what the competition does.","But as I mentioned at Analyst Day my best guess is that is if there's a 25 basis point rate cut next week that there would be something between a 60% and 80% deposit beta associated with that, which would mean a 15 to 20 basis point decline to clients, but would have a modestly negative impact to firms that follow that deposit beta in our case would compress our spread by five to 10 basis points. And again as we remind you each basis point's about $1 million a quarter to us. So five or 10 basis points you can do the math.","So I'll wrap it up just talking about the segment results page 8 of the release. I mean, for the quarter three of our four primary operating segments showed sequential improvement in both revenues and pre-tax income. But I would call our three steadier performers in terms of operating segments PCG, Asset Management and the bank. Our most volatile segment by far is Capital Markets, and they were down because they came off their record M&A quarter in March. So they actually showed just a slight decline from the strong March quarter.","But -- month results you see revenue improvement in all four primary operating segments and pre-tax improvement in all except PCG, which has been bearing the brunt of the negative impact of the declining cash sweep balances. We continue to finance the growth of the bank. And those cash balances are coming out of external banks where that spread would go to the Private Client Group.","And so -- and they are also bearing, obviously, some of these elevated expenses in comp that we talked about and business development. So bottom line is for nine months when you look at the year-over-year improvement, we have had a little bit of help from interest rates during that period and we certainly had some help from the market.","Although remember the beginning of this year, we had a pretty severe decline in December and 14% decline in the S&P. So we didn't really have three good quarters of fee billings. We really only had two out of the three. Yet we're still showing pretty nice improvement year-over-year.","And with that, I'll let Paul talk a little bit more about the outlook for Q4.","Paul Reilly","Great. Thanks Jeff. Well, first in the Private Client Group segment, we're entering the fourth quarter with fee-based assets, accounts up 5% on a sequential basis. And remember substantially all of the assets are billed based on beginning balances in the quarter. So billings should look pretty good in this segment.","Of course the offset, which you have decline as discussed is any decline in client cash balances and increased allocations to other investments and certainly whatever happens to interest rates. But overall we continue to experience very good financial adviser retention and recruiting. And in fact, although we may not hit our record for last year, we may come pretty close. And our recruiting pipeline is really extremely solid. And our employee side has really picked up where the independent has -- had led the way the first couple of quarters.","In the Capital Markets segment, while the timing of closings are always difficult to predict in M&A, the pipeline is very, very strong. And I think we're optimistic in that area.","Fixed Income results have improved last two quarters. And the rate environment is generally still conducive for trading activity, especially as interest rates move. However, we did go through the process of rightsizing the Fixed Income business somewhat and expenses during the year. So that certainly has helped their margins and should continue to.","The Asset Management segment, we entered the fourth quarter with financial assets under management of 6% year-over-year and 3% sequentially, which had also helped billings. Increased utilization of fee-based accounts in the Private Client Group as well as good return performance in Carillon Tower should help here.","The Raymond James Bank, we started the fourth quarter with record loan balances and attractive net interest margin. I think the bank remained very, very disciplined in its loan portfolio. I see that our numbers said that our credit was non-core, but when we add it to expenses in the last couple of quarters they were certainly were considered core. I think it was just a measure of good credit discipline. And so I think they're -- that we're very -- feel very good about the bank's positioning.","Our capital levels obviously remain very strong with the total capital ratio for third quarter 25%. We continue to deliberately deploy our capital. In the third quarter, we purchased a little over a million shares for $85 million.","And through the first nine months of fiscal 2019 we repurchased 7.7 million shares for $591 million at an average price of $76.70 per share. That leaves us with $373 million of availability under the $505 million share repurchase authorization, which was increased by the Board of Directors in March of 2019. We'll continue to be proactive in offsetting share-based compensation dilution while remaining opportunistic with incremental repurchases.","Following the last two investments last year Silver Lane Advisors and ClariVest will continue to be very active in pursuing opportunities to grow our business and larger ones, but only if they can meet our criteria of the strong cultural fit a good strategic fit and something we can integrate at a price that's reasonable. We're working very, very hard at this and continue to follow the same guidance we've been giving you.","So overall, we've entered the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 we have a lot of tailwinds; record number of Private Client Group advisors, record PCG fee-based assets of 5% higher than the start of the preceding quarter, record high spreads on cash balances record net loans at RJ Bank and a strong pipeline for financial advisor recruiting and M&A. But we certainly have headwinds including declining cash balances and what happens there and certainly any impact of potential of rate changes which we obviously can't control, but we'll react to.","So, with that, I'm going to turn it over to Jessa and open the line for questions. Jessa?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Craig Siegenthaler","Hey, thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Paul Reilly","Good morning, Craig.","Craig Siegenthaler","So I just wanted to ask a question on the bank after the recent decline in interest rates. But from your seat how do you compare the relative returns between deposits allocated to the Raymond James Bank and also third-party banks? And also how do you determine the size of the Raymond James Bank?","Paul Reilly","Well, we look at return on our equity no matter where we put it. We get just under 200 basis points on our sweep and earn 373 spread on our bank. So we just look at the return on capital how we allocate it and look at controlled growth in the bank. So we have some internal governors on how large we'd like the bank to be all of it for the business. But I think you're going to see a very similar strategy as we go forward that you've seen over the last few years both in size and how we deploy.","Craig Siegenthaler","Got it. And just as my follow-up, we saw a little bit of a slowing in the break rate broker trend in the March quarter partly due to the backdrop including government shutdown. But I'm just wondering have you seen a pick-up in the migration of advisers away from wirehouses and smaller broker-dealers given the improving equity market backdrop we've seen year-to-date?","Paul Reilly","Honestly, we haven't seen a lot of slowdown. So we are again at pace to be nearer last year's record. You can see it by the number of advisors that we have now. If you look at the pipeline of commits and visits it's very, very robust. So if anything there may be an increase certainly in the employee side. Independent's been really active the first three quarters, but the employee side is really active. And again it usually comes and goes with market. But I'd say in all of our affiliation options we're having very good results on recruiting.","Craig Siegenthaler","Thank you. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Paul Shoukry","Steve, hello. Are you on mute?","Steven Chubak","Yes, sorry, I was muted. My apologies. So much coughing in the background earlier, so figured --","Paul Shoukry","No problem.","Steven Chubak","Appreciate some color on the high comparable per role in the quarter. I'm just wondering in terms of the revenue outlook, if I look at Street expectations just given the forward curve, people are anticipating I think rightfully so continued fee momentum helped by strong organic growth. But the Fed easing cycle which is beyond your control will weigh on NII and spread revenue.","And as you think about your ability to maybe hold the line on comp is that something that's achievable given the expectation for multiple rate cuts in the back half? And just trying to thinking about your philosophy if the growth from here is primarily driven by fee income versus NII.","Paul Reilly","Really we think we're going to get -- given the market we should have good fee income growth. Now, the only difference between those revenue streams is we have a comp cost to fee income growth and not really any comp cost in net interest. So, even though I think this -- the fee income growth will be -- should be good certainly with a 5% tailwind going into the quarter, certainly any offset on net interest is going to hurt.","But again I think any of those adjustments are going to be more short-term than long-term and are just -- if markets move up or down we get impacted. But I think we'd do a good job of managing through those so...","Jeff Julien","It depends on what you're projecting. If you're projecting Fed rate cuts then I think you're right in not assuming that NII is going to be a revenue driver. If you're projecting maybe one cut only or no cuts, then it's going to be dependent on how well we're able to hold onto or grow cash balances.","Steven Chubak","I understand. Just as a follow-up to the expense remarks you just made one of the other big areas of debate is any flexibility that you guys have to maybe manage non-comp lower at least slow the pace of non-comp inflation you've made a lot of investments in systems and technology over the last couple of years. That's clearly helped accelerate organic growth. Is there any potential to flex that as the NII backdrop becomes a bit more challenging?","Paul Reilly","I think we always have the opportunity certainly on revenue outlook in the medium term to impact expenses comp and non-comp. So, you can see in Fixed Income we did that and we went from a market where we're just breakeven to 15% ROE. Part was market helped but a lot of that was cost discipline. And if we see those trends in other areas of the business we're going to have to look at more cost discipline for sure.","But you're right a lot of our somewhat elevated expenses are to get on and to stay ahead of our adviser growth. So, whether that's support or compliance supervision or systems it's had a big payoff on net adviser growth. But it does hit short-term comps. So, I think to help us on comp I mean on to the numbers it'd be great to slow down recruiting.","I don't think it's a great long-term benefit so -- but we always have those flexibilities. And I think we've shown that discipline. In any slowdown or recession we've reacted pretty well on cost and certainly we'll do that if we think it's needed to be done.","Steven Chubak","Thanks Paul. And just one follow-up for me on account and service fees. You quoted the spread on off-balance sheet cash at 200 basis points. It looks like some intra-quarter volatility in terms of the movement in balances impacted the calculated fee rate. I'm just wondering given where the balances exit the quarter in June, what's the right jumping off point for account and service fee revenue? This seems to have been the biggest source of shortfall versus consensus expectations, so just want to make sure that we're modeling that appropriately.","Jeff Julien","Again, it depends how you want to model client cash balances. That's the line item that will be most impacted by whatever fluctuation you want to assume in client cash balances. We've had run off obviously that's had a negative impact on that line item because external bank sweeps are the ones that are impacted first because we're going to continue to finance the growth of Raymond James Bank as long as we can.","So, the external banks are the -- get the remainder if you want to call it that. Then to the extent that keeps dropping that's going to be the line item affected more than net interest earnings.","Steven Chubak","All right. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell from Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.","Jim Mitchell","Hey, good morning. Just maybe you talked about as a recruitment could be close to last year's record. But when I look at year-over-year net growth, it's about a little less than half of last year's growth. So I'm just trying -- are you sort of indicating that second half I guess additions could be a lot stronger or am I missing something I guess in that analysis?","Paul Reilly","So when we look at it, I know you guys look at FA count, we look at trailing 12s recruited. And I think that's the measure. If you look at 2009, we had a lot of individuals, but in last year it wasn't even close in trailing 12. So we look at the trailing 12 recruited rather than look at the advisory count itself. [Technical Difficulty]","Jeff Julien","And I would also caution you instead of looking at advisory growth to see how well we're doing I mean certainly look at the total asset growth. I mean a lot of the runoff of advisers are people that don't make it in the business, people that retire, reasons they leave. In a lot of cases, their assets stay here with their team or with some other advisers. So, it's really the asset growth that's more important, and with our recruiting metrics and records we're talking about really part of the gross production we're creating as Paul said.","Paul Reilly","I do think that too and especially we saw the impact in the first quarter, our first quarter, because we've had a lot of retirements as the industry has. So what we measure when we talk about recruiting, we're talking about the gross number. But as you look into the net number, an awful lot of those retirements or unfortunately we got people or passed away, we've kept the asset. So they've gone on to other advisers. And so that's really what we track. And that's why we look at kind of non-regretted attrition. Certainly, if someone passes away, it's regretted. It's a death in the family. But if we keep the assets from a financial standpoint, it isn't as negative. It certainly is to the people and us and the people we know, so.","Jim Mitchell","Right. So, it's just a higher quality FA you're bringing on. Is there a way to think about the timing of last year's versus this year's? If last year was close to record, do you have 75% of the assets and fees over or is there still -- is it 100%, 50%? Just trying to think of how much more you have from last year's recruiting class versus the new kind of recruiting trailing 12 months you're getting this year?","Paul Reilly","It's hard to tell. It's so individualized. We think in the first six months to a year, we get a majority of them and it may trail for a little bit while after, and then the growth is really due to their growth of production. Most all these teams that we recruit aren't just because they have assets. It's because they're looking to grow. So, it's so individualized. But you're going to see momentum as you've seen in the past. Assets are still coming over from our recruiting. And those -- we keep the pipeline filled we're going to continue to have that push.","Jeff Julien","It's certainly reasonable to assume something like a 6-month lag of assets coming in versus production recruited. So, I mean if you have a -- last year's record production year, we kind of get the benefit a lot of those assets coming in this year. And this year is the same way with next year's assets.","Jim Mitchell","Great. Okay. And Jeff, maybe one just follow-up on deposit, your deposit costs were down 8 basis points quarter-over-quarter. Obviously, the change in the relationship pricing was that -- was driving them. Just -- is that all impacted in this quarter? Is there some -- a little bit of on an average basis? Do we get a little bit more next quarter or is there some or -- and\/or is there some other dynamic that centered it lower than basis points?","Jeff Julien","That's substantially all of it. It didn't happen exactly at the beginning of the quarter, but I would -- that's about what we modeled in as the impact. So I wouldn't assume any future benefit from that.","Paul Reilly","And I do think that especially when you look at the bank that -- where LIBOR is predicted and you get benefit going up, because LIBOR moves usually before Fed funds, I think the bank has seen a lot of that loan repricing already. So any change in the cost of funds should be under total deposit and not in negatives.","Jim Mitchell","Great. Okay, great. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Katz from Citi. Please go ahead.","Brian Wu","Hi, good morning. This is Brian Wu on for Bill Katz. Appreciate the comments on client cash sorting. Any update you can provide on client cash in July?","Jeff Julien","We've continued to see -- I think -- I don't have the exact number. It's been another $1 billion or so, I think through today runoff of -- into -- mainly into position of money market funds. These are the \u2013 in \u2013 oh, yeah, I'm sorry. And of the big part of that as Paul mentioned is that the beginning of every quarter we have the quarterly fee taken out of accounts. That's generally just an account subtraction. Over the course of the quarter money coming into the accounts through dividends interest whatever and repositioning \u2013 positions it for the next quarter. So that number coming out in fees is about $700 million to $800 million at the beginning of each quarter right now. So that's really been the primary reason, we see a decline so far in July. But we see that every quarter, and again it builds back up over the course of the quarter.","Brian Wu","Got it. And how should we think about the funding mix for the bank, if client cash continues to run off?","Jeff Julien","It's entirely possible that our bank's going to be entertaining other funding sources aside from our sweep program over time. We're already \u2013 we've already looked at some. We've done one CD issuance through our syndicated desk, a secondary market CD. We're looking at alt \u2013 immediate \u2013 or we're looking already at alternative funding sources at the bank level preparing for the eventuality that sweep balances are not available given our internal limitations or in general to continue to support the growth of the bank. And we don't \u2013 if we do the math, we'll have to see whether it makes sense for us to run the bank in place, or whether it makes more sense for us to continue to grow the bank with external funding sources. I think the answer's going to be the latter, but we don't know that for a definitive fact yet. So we are exploring alternative funding sources of various types at the bank. We have been for the better part of the year actually in anticipation of what you're talking about.","Paul Reilly","Yeah, so agree everything with what Jeff said. And the only caveat is right now we are funding basically almost exclusively internally and cash sweep balances moderate the exit or grow we're going to be fine. If they continue to go down at some point you've got to have alternatives and that's what we're exploring.","Brian Wu","Great. Thank you for taking my question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Harris from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Chris Harris","Thanks, guys. How do you think interest rate cuts will affect the customer cash balances? I ask that question because a lot of people think it would actually help to stabilize those balances. I'm just wondering, if you guys would agree with that?","Paul Reilly","Our premise, which I don't know why your \u2013 always people ask us to predict what's going to happen with interest rates given our \u2013.","Jeff Julien","Or balances.","Paul Reilly","Or balances. But I think too right now the attraction has been positional money markets and the spread between that and FDIC insurance. And I think that, if rates come in and that spread decreases that the cash sweep is going to be even a better option than the money markets if rates have come in. So I think we agree with that. But we'll see what happens.","Jeff Julien","I am in the camp that it will help stabilize the balances at least by the second rate cut or so. The first one may not have a big impact or maybe even the second one. But beyond that, if there are that many rate cuts I think \u2013 I certainly think it will minimize the differential that they can get elsewhere.","Chris Harris","All right. That's great. And my follow-up question relates to the bank, excellent credit quality again this quarter. Bigger picture how would you guys characterize the risk profile of the bank today? And specifically wondering, how you think the loan portfolio the risk profile of that compares to say how the loan portfolio looked in 2007.","Paul Reilly","So I think that the biggest difference the bank is much more diversified. And back in pre-2008, 2009 we were almost purchase mortgages or C&I was really our portfolio. So today C&I is certainly is a much smaller percentage. It's much more diversified, but I believe the credit quality in the C&I and other parts of the equation is good. So I view we're in good shape and more diversified in our product portfolio.","Jeff Julien","And we didn't have an SBL portfolio in 2007, which is extremely a good source of business for us. Most of our mortgages now are originated versus purchased. So \u2013 and we have extremely good credit quality within our client base as you can imagine. And we have a tax-exempt portfolio, which we didn't have in 2007, which are loans to investment-grade municipalities. So it's \u2013 I think in \u2013 it's more diversified and probably on average much better quality than it was in 2007. And remember, we survived 2008 or 2009 without particular ugly -- with no real ugly hiccups. So it just -- to be in even better shape now, I think we're very well-positioned.","Paul Reilly","But we're also cognizant that anything can happen, so we watch it very, very carefully so.","Chris Harris","Very good. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan from JMP Securities. Please go ahead.","Devin Ryan","Great. Good morning, everyone.","Paul Reilly","Good morning","Devin Ryan","First question just on private client commissions. So they increased 2% from last quarter. We were thinking they could have been something a little bit better than that just with trailing commissions increasing from the move higher in average daily balances like in mutual funds which I think were only up about 1%. So I'm just curious, if there's any lag in there sometimes the accounting can be a little bit funky. Or was it just lighter transactional activity like new sales being slower which offset some of the benefits of the average daily balance increases?","Jeff Julien","I think it's just a continuation of the trend towards fee-based assets away from commissionable activity in the Private Client Group side. The people we're recruiting are heavy users of fee-based alternatives. And it's just been a continuing trend you've seen that -- if you map that for the last two to three years, I think you'd see a pretty steady decline in commissionable activity in PCG. No real change there.","Devin Ryan","Yes, okay. Got it. And then just a follow-up here on M&A opportunities, I know we touched on this a bit at the Investor Day, but even since then there's press out that USAA may be looking to sell their wealth management business. I know that's a different business, but just something notable activity in kind of financials Investment Banking, so just wanted to get a little perspective on your corporate development function business development. How active is it right now? And how are you guys kind of thinking about M&A kind of balancing views that are out there that we may be late cycle versus long-term opportunities that would come along?","Paul Reilly","Look Devin, I would describe us as active as ever looking at all sorts of opportunities. And I would view the market as a lot of people or more people looking maybe at a possible transaction. The problem is that, I think some of that in certain categories are driven by a belief that it's late cycle. The pricing doesn't necessarily -- it reflects peak growth. So, you still got that delta, so it may take a little bit of adjustment before pricing realizes.","So through our view, if we look at transactions, first they have to fit. There are a lot of transactions that happen that just don't fit our model. So, they just aren't good fits for us. But the -- and some are just culturally aren't good fits. But I would say the biggest -- there is more interest that I think the pricing has to reflect kind of reality and not peak because they think there's going to be a cycle change, so those are the challenges. But we're very active in talking to folks though.","Jeff Julien","Another silver lining to the market correction whenever it comes along with increased cash balances.","Devin Ryan","Great. Would -- I guess just on that point, I've always had the impression that Raymond James doesn't need to be the high bidder because -- especially in wealth management because your retention tends to be quite a bit better, so the earn-outs over time, the seller may actually do better even at the lower price. So how does that play in? And is that an accurate thought process?","Paul Reilly","I don't know. We've never tried to be the high bidder, so we're in -- what's most impressive about I think to us on recruiting results especially at the high end, our retention agreements are substantially -- offers are substantially lower than other firms and yet people still join us. I would say when it comes to M&A that depends. If it's public company or something it's hard to be not near the high bidder and I'd say there are some that are private that we always ask ourselves are we being too conservative, but we've seen a number of things where we were first choice spiritually second by price in the line with a number of other people. But somebody had a bid that was 30% to 50% higher. So you can't beat outlier bids just to win a deal. And I think that's been more the frustration than anything for us where we were preferred, but the premium someone else was willing to pay was just too high. So we just again remained disciplined and said our job is to have an ROE for shareholders not just to be bigger.","Devin Ryan","Yeah. Great. Thank you.","Paul Reilly","Thank you.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Alex Blostein","Hey, good morning. Thanks. Paul a question to you regarding some of the earlier comments you made on the call and that kind of echoes your comments at the Investor Day as well just around the more competitive recruiting practices out there. How are you guys thinking about that impacting your guys' franchise? Should we think about the cost of bringing in new financial advisers going up all the time for Raymond James or you guys are going to try to stay disciplined, which may ultimately result in slightly lower net new asset growth?","Paul Reilly","So I think the results so far as we've -- I'd say, we've had some slight increases at times to close the gap, but we certainly haven't matched. We've stayed very, very disciplined yet the result is that this year will be close to last year's record even though we've seen a high an increase of the number of competitors offering substantially more. So our focus is that although we lose some really good people that we would like the people that join us are joining us for the right reasons, it's not just the biggest check.","Certainly, we think what we offer is very fair to the adviser and long-term they can do just as well and what we think we can help them with their practice. And it's hard when you really want someone to stay disciplined, but we stay disciplined and just say overall it's the right thing to do for the advisers that are here. And bring in the new advisers at a fair price. And it helps reinforce the culture and we get the people that I think are joining for the right reasons.","So it's just like M&A. You're -- there's something you may really want, but if it gets out-priced, you're better off just sitting on the sideline, and it's hard to do especially at -- if we are near the end of the cycle, it's always the worst and the hardest, so maybe it's an indication it is. So we just felt through our discipline and not being arrogant, we really -- we always second-guess ourselves and say, are we doing it right and I think we're doing the right thing. And our results have been -- I think this year will be almost as good as last year's even with this competitive pricing.","Alex Blostein","Right. All makes sense. A couple of follow-ups for Jeff. I guess on the rate sensitivities you talked about a 25 basis point cut is five basis points to 10 basis points, I guess compression in the NIM. Are you guys talking about the back NIM only or are you talking about the overall company NIM? And if it's just the bank maybe give us [Technical Difficulty] vast majority, but that would be helpful to get the full picture.","Jeff Julien","It would be felt partly by the bank and it would be felt partly in the account and service fees in the Private Client Group. So it would be kind of a split between those two segments, which are a direct, but it's hard to tell the exact proportion. Depends what we do on the grid of what we pay to clients, but they both feel it those two segments.","Alex Blostein","Right. And then the last just clean up in terms of bank funding sources just to follow-up to one of the earlier questions of the $14 billion that sits in third-party bank sweep today how much of that is ultimately still available to be moved through AJ before triggering any restrictions?","Paul Reilly","Well, so far that's been an -- more of an internal restriction than a market so most of our competitors put a lot more of their cash sweeps. I do think you're seeing one of the benefits of our discipline that we've had. You've read a number of firms that had restrictions on what they could do, because they've leveraged up their sweeps so much it's hit other trigger points and whether it's buying back stock or flexibility.","So we still have room. So we're getting closer to our internal numbers, but we have the ability to raise that I think comfortably still for a while. But again, we're not going to do -- what other people have done. We don't think -- we think it limits flexibility.","Jeff Julien","Yeah. We have some internal limitations that are the first triggers that we will hit, but then there are some external triggers too, such as we don't want to violate clients' ability to get the $3 million of FDIC insurance and put so much in our bank that they don't go through the waterfall, et cetera.","Those numbers are a little less than half of that $14 billion could still be directed to our bank and also without triggering some penalty rates, because we do have some contractual commitments, which are running off over time here with some third-party banks that we won't fall below a certain, but I guess a safe number to use would be a $6 billion type number in that. And we're not trying to dodge the question, but we have some internal constraints that would again be triggered before that comes into play.","Alex Blostein","Super. Great. Thanks very much, guys.","Paul Reilly ","Is that it? Well, great. So we appreciate you all joining us and I think we're as I've -- ended up in good shape. I think most of the indicators -- all indicators are really positive outside of the cash balances. We'll see what happens with this rate cut, if there's a rate cut this month. And we'll talk to you next quarter. So thank you very much for joining us.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."]}}
