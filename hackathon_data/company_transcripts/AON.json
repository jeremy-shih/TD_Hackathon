[Operator Instructions] I would also like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded and that it is important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements that are forward looking in nature, as defined by the Private Securities Reforms Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our third quarter results as well as have been posted to our website. Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, President and CEO of Aon plc. Thank you. You may begin.","Gregory C. Case","Thanks very much, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter 2014 conference call. Joining me today is our CFO, Christa Davies. I would note that there are slides available on our website for you to follow along with our commentary today, and consistent with previous quarters, I'd like to cover 3 areas before turning the call over to Christa for further financial review. First is our performance against key metrics we communicate to shareholders. Second is overall organic growth performance, and third, continued areas of strategic investment across Aon. On the first topic, our performance versus key metrics. Each quarter, we measure our performance against the key metrics we focus on achieving over the course of the year: grow organically, expand margins, increase earnings per share, and deliver free cash flow growth.","Turning to Slide 3. In the third quarter, organic revenue growth was 3% overall, driven by strong growth in HR Solutions. Operating margin was flat. A strong margin improvement in HR Solutions was offset by unfavorable impact from both revenue timing and foreign currency translation in Risk Solutions. EPS increased 14% to $1.29, reflecting underlying operational improvement, a lower effective tax rate and strong share repurchase. Finally, free cash flow was $704 million on a year-to-date basis, as we head into our strongest cash flow quarter. Overall, in our seasonally weakest quarter, results reflect double-digit earnings growth, driven by underlying operational improvement and effective capital management. In addition, we've returned a record $2 billion of capital to shareholders through the first 9 months of 2014.","Turning to Slide 4, on the second topic of growth. I'm going to spend the next few minutes discussing the quarter for both of our segments. In Risk Solutions, organic revenue growth was 1%, reflecting growth across Retail Brokerage, partially offset by an anticipated decline in Reinsurance and a $15 million unfavorable impact from timing. As we discussed previously, we're driving a set of initiatives that are strengthening underlying performance and positioning our Risk Solutions segment for long-term growth and improved operating leverage, with management of a renewal book through Client Promise and retention rates of more than 90% on average, highlighting strong client satisfaction in our retail business; new business generation of $216 [ph] million across our retail business, highlighted by another quarter of strong new business in U.S. retail; and double-digit new business growth in many markets across Asia and the EMEA region; increased operating leverage from our investments in innovative technology and client service capabilities with the growth of GRIP and Aon Broking. And in our core treaty reinsurance business, net new business trends have now been positive for 14 consecutive quarters, an outstanding performance in today's changing marketplace that reflects Aon Benfield's long-term value proposition for clients, focusing on data, analytics and the application of excess capital in the industry to previously uninsured risks.","Reflecting on the individual businesses within Risk Solutions. In the Americas, organic revenue growth was 2% against the strong comparable of 5% in the prior year quarter. Exposures continue to be positive across the region, while the impact from pricing was flat, resulting in continued stable market impact. We saw strong growth across Latin America and in our U.S. Affinity business. New business continues to be strong across the region, specifically in U.S. retail. Results in the quarter were partially offset by an $8 million of unfavorable timing across U.S. retail and Canada that we expect to largely reverse itself as a benefit in Q4. In international, organic revenue growth was 2%, similar to the prior year quarter. Exposures were stable, and the impact from pricing was modestly negative on average, driven by fragile conditions in many regions across Europe. Results reflect strong growth across Asia, driven by double-digit new business generation in many countries with solid growth in a number of other markets, New Zealand, Italy and France, to name a few. In Continental Europe, we continue to deliver solid growth against sustained economic and market headwinds, driven by strong management of our renewal book portfolio. Results in the quarter were partially offset by $4 million of unfavorable timing. Macro conditions remain relatively fragile across many core markets in Europe. However, despite uncertainty around economic recovery, we continue to see signs of stabilization throughout this region in Q3.","In reinsurance. As we noted on previous calls, we expect macro factors to be a headwind in 2014. Overall, organic revenue growth was minus 4% against a strong comparable of 5% in the prior year quarter. Results reflect a significant unfavorable market impact in treaty, a decline in capital markets transactions and advisory business closing in the quarter and $3 million of unfavorable impact from timing. We saw solid growth in facultative placements, and as I mentioned earlier, positive net new business for the 14th consecutive quarter in treaty placements. In Q4, we expect organic revenue to improve modestly from Q3, driven by growth in our capital markets transactions and advisory business and a modest benefit from timing, while treaty will continue to be pressured by negative market impact.","Overall, across total Risk Solutions, we're generating new business across the portfolio, while absorbing market pressure in Reinsurance and unfavorable timing in Q3. We expect stronger organic growth in the fourth quarter, driven by new business growth in the Americas and a modest improvement in Reinsurance.","Turning to HR Solutions. Organic revenue growth was 7%, with growth in both consulting and outsourcing. Included in third quarter results was an anticipated favorable impact from timing of revenue and compensation consulting. This timing unfavorably impacts results in the first half of 2014. Excluding this benefit, underlying organic revenue for HR Solutions was 4% compared to flat in the prior year quarter. Underlying performance in the third quarter reflects growth in areas where we're making investments in the business, including pension risk and delegated investment solutions. These investments reflect Aon Hewitt's client leadership, understanding and influence of market trends, and solutions to sustainably address the long-term issues that face our clients, as health care reform, health care costs and the associated financial risks continue to rise at a time when overall health and wellness is not improving. Multinational clients are increasingly looking for global benefit solutions that support their global organizations, delivered at the local level, managing and transferring risk against pension schemes that are increasingly frozen, largely underfunded and facing regulatory changes.","Turning to the individual businesses within HR Solutions. In consulting, organic revenue growth was 14%. As previously noted, the quarter includes an anticipated favorable impact from timing of revenue in compensation consulting. Excluding this benefit, underlying organic revenue growth for consulting was 6% compared to 3% in the prior year quarter. Underlying results reflect strong growth in U.S. retirement, primarily for investment consulting. We saw an increase in demand for project work to help clients address lump sum windows and for actuarial services on defined benefit plans to support clients facing regulatory changes, specifically the recently passed Highway Bill. For the full year, we continue to expect mid-single-digit organic growth across Consulting Services.","In Outsourcing, organic revenue growth was 3% compared to minus 1% in the prior year quarter. Growth primarily reflects new client wins in benefits administration and project-related revenue, driven by demand for discretionary services. For the full year, we expect stronger organic growth in Outsourcing when taking into consideration the seasonality of revenue recognition and health care exchanges in Q4.","Slide 5 highlights the third topic: areas of investment. Aon has a unique and strong track record of developing innovative solutions to help solve problems in response to specific client needs. Solid long-term operating performance, combined with expense discipline and strong free cash flow generation, continues to enable substantial investment in colleagues and capabilities around the globe. A few examples include: in Risk Solutions, we're investing in client leadership with the international rollout of Client Promise to drive greater productivity and efficiency. We're investing in innovative technology such as the Global Risk Insight Platform. GRIP is the world's leading global database of risk and insurance placement information, now capturing 2.2 million trades and $113 billion of bound premium. We continue to have a growing list of more than 35 insurance carriers utilizing the platform for its analytics and services capabilities. Nearly half of the clients have signed multi-year contracts, and an increasing number of clients are also adding strategic consulting services.","In addition, we're driving our Aon Broking initiative to better match client needs with insurer appetite for risk and to identify structured portfolio solutions. We continue to align our global health and benefits platform to better capitalize on our global distribution channel and deep brokerage capabilities. And further, we're developing analytics to create globally consistent actuarial valuation and benchmarking models for health and other employer-sponsored benefits. We're also investing in the continued development of data and analytics capability at Aon Benfield to strengthen an already industry-leading value proposition and client-serving capability. A great example of this is Aon Benfield's review [ph], a reinsurer dashboard, implementation support and strategic consulting to help insurers be more effective markets for seeding company clients. Finally, we're expanding our footprint through over $500 million of tuck-in acquisitions so far in 2014 at an [ph] increased scale in emerging markets or expanded capability to better serve clients such as the National Flood Services and Lorica. In HR Solutions, we're invested in innovative solutions to address high-growth areas. We're expanding solutions to derisk pension plans and are seeing tremendous growth in our delegated investment solutions, which fulfill our clients' needs for faster execution of their investment strategies.","Aon Hewitt is able to offer differentiated strategy based on our strong 3 pillars of actuarial expertise, investment solutions and pension administration. We're also providing a broader set of advisory and advocacy solutions to our clients' employees to enable greater choice and improve decision making on the retirement options, especially important as recent regulatory changes require more involvement from individuals. Further, we continue to make investments to support future growth and strengthen our industry-leading position in health exchanges for active employees and retirees as part of our comprehensive portfolio of health solutions, covering the full spectrum of benefit strategies. Across Aon's suite of private health exchanges, covered lives will increase by 60% to more than 1.2 million employees, retirees and eligible dependents for more than 100 companies across 19 industries, an outstanding result, as we saw 100% renewal rates, as well as over half of the clients continuing to be new. We continue to expand the number of industries and increase the number of carriers participating. Our model is bending the cost of health care and eliminating volatility for clients, while delivering more choice and strong satisfaction to employees. We feel good about our progress to date, the sustainability of the value proposition and our ability as a market leader to offer the most robust set of exchange solutions to clients. We also continue to invest in our industry-leading benefits administration solutions and technology platforms, including extensive mobile solutions and cloud-based outsourcing solutions. And finally, we're strengthening our international footprint to support a global workforce, with investments in key talent and capabilities across emerging markets.","In summary, we delivered strong earnings growth of 14%, despite a number of headwinds impacting results. Looking forward, we expect to deliver strong operating performance across both Risk and HR Solutions in the fourth quarter, benefiting from our investments in client-serving capabilities and resulting in a solid year of operational improvement and record-free cash flow generation. With that said, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Christa for further financial review. Christa?","Christa Davies","Thank you very much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg noted, our third quarter results reflect strong earnings growth in our seasonally weakest quarter, driven by underlying operational improvement and effective allocation of capital, highlighted by the repurchase of $500 million of ordinary shares in Q3.","Now let me turn to the financial results for the quarter on Page 6 of the presentation. Our core EPS performance, excluding noncash intangible asset amortization, increased 14% to $1.29 per share for the third quarter compared to $1.13 in the prior year quarter. Results in the quarter reflect operational improvement, a lower effective tax rate and strong share repurchase. In addition, foreign currency translation had a $0.01 unfavorable impact on EPS in the quarter, due primarily to a weaker dollar versus the British pound and a stronger dollar versus the Argentine peso. If currency were to remain stable at today's rates, we would expect a modestly higher unfavorable impact in the fourth quarter than we experienced in the current quarter.","Now let me turn to each of the segments on the next slide. In our Risk Solutions segment, organic revenue growth was 1%. Operating margin decreased minus 80 basis points to 20.3%, and operating income decreased minus 3% versus the prior year quarter. As Greg previously noted, timing impacted revenue unfavorably by approximately $15 million, which we expect will largely reverse as a benefit in Q4. In addition to unfavorable revenue timing, operating results in the third quarter include an $8 million or minus 40 basis point unfavorable impact from FX and $4 million of onetime cost related to closing the NFS acquisition. Together, these headwinds, totaling minus 120 basis points, more than offset underlying operational improvement in the quarter.","Let me spend a moment on the Aon Hewitt restructuring program. Approximately $99 million of estimated savings will be achieved in Risk Solutions. Approximately $94 million of accumulative savings have been achieved under the program to date, with the remaining $5 million to be achieved in the fourth quarter. We have incurred 100% of the charges necessary to deliver the remaining savings and expect to complete the Aon Hewitt restructuring program by the end of 2014. Overall, results in the third quarter were challenged by unfavorable impact from revenue timing, foreign currency translation, reinsurance market impact and certain onetime transaction costs, which offset solid underlying operational progress as we generate return on our investments and manage expenses. Year-to-date, Risk Solutions margins are up 10 basis points, including a minus 40 basis point unfavorable impact from foreign currency. We expect to deliver strong operating margin performance in Q4, resulting in solid margin improvement for the full year, placing us firmly on track for continued progress towards our long-term target of 26%.","Turning to the HR Solutions segment. Organic revenue growth was 7%. Operating margin increased 110 basis points to 16.5%, and operating income increased 15% versus the prior year quarter. Strong organic revenue growth and anticipated favorable impact from timing of revenue and a $9 million benefit from timing of certain expenses was partially offset by an anticipated increase in expenses related to future growth in health care exchanges.","With respect to the Aon Hewitt restructuring program, approximately $301 million of the $303 million in total cumulative savings have been achieved under the program, with the remaining $2 million to be achieved in the fourth quarter. As discussed previously, we provided guidance for Q3 to be relatively flat. This included favorable revenue timing in compensation consulting that negatively impacted the first half of 2012, and increased expense to support future growth in health care exchanges.","Our third quarter results were modestly better than previous guidance, primarily reflecting some incremental demand for project work in retirement consulting, and a $9 million benefit from timing of certain expenses. We expect the $9 million to unfavorably impact Q4 compared to our original expectations but have no impact on our full year outlook.","Throughout the year, we have provided commentary regarding the full year outlook for HR Solutions segment, and this remains unchanged. For HR Solutions in 2014, we expect to, number one, deliver organic growth; number two, generate greater scale and improved return from investments; number three, deliver remaining savings related to the restructuring program; number four, and lastly, deliver greater than mid-single-digit operating income growth and further margin expansion toward our long-term target of 22%. Overall, the outlook is unchanged, and we are firmly on track for greater than mid-single-digit operating income growth in 2014, with Q3 modestly better than anticipated and Q4 up substantially in our seasonally strongest quarter, including strong organic growth in our health care exchanges.","Now let me discuss a few of the line items outside the operating segments on Slide 9. Unallocated expenses decreased $4 million to $39 million, primarily driven by expense discipline in the quarter. Interest income was similar at $3 million. Interest expense increased $12 million due to an increase in total debt outstanding and costs associated with certain derivative hedging programs. Other income of $35 million primarily includes a gain on the sale of our eSolutions business and gains on certain long-term investments. These gains reflect our intent to optimize the portfolio around highest return capital as well as monetize unproductive capital. Going forward, we expect a run rate of approximately $1 million per quarter of interest income, $45 million of unallocated expense and $66 million of interest expense per quarter.","Turning to taxes. The effective tax rate on net income from continuing operations was 19.1% compared to 25.1% in the prior year quarter. The effective tax rate in the third quarter of 2014 was favorably impacted by changes in the geographic distribution of income, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from certain discrete tax items. Lastly, average diluted shares outstanding decreased to 296.1 million in the third quarter compared to 312.9 million in the prior year quarter. The company repurchased 5.8 million Class A ordinary shares for approximately $500 million in the third quarter. The company has $1.1 billion of remaining authorization under its share repurchase program. Actual shares outstanding on September 30 were 285 million, and there are approximately 10 million additional dilutive equivalents. Estimated Q4 2014 beginning dilutive share count is approximately 295 million, subject to share price movement, share issuance and share repurchase.","Now let me turn to the next slide to highlight our strong balance sheet and cash flow on Page 10. At September 30, 2014, cash and short-term investments were $599 million. Total debt outstanding was approximately $5.5 billion, and overall debt to capital decreased modestly to 43.3% at September 30 compared to 43.6% at June 30, driven by a decrease in total debt outstanding. For the first 9 months of 2014, cash flow from operations decreased 10% to $883 million, driven primarily by significant receivable collections in the prior year period, and higher-than-normal tax payments, partially offset by a decline in pension contributions. Free cash flow, as defined by cash flow from operations less CapEx, was $704 million, reflecting lower cash flow from operations and a $5 million increase in CapEx. Looking forward, the fourth quarter is our seasonally strongest cash flow quarter, and we are on track to deliver cash flow growth for the full year.","Turning to the next slide to discuss our significant financial flexibility. We value the firm based on free cash flow and allocate capital to maximize free cash flow returns. There are 3 primary areas that will contribute to our goal of doubling free cash flow to more than $2.3 billion annually by the end of 2017. From the graph in the presentation, based on current assumptions, we expect annual free cash flow to increase by over $600 million based only on a reduction in cash used for pensions and restructuring. Combined with growth in the core business, further margin expansion and a reduction in the overall effective tax rate, we are well on track to achieve our expectations for substantial cash flow generation. Regarding our underfunded pension plans, we have taken significant steps to reduce volatility and liability as we've closed plans to new entrants, frozen plans from accruing additional benefits, and continue to derisk certain plan assets. We currently expect contributions to decline by roughly $138 million to $385 million in 2014 and continue to decline thereafter.","Regarding our restructuring program, cash payments were $152 million in 2013. As all charges related to the restructuring program have now been incurred, we would expect cash payments to decline by $65 million to approximately $87 million in 2014, and continue to decline significantly each year thereafter.","In summary, we delivered double-digit earnings growth in the third quarter and have returned a record amount of capital to shareholders year-to-date. We expect strong performance in the fourth quarter, placing us firmly on track for growth, margin expansion in both segments and record-free cash flow generation for the full year. With a strong balance sheet and significant financial flexibility, we expect to generate more than $2.3 billion of annual free cash flow by the end of 2017. We have positioned the firm for significant shareholder value creation in 2014 and beyond. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Adam Klauber of William Blair.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Just 1 or 2 questions. In HR Solutions, could you talk about the pension transfer opportunity? You had one big win. How does the pipeline look? And also was this quarter helped by that one good-sized win?","Gregory C. Case","Adam, the pension opportunity, as the laws have sort of shifted and changed a bit, particularly, the Highway Bill, as I mentioned, created a number of different opportunities to support clients with demand. There was some influence on the quarter, but it will happen over time as we help clients sort of react to the situation. But overall, the business has just done very, very well. It's on a very, very good trajectory, but not an undue [ph] influence in the quarter but just will happen over time.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","So do you think that will be a good driver of growth as we look in '15 and '16 for that segment?","Gregory C. Case","Yes, I think it really is an indication of just the change that happens in this segment and just continues to happen. As you think about sort of the whole world around pensions and sort of what's going on, sort of in that context, clients continuing to have to react to different regulatory changes. And whether it's the Highway Bill we described before, in Montreal, there was a change in regulation that also impacted overall, so this is basically U.S., Canada. The U.K. is also seeing regulatory change. These sorts of changes are exactly what our clients have to react to and what we're very well equipped to help them support, and that drives fundamental demand in the business, and that will actually influence and help us and help our clients, not only in '14, but in '15 and '16 and beyond.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then as far as health exchanges, you had a good selling season. You added a fair amount of clients. There -- from what we can see, there was not one large jumbo client. Could you talk about maybe the mindset of some of the large jumbo clients in the pipeline as you think about the larger clients for the next couple of years?","Gregory C. Case","Well, we would say, look, Adam, fundamentally, we are very pleased with the progress we made around -- what is our mission here is a health solutions. That's really what we're trying to bring into the table and an objective and a mission we have on behalf of our clients. Against that, when you think about it, we have a base that's 23 million strong in terms of who we serve sort of in the health category, with $9.5 million in health and benefits alone, and it was really against that backdrop we brought forward was the first of its kind, which is the fully insured multi-carrier exchange. And as we reported, the results have been very, very strong, 1.2 million lives, 100-plus companies, in that context, 60% growth. And the pipeline we've got is exceptionally strong, stronger this year than it was last year as clients have sort of seen this come online. It's resulted in a fundamental bending of the cost curve, which is what we had hoped and anticipated. That includes, by the way, everything thrown in there, taxes, fees everything else, and a real meaningful cost for employee savings around that. We've also seen carriers come on board. So on the active side, 30-plus national and regional carriers. We've expanded coverage, over 10 elected benefits. And on the retiree side, 90-plus health insurance carriers with over 3,700 plans. So the fundamental chassis, the basis, the foundation is exactly what we hoped it would be. Even the industry, frankly, 19 different industries represented, finance, manufacturing, retail, health care technology. And I would say fundamentally, the thing that's driven this more than anything else, from our standpoint, we're excited about, is the impact on the employee. In the end, that's really what the whole focus of the mission is about. I think the numbers, as we've seen them, to date, over 85% of employees, 87%, in fact, love the ability to have choice, transparency and to really have a greater accountability. And a large percentage, 3\/4 of them really feel good about -- they're choosing the right health care plan for them, for their families, for their situation. So for us, we really have appreciated the trajectory that our colleagues have been able to build sort of in the category of exchanges. Remember, exchange is a part of our overall strategy, one piece of it, an important piece of it. Fully insured multi-carrier has just gone exceptionally well, and we anticipate that will happen over time. This was never about a quarter or a year for us. This is about, over a period of time, developing a meaningful business that will help serve our clients. And that's exactly where we think we are.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","And just one follow-up on exchanges. I know you have a partnership with eHealth, and they actually talked about it that they have -- it sounds like a fair amount of companies are going to be looking at helping their part-time employees potentially find coverage on the federal exchange or for -- yes, on the federal exchange. If that takes off, will that actually help -- will that revenue hit more in the first quarter and second quarter versus all in the fourth quarter?","Gregory C. Case","It's going to really be over time, as you tend to sort of think about how this evolves. And sort of depending on how it plays out, it's going to have a modest impact. And I just want to emphasize, overall -- again, as we think about the conversation around exchanges, exchanges, overall, when you think about sort of the impact to 2014, have really been an investment for us and will continue to be, as we start to see benefit in '15 and '16. But the category you're describing is important, because it affects individuals, but from a financial standpoint, will have minimal overall impact on us.","Operator","Next question, Dan Farrell, Sterne Agee.","Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","So tax rate again came in at a pretty low rate, and you've talked about some of the geographic things going on, but also some negative discrete items. I'm just wondering within the geographic items, is health exchange accounting leading to some seasonality there, where there's some losses booked early in the year, and, then obviously, a lot of gain in the back half?","Christa Davies","No. As we think about the effective tax rate, it's really a full year estimate. That's the way effective tax rates always work. And so as we think about our tax rate going forward, the year-to-date rate of 18.5% is really the best indicator of our underlying effective tax rate. And as we think about the tax rate, going forward, for full year '14 or '15, it's really looking at this underlying operating rate of 18.5%, and then that could change in any quarter or year based on discrete tax adjustments, which as we described, were -- negatively impacted it in Q3, positively impacted in Q2, and obviously, can be positive or negative going forward.","Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay, and then there's also just been a lot of talk around the double Irish, and I was wondering if you could just give any thoughts if there's any impact with regard to any businesses that you have there.","Christa Davies","There's no impact on us from that. We are a U.K. company with a global business, operating in 120 countries, and we don't comment on changes in local regulations or statutory changes.","Operator","Next question is Elyse Greenspan, Wells Fargo.","Elyse Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I was hoping to spend a little bit more time on your private health care exchange. I know you provided your enrollment figures and did speak positively, I guess, going forward about the pipeline. Just in terms of looking at your active exchange, if we look at the incremental number of companies this year, it's about 15, which is the same did join your exchange last year. Have you seen maybe some companies taking longer to make their decision? And if so, why have some companies held off? Were you surprised, I guess, in terms of the 15 that joined this year versus last year? And then, also, if you can just tie in, in terms of your long-term view surrounding the financials of this business? I believe in the past, you've said modest positive earnings in '14. Is that still the same? And then should we think about this as kind of growing from there when we look to 2015?","Gregory C. Case","Let me take those in turn. First, in terms of the ramp-up, no, we weren't surprised. And in fact we're not -- as we said before, we -- the mission we have is truly a mission around health solutions, the best set of integrated health solutions on behalf of clients. The fully insured exchange on the active side was -- it's just been a great platform. The clients who've joined it, I want to remind you, is literally 100% renewal rates. It doesn't mean that a client might come -- might not come off at some point in time, but right now, 100% renewal rates. So everybody who's on it has repeated, has seen tremendous benefits. Employees have really appreciated sort of the overall impact. And when you think about sort of the growth, it's been substantial, 60% growth in participants, as we said before, substantial growth in clients. And our view has always been we want to build this at the right pace and the right time. So we may very likely say to a client, \"Defer,\" if we think actually it will help from a communication or employee standpoint more than anything else. This is about building this in the right way and the right time, and that's exactly what our colleagues have done. So we feel very, very good about the platform, again, from a standing start to go where we are now. And remember, as we did this, we serve more employees than anyone sort of in this space. And we said for the fully insured multi-carrier, we were going to actually start this in the most sophisticated largest market in the world, and that's the large carrier. That's why our smallest is about the size of some of the others' largest sort of in this category. And so we've gone against sort of that backdrop to make sure we're bringing the best capability to bear on behalf of our clients, and that's what we've done. And we expect that's going to grow over time. As I said, the pipeline's exceptionally strong, and we'll see how things play out over the next 24 months, and we feel very good about that.","Christa Davies","And then in terms of the economics, Elyse, I think we did originally say that it'd be modestly profitable in 2014. As a result of the significant win we had this year and the scaling up to support that significant client, it is going to be modestly unprofitable this year, and we look -- we don't think it'll have any impact on our greater than mid-single-digit operating income growth, which is exactly where we said we would be for the full year.","Gregory C. Case","[indiscernible] Christa described. We've been able to actually bring this online to develop truly a world-class platform with great capability. We're in the middle of the work, as Christa just alluded to, to the largest active and the largest retiree opportunity in the world by a substantial margin and been able to fully do that in the context of delivering greater than mid-single-digit operating income, and that's exactly where we are for the year.","Elyse Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then in terms of just a little bit more time maybe on the Reinsurance side, you did highlight improving trends in terms of organic growth going into the fourth quarter. Just -- is that partially a function of you seeing a change in growth, but then also, where it's a little bit of an easier comp when we look to Q4 last year. How much does that come into play? And then can we talk about the reinsurance markets, I guess, heading towards the January renewals. And we're hearing still competition out there. What would be kind of your initial view when we're looking towards growth in 2015?","Gregory C. Case","Well, if you step back, first, think about sort of where we are in Reinsurance through the first 9 months, we're down 2% on what literally is the, by far, the largest book in the world in terms of what we do on behalf of clients, #1 in treaty, #1 in capital markets, #1 in fac. And our treaty book is the most exposed to the area that's sort of most under pressure from a market standpoint, and that's the property cat world, both in the U.S., substantially greater, Japan and other places around the world. Against that backdrop, through the first 9 months, we're minus 2%. We're not excited about that, but when you think about that, that's pretty -- that's a powerful -- that's a reasonable outcome given where we are. We continue to make substantial investments to build the business in data analytics as I said. We're going to see that benefit coming through. We've had record new business across risk overall, and we've been able to improve margins even in this environment, and we think we're going to be able to continue that trend. Q4, we see the capital markets pipeline and what's going to close. It's stronger in Q4, less closed in Q3, a matter of timing. We'll see that in Q4. So we'll see a marginally stronger benefit in Q4, which will help us deliver the year. But net-net, when you step back and think about Risk Solutions overall, which is how Christa teed this up, we have a 10 basis point improvement margin even against the headwinds with 40 basis points in FX, and we're going to continue to sort of see that improving in the fourth quarter, which is our overall strongest quarter.","Operator","Next question is Cliff Gallant of Nomura.","Clifford H. Gallant - Nomura Holdings, Inc.","I'm sorry to look at this simplistically, and sort of just, I think, building off of Elyse's last question there. But when we look at Reinsurance from the outside, and Greg, I realize this is simplistic, but earlier this week, 2 of your competitors reported growth in Reinsurance, and we realize that, of course, it's a very difficult market, but it's hard not to think that there might be some share shift happening. Is that not happening or is it something else that's going on?","Gregory C. Case","We would say no. In fact, not at all, Cliff, from our standpoint. Again, net new business won, which is what we track, has been positive for 14 consecutive quarters. In fact, we are almost among our highest ever new business results for the quarter and year-to-date for the first 9 months. So the underlying piece of the business, our colleagues continue to do an exceptional job. Really, just step back. Again, we're the largest book. I mean, there's no excuse. We need to grow. We are -- we anticipate growing over time in this business, but we have the largest book in the world. It is most exposed around the property cat world, and that's in the U.S. and in Japan, and that actually creates pressure. That's what we have to deal with. On the other hand, our clients have tremendous opportunity right now, and we're bringing more and more of that opportunity on behalf of our clients. We're doing it through capital markets. We're doing it through classic treaty and from other avenues as well. And so from our standpoint, we're going to continue to work, build the franchise and feel good about capability in Q4 and what we're going to be able to do in '15 and '16, but we have not seen share shift in any way, shape or form.","Clifford H. Gallant - Nomura Holdings, Inc.","If I could have a follow-up. On the -- if I think about buyback, your pace in buyback this year has been very strong, and it's exceeding both what you're making in terms of operating income or what you're reporting for cash flow. And when we think of it, going forward, as a general rule, how should we think about what pace you can sustain in terms of share repurchases?","Christa Davies","Yes, it's a great question. So as we think about buyback, we obviously allocate capital based on return on capital, and buyback is our highest return on capital activity. We have returned year-to-date $2 billion to shareholders, of which $1.75 billion was buyback. And included in this amount was $300 million of additional cash on the balance sheet at year end 2013, and $800 million of additional capital from debt that we raised during the year. And so as we think about the amount of buyback going forward, it's unlikely to be as high as it was in 2014 due to those 2 additional activities. We don't give specific guidance, but share repurchase continues to be the highest return on capital activity across the firm. And given the substantial cash flow growth we see over time, we do see opportunities to deploy cash based on the cash flow growth, and there's incremental leverage opportunities over time too.","Operator","Next question is Vinay Misquith of Evercore.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Just looking at the organic growth year-to-date in the Risk Solutions segment, perhaps, around the 2%, how would you say that compares to what you would think that the company should do, and where do you think it's going forward? And just also attached to that, do you think that Aon can generate margin expansion in a 2% organic growth environment?","Gregory C. Case","If you step back and think about where we are year-to-date, as you described, we're at 2% for Risk Solutions overall, going into the -- with the headwinds that have been described already on the call, going into our strongest quarter. Through the first 9 months, at 2%, we expanded margin 10 basis points, including 40 basis points of negative FX. So if you just sort of think about can we expand margin against that growth rate, yes, and we're -- we think the fourth quarter is going to be stronger that the sort of overall year-to-date. Remember, a lot of the investments we've made and continue to make are not just around revenue growth by itself. It really is revenue growth and associated operating leverage with that. And I think we've been able to actually demonstrate very clearly our ability to grow margin with low single-digit, and if you step back -- or low single-digit organic growth. And if you think about what we described for the overall year, we've said we'd be low to mid-single-digit organic growth for the year, and we delivered solid margin expansion, both on a reported and underlying basis. And what we're reporting through the first 9 months is that's exactly what we're going to do for the year. And we feel like through the first 9 months, we've got more confidence in that now, having put 9 months in the books than we had even at the beginning of the year, and it was strong then. So to answer your question, we do feel like we can. Obviously, we're always going to go for higher and higher levels of growth, but we want to make sure it sort of meets the criteria I just described.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Sure. Just as a follow-up to this, I mean, this year was helped by the restructuring savings, and next year, I don't think that's going to be there. So do you think you have anything else that can help your earnings next year?","Christa Davies","Yes, so as we think about our margin expansion in Risk Solutions, it's really driven by 3 things. The first and primary driver of our margin expansion across Risk Solutions is the investments we've made in data and analytics, both in our retail business in the GRIP platform, which has over $100 billion of premium, and that is driving improved yield on every dollar of premium placed \u00e0 la incremental operating leverage, and equally the $120 million a year we are investing in Aon Benfield data and analytics. So those investments in GRIP and Aon Benfield data and analytics are really the primary driver of Risk Solutions margin expansion in calendar year 2013 and calendar year 2014. And we'll continue to drive expense discipline and expense opportunities as we look at outsourcing and off-shoring. We look at being more efficient around our IT investments and our real estate footprint. So we feel very good about the continued growth towards 26% Risk Solutions margin.","Gregory C. Case","In many respects, generally [ph] the investments we've made over the last 24 months, 36 months around this idea, as Christa described, of really data and analytics to help clients make better decisions to improve their performance and also to increase yield per dollar of premium placed are literally just coming online. You're starting to see the impact of those. The fullness of those come online in '15 '16 and '17, and that's why, as we said, and continue to say, we're on track to continue to march toward 26% from a margin standpoint in the Risk Solutions business.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Sure, okay, that's helpful. And just on tax rate, Christa, so should we look at it at a 19% tax rate for next year? I mean, is that reasonable, and that seems substantially lower than the 22% rate that you had in 2013, excluding the onetime adjustments.","Christa Davies","Yes, we're not -- we're no longer providing specific guidance. The year-to-date rate of 18.5% is the best indicator of our underlying effective tax rate. And as I said previously, as we think about the tax rate going forward, 18.5%, plus or minus discrete tax adjustments, which can be positive, as we saw in Q2 and negative as we saw in Q3, is really how you should think about it.","Operator","Next question is Brian Meredith of UBS.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes, 2 questions here for you. The first one, just going back to exchanges. Christa, when we think about -- you've signed up a large client this year. That's one of the reasons that, I guess, now you think that the exchanges are going to have a loss for the year. So is every time you sign up a large client, you're going to have this kind of issue of expense pressure? Or are some of the expenses you're putting on as a result of this large client leverage-able as we go into kind of the following years in exchanges?","Christa Davies","Yes, it's a great question, Brian, and it's really the second. As we think about the scale we're adding in calendar year 2014, we're really building the infrastructure to run the business going forward. It's a fixed cost base we're building, which will then be leverage-able across new clients going forward.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great, great. And then the second question, I know as far as the 26% margin target in Risk Solutions, improving yield specifically through GRIP is, I know, is a big part of getting there. I guess my question is when you look at GRIP, where do you expect kind of the revenues and the profits kind of to come from as you get that 26%? Is it signing up new insurance clients? Is it deals? Where is it going to come from?","Gregory C. Case","Yes, Brian, it really is across the board. And again, the goal here is what is the Risk Insight platform? It really is -- it is as sophisticated or not as sophisticated, if you will, of just really getting insight to match capital to client need more effectively. So it really provides insight into our distribution capability for our market partners so that they can apply their balance sheets in a more effective way. Against that goal, that means it actually helps them grow and more opportunity for them is more opportunity for our clients and more opportunity for us. It would give us the ability to bring on some additional insurers, as they see that opportunity, but it also dramatically expands the group we've got. We work with over 4,000 insurers overall, but really, it is -- we said, 30 to 35, we have sort of engaged in this. It really requires the insurers, they're our market partners, to invest time and energy too because we're changing the way we apply capital into our -- into the marketplace on behalf of our clients. So we see really the opportunity all of the above, more of them, more carriers involved, more opportunity with our existing carriers, we think, is quite, quite substantial, and ultimately, even with our clients in terms of sort of what we're doing at this point and helping them make better decisions. So this is really -- GRIP was really just the first step on a journey called using data and analytics to help clients make decisions to improve their operating performance, strengthen their financial position or reduce their volatility. And that's really what the data analytics is all about.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, so it's more getting more penetration within your insurance clients is kind of where the revenue growth comes from [ph]?","Gregory C. Case","But even more than that, more coverage with the existing clients we have. There's so much opportunity that we have, as they think about what they're doing. And we think about our overall portfolio of 60 billion or 70 billion, being able to actually package those risks and deliver them to these carriers in a way they can provide better value propositions for our clients, really, really powerful too. So this is the structured portfolio of solutions, tremendous set of opportunities there. It really benefits everyone, benefits clients tremendously, benefits markets. We benefit in the process too. So it's greater penetration with our existing group and also other opportunities outside that. So that's the second, and the third is opportunities with clients.","Operator","The next question, Jay Cohen of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","On the tax rate, one question, I thought the tax rate, the corporate tax rate in the U.K. was 21%. One, is that right? And then secondly, why is your rate below the corporate tax rate in the U.K.?","Christa Davies","Jay, we operate in 120 countries, and so our global effects of tax rate is really a result of profits that we generate in each of the 120 countries as opposed to the U.K. itself.","Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, so there's obviously other tax jurisdictions that are lower, and that's when you make some money, obviously, brings it overall down, okay. Fourth quarter buybacks tend to be smaller seasonally. Should we expect that again this fourth quarter?","Christa Davies","Jay, we don't give specific guidance on share repurchase. I have described why our year-to-date number that we've returned to shareholders of $2 billion is higher than it will be, going forward, because it included additional cash off the balance sheet of $300 million at year-end 2013, and the $800 million of additional capital we raised from debt during the year. And so as we think about our share repurchase going forward, obviously, it's based on our free cash flow growth, which is going to be strong, and it's allocated to the highest use of capital, and that's really our philosophy going forward.","Operator","Our next question is Kai Pan of Morgan Stanley.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","First, just a little bit on the Reinsurance side. I just want to -- your opinion on -- more on the expense side. If you think about pricing pressure as well as some secular change in the Reinsurance marketplace, how much, like do you think -- what property level of expense, as well as where do you invest your money in that? And basically, we're trying to get is that we see in the near term some margin pressure in the business as you continue to invest. Why the top line probably is lower [ph] in the past?","Gregory C. Case","Well, let's step back. Think about what we're trying to do in the space, again, we're the largest platform in the world, #1 in treaty, #1 in facultative, #1 in capital markets. And what we're trying to do is we're actually helping our clients actually improve their return on invested capital, reduce their volatility, strengthen their balance sheet. And when you think about that opportunity, it is tremendous, and we see that actually increasing over time. The 4,000 issuers out there, many of them, if not, all of them would love to actually have improved operating performance, stronger financial positions, less volatility, et cetera, and that's fundamentally exactly what we do at Aon Benfield. So we see that opportunity is substantial. And by the way, we continue to invest very, very strongly behind that opportunity. Christa highlighted we have -- we're investing over $120 million a year in data and analytics in Aon Benfield alone, which we believe is substantially greater than anyone else in the overall industry, and we're making substantial investments across the overall risk business, not just in the Reinsurance business, and it really is that -- that's really, as we think about the business overall, how we see tremendous opportunity. It is absolutely clear that, currently, there's tremendous price reduction that has happened, and it disproportionately affects books that have property cat, \u00e0 la ours. But having said that, we think about this across overall Risk Solutions, is it -- Risk Solutions, and as we said before, we improved margins in Risk Solutions in the first 9 months, and we did it against FX headwinds in addition to the market headwinds. So from our standpoint, we like our position a great deal on the Reinsurance side. We're going to continue to invest behind it, and it really is about how we grow that business through helping clients, and that's really what our focus is.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","That's great. And then second question on the acquisition front. You have been relatively quiet in the last few years, but now you just acquired the National Flood Services. I just wonder, do you see additional like acquisition opportunities that could augment your organic growth?","Gregory C. Case","We said -- we've done 12 acquisitions plus year-to-date. We've described NFS, and we described Lorica and a number of others as well. We've done in excess of $500 million for the first 9 months, and we see tremendous opportunities around the world and continue to invest in content, capability, geographic expansion, particularly, in the emerging markets. So we see tremendous opportunity on the acquisition front to continue to strengthen global Aon, and as we said, we're going to continue to invest behind that thesis.","Operator","Next question, Mike Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs.","Michael Steven Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions here. One is you called out the favorable competition consulting impact on revenues. Did that have an impact on HR margins as well?","Christa Davies","No, it didn't because when we gave original guidance at the beginning of the year in terms of greater than mid-single-digit operating income growth, and essentially flat in Q3, we were giving it in the context of knowing about this compensation, consulting revenue timing change, and of course, knowing about the investments we're making in health care exchanges.","Michael Steven Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. Okay. And then just on the exchanges a bit, I mean, obviously, last year, large case employers saw a lot of movement; this year, maybe a little bit more in the middle market. I was just wondering like, do you think in the near term there are trends out there that may support more adoption in the middle market at a pace that's elevated relative to large -- the larger case employers? And if so, would you consider expanding your offering to kind of reach down to that segment of the market?","Gregory C. Case","Again, come back -- remember our mission and objective. Our mission is to bring the best health solutions to the marketplace, and we serve large market, middle market, small across the board. So and again, if you'd go back to sort of the base line, 23 million strong, 9.5 million in health and benefits alone, that includes a huge amount of the middle market. So we already have a disproportionate amount of business in the middle market and a number of folks are sort of describing pieces of that in different ways as kind of self-insured exchanges. We don't do that. We're trying to bring a range of solutions, including a range of exchange solutions to wherever they have impact. We happen to have tested our first set in the large market arena, and it's done exceptionally well. We think there's great applicability across large and across middle, and for the clients that would benefit from exchanges, we want to bring those solutions to them. And if there are other ways we can serve them and help support their mission, we'll do that too. So we see substantial growth across the board -- substantial potential in the large market and in the middle market.","Michael Steven Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then, I guess, we've talked a lot about you've got growth, and talked -- focused a lot about -- on enrollment and the fact that we expect in the near term that you'll be reinvesting dollars back into the exchanges. You continue to grow in anticipation of more scale down the road. But can you talk about how you think about this business from, like from an operating leverage perspective? I mean, do you expect that at scale, should this business be able to deliver higher margins than your sort of traditional health and benefit business just because there's more technology and there's more -- should be more scalability?","Christa Davies","Yes. So what we would say is, obviously, we're investing on behalf of our clients. We've been doing that for several years now,, and we're doing that again in 2014. Long term, we absolutely expect this business to be higher than our target margins of 22%, and therefore, generate a terrific return on capital for shareholders.","Michael Steven Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it, okay. And then just last question, I guess, on this topic is, has the -- how has the relationship with clients changed to the extent that you were a consultant, the largest on the benefit side? Now you are sort of straddling that line between consultant and vendor because you now have your solution that you're bringing to the table? Does that change the relationship at all? And if it does, how, and if not, why not?","Gregory C. Case","It really doesn't. In fact, when we -- when this works well, we were able to provide a platform, which creates transparency, choice, even greater accountability for individual employees. We've actually enabled companies sort of at the center of this to actually create better alignment, more -- better choices for their employees. They then also take risk off their balance sheet. They control volatility and we've created alignment very much with the actual carriers out there. So that's the platform. And again, against that backdrop, 100% renewal, and most important than anything else, 87% employee satisfaction. But if you said yourself, is everything done then? Is all the health issues -- are all they -- are they gone? And the answer is no. This is an ongoing set of challenges for companies. It's an ongoing set of challenges for individual families, and so bringing advice and content and insight around that platform, when it goes well, that's really -- that's the most powerful outcome we can bring to the table, a very clear platform that clients can utilize, as well as advice and perspective that actually helps them take full advantage of it for their company and for the employees. So we think when it works well, there's -- it's highly complementary.","Operator","Next question, Joshua Shanker of Deutsche Bank.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I'm not going to be the last person to ask a question about taxes, unfortunately. When I've asked in the past, I've gotten an answer like, well, the data analytics for our health care exchanges are located in Singapore, or the data and analytics for our reinsurance business is located in Singapore. When the client is buying a health care exchange, how much are they paying for the access to the health care, and how much are they paying for your data and analytics services? Or similarly, in reinsurance, how much are they paying for you to buying the business for them, and how are they paying for your data and analytics? It seems like the data analytics is a small part and the access is the big part. And so I'm wondering, how much revenue is really being generated in Singapore that can effectively bring your tax rate significantly down below your domicile where you're located?","Christa Davies","Yes, I guess, what I would say, Joshua, is really, as we think about delivering value to clients, we're trying to ensure that we're delivering the best value service to clients, wherever they may be in the world, and a core part of the value we're providing for clients is helping them make better decisions, and the data analytics are a key part of making more informed and better choices in our Reinsurance business, in our retail business, and obviously, in our health care exchange business, as employees make the right health care choice for them, which is why we've got 87% employee satisfaction. As we think about our business around the world, we're absolutely investing in data analytics, because it's a huge part of helping us provide differentiated solutions for clients. I would separate that out from the tax rate. We are a U.K. company. We operate in 120 countries. As we think about our tax rate and our effective tax rate, going forward, the 18.5% is our underlying operating rate, and it's a mix of 120 countries in which we operate.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","But the health care exchange, for example, is a U.S. business that happens to record revenues in Singapore because that's where the data analytics is located, yes?","Christa Davies","That's not true.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So it doesn't record revenue in Singapore?","Christa Davies","No.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, then I'm mistaken in terms of how -- the information I've gotten in the past. And then -- so there are not countries where you're booking revenue in one country, but recognizing the revenue in a tax-free domicile in order to get a better tax rate?","Christa Davies","Joshua, what I would say is we have product development and innovation in analytics centers because -- to hub them in analytics centers is the best way to build deep analytic skill sets. So GRIP, GRIP is based in Ireland. We have 110 people based in Ireland. They're PhDs. They're statisticians. They're building that GRIP database. Of course we want them all in one location. That's absolutely right, and so -- but we really think about delivering the value to clients using that data in the best way for the clients.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","But if a U.S. client buys GRIP in the United States, is the revenue for the purchase of GRIP recorded as a U.S. revenue or is it reported -- recorded as an Irish revenue?","Christa Davies","Yes, look, we have global carriers, and therefore, the revenue is recognized wherever the service is delivered.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. I think that's the same answer, but I'm not sure, but it's a complicated issue. There's a lot of stuff going on in global tax. Obviously, I'm just concerned that you're actually doing a great job with tax, and I want to know if I can forecast that in perpetuity.","Christa Davies","And what I said on that is the 18.5% operating rate is our underlying effective tax rate. And as you think about the tax rate going forward, it's 18.5%, plus or minus discrete tax adjustments, which could be positive or negative in future years.","Operator","Next question, Meyer Shields of KBW.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Greg, one question, just to clarify, when you talk about Reinsurance organically being better in fourth quarter, are you expecting it to be positive or just less bad than it's been for the past couple?","Gregory C. Case","Again, we don't give specific guidance. We said it would be an improvement in the Q4, and it reflect kind of a negative 2% year-to-date. We think Q4 will be a bit better.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay, that helps. Broadly speaking, when you look at the demand for cyber risk, I guess, I'm wondering, one, is there -- is that something that's going to present a measurable opportunity for Aon? And second, is there any risk that clients that have gotten hacked look to the broker as maybe not pushing as hard on these coverages as they should have?","Gregory C. Case","Well, if you step back and think about it, you're really hitting on -- cyber, you can talk about pandemic. You can talk about sustainability, a whole series of things. Our view always has been, it's one of the reasons why we love this business so much on behalf of our clients, is our clients face a range of traditional risks. And globally, it's true. It's true in every country of the world. As populations urbanize, it becomes even more true around property, casualty, D&O, et cetera, and then you bring in all the nontraditional risk, as you're starting to highlight, cyber being one. But again, you could add pandemic, Ebola, whatever you want to add to that mix. There's just a whole range of those sorts of opportunities and challenges for our clients. We see that as a tremendous obligation to support them in that and opportunity for us to support them in that. And so we've invested and continue to invest very, very heavily. This is back to Christa's point around data and analytics, getting the insight and understanding so that you can just begin to quantify that risk. Therefore, you can then understand -- you can mitigate that risk and then price for it, and where there's opportunities, bring balance sheets into play, \u00e0 la place insurance. But oftentimes, it doesn't even involve insurance placement. It involves operations, and we're helping clients across the board on all those pieces, and our clients are really looking for us to try to do that.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then one last question if I can. I think it's for Christa. The various revenue timing issues that you've talked about today, do those reverse in 2015?","Christa Davies","In 2015, no. The revenue timing issue, the $15 million, will reverse itself in Q4 2014. So really, in terms of Risk Solutions, what you should really think about is putting $15 million of revenue in Q4 because we've absorbed the expense for it in Q3.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Right. No, I understand that. I'm just wondering when we look forward a year, is the seasonal adjustment that we're seeing this year, does that go back to the way it was in 2013 or is this sort of the mentality?","Christa Davies","No, this is the new patterning, going forward.","Operator","Next question is Paul Newsome of Sandler O'Neill.","J. Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","I was hoping we could talk about, just more broadly, the organic growth year-to-date in the U.S. in international. I think Reinsurance has been beaten dead. So we've seen a modest deceleration, and in hindsight, can you talk about any reflections on whether or not you think that's more economic growth changes or rate changes?","Gregory C. Case","Well, a little bit as we said before. Think about year-to-date in the Americas, the 2%; year-to-date in international, 3%. Basically, as we said, we're about to go into our fourth quarter, which is the strongest quarter we have across the firm. We see exceptionally strong new business trends, particularly in the U.S., have been exceptionally strong. So underlying, again, tremendous opportunity as we continue to build the business. We would say from a pricing standpoint, really, think about it as market impact pricing on one side, and then insured values on the other. Pricing is largely around the retail side, hovering around 0, plus or minus, very slightly, and insured values are holding up, I would say, not decreasing. So we're kind of marginal from that standpoint, which, by the way, might be a bit of an improvement, but marginal overall, and that's really the context.","J. Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Terrific. My second question, I was hoping you'd talk a little bit more about the other income line. I recognize that there's more than one thing in there, but it seems like we've had a couple of years where, on average, and I'm not asking here for a discussion really on the quarter, but more the year in total, on average, that line has become a positive number. Is that something that we should think about as possible in the future? Or I think, historically, we thought it as being something that in the end ended up being kind of a 0 typically over time?","Christa Davies","Yes. So Paul, I think it's obviously a lumpy line. And it, theoretically, should be 0 over time. What you see reflected in there is our continued efforts in managing the portfolio to maximize ROIC for shareholders, and therefore, it includes the gains on the sale of a business, and it also includes gains in certain long-term investments, as we continue to optimize the portfolio around highest return capital. So it is lumpy, and therefore, almost impossible to predict.","J. Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Well, I'm comfortable with lumpy, but I guess, it actually sounds like if you are -- continue to optimize the portfolio and sell things off and do those like -- and have these investments, that, generally speaking, although, obviously, with a lot of volatility, it should be a positive number. Or am I just completely off-base?","Christa Davies","Well, I guess what I would say, Paul, is as we actually model our own business internally, we model it at 0, if that's helpful for you.","Operator","Our last question is Charles Sebaski of BMO Capital Markets.","Charles J. Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","The first question I have is regarding GRIP, and wondering, I think, Greg, you said that some of the 30 or 35 clients currently participating in GRIP are on multi-year contracts. I wonder if we could get some more color on how many of the accounts and how long those multi-year agreements might be lasting?","Gregory C. Case","Yes, we really don't disclose that. What we said before is, again, nearly half or so have signed multi-year contracts, but really, it was more an indication of the value they're seeing and the impact it has. That really is what we're trying to highlight, but we're not going to go into detail in terms of the specific mechanics around it.","Charles J. Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. I guess what I'm trying to understand is I believe that the number's been around 30 for a couple of years now. And given, as you said, you work with 4,000 insurers globally, I would have thought that the value proposition you're talking about, we would've seen more expansion in that product line.","Gregory C. Case","No. Actually, we're not going for volume here. We're going for -- by the way, very good question, but this isn't about volume, it's about quality, content. With that balance sheet, our carriers deliver on behalf of our clients. So it's been a reasonable progression, 20, 25, 30, 35, give or take. We don't -- this doesn't need to be thousands or even hundreds, nor do we want it to be, because in the end, we're really talking about using data and analytics to change the way that an underwriter thinks about applying capital to our clients. Fundamentally, that means it's better for our clients, and it means it's better for the underwriters, better for Aon too in that process, but really, it's a function of our clients. That process takes real content, data and analytics. It also takes real leadership from an Aon standpoint and from a carrier standpoint, and this is really what we've been doing. And as those relationships connect in different ways, that's really what's drawn and built the overall GRIP platform effectively, and that's why we see it will expand over time. This goes back to Brian's earlier question. With the 30, 35, we think we see substantial opportunity to expand dramatically, and that's a huge benefit for our clients and for them. And then we'll add a few from time to time if insurers really want to invest their time and energy to make this work, because there's nothing instant about this. This is real hard work with new insights and new data to apply their capital in a different way.","Charles J. Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Is that -- is there any sharing between that data analytics platform and what you're doing in Re? So I guess what I'm wondering, as you talk about the $120 million spend in data and analytics for Re, and I guess I'm trying to get an understanding better on what your total investment is across all platforms, be it health care exchange, be it GRIP, be it Re, on where you guys are on that relative to the $120 million you provide.","Gregory C. Case","Yes. Again, we'll be very clear. What we talk about with the $120 million is Aon Benfield only. So the investment on the Risk Insight Platform is not included in that at all. That really is done in the ARS book -- ARS business overall, so it's completely separate. We haven't disclosed what the number is, but if you think about it, $120 million in the Reinsurance business is a tremendous investment, annual investment. We invested substantially more than that on the retail side of the business. So now we haven't even got to Aon Hewitt yet. We're really just talking about on the risk side of the business. So back to what we're doing to sort of build our content and capability, again, we haven't disclosed it, but it's substantially, a multiple greater than $120 million a year when you think about what we do in Risk Solutions overall, and GRIP, our Risk Insight Platform is completely separate from this $120 million.","Charles J. Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","And can we get some idea at all on the -- I know there was some commentary made about investments this quarter on the new clients for health care exchanges. I'm trying to get an understanding since inception on what kind of investment has been made in the construction of the health care exchange platform. And then going forward, what kind of investment upkeep or run rate investment growth is going to be required in that business?","Gregory C. Case","What we said basically is we've invested -- we explicitly said, as we were bringing this up and online, greater than $100 million investment. What we said, going forward, there will be -- continue to be substantial investments. And by the way, bringing large clients on is a great cause for celebration for us. We -- a phenomenal validation of what we're doing, very reinforcing. What we said is all future investments, we're going to fully fund out of the P&L. And what you need to hear from us is the following, exactly what Christa described, is we are delivering in HR Solutions mid-single-digit organic revenue growth and greater than mid-single-digit operating income growth for 2014. And so while there have been investments greater than $100 million we described before, we are absorbing them all in the P&L, and by the way, delivering greater than mid-single-digit operating income growth for '14. So that's really how you should think about it.","Charles J. Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","And just a last one. Christa, on the share repurchases for the first quarter, to make sure that I -- I'm understanding something correctly, with the current share count at 296.1 million, and I think in the presentation, you say the expected diluted share count in the -- for full year '14 is 295 million, so am I reading that right that the expectation is really only about 1 million shares of buyback? Is that on par with where cash flow or cash ability is in the quarter?","Christa Davies","Yes. So here's what I would say. The actual shares outstanding at 9\/30\/2014 were 285 million. You then have about 10 million of additional dilutive equivalents, which get you to 295 million, which is your starting point, for Q4, before any share repurchase, et cetera. And so we're not giving guidance about share repurchase in this number.","Operator","Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg Case for closing remarks.","Gregory C. Case","Just wanted to say thanks to everyone for joining us. We appreciate it very much and look forward to our discussion next quarter. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you for your participation. That does conclude today's conference.

If anyone has an objection, you may disconnect your line at this time.","I would also like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded and that is important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results as well as having been posted on our website.","Now, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, President and CEO of Aon Plc.","Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you and good morning everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2015 conference call. Joining me today is our CFO, Christa Davies. I would note that there are slides available on our website for you to follow along with our commentary today and consistent with previous quarters, I'd like to cover two areas before turning the call over to Christa for further financial review. First is our performance against key metrics we communicate to shareholders. Second is the overall organic growth performance including continued areas of strategic investment across Aon.","On the first topic, our performance versus key metrics. Each quarter, we measure our performance against the key metrics we focus on achieving over the course of the year: grow organically, expand margins, increase earnings per share and deliver free cash flow growth.","Turning to slide 3. In the fourth quarter, organic revenue growth was 5% with solid growth across all major businesses, highlighted by 6% growth in each of our retail brokerage businesses. Operating margin increased 110 basis points, reflecting strong operating performance in both segments. And EPS increased 20% to $2.27, reflecting strong operating performance and effective capital management.","If we turn to the full year, organic revenue growth was 3% overall, reflecting solid growth across both Risk and HR Solutions despite pricing pressure and overall economic uncertainty. Operating margin increased 50 basis points, reflecting strong operating performance and record margin results in those segments. EPS increased 8% to $6.18, overcoming substantial foreign currency headwinds. And finally, free cash flow increased 10% to a record $1.7 billion.","Overall, our results reflect both the strong performance in the quarter and for the full year. In the year of substantial volatility driven by macroeconomic factors and industry headwinds, we continue to invest heavily in client-serving capabilities across our industry-leading platform. These investments, combined with the leadership of our colleagues around the globe, contribute to strong organic growth in both segments to close the year, record operating margin in both segments, record free cash flow, and a return of $1.9 billion of capital to shareholders.","Turning to slide 4 on the second topic of growth and investment. I want to spend the next few minutes discussing the quarter for both of our segments. In Risk Solutions, organic revenue growth was 5% compared to 3% in the prior year quarter, driven by growth across all businesses and reflecting a level of quarterly organic growth not seen since the second quarter of 2007. As we discussed previously, we're driving a set of initiatives and making strategic investments that are strengthening underlying performance and position our Risk Solutions segment for long-term growth and improved operating leverage, with the management of our renewal book, through right-on-time promise and retention rates of more than 90% on average across retail brokerage. New business generation of more than $330 million across our retail business, with record new business in U.S. Retail. In 19 consecutive quarters of positive net new business in core treaty reinsurance.","Increased operating leverage from our investments in innovation technology and data and analytics, including from the Global Risk Insight Platform, which now captures over 3 million trades and $160 billion of bound premium, with approximately 40 carriers utilizing the platform today. ReView, a reinsurer dashboard, combined with strategic consulting, help reinsurers be more effective markets for ceding company clients. And our Aon Broking initiative to better match client need with insurer appetite for risk and to identify structured portfolio solutions.","A great example of our innovation in data and analytics recently was the launch of Aon Client Treaty, the largest ever underwritten portfolio of risk in the history of Lloyd's. An undertaking of data and analytics looking at 64,000 policy transactions, 120 different classes of business, and over 157 countries and territories. We've received terrific feedback from clients, bound coverage in every major geography and have generated incremental new business since the launch on January 1. And, finally, we're expanding our content and global footprint through tuck-in acquisitions that increase scale in emerging markets or expand capability.","Reflecting on the individual businesses within Risk Solutions. In the Americas, organic revenue growth was 6% against the strong comparable in the prior year quarter, driven by a diversified portfolio reflecting industry expertise, product and service capability. The exposures continue to be positive across the region, while the impact from pricing was modestly negative, resulting in stable market impact overall. We saw growth across all regions; U.S. Retail, Canada, and Latin America, including growth across all businesses, property\/casualty, health and benefits, and in Affinity, where 16 of 18 underlying product lines were delivering growth.","In U.S. Retail, growth was driven by solid retention rates and record new business generation on areas such as P&C, D&O and cyber, while strong management of the renewal book portfolio drove growth in Latin America. In International, organic revenue growth was 6% compared to flat in the prior year quarter. Exposures continue to be stable and the impact from pricing was modestly negative on average, driven by fragile market conditions in many countries across Europe and a continued pressure in the Pacific region.","In Continental Europe, we saw solid growth driven by management of the renewal book portfolio, reflecting strong leadership across the region. This positions us well to benefit from potential improvements in a macroeconomic environment. We saw continued strength in New Zealand while Australia showed modest growth. Results also reflect solid growth across Asia where many markets grew double digits including Taiwan, Thailand and Singapore.","In Reinsurance, organic revenue growth was 2%, a strong performance against the tough comparison in the prior year quarter. Results in the quarter primarily reflect positive growth in treaty globally driven by an increase in (07:08) demand, as well as growth in new products such as U.S. Mortgage and ReView.","Across our portfolio, we saw a record level of new business generation in the quarter. While excess capital continues to place pressure in the market, the rate of price decline continues to moderate. Against that price measure, clients are buying more and capital is being deployed to new markets. New opportunities for growth combined with industry-leading data and analytics has positioned our Reinsurance business for return to modest growth in 2016.","Overall, across Risk Solutions, we delivered our strongest quarterly rate of organic growth for the year, driven by record new business generation, strong retention rates, and returns on our investments in industry leading data and analytics. Despite fragile macroeconomic conditions and soft pricing in certain areas, we fully anticipate a continuation of low to mid-single digit organic growth in 2016.","Turning to HR Solutions, organic revenue growth was 4% with solid growth across both major businesses and in high demand areas where we've invested in innovative solutions and client serving capability. These investments reflect Aon Hewitt's client leadership and in-depth understanding and influence of market trends. Including, as clients manage risks against pension schemes that are frozen, largely underfunded and facing regulatory changes, solutions to de-risk pension plans and support for delegated investment solutions. A strong area of growth where assets under management have grown from $10 billion to roughly $75 billion in five years.","Continued investment to strengthen our industry-leading portfolio of health solutions covering the full range of benefit strategies, client size and funding choices. Across Aon suite of private health exchanges, we enrolled roughly 1.4 million lives across 150 clients in 2015, compared to roughly 1.2 million enrolled lives across 100 clients in 2014, reflecting solid double-digit growth.","Participant satisfaction was strong, as 92% of individuals on the Retiree Exchange were satisfied with their advisor, while 88% on the Active Exchange liked being able to choose from multiple carriers. Our solutions for clients continue to bend the cost curve by 150 basis points to 200 basis points on average over a multi-year period, but more than a quarter of returning clients seen a year-over-year decrease.","We feel good about the pipeline and our ability to drive greater scale in growth in 2016. We're also investing in Software-as-a-Service model in our HR BPO business, where growth in new clients and conversation with existing clients is driving strong demand, as well as the expansion of our capabilities to include financial implementations. And finally, we're investing in our talent and rewards business, as we are seeing strong demand for data and analytics to support increasing organizational change.","Turning to the individual businesses within HR Solutions. In Consulting services, organic revenue growth was 4%, overcoming a tough comparable in the prior year that included project work relating to the HAFTA bill. Results in the quarter reflect continued growth in retirement consulting, primarily driven by demand for delegated investment consulting solutions. We also saw continued growth in consultation consulting, driven by record growth in participation for survey work as companies require benchmarking and assistance with planned designs to address retention and ways to compete more effectively with a set of strategies.","In Outsourcing, organic revenue growth was 4% as well, driven by growth across all major businesses. We saw growth in benefits administration, driven primarily by an increase in project-related work. Results reflect growth in HR BPO, driven by new client wins in cloud-based solutions. We saw solid growth in healthcare exchanges driven by an increase in the number of enrollments across the platform.","Overall, across HR Solutions, client needs are growing in both size and complexity across retirement and health. Our results reflect the solid finish to the year with growth across all major businesses, including strong growth in areas we've been investing to continue delivering sustainable long-term growth.","In summary, despite short-term headwinds from both macroeconomic and industry pricing standpoint, our results for both the quarter and the year finished on a high note. We delivered solid organic growth across both segments and strengthened our operational performance driven by our industry-leading platform of client-serving capabilities and investments in data and analytics.","With that said, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Christa for further financial review. Christa?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks so much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg noted, our industry-leading franchise closed the year with a strong performance despite both macroeconomic and industry-specific headwinds. Our results in the quarter reflect solid organic growth and record operating margin performance in Risk and HR Solutions. Record free cash flow generation and effective capital management highlighted by the repurchase of approximately $400 million of ordinary shares in the quarter. We returned roughly $1.9 billion of capital to shareholders in 2015.","Now, let me turn to the financial results for the quarter on page 6 of the presentation. Our core EPS performance excluding certain items increased 20% to $2.27 per share for the fourth quarter compared to $1.89 in the prior year quarter. Certain items that were adjusted for in core EPS performance and highlighted in the schedule from page 12 of the press release include non-cash intangible asset amortization. Further, included in the results was a $0.10 per share unfavorable impact related to foreign currency translation due to the U.S. dollar strengthening against most major currencies.","Excluding the impact of foreign currency, EPS grew 25% for the fourth quarter and 15% for the full year, in line with our compounded annual growth rate of 15% for the last 10 years. Another year of outstanding performance reflecting the strength of our industry-leading franchise and focus on shareholder value creation.","Going forward, if currency were to remain stable at today's rates, we would expect substantially less of a headwind with an estimated unfavorable impact of roughly $0.10 for 2016 compared to $0.41 of impact for 2015. We would expect the majority of this impact to be weighted towards the first half of 2016 more so in the first quarter.","Now, let me talk about each of the segments on the next slide. In our Risk Solutions segment, organic revenue growth was 5%. Operating margin increased 100 basis points to 25.7%, and operating income increased 2% compared to the prior year quarter. Operating income included a $27 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding this impact, underlying operating income increased 7% versus the prior year quarter. Operating margin improvement of 100 basis points includes a 30 basis points favorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding the impact from foreign currency, underlying operating margin improved 70 basis points in the quarter. Our fourth quarter performance reflects solid organic growth performance and improved returns on our investments in data and analytics across our portfolio.","For 2015, Risk Solutions operating income decreased 2%, which includes a $128 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding this impact, underlying operating income increased 5% versus the prior year. Operating margin increased 70 basis points to 23.6%, including a 20 basis points favorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding the impact from foreign currency, underlying operating margin increased 50 basis points in the year.","We delivered strong operational improvement in 2015, with record operating margins despite significant headwinds from an unfavorable market impact in reinsurance and fragile macroeconomic conditions. This level of performance reflects strong new business generation and increased operating leverage in the business, as well as expense discipline as we optimize our global cost structure. We expect continued improvement in 2016 and are firmly on track with our long-term target of 26%.","In addition, if short-term interest rates continue to rise, we believe we have significant leverage to improving interest rate environment as every 100 basis point rise in global interest rates should result in approximately $45 million of investment income.","Turning to the HR Solutions segment, organic revenue growth was 4%, operating margin increased 270 basis points to 26.2% and operating income increased 14% compared to the prior year quarter. Operating income included a $6 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. In addition, there are approximately $12 million or minus 90 basis points of transaction-related and portfolio-repositioning costs incurred in the quarter as we continue to drive improved return on capital. The gain related to the sale of our Absence Management business was reported in other income.","Results were driven by organic growth, expense discipline and improved returns on investment, including healthcare exchanges, which delivered modest profitability in 2015. For the full year, operating income increased 7%, including a $20 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding this impact, underlying operating income increased 10% compared to the prior year, and operating margins increased 100 basis points to a record 18.1%.","This level of performance demonstrates strong improvement over the prior year, reflecting solid financial results in our core business, as well as improved profitability in the areas we've been investing for long-term growth, including delegated investment consulting, cloud-based solutions in HR BPO, and healthcare exchanges.","Looking forward, we expect continued operational improvement in 2016 towards our long-term target of 22%, with quarterly patterning of operating income results in HR Solutions similar to 2015. More specifically, down in the first half more so in Q1, and up in the second half most notably Q4.","Now, let me discuss a few of the line items outside of the operating segments on slide 9. Unallocated expenses increased $17 million to $61 million due to the timing of certain employee incentive and employee benefit-related expenses, as well as certain investments in shared services. Interest income was $4 million compared to $3 million from the prior-year quarter. Interest expense was $68 million, in line with quarterly guidance.","Other income of $49 million primarily includes the gain on the sale of our Absence Management business in Outsourcing and HR Solutions. The sale continues to reflect our effort to drive improved return on capital. Going forward, we expect a run rate of approximately $45 million per quarter of unallocated expense, $3 million per quarter of interest income and $68 million of interest expense.","Turning to taxes. The adjusted effects of tax rate on net income from continuing operations, excluding the applicable tax impact associated with expenses related to legacy litigation in Q2, decreased to 17.9% compared to the prior-year quarter at 19.6% due to the favorable impact of certain discrete tax adjustments. Our estimate of the underlying operating tax rate remains at 19%.","Lastly, average diluted shares outstanding decreased 5% to $279.3 million in the fourth quarter compared to $293.4 million in the prior-year quarter as we effectively allocate capital and manage dilution. The company repurchased 4.3 million Class A ordinary shares for approximately $400 million in the fourth quarter. The company has $4.1 billion of remaining authorization under its share repurchase program.","Actual shares outstanding on December 31 were 269.8 million and there are approximately 6 million additional dilutive equivalents. Estimated Q1 2016 beginning dilutive share count is approximately 276 million, subject to share price movement, share issuance and share repurchase.","Now let me turn to the next slide to highlight our solid balance sheet and strong cash flow growth on slide 10. At December 31, 2015, cash and short-term investments were $740 million. Total debt outstanding was approximately $5.7 billion and total debt-to-EBITDA on a GAAP basis was 2.3 times. Cash flow from operations for the year increased 11% or $197 million to a record $2 billion, driven by a decline in pension contributions, restructuring-related payments, cash paid for taxes, and working capital improvements, partially offset by $137 million in cash paid to settle legacy litigation and strong organic growth performance in the fourth quarter.","Free cash flow is defined by cash flow from operations less CapEx increased 10% or $163 million to a record $1.7 billion, reflecting strong growth in cash flow from operations, partially offset by a $34 million increase in CapEx. The increase in CapEx in 2015 was primarily related to completed investments in certain projects to optimize our global real estate portfolio.","As we noted in our press release and related presentations today, during the quarter for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we reclassified certain cash flows related to shares withheld for taxes from cash flow from operations to cash flow from financing. Shares withheld for taxes reflects the choice of colleagues upon vesting to choose gross or net shares to satisfy their withholding requirements. As nearly all colleagues choose to receive net shares, the company then withholds an applicable amount of shares to cover withholding amounts, in effect, creating a share repurchase-like transaction.","We believe the reclassification of shares withheld for taxes to cash from financing activities provides greater transparency to the cash flow production from operating results underlines more closely with the accounting treatment of comparable peers. While the reclassification has no actual cash impact on the cash flow statement, as a result of a reclassification, we are increasing our near-term free cash flow goal from $2.3 billion to $2.4 billion for the full year 2017.","Turning to the next slide to discuss our significantly increasing free cash flow generation. We value the firm based on free cash flow and allocate capital to maximize free cash flow returns. Free cash flow of $2.4 billion is not our end goal, as further long-term sustainable free cash flow will be driven by continued operating income growth and additional working capital initiatives beyond 2017.","There are four primary areas that are expected to contribute to our goal of delivering $2.4 billion or more for the full year 2017. The first is continued operational performance, driven by organic revenue growth and margin expansion. The second is working capital improvements as we focus on closing the gap between receivables and payables. The third is declining uses of cash for pension contributions CapEx from restructuring, which will free up more than $90 million of annual free cash flow between the end of 2015 and 2017. And fourth, lower cash tax payments reflecting a lower effective tax rate. Lastly, I would note that during 2015, we paid $137 million of cash to settle a legacy litigation, which we would expect to provide a tailwind free cash flow growth in 2016.","Turning to our pension plans. We have taken significant steps to reduce volatility and liability as we've closed plans to new entrants, frozen plans from accruing additional benefits and continue to de-risk certain plan assets. Based on December 31, 2015 actuarial assumptions, reported liabilities on a GAAP basis decreased to $1.8 billion at year-end 2015, reflecting a 94% funded status, compared to $2.1 billion at year-end 2014, reflecting a 90% funded status.","Not reflected in those amounts, however, are $1 billion of overfunded pension plans that are included in non-current assets in the balance sheet? Considered together, our net unfunded obligations are approximately $800 million. Overall, we expect contributions to decline by approximately $44 million in 2016 and would expect non-cash pension income to be a modest benefit in 2016 versus 2015.","Regarding our restructuring program, cash payments declined by $54 million to $28 million in 2015. As old charges related to restructuring program have been incurred, we would expect cash payments to decline by $9 million or approximately $19 million in 2016, and continue to decline thereafter to an immaterial amount.","In summary, our results for both the quarter and the full year reflects solid organic growth, record operating margin performance across both Risk and HR Solutions, strong EPS growth, record free cash flow of $1.7 billion and a return of roughly $1.9 billion in capital to shareholders. Despite challenging macroeconomic and industry-specific headwinds, our industry-leading franchise is strongly positioned to help clients manage through increasing complexity, magnitude and volatility across the areas of risk, retirement and health.","With that, I would like to turn the call back over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. At this time, we don't have any questions on queue.","Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer","Sorry. Apparently, we're having some difficulty on the queues \u2013 on the questions. We've got a number in queue. I can assure you we'll take all the time we need today to answer any and all the questions we've got, so be comfortable with that. We'll work out this logistical glitch a bit. And they're coming up in a bit, so just a little patience and we're going to get this moving as soon as we can. So apologies for that.","Redial back in, and I think you'll get to the front of the queue.","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer","Ryan, are you with us?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Dave, I think you might be up.","Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey, Greg.","Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yes, please.","Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey. Sorry about that. My first question is for Christa, and it's just \u2013 I think she said that non-cash pension income will be a benefit this year versus 2015. Just wondering if you could quantify that, what the benefit is?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. It's small, Ryan, but it is going to be up slightly year-over-year.","Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. And then just on the reclassification, I guess just trying to understand what's going on here. I think last year you guys still had something like $300 million-plus of share-based compensation that was helping free cash flow, but now it sounds like you're moving something to financing activities. I'm just trying to understand why it sounds like there might be some share-based compensation that's still helping free cash flow and some that might have been moved to financing activities.","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So I think the first thing to say, Ryan, is this has \u2013 this reclassification has no cash impact on total cash generated or cash paid in previous or future periods. I think the issue you're referring to is actually quite a different issue. The reason we did this was really as a preferable classification and it's consistent with peers. And we feel like it's a much cleaner way to explain our overall cash flow and cash flow growth. The stock compensation expense is stable and has not changed.","Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. And then Just one last one, I know the guide to the tax rate is at about 19%, but over the past couple of years, it's coming a little bit below that. I just wanted to make sure the $2.4 billion 2017 free cash flow target, that we can assume that that's \u2013 that's assuming a 19% tax rate.","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Ryan, we expect 19% to be our underlying operational rate going forward. I think what shows up in any one year is impacted by discrete tax adjustments. They can be positive or negative, and we actually can't forecast them. And the reason our full-year tax rate for 2015 on an adjusted basis was 17.9% was because we had positive discrete tax adjustments. So what we would say is the right underlying rate to model for the company and we use ourselves is 19%, but then discrete tax adjustments can come in positive or negative.","Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. But \u2013 so the 2.4%, though, is absent, though, the discrete tax adjustments, just over the past couple of years, I think, have been positive, correct?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I mean, it is impossible by nature of those adjustments to predict them because they happened at the time.","Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. I'll stop there. Thanks so much, guys.","Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dan Farrell of Piper Jaffray. Sir, your line is open.","Daniel D. Farrell - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","To your cash flow growth targets, even if we take into account the pension decreases and some of the change, there's some healthy growth there. I'm wondering if you could comment on ReView on the underlying macro trends that you think you might need for that? If we look at the last couple of years, certainly you would probably have more headwinds than we would've thought we're going to have. And do you think you need any of that to reverse \u2013 or with the current headwinds that we're seeing, do you think that that cash flow is still achievable? Thank you.","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I think it's a great question, Dan, because we have had some significant headwinds in the last couple of years, most notably FX, which had a $140 million impact on operating income in calendar year 2015. We would say that we do not need changes in the macro environment to achieve our $2.4 billion in free cash flow in 2017. If you think about the $1.7 billion of free cash flow we delivered in 2015, you can add back the $137 million of cash we spent on litigation in 2015, and then you can add about $100 million of improvement in free cash flow from decreased uses of cash between now and 2017. So you're already up to $2 billion of free cash flow, and then you really need an incremental $400 million from revenue growth and margin expansion and improved working capital.","And so we really believe that we have exceptionally strong free cash flow over the coming years and exceptionally strong free cash flow per share as we expect declining share counts between now and 2017, too.","Daniel D. Farrell - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question that we do have comes from the line of Sarah DeWitt of JPMC. Your line is open.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, good morning, and congrats on a good quarter. First on the brokerage organic growth, the 5%, this is the best result you've had in years. Could you just talk about what changed versus the third quarter?","Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Sarah. First, step back, reflect \u2013 if you think about brokerage overall, it's consistent with what we're trying to achieve over the course of the year, being able to grow in virtually every environment, and we've been able to do that. And in the fourth quarter, what you're seeing is just at continuation. So for us, it's really nothing new but a continuation of the yield on a lot of the investments we're making in the business and the progress we're making across the business overall.","And listen, we saw the new business characteristics in U.S. Retail, for example. These are records \u2013 record-on-record, in fact, in terms of sort of what's happened over the course of the last year. So, for us, this is just a continuation in terms of sort of where we are. Across the business, we really like our position now, the way we finish in 2015 and our position in 2016 and the trajectory going into 2016 overall. So for us, what you would read into this is this is just another quarter kind of on a proof point of our underlying capability, and expect continued growth at the same levels going forward and the ability, frankly, to deal with any headwinds that are out there as we've been able to do and move the business forward.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. And then on consulting, the organic growth is usually seasonally highest in the fourth quarter because of private health exchanges. Why wasn't that the case this year? And could you just give us your latest thoughts on what you view is the opportunity for private health exchanges, especially since there has been some press that larger players are a bit slower to adopt and Cadillac tax might be pushed out?","Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well first, take a step back over all HR Solutions. Again, we love where we finished on the risk side. We really like where we finished on HR Solutions. And this is a business over the course of the year that produced 10% operating income growth, grew at 4%. We made substantial \u2013 and by the way, also achieved record margins. We made substantial investment scenarios like retirement and delegated it across the board, and in our Health Solutions. And again, we look at Health Solutions across the board, really every category in terms of the ability to help clients with this very important challenge they've got around the health side. And we think we've got one of the strongest capabilities here whether it's H&B, whether it's global benefits across the board, and on the exchanges. Retiree, active, employee, self, all across the board.","And what we would say, if you think about sort of quarter-over-quarter, first, we would agree the adoption on the health active side across the board, especially the larger end, hasn't been as fast as expected. By the way, especially given some of the results we've seen with existing clients because it's been a bit exceptional. Reduced volatility for them, price reductions year-over-year. 25%, in fact, had price reductions over the last year. So we're very, very positive in terms of the overall impact.","The pipeline looks very, very strong. And again, even in the exchange business as it exists, we had double-digit growth and it's profitable. So for us, we love this solution on behalf of clients, but as part of our broader health solution. I would reflect, by the way, in the fourth quarter last year, we had the single largest implementation on the retiree side, sort of in the history of the world and maybe will forever be in the history of the world. And that actually influenced results a bit, too. But we really like the business overall tremendously, and we're really feeling good about our position in HR Solutions.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question that we do have comes from the line of Quentin McMillan. Your line is open \u2013 from KBW.","Quentin McMillan - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Hi, guys. Thanks very much. Can I ask a question on seasonality, a two-part question? One on just the reinsurance brokerage organic bounce-back this quarter after a couple of quarters of negative growth. So it's nice to see some positive trend there. But the last time that you shared a positive number was in 4Q 2014. It may just be coincidence that that happened year-over-year, but can you talk about sort of how you account for revenue recognition in the reinsurance brokerage and if there's anything to read into that, and then possibly what that could mean for next year or for 4Q 2016?","And then on the HR Solutions side, your profitability in the fourth quarter basically doubles from the rest of the quarter. So can you just help us to also understand why there's so much more profitability in 4Q other than just the healthcare exchanges, and if there's anything else that we can kind of look at that? Thanks so much.","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So let me do sort of just technically how we account for reinsurance because I think that's one of your questions. So we account for revenue and reinsurance over the course of a 12-month period of time. And so therefore, what you're seeing in Q4 is revenue that was placed over the last 12 months. And that's really for our treaty business I'm talking about, which is about 80% to 85% of our total revenue. So 12-month revenue recognition.","So what you're seeing in our Q4 results is the last four quarters of revenue. And so it's sort of a lagging indicator because you're getting price over that last 12 months showing up in our current year's results. The facultative and capital markets, they are recognized in the quarter, so that's sort of 15% to 20% of our revenue.","Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer","And so if you step back on the reinsurance side, basically, in terms of where we finish and thinking about going into 2016. Again, this is consistent with the theme across the company. We feel very good about how we finish the year and what it sets to save for in 2016. Obviously, again, looking at in terms of the overall year, we're not happy with the level of growth and reinsurance of negative 1% for the year. But we've said already, we expect reinsurance to return a positive organic growth in 2016.","And for us \u2013 especially for our reinsurance business maybe more than any other. It's a great example of a business right now as business results don't really reflect the underlying capability and opportunity we see, which is exceptional. I mean, think about it, we're the largest adviser in the world in this area and really, number one in treaty, number one in fact, number one on the alternative capital side, capital markets. 20% of the global book is linked to U.S. property cat and that's wholly commission based. Those rates have come down 15% to 25% over the last 24 months and that's been reflected. Probably those are starting to flatten out a bit; the decrease is not as great.","But against that, it's really been the team's ability to continue to win 19 consecutive quarters of wins on treaty reinsurance, which had been exceptional, and really, the ability to create net new demand. And this is really in areas like mortgage overall and what we've done in ReView. So they've been able to offset these headwinds, which are diminishing, those businesses that they've offset whether they're going to continue to grow. And the opportunity going into 2016, we feel very good.","And we'd say, by the way, just technically, the 2% in this quarter is on top of a 5% in the Q4 2014, so it was kind of on top of a very strong comparable. So, we feel good about the position, and we love this business. We're very excited about it.","So maybe we go back to Christa on the HR Solutions side on sort of the seasonality overall.","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. So what I would describe, Quentin, is we have an HR business which is very seasonally orientated towards the second half of the year, and in particular towards Q4. As we think about the patenting for HR Solutions in 2016, it will look very similar to 2015 where from an operating income point of view, we are down in the first half, particularly in Q1. We're up in the second half, particularly in Q4. As you think about the overall HR Solutions business, we really have a very significant bias towards Q4 with annual enrollment in our benefits administration business primarily occurring in Q4, and healthcare exchanges primarily occurring in Q4 where you have expenses showing up in Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4 and revenue really coming through in Q4. And so that's why we're primarily a Q4-orientated business in terms of revenue and therefore operating income.","Quentin McMillan - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","That's perfect. Thanks so much guys. And if I can sneak one more in, just in terms of the leverage that you guys have. The debt to EBITDA came down from 2.6 to 2.3 in the quarter. And I think you'd previously indicated that you were sort of comfortable with that 2.6 level, and a willingness and an indication that you wanted to \u2013 you could use shares in the \u2013 I'm sorry, use debt in the future to repurchase shares. Is that still sort of the lineup to where your \u2013 what you think for 2016 and going forward? And what level do you feel comfortable at?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. It's a great question, Quentin. So what we would say is strong free cash flow generation, and therefore EBITDA growth allows us to continue to increase leverage in line with the 2 to 2.5 times leverage ratio. So we do see the opportunity for incremental leverage, given the strong free cash flow and EBITDA growth of the company.","Quentin McMillan - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Great. Thanks very much, guys.","Operator","Thank you. The next question that we do have comes from the line of Adam Klauber of William Blair. Your line is open.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. The sale of the Absence Management company, just a couple of points around that. Was that business higher or lower margin than your overall? In other words, will that help the margin going forward?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So as we think about the Absence Management business, it's a terrific business, helping businesses really manage their workforce overall. One of the things we would say about that business is given the high demand from corporations to manage their workforce and of the absence of their employees over time, it has significant \u2013 very high capital requirement to invest in this business over the coming years. And as we look at our strategy, it's not as core to our strategy as some other areas in which we've been investing.","And so as we think about the need to invest capital in this business over the coming years, we do believe that Guardian has a much higher priority in this area and they're going to substantially invest. And so we feel really good about partnering with them to continue to serve our clients in this area. We did not disclose the financials in this business, but you should think about this business as overall in line with our focus on improvement return on capital.","Quentin McMillan - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. And then just detail on that. I think you mentioned maybe $12 million of transaction cost. Was that in the operating line or was that adjusted out?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It is included in our HR Solutions operating income so it is in the operating line. So as we think about this business, there is obviously a gain that shows up in other income, which is quite significant. And then there are transaction costs and severance related to this showing up in the operating income of HR Solutions.","Quentin McMillan - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. And was the revenue for the Absence Management, was that pulled out for the fourth quarter or was that in the fourth quarter?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It was in the fourth quarter.","Quentin McMillan - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. Then on the \u2013 staying with the solutions on the HR cloud business. Is that business growing materially faster than your overall business? And how's the pipeline of large clients looking for 2016?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah...","Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer","This business has done exceptionally well. We love the position overall and it's growing well above double-digits. The fundamental capability we've got and the need clients have around HR transformation and improvement is just exceptional. And the capability we've got on the Workday front in particular is really, really carving out a lot of space there for us. And we're seeing the growth, not only in the HR side, but we're also seeing it as clients think about beyond HR transformation, how it relates to finance transformation. And this combination has just been incredibly positive.","By the way, Aon itself has going to do the same thing. We adopted Workday on the HR side. We've now adopted Workday and are implemented on the finance side. And we see the potential, and our clients see it as well. So for us, this has been a very, very strong growth business. We really like the capabilities here and the prospects on behalf of our clients.","Quentin McMillan - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thanks. And just one more. In the risk business, how much are exposures helping more now than a couple of quarters ago?","Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer","Exposures continue to be helpful. And by the way, it is the right question because in the end, a lot's discussed on price. It really is an issue of exposures as much as price. And again, we can clinically look at this with the Risk Insight Platform across our entire book at a very micro level. When you add all that together, price and exposures, they're net-net stable. So, the market roughly is stable. So, a little up, a little down but roughly it's been stable. And I'm really looking at the chart right now across multiple quarters and it's, give or take, stable. The prices have come down a little bit, exposures have come up and we \u2013 just how the market overall has performed.","From our standpoint, that's right, we don't really look at market conditions as an excuse not to grow or reinforcement to grow. We're going to grow either way, we have proven we can do that. 2015 is another example of that. We'll see it in 2016. And we've more than offset price changes and exposure changes with net new business and net new capabilities we brought to the marketplace, as well as our ability to retain our existing book of business and actually add services on to that. So, for us, overall, it's been market stable. And our ability to deal with it has been quite positive.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. The next question that we do have comes from the line of Kai Pan of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you so much. Good morning. First question is on the HR Solutions. And in the past, you have been guiding like year-over-year improvements in terms of underlying margin, as well as operating income; it grows from mid to high single digits. I just wonder is that still valid going forward?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi. We fully expect to grow revenue organically, to continue to expand margins and to grow operating income in HR Solutions as we have in 2015.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. That's great. And then just a number of question on the free cash flow target $2.4 billion looks like 2015 the reclassification as you benefit about more than $200 million. So, the raise of your guidance, the $100 million, I just wonder what's the calculation behind it?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I think one of these things that shares with help from taxes is really driven. The amount is the result of employee choice and the market value of the stock, two variables of which we have no control. So, as we think about it, we think that we have very strong free cash flow growth over the next coming years, and therefore, $2.4 billion is the right number. And this particular element we took out really has no impact on cash. And so we think that, therefore, $2.4 billion is the right goal going forward.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So there's no change in the underlying forecast for your free cash flow target?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. That's great. And lastly, Greg, if you could talk about on the acquisition front because the buybacks have been very meaningful return to shareholders. I just wonder like in this marketplace, where do you see the platform capability you could help grow like in the future and how do you balance between acquisitions versus shared buybacks?","Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Kai. We actually look at both, and if you look at our history over the last 10 years, we've actually been a little more leaning towards acquisitions when you look at some of the amount of our overall investments versus what the buyback has been over time. And underlying that, if you look back over the last 10 years, our operating income growth year-over-year has been roughly 11%. So, it's something we've really invested in. And invested heavily in organic improvement as well, as I've described before. The level of capabilities that we're investing in for existing clients, new clients and on the data and analytics side is we believe candidly quite unprecedented.","If you think about data and analytics, Global Risk Insight Platform to ReView to the Aon Client Treaty now at the endpoint, all the work we've done and delegated exchanges, you get the picture. So, we're very, very much focused on investment back into the business. And M&A plays a big role on that, and will continue to play a big role on that. And we probably \u2013 I'm looking at Christa \u2013 we'll probably look at more deals this year, situations this year that may be any time at our history measured in the billions. Done fewer of them, because we're always going to be disciplined around return on investment capital.","Christa has in place a very, very structured way to think about how we can very meticulously invest our capital to get to the highest return on capital, generate free cash flow and build wealth for our shareholders. And in the context of that, serve clients in a very, very effective way. And that's really the machine we've set up. That's how the engine runs and that's what we've done. So, we're going to continue to look at where the best places to place our capital. And we'll be open to acquisitions as we are, organic investment, buyback, and all of the above. That's really how we're looking at it.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Specifically, kind of a follow-up, if there's a price like discussion about wholesale platform. I'm wondering, if that's something would be of your interest?","Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer","Again we're not going to comment on specific situations or categories. But you can imagine, we're going to do what we need to do to actually support our clients and deliver distinctive value to our clients and do it in a way, again, that returns benefits to our shareholders. So, we're going to look at capabilities across the board. We've partnered with great capability on the wholesale side. We're going to continue to do that and always look at options.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That's great. Well, thank you so much, and good luck.","Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer","All right.","Operator","Thank you. The next question that we do have comes from the line of Vinay Misquith of Sterne Agee CRT. Your line is open.","Vinay Misquith - Sterne Agee CRT","Hi. Good morning. So the first question is on the HR Solutions. Margins grew by 100 basis points this year, while organic revenue growth was actually lower this year, that's 2015 versus 2014. Curious how you've managed to expand margins even though the organic revenues were lower this year versus last year.","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. It's a great question, and I think it's really about the investments we've made, Vinay, and the areas of growth that we've outlined: delegated investment management, HR BPO and our cloud solutions, and healthcare exchanges. And they are generating great returns on investments, which is how we're able to continue to expand margins and grow operating income at lower levels of organic growth. And so, we will continue to manage the portfolio on a return-on-capital basis. And generating improved cash flow from the investments we've made organically and inorganically in our business.","Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer","Vinay, really what's been highlighted here is the idea of operational leverage. And a lot of the core organic investments we make in the areas Christa described, same is true, by the way, on the Risk Solutions side, is the reason, again, back to we're very confident, comfortable talking about margin expansion in lower growth environments. By the way, don't take away from that that we're not interested in growing organically. We're absolutely focused on that and that is a high priority, and we'll continue to do that. But our ability to actually produce results in a variety of environments is really a function of our ability to invest heavily back in the business from an organic standpoint.","Vinay Misquith - Sterne Agee CRT","So that's helpful. And now within the segment, I believe there were $12 million of costs. So should we sort of add back those $12 million to say that that's the normalized operating income for the segment for this year?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, I think that's probably right.","Vinay Misquith - Sterne Agee CRT","Okay. Great. And then one last question, just on the free cash flow and maybe my math is not that great, but my understanding is that the reclassification helped the free cash flow by about $200 million. And the future guidance for free cash flow has increased only by $100 million. So, have the underlying cash flows for the future sort of come down by $100 million?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, they have not. So, one of the things that I tried and obviously failed to communicate earlier was this number varies substantially by year. And the amount is a result of employee's choice, growth in net shares and the market value of our stock. Therefore, we have no control over the number. As we think about our free cash flow going forward, there is no change to our view on the underlying free cash flow growth of the firm. We do believe that this amount going forward is somewhere between $0 and $100 million, therefore, we've increased our target by $100 million to $2.4 billion.","One of the other things I would make clear is that the $2.4 billion in free cash flow in 2017 is fully deployable cash, because if you look at the $1.7 billion we generated in 2015, we actually returned $1.9 billion of cash to shareholders in 2015. So, we are generating a huge amount of cash, which we can fully deploy on either return to shareholders or, as Greg said, investing back into our business either organically or inorganically in the form of M&A. So we're very excited about the future growth potential of the firm given the huge cash flow generation we're going to produce.","Vinay Misquith - Sterne Agee CRT","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question we do have comes from the line of Charles Sebaski of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning and thank you. I guess, the first question, Christa, a follow-up to the free cash flow question going forward. With regard to the working capital improvement, I guess, I was just hoping you can just help me understand a little bit how that is truly incremental as opposed to timing. I guess, if I think you pull in your accounts receivable and push out payables is a timing issue, but is there something else in that that's truly incremental to free cash flow?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Well, the one other thing that I would say is that we are on a sort of march now to really improve our flow-through of every $1 of revenue through to $1 of free cash flow. And I would say we're on a 10-year journey to get there. I think the overall industry in which we operate has not been particularly focused on free cash flow, and I think it has been a journey for us, which we've been on really for the last, you know, almost five years.","And I think as we continue to improve the collection of cash from customers and we continue to manage the payment of cash to suppliers, we believe that we have improvements in cash for at least the next five years to eight years in terms of working capital. And it's structural improvements in the process around which we do this, in the way in which we manage this, in the overall portfolio of business we do. So, I guess, what I would say as you think about Aon, we believe we should be working capital neutral overall and we are far from that today. So, we believe the upside in terms of cash from working capital is substantial over the coming years.","Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","I guess, and obviously you guys are a different business or like in a different business, but I guess in some other industries if you pull in your receivables faster, an incremental improvement might be of less charge-offs, right? You have less credit events; that there's something is truly is incrementally increasing as opposed to just the time value of money by getting that cash flow today versus 90 days from now. I guess I'm wondering, is there structural elements in that improvement for you or is it timing related?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It's absolutely structural. If you think about today, we are tying up a huge amount of cash, essentially, by not collecting the cash from customers early enough, or by paying suppliers. And so, as we think about return on capital of Aon, we are managing our overall portfolio to improve cash in this area. And we would say, we are making structural process improvements, and have for the last couple of years. You can see it if you look at receivables divided by revenue you can see days sales outstanding improve over time. And the same on the supplier side.","And so, whether we're improving invoice velocity or eliminating prepaid expenses, there are a number of structural things we're doing to improve the flow-through of $1 revenue to $1of free cash flow.","Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. I appreciate that. I guess, finally just on the risk business and the investments you guys have made in the data and analytics. I think now we more clearly see on the reinsurance side or maybe the GRIP program with the insurance carriers. I was hoping you might be able to just expound a little bit on where maybe some of these data and analytic investments are helping you improve the retail. I don't know if you need to charge for it at the retail level or if it flows through in organic growth. And that piece of it, if you think of kind of the multitude pieces in the risk business, the real core retail side and where the data and analytics is helping the business there.","Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer","So the effort on data and analytics has really been multi-year and ongoing. And for us, we believe it's going to be fundamental to what we needed to try to get it accomplished over time, Charles. It really is going to be differentiated in terms of our capability versus the marketplace. And there are many examples. By the way, the risk insight platform efforts really are actually, the work is done directly with the primary insurers serving clients. So it actually touches very much the primary insurance marketplace.","But let me give you one example that \u2013 I happened to be just in London yesterday with Lloyd's and Lloyd's syndicates. We just launched something called Aon Client Treaty, which is a very \u2013 it's basically built on a foundation around data and analytics. So in essence, it will be, when done, the single biggest underlying transaction likely in the history of Lloyd's to-date and it really takes our book that goes into the London market to our global broking center and we actually modeled that book in detail, really bottom up, all different aspects of what's going on. 64,000 policy transactions, 120 different classes of business, 157 countries. You get the idea. We built an incredible data room in which underwriters will come in and actually take a company-level understanding at underwriting and then apply it to portfolio level.","And in essence, what we're saying to our client, by the way, on Monday happening at our Property Symposium, I'm talking to clients in our Property Symposium and essentially saying if you're going to use London capacity, you've eliminated your tail risks. So when you actually think about the set of syndicates that are actually going to come to bear on behalf of you, the last three, four, or five actually create risk. We've eliminated that.","So we've actually pre-confirmed 20% of that capacity that will follow a lead capacity going into London. That makes that capital we're bringing to bear much, much more competitive. So there's an example of hard clear data and analytics but essentially we've analyzed our book sort of, it happens to be in the London marketplace, but imagine, we can look at this all over the world in which we're actually providing distinctive value, unduplicated value to clients using data and analytics.","So, that was a little bit longwinded, but I hope you get the idea that it's a very powerful tool. By the way, in order to do that, you had to be able to analyze all 6,000 clients going into London in a way that, frankly, leverages off our risk insight platform. Never been done before.","Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you very much for the answers.","Operator","Thank you. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Greg Case for the closing remarks.","Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer","Excellent. Well, let me apologize again for the logistics during the Q&A. If anything comes up and you want to ask us, please feel free. We're available at any time.

Thank you for holding. Welcome to Aon Plc's Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all parties will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer portion of today's call. If anyone has any objection, you may disconnect your line at this time.","I would also like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded.

Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our second quarter 2016 results as well as having been posted on our website.","I would now like to hand the call over to Greg Case.","Gregory C. Case - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director","Thank you. And good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter 2016 conference call. Joining me here today is our CFO, Christa Davies. I would note that there are slides available on our website for you to follow along with our commentary today.","Consistent with previous quarters, I'd like to cover two areas before turning the call over to Christa for further financial review. First is our performance against key metrics we communicate to shareholders. Second is overall organic growth performance, including continued areas of strategic investment across Aon.","On the first topic, our performance versus key metrics. Each quarter, we measure our performance against the key metrics we focus on achieving over the course of the year: grow organically, expand margins, increase earnings per share, and deliver free cash flow growth.","Turning to slide three. In the second quarter organic revenue growth was 3%, highlighted by 4% growth in Retail Brokerage with 6% growth in the International Brokerage business. Operating margin increased 30 basis points, reflecting strong operating performance in Risk Solutions. EPS increased 6% to $1.39, reflecting operational improvement and effective capital management. And finally, free cash flow for the six months increased $224 million to $660 million, driven by a 32% increase in cash flow from operations and a decline in capital expenditures.","Overall, results continue to reflect the strength of our industry-leading platform in a volatile microeconomic environment with positive performance across each of our key metrics, for both the second quarter and the first six months of 2016.","Turning to slide four on the second topic of growth and investment. I want to spend the next few minutes discussing the quarter for both of our segments.","In Risk Solutions, organic revenue growth was 3% compared to 2% in the prior-year quarter, driven by growth across all major businesses. As we've discussed previously, we're driving a set of initiatives and making strategic investments that are strengthening underlying performance and position our Risk Solutions segment for long-term growth and improved operating leverage with management of our renewal book portfolio through a proactive client partnership we call Aon Client Promise, which is driving retention rates of more than 90% on average across Retail Brokerage; new business generation of roughly $280 million across Retail Brokerage, including double digit growth in Asia and EMEA and another quarter of record new business in U.S. Retail; 21 consecutive quarters of positive net new business in core treaty reinsurance; and increased operating leverage from our significant investments in innovative technology and data and analytics, including Aon Inpoint, where we empower carriers to become more competitive, effective and operationally efficient by integrating our market-leading data and analytics with strategic consulting and access to Aon's unmatched expertise. This includes the Risk Insight Platform, which now captures 3.2 million trades and more than $160 billion of bound premium, and Review, our reinsurer dashboard.","Another example is our Aon broking initiative to better match client need with insurer appetite for risk and to identify structured portfolio solutions. A great example of client impact in this area was the launch of Aon Client Treaty, the largest ever underwritten portfolio of risk in the history of Lloyd's, enabling our clients to access 20% of pre-secured unique co-insurance capacity.","And finally, we're expanding our content and global footprint through tuck-in acquisitions that increase scale in emerging markets and expand capability.","For example, in the second quarter, we completed the acquisition of Univers, an elective benefits enrollment and communications firm, strengthening our ability to serve clients as the leading provider of a comprehensive benefit solutions.","Reflecting on our individual businesses within Risk Solutions. In the Americas, organic revenue growth was 2%. Exposures continued to be positive across the region, while the impact from pricing was negative, resulting in relatively stable market impact overall. We saw double digit growth in Affinity, driven by growth across all product lines. In U.S. Retail, we saw modest growth driven by record new business generation and strong retention.","Results also reflect modest growth in Latin America, driven by new business generation, despite macroeconomic challenges facing the region.","In international, organic revenue growth was 6% compared to 2% in the prior-year quarter. The impact from pricing remains negative on average, driven by fragile market conditions in various countries across Europe and Asia and continued pricing pressure in the Pacific region, while exposures are modestly improving.","Results reflect solid growth across every major region, including EMEA, Asia, and the Pacific, driven by strength in both new business generation and management of the renewal book portfolio.","In Continental Europe we delivered the highest organic revenue growth in over six years, with growth across all product lines, including Health & Benefits, Affinity, and Retail, reflecting Aon's strength in client leadership across the region despite macroeconomic environment that remains challenged in many countries.","In Reinsurance, organic revenue growth was 1% compared to a negative 1% in the prior-year quarter. This marks the third consecutive quarter of positive growth in Reinsurance, further reflecting our previous guidance of an expected return to modest growth in 2016. Results in the quarter were primarily driven by growth in global facultative placements, cedent demand in Treaty, and from new business generation. Results were partially offset by an unfavorable market impact internationally.","As the rate of price declines continue to moderate, capital is being deployed to new markets, including U.S. mortgage credit risk, life and annuity risk, and other emerging risks, such as cyber liability. And as highlighted in our prior discussions, new business opportunities for growth, combined with industry-leading data and analytics, has positioned our Reinsurance business for a return to modest growth in 2016.","Turning to HR Solutions, organic revenue growth was 1% overall, as growth across high demand areas where we continue to invest was partially offset by a modest decline in benefits administration, and unfavorable timing. We continue to strengthen our industry-leading platform with investments in innovative solutions and client-serving capabilities that reflect Aon Hewitt's leadership and in-depth understanding of market trends, including solutions to help plan sponsors both manage pension risk and drive better retirement outcomes for their employees.","A strong area of growth has been delegated investment consulting, where assets under management have grown from $10 billion to roughly $85 billion in five years. We expect continued global growth in this area as sponsors are faced with regulatory changes and increasingly complex global markets. Continued investments to strengthen our industry-leading position of health solutions, covering the full range of benefit strategies, client size, and funding choices, including our suite of private healthcare exchanges.","We continue to see strong and steady growth across our entire suite of exchange solutions for companies of all sizes and industries. Starbucks recently joined a growing list of employers on our Active Healthcare Exchange. We're proud to help Starbucks introduce a new health solution that enables Starbucks' U.S. employees to have greater choice, opportunities for cost savings and personalized support to select and get the most out of their health insurance coverage.","Starbucks' decision to adopt a consumer-driven approach to health benefits underscores the sustainability of our exchange model and proven results that our exchange has achieved on behalf of clients over the past several years.","We also continue to invest in Software-as-a-Service models in our HR BPO business, where growth in new clients and conversion of existing clients is driving strong demand, as well as the expansion of our capabilities to include financial implementations.","And finally, we're investing into data and analytics in our health and talent and rewards businesses to provide superior advice to drive better outcomes for our clients and our clients' employees.","Turning to the individual businesses within HR Solutions, in Consulting Services, organic revenue growth was 1%. Results reflect growth in core pension solutions where we provide clients an in-depth approach to pension risk management and the best solutions to take advantage of the market shift from defined benefit to defined contribution.","We also saw continued growth in retirement consulting, primarily driven by demand for delegated investment consulting services as an increasing number of clients find significant value in Aon's ability to provide advice and manage their retirement assets. Results in the quarter were partially offset by unfavorable timing of revenue in our compensation consulting practice.","In Outsourcing, organic revenue growth was flat versus the prior-year quarter. We saw strong growth continue in HR BPO, driven by new client wins and cloud-based solutions. Results in the quarter were offset by a modest decline in benefits administration as well as a decline in project-related work around lump sum windows for pension plans that created an unfavorable comparison in the prior-year quarter.","Overall, in HR Solutions, we expect to deliver improved organic growth in the second half of the year, driven primarily by growth in high demand areas where we've been investing, a modest benefit from revenue timing that impacted this quarter, and seasonal strength in the fourth quarter.","In summary, for both the second quarter and the first six months, we delivered solid organic revenue growth against a volatile macroeconomic environment, improved operational performance, and generated substantial free cash flow.","With that said, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Christa for further financial review. Christa?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you very much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg noted, against continued volatility in the macroeconomic environment, our industry-leading platform delivered solid progress in the first half of the year, with positive performance across each of our four key metrics. Results reflect organic growth in both segments, strong operating margin expansion in Risk Solutions and substantial free cash flow generation.","Now, let me turn to the financial results for the quarter on page six of the presentation. Our core EPS performance, excluding certain items, increased 6% to $1.39 per share for the second quarter compared to $1.31 in the prior-year quarter. Certain items that were adjusted for in the core EPS performance and highlighted in the schedules on page 12 of the press release include non-cash intangible asset amortization and non-cash expenses related to certain pension settlements.","There was no material impact on earnings per share related to foreign currency translation in the second quarter. If currency were to remain stable at today's rates, we would expect foreign currency translation to have no material impacts going forward.","Now let me talk about each of the segments on the next slide. In our Risk Solutions segment, organic revenue growth was 3%. Operating margin increased 70 basis points to 24.9% and operating income increased 3% compared to the prior-year quarter. Operating margin improvement of 70 basis points includes a 50 basis point favorable impact from foreign currency translation.","Excluding the impact from foreign currency, underlying operating margin improved 20 basis points in the quarter. Operating improvement in the second quarter reflects organic growth in each business, including Reinsurance, and improved returns on our investments in data analytics across the portfolio.","For the first six months, operating margin improved 80 basis points, including a 40 basis point favorable impact from foreign currency translation. Our performance in the first half firmly positions the Risk Solutions segment for further margin expansion towards our long-term target of 26%.","With normal seasonal weakness in Q3 and seasonal strength in Q4, we expect a stronger second half of the year for Risk Solutions. Included in our expectation are two underlying adjustments. We expect certain client revenue to shift from Q3 into Q4, and we expect a shift in certain underlying compensation expense from Q4 into Q3. As a result, we expect normal quarterly patterning to be more pronounced this year, with modest operating income growth in Q3, significant operating income growth in Q4 and no change to the full year expected performance.","Turning to the HR Solutions segment. Organic revenue growth was 1%. Operating margin decreased 40 basis points to 12.8% and operating income decreased 8% compared to the prior-year quarter. For the first six months, the operating margin decreased 90 basis points and operating income decreased 11%. Reported results are in line with our previous guidance of flat to down in the first half.","Performance was primarily driven by investments for future growth, timing of certain revenue in our compensation consulting business and an anticipated reduction in operating income reflecting the disposal of two businesses in previous quarters. While we continue to reduce certain expenses that supported those noncore businesses, the monetization of those businesses in previous quarters generated other income gains and cash proceeds that will ultimately be deployed to higher return on invested capital opportunities.","Looking forward, in line with our previous guidance for HR Solutions, we expect a strong second half of the year. This expectation reflects normal seasonality in Q3 of relatively flat operating income growth and normal seasonal strength in Q4 of significant operating income growth, with full year results continuing to deliver solid organic revenue growth, further margin expansion towards our long-term operating margin target of 22% and increased operating income for the full year.","Now let me discuss a few of the line items outside of the operating segments on slide nine. Unallocated expenses were $43 million compared to $41 million in the prior-year quarter. Interest income was $3 million compared to $4 million in the prior-year quarter. Interest expense increased $5 million to $73 million, due to an overlap of long-term debt placed in the first quarter with debt that matured in the second quarter.","Other income was immaterial as the losses on certain long-term investments and foreign exchange hedging programs were offset by the sale of a certain business.","Going forward, we expect a run rate of approximately $45 million per quarter of unallocated expense, $3 million per quarter of interest income and $71 million per quarter of interest expense.","Turning to taxes, the adjusted effective tax rate on net income from continuing operations excluding the applicable tax impacts associated with non-cash pension settlements decreased to 17.4% compared to 18% in the prior-year quarter. This was driven by changes in the geographic distribution of income and certain favorable discrete tax adjustments. The prior-year quarter adjusted effective tax rate excluded the applicable tax impact associated with expenses related to legacy litigation.","Lastly, average diluted shares outstanding decreased 6% to 269.8 million in the second quarter compared to 286.7 million in the prior-year quarter driven by share repurchase in previous quarters. The company did not repurchase shares in the second quarter. Strong cash flow generation was used in the near term for $500 million of debt that matured in the quarter and an attractive acquisition in the quarter in the elective benefit space. We expect to return to deploying capital to share repurchases in the second half of the year, reflecting our highest return on invested capital. The company has $3.3 billion of remaining authorization under its share repurchase program.","Actual shares outstanding on June 30 was 265.8 million. And there are approximately 5 million additional dilutive equivalents. Estimated Q3 2016 beginning dilutive share count is approximately 271 million, subject to share price movement, share issuance, and share repurchase.","Now let me turn to the next slide to highlight our solid balance sheet and strong cash flow growth on slide 10. At June 30, 2016, cash and short-term investments was $689 million. Total debt outstanding declined to approximately $6.2 billion and total debt to EBITDA on a GAAP basis declined 2.4 times, reflecting the extinguishment of $500 million of debt that came due in the quarter.","Cash flow from operations for the first six months increased 32%, or $186 million, to $764 million, driven by an increase in net income, a decrease in cash tax payments, a decline in cash paid for pension contributions, and underlying working capital improvements. Strong progress in the first six months of the year.","Free cash flow, as defined by cash flow from operations less CapEx, increased 51%, or $224 million, to $660 million, reflecting strong growth in cash flow from operations and a $38 million decrease in CapEx.","Looking forward we expect to deliver double digit free cash flow growth for the full year 2016 and are firmly on track to deliver against our near-term goal of $2.4 billion of free cash flow for the full year 2017.","Turning to the next slide to discuss our significant increases in free cash flow. We value the firm based on free cash flow and allocate capital to maximize free cash flow return. Free cash flow of $2.4 billion in 2017 is not our end goal, as further long-term sustainable free cash flow will be driven by continued operating income growth and additional working capital initiatives beyond 2017.","There are four primary areas that are expected to contribute to our near-term goal of delivering $2.4 billion or more for the full year 2017. The first is continued operational performance driven by organic revenue growth and margin expansion. The second is working capital improvements as we focus on closing the gaps between receivables and payables. We've made substantial progress in this area over the last five years with further opportunity to increase free cash flow by over $500 million. Third is declining uses of cash for pension contributions, CapEx and restructurings, which we expect to free up more than $90 million of annual free cash flow between the end of 2015 and 2017. And fourth, lower cash tax payments, reflecting a lower effective tax rate.","Turning to our pension plan. We continue to take significant steps to reduce volatility and liability. In the first half of 2016, we completed two transactions to materially de-risk our pension liabilities in the UK. The first was a buy-in completed with assets in the trust to reduce the size of our largest risk within certain UK pension schemes. And secondly, through a lump sum offering, Aon was able to reduce interest rate, investment and longevity risk associated with certain UK pension liabilities. These transactions resulted in $62 million of non-cash settlement charges and related advisory fees, which are adjusted for in our second quarter results. Both of these transactions were completed prior to the Brexit vote as a continuation of our de-risking efforts. As a result, our UK pension scheme funding status remained relatively flat through the Brexit result despite the recent fall in the UK interest rates and market volatility.","Further, we expect pension contributions to decline by approximately $44 million in 2016 and expect non-cash pension income, excluding the expenses related to the described transactions, to be a modest benefit in 2016 versus 2015.","In summary, we delivered solid results for the second quarter and the first six months of 2016 and continue to take certain steps to strengthen the return on invested capital and free cash flow. Against continued volatility in the macroeconomic environment, we expect improved organic revenue growth and operational performance in the second half of 2016, primarily driven by seasonal strength in Q4.","Our industry-leading platform and innovative investments across data analytics continue to position the firm for long-term growth, increased operational leverage and substantial free cash flow generation towards our near-term goal of $2.4 billion for the full year 2017.","With that, I'd like to turn the call back to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, ma'am. Our first question comes from Sarah DeWitt with JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Gregory C. Case - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director","Hi, Sarah.","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","First on the Starbucks announcement, how should we think about the benefit of that opportunity to the top and bottom line?","Gregory C. Case - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director","Well, first of all, Sarah, let me just start with overall. We're just really pleased, we're excited, we're proud to partner with Starbucks. This firm obviously, as you know, has got a long history of providing industry-leading benefits to its partners or employees, and it's really who they are as a company. They've been doing this for a long time. But they're also an industry leader on the healthcare side, committed not only to providing partners with access to healthcare, but also, candidly, shaping the role of the future employer based healths across the entire country. So, this for us is a very \u2013 and an innovative company in multiple ways who we partnered with to provide better choice, better transparency for their employees.","So we're very excited about doing that. And this for us is just a continuation with a host of other companies who've joined the exchange who want to make a difference on behalf of their employees. And it's one option as part of our overall health platform, which, as we said before, we really love. We love the set of opportunities here to support and help clients and this is just a continuation of that. So, as we've said before, we're going to continue to drive performance in HR Solutions. You'll see that for the year. Starbucks will be included in that, and that will just be a continuation.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thanks. And then, given the decline in interest rates year-to-date, should we anticipate any higher pension contributions than what's outlined on page 11 of the slides, given that's as of year-end 2015?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No. And the reason for that is we've really taken substantial efforts over the last 10 years to close our plans, freeze them and de-risk them. And so, because of that, we're in a position where the pension contributions will not change.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks for the answer.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dave Styblo with Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.","David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC","Hi there. Good morning. Thanks for the questions. Let me start out just on the inferred (24:50) organic growth in the second half and make sure I understand. So it sounds like it's mostly related to the HR Solutions side. And if that's really the case, can you again walk us through some of the components? I know there is a little bit of timing and it sounded like the typical seasonality that you have, but is there other visibility that you have on project-based work that maybe wasn't there this quarter that you expect to come in later on?","Gregory C. Case - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director","Dave, the commentary really is applicable to both the risk side of the business and the HR Solutions side of the business. And what you're seeing in HR Solutions is just the natural continuation as this business trends to more of a second half set of engagements, particularly around the fourth quarter set of engagements. So that's really what you're seeing trending here.","That's amplified a little bit by some timing that Christa highlighted, but this is just, for us, a natural evolution. The real piece here is our expectation that the year stays exactly the same, there's absolutely no change in terms of what we were thinking about and have been thinking about for the first six months, and in fact, feel good about the trends against that. We see what the pipeline looks like. We see how it's going to evolve and, as I said before, it's really just \u2013 if you think about some of the work we've done in HR BPO and in cloud, it's just more of a fourth quarter business than we've seen historically.","And then on the risk side, same piece: we expect a stronger second half than we saw in the first half and continued growth in the overall business, so no change to the year.","David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC","Okay, got it. And then on the margin \u2013 sorry, there was some background noise. But on the margin, Risk Solutions up 20 basis points. I know I think you said it was up 40 basis points excluding constant currency. Is that sort of in line with what you were looking for or \u2013 some of the peers have reported some larger margin expansions with organic growth that hasn't been as robust as yours. So, curious just to hear your thoughts on that.","And then can you help us triangulate a little bit on HR Solutions? I know the portfolio repositioning changed a little bit of perhaps the base. And so margins down 30 basis points year-over-year, but I think last quarter, you guys started to give us some facts and figures about how much the portfolio repositioning changed the underlying margin base. So, if you could help give color on that so we understand the down pressure on margins year-over-year, that would be helpful.","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. So, let's start with risk. I think the first thing I'd say about risk is, I wouldn't over rotate on any one quarter. We do expect a stronger second half to the year in both Risk Solutions and HR Solutions, as Greg said, as we are becoming a more Q4 orientated company just in terms of the patterning of our revenue and operating income. And therefore, we expect for Risk Solutions strong organic revenue growth, margin expansion and operating income growth for the full year 2016.","In terms of HR Solutions, I would note, as you said, there is an impact if you look at the first half of the year in terms of the divestitures. And that's having an impact of about $6 million in terms of lost operating income in the first half of the year. And obviously there is some stranded costs associated with those divestitures, which is really why we originally gave guidance in HR Solutions which is down in the first half, up in the second half. And what you're really seeing in the second half is we're working through exiting those stranded costs in Q3 and that's why Q4 will be stronger than Q3.","David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC","Okay. So about $6 million of costs you said, right?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","$6 million of operating income.","David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC","Of income, right. Okay. And then just lastly just on free cash flow, obviously a strong start. I know there were some easier comps in the first half but as we look into the second half, I can't imagine we keep up with that pace. Yeah, there were some timing events that got pulled forward in the first half here or \u2013 maybe just help us bridge to what you might define as double digit growth a little bit more precisely.","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So we obviously expect very strong free cash flow growth for the full year, double digit free cash flow growth for full year 2016, which will put us well on track for our $2.4 billion free cash flow in 2017. Obviously, the 51% growth in free cash flow won't continue at exactly that pace, because we did have in Q2 2015 the $137 million cash outflow related to legal settlements. But we do expect very strong free cash flow growth and much stronger cash flow in absolute dollars in the second half of the year aligned with the revenue and operating income growth for the company.","Gregory C. Case - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director","We are really seeing, as we've talked before, is our intention is to grow organically, improve margins and improve earnings per share, but to continue to work to translate our operating income and revenue performance into free cash flow. So that engine, that translation is continuing to become disproportionally stronger and that's exactly what you are seeing here, which is why we have been able to achieve the free cash flow performance in the first half, which is on top of record free cash flow performance in 2015.","David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thanks for the questions.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question from Adam Klauber with William Blair. Please go ahead.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC","Good morning. Thanks.","Gregory C. Case - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director","Hey, Adam.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC","Couple of questions around the HR BPO. One, have you continued to have some major wins there? Two, any success moving over to the financials? And then three, I think I heard that and I thought that business is a little tilted towards the fourth quarter, is that right?","Gregory C. Case - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director","That's exactly right on the trend line in terms of the disproportionally skewed more toward the fourth quarter, and this is exactly what we're trying to highlight on the call today. We love the progress though here. The team has just done a terrific job, not only in the translation of what we do with our cloud-based businesses on the HR side, but also what we're doing on the finance side. And you can see that evolution starting in HR, moving to finance and eventually connecting the two back which is really where the opportunity is. And from our standpoint, our pipeline is literally sold out in this category. The team has just done a terrific job.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. So you have had some wins on the finance side?","Gregory C. Case - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director","We have actually made real progress on the finance side. And I would say that the speakers on the phone today are quite engaged in that and are excited about that for Aon as well. So we're putting our money where our mouth is as we always do and are very excited about what we're going to achieve in this, not only for us and the opportunities there, but also globally in terms of what we've got going on. So we're very excited about the possibilities here.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. And then, as far as Univers acquisition, looks like they do engagement and enrollment. Clearly those were the things that you already did. What does this add? Does it help you attack a different market segment?","Gregory C. Case - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director","This is terrific. This is a great example of when we take businesses we've done very, very well in, add content and capability and are able to scale that. So Univers brings \u2013 really, this is an elective benefits enrollment and communications firm, as you've highlighted and we highlighted. They bring it into the middle market and across the U.S. and have just an incredibly strong client base. We're going to be able to engage that client base with a broader set of products and services we provide but also take their capability to our client base as well. So we're very excited about this. This is a great example of, as we've described, tuck-in acquisitions in which we can take content and amplify content, and that's exactly what this is about.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC","And have you said what range of revenue they bring in?","Gregory C. Case - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director","We haven't talked about that, no.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Gregory C. Case - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah. Thank you and good morning.","Gregory C. Case - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director","Hi, Kai.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So the first question is on Brexit. Can you elaborate a little bit on that, what's the near-term as well as what's the long-term impact?","Gregory C. Case - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director","Kai, I would say \u2013 maybe I'll divide the Brexit question into two parts. One is just for our clients, and that's really the lens, as you know, that we look through \u2013 we look through everything out in the world through the lens of our clients. And obviously, there's a lot of uncertainty, our clients are going through a lot of questions, both in the region, but also globally, in terms of what the impact is going to be, and we're very vigilant. We spend a great deal of time with our clients on the tradeoffs and issues and areas that they are trying to address in the context of it. And you watch that evolve like we do. And we think there will continue to be uncertainty.","As it relates to Aon, the second part, for us, Brexit, like all things that involve client uncertainty, it's an opportunity to help clients understand the situation and take actions to improve their positions. And Brexit has proven to be just that for us, both on the HR Solutions side as well as on the risk side. So from a financial impact from our standpoint, this is really an opportunity to help and support clients. And as I said before, they are facing a lot of uncertainty and we want to help them address that.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Are there any sort of near-term...","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Kai, just in terms of the financial impacts, I guess what I would say is overall the biggest impact for us is on currency. And so a weaker pound is best for us because we do have about $350 million to $400 million of U.S. denominated revenue into the Lloyd's marketplace in the UK. And so a weaker pound actually helps us.","There's an offsetting impact in the consulting business that is negative, but net-net it's a benefit. And the only other impact I think I did previously address was interest rates. I think we've had a number of questions from people on interest rates and the impact of that on our pensions and I said it's immaterial.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Have you seen any sort of deferred project related to Brexit?","Gregory C. Case - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director","Listen, again, there is a range of client reactions. Some clients are deferring and trying to understand and get greater clarity. We're helping them to do that. Other clients are engaging us to actually understand the situation and figure out where there might be opportunity for them as they think about Brexit. So, net-net from our standpoint, again, in times of uncertainty, it's a time to help clients succeed, and that's actually been a benefit as we've engaged them to do that.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. That's great. And then on the Risk Solutions side, you mentioned the pattern shift in terms of revenue from third quarter to fourth quarter and also the compensation shifting backwards from fourth quarter to third quarter. Could you provide a little bit more detail context to that? And also, will these be the same pattern going forward?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So the first answer is yes, it will be the same pattern going forward. And one of the reasons for this is we are seeing client buying behavior shift their buying patterns from Q3 to Q4 in risk to really align around budgeting for the calendar year. And so, we do expect that client buying trend to continue. And then this shift in underlying compensation expenses from Q4 into Q3 we would expect to be a permanent shift too, yes.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And lastly, on tax rate, it had been consistently lower than our expectations. So I just wonder, is that run rate for the last like six months would be a good one going forward?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No. We do expect that the correct ongoing tax rate for the company is 19%. We did see some positive discrete tax adjustments again in the quarter, really around state audits. It is actually impossible to predict discrete tax adjustments; they could be positive or negative. And so, 19% is the right operating rate for the company.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you so much for all the answers.","Gregory C. Case - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director","Thanks, Kai.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question from Charles Sebaski with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning and thank you. I guess the first question, Greg, I was hoping you could help me understand a little bit on the Americas organic growth and reconciling your commentary that U.S. has had record new business. I guess, when I think of record new business in the U.S., it would seem that's the larger portion of that and I would have thought that that would be higher, just given that commentary.","Gregory C. Case - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director","Yeah. What I was really talking about \u2013 first of all, just to be clear, the U.S. did have record new business, actually it was a $100 million-plus quarter, the first time we've ever done $100 million in Q2. So, it was really a terrific testament to the team with very strong retention. A lot of things go into that, rollover, et cetera. But remember, Q2 is one quarter and it tends to be among our smallest quarters, Q2 and Q3. And from our standpoint, as we look at the overall trend line for the year, what I was describing is really the opportunities for the year, and that's really how we look at those, and highlighted what we see in the pipeline for the opportunities in the second half for U.S. Retail and really for risk overall. And then we skew, as Christa just described, I think very well, why the fourth quarter is higher or stronger than the rest of our quarters.","Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. And Aon Inpoint, could you give us some idea on what the size or scale of this business is currently and what the expectation of that business could be going forward?","Gregory C. Case - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director","Yeah, well, we've talked about \u2013 Aon Inpoint is just a great example. When you think about growth for Aon overall, as we've highlighted on previous calls, we've got all the work we do on the traditional side of the business and putting in place things like Aon Client Promise and really substantially increasing our ability to acquire clients, retain clients, and do more with clients.","We've also talked about some of the other areas of investment outside of the traditional areas, and we highlighted a couple on the last call. There are $1 billion-plus businesses in Affinity and Health & Benefits that are growing substantially. And then Aon Inpoint is another example really outside the core in which we've made substantial investment.","And Aon Inpoint really is bringing together what is a very unique and the single biggest repository of insurance information that exists in the world today and pulling it together on behalf of our clients. And in this case, they happen to be insurance carriers. We've got 45-plus carriers who are involved right now, and we're helping them think about how they improve their business, grow their business overall.","We haven't talked about the size, but what I would say is, this is a very \u2013 been very positive for us in terms of supporting carriers, strengthening overall position. And it's another example of how we've used data and analytics as a core and cornerstone piece of what we do. And so, for us, it's just another example of where we're investing to grow the business.","By the way, not only do we have Aon Inpoint, now we also have something called Aon Review, which is doing the same thing on the reinsurance side. We've actually taken the data and analytics approach that really underpins Aon Inpoint and used it as part of our U.S. mortgage effort, that's, by the way, reached $5 billion-plus in premium since its inception, which is a great accomplishment. And then things like Aon Client Treaty. These are fundamentally data-driven, analytic-driven businesses that we see a lot of promise for.","Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Right. And lastly, I guess, Christa, could you help me out with one thing on the cash flow, and I'm trying to work through understanding the improvement from cash flow from improvements in working capital on the accounts receivable and payable that you've mentioned and how this is net new cash flow, as opposed to accounting timing, if I think pulling receivables from calendar year 2018 into 2017 or 2017 into 2016, or is it actually net new in some manner and how would that be actual net new dollars?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So I guess one way to think about it on the receivables side is if you've got a dollar of revenue today and it takes you 100 days to collect it, then you're tying up a lot of cash on your balance sheet in the form of receivables. And if we get the 100 days, for argument's sake, down to 50 days, then you've halved the amount of cash that you're tying up on your balance sheet in the form of receivables. And what you can see if you divide receivables by revenue on our balance sheet, is that days' sales outstanding has come down substantially. And so it's taking us less time to collect cash from customers. And so we are getting more in line with what we think a professional services firm should be, which is working capital neutral.","And today if you looked at our days payables and our days sales outstanding, there is a 15-day negative gap, and we believe that should be neutral. And the difference between that is the extra $500 million of free cash flow I mentioned. So we think there is a substantial opportunity to continue to improve working capital and generate substantial free cash flow over the coming years.","Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Is there a cost to that 15-day net? I mean, in a low interest rate environment like we're in today, what's the cost of that spread?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, it's not. There is no cost.","Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you very much.","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It's just processing.","Operator","Our next question comes from Quentin McMillan with KBW. Please go ahead.","Quentin McMillan - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Thanks very much, guys. I just wanted to talk about the divestitures really quickly. You had a decrease in expenses for the divestitures, but the overall kind of divestiture strategy, particularly as it relates to HR Solutions, as you drive towards your 22% long-term margin target, do you need to divest some of the lower return businesses in order to achieve that in HR, or are you happy with the current portfolio and it's just improvement in those businesses?","Gregory C. Case - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director","Yeah. There's no divestiture strategy. There's a return on invested capital strategy and a client strategy that drives everything we do. And we continue \u2013 we've made unprecedented investments back into the HR Solutions business and the risk business. We're going to continue to do that, look for us to do that, with the organic investments we've made and then acquisitions that strengthen our position to serve clients more effectively. And then from time to time as we look at that overall portfolio, we will make calls and decision that will help us both improve client serving capability, absolutely fundamental, and then also improve return on invested capital. And you'll see us do that just in the natural course.","And if you think about over the last 10 years, it hasn't just been in HR Solutions, it's across Risk Solutions, probably even more pronounced in Risk Solutions, where we have transitioned out assets that weren't strengthening our client serving capability as much and brought new assets and it helps us do that.","Quentin McMillan - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Great. And just a quick numbers question, Christa. Thanks for the $500 million of working capital improvement that you mentioned, but is that through 2017 or is that a number that you're talking about in a longer term?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","That is a very long-term number.","Quentin McMillan - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. And then one last quick thing on the Americas retail growth. If you're saying that there was $100 million of new business, a record number in the quarter, Latin America is included in your Americas retail, I believe. Does that indicate that LatAm was kind of particularly weak in the quarter or don't read into it that way?","Gregory C. Case - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director","No, really don't read into it. Look, the real message cutting across the entire call is the first six months of 2016 have just been a continuation, a reinforcement of everything we expected coming into the year, nothing's really thrown us off from that at all. Some up, some down, but overall what we're seeing is growth across the globe and we fully expect to see that for the year, and we fully expect Latin America is going to be a big contributor to that as they've been for the last number of years.","Quentin McMillan - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks very much, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Jay Arman Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Just a quick one on the benefits administration business. I guess there's been some revenue pressure there. I'm wondering what's happening there, and should we expect that to improve or is this going to be permanently relatively subdued?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We love the benefits administration business. We serve 22 million Americans across our retirement and health portfolios there, and we continue to invest in the technology to serve clients and develop unique solutions. So, we expect to continue to grow in that business. We did have some anticipated losses coming into the year. Clients were in a sort of M&A (44:51) environment and were acquired, and we do expect to grow overall.","Jay Arman Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, there are no additional questions in queue. I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg Case for closing remarks.","Gregory C. Case - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director","Just want to say thanks very much, everybody, for joining the call, and look forward to the next quarter. Thanks very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation.

Welcome to Aon plc's Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would also like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded and that it is important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements that are forward looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our fourth quarter results, as well as have been posted to our website.","Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, President and CEO of Aon plc.","Gregory C. Case","Thanks very much and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2013 conference call. Joining me here today is our CFO, Christa Davies. Consistent with previous quarters, I'd like to cover 3 areas before turning the call over to Christa for further financial review. I would note that there are slides available on our website for you to follow along with our commentary today.","First is our performance against key metrics we communicate to shareholders. Second is overall organic growth performance. And third is continued areas of strategic investment across Aon.","On the first topic, our performance versus key metrics. Each quarter, we measure our performance against the 4 metrics we focus on achieving over the course of the year: grow organically, expand margins, increase earnings per share and deliver free cash flow growth.","Turning to Slide 3. In the fourth quarter, organic revenue growth was 4% overall, highlighted by strong growth in our HR Outsourcing and Americas Retail Brokerage businesses. Operating margin increased 160 basis points, primarily reflecting significant margin improvement in our HR Solutions segment. EPS increased 21% to $1.54, reflecting strong operating performance, a lower effective tax rate and effective capital management. And finally, free cash flow increased 23%, driven by strong working capital performance and a decline in CapEx spend. If we turn to the full year, organic revenue growth was 3% overall, reflecting solid growth across both segments despite pricing pressure on our reinsurance business and overall economic uncertainty in Europe.","Operating margin increased 40 basis points, reflecting strong margin improvement in Risk. EPS increased 16% to $4.89. And finally, free cash flow increased 22% to $1.4 billion, driven by a record $1.6 billion cash flow from operations, a truly incredible effort from the team, as we're well on track to double annual free cash flow in the next 3 to 5 years.","Overall, our results reflect a strong finish to a solid year, with improvement across each key metric for both the fourth quarter and full year. Having made significant investments across the firm in both risk analytics and the most robust set of solutions for health care exchanges, we continue to strengthen our platform for long-term growth, strong free cash flow generation and significantly increase financial strength in 2014.","Turning to Slide 4. On the second topic of growth, I want to spend the next few minutes discussing the quarter for both of our segments. In Risk Solutions, organic revenue growth was 3%. As we've discussed previously, we're driving a set of initiatives that are strengthening underlying performance and positioning our Risk Solutions segment for long-term growth and improved operating leverage; with management of our renewal book through Client Promise and retention rates of more than 90% on average, highlighting strong client satisfaction in Retail Brokerage; double-digit growth in new business generation, reflecting more than $335 million across our Retail business; with strong growth across the Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific regions; investments in new products and service capabilities with the growth of GRIP and Aon Broking, delivering increased operating leverage; and in our core treaty reinsurance business, net new business trends have now been positive for 11 consecutive quarters.","Reflecting on the individual businesses within Risk Solutions, in the Americas, organic revenue growth was 4%, exposures are relatively stable and the impact from pricing was modestly positive on average, reflecting the steady pace of market impact. We saw strong growth in Latin America and solid growth in U.S. Retail, including growth across all businesses: property\/casualty, Health and Benefits and Affinity.","In U.S. Retail, we delivered a record level of new business, with solid management of the renewal book portfolio, including record levels of retention.","In International, organic revenue growth was 2%. Exposures continued to be stable, and the impact from pricing was flat on average. We saw a growth in multiple markets: New Zealand, Italy, Spain and Portugal, to name a few, with double-digit growth across Asia. In the U.K. and Continental Europe, macroeconomic conditions still remain relatively fragile across many core markets. However, with leadership positions across this region, we continue to deliver modest growth against the same economic and market headwinds.","In Reinsurance, as we noted previously, our third quarter was favorably impacted by the timing of revenue pulled forward from the current quarter and we expected a modest decline in organic revenue. Overall, organic revenue growth was flat for the quarter. Results reflect growth in our capital market transactions and advisory business, as well as net new business growth in treaty placements, offset by the anticipated unfavorable impact of timing in the quarter.","As we've noted over the past year, record capacity continues to be available to meet demand and cedents are retaining more risk, driving expected negative market impact, most notably in the U.S. Absent an event in the industry, macro factors will continue to be a headwind in 2014.","Against those headwinds, we expect results to continue to reflect flat to modest growth, highlighted by net new business won, which was positive for the 11th consecutive quarter, growth from investments internationally and capital markets and advisory transactions business. Overall, this level of performance and strength in new business generation reflects Aon Benfield's unmatched level of investment and long-term value proposition for clients, while strengthening operational performance and reducing volatility through unmatched data, analytics and advisory capability.","Turning to HR Solutions. Overall, organic revenue growth was 8%, with growth across both major businesses and in areas where we're making significant investments in the business, including health care exchanges, investment consulting and delegated investment solutions. These investments reflect Aon Hewitt's client leadership, understanding an influence of market trends and the long-term issues that face our clients as health care reform, health care costs and the associated financial risks continue to rise unchecked at a time when overall health and wellness is not improving; multinational clients are increasingly looking for global benefit solutions that support their global organizations, delivered at the local level; managing and transferring risk across and against pension schemes that are increasingly frozen and largely underfunded; and finally, after continuing to work through the worst economic recession in the last 70 years, clients are just beginning to renew their focus on talent, retention, development and engagement to prepare themselves for renewed long-term growth.","Turning to the individual businesses within HR Solutions. In Consulting Services, organic revenue growth was 1% compared to 8% in the prior year quarter, which benefited from certain non-recurring pension de-risking activities. Results in the quarter reflect solid growth across our compensation consulting business and in our retirement business for investment consulting and delegated pension management services, partially offset by a modest decline in demand through actuarial services and retirement consulting.","Despite weak demand for discretionary services and overall economic weakness in Continental Europe, for the full year, we delivered low- to mid-single-digit organic growth across the Consulting Services business and would anticipate similar levels of growth in 2014. In Outsourcing, organic revenue increased 11%. Organic revenue reflects substantial growth in our health care exchange business as we recognize revenue related to the majority of enrollments that take place during the fourth quarter in our active and retiree exchanges. Results also reflect modest growth in our HR BPO and in benefits administration for discretionary services, partially offset by unfavorable net client activity that we saw in early 2013 but became less of a headwind starting in Q4.","Slide 5 highlights the third topic, areas of investment. We believe Aon is in a unique position. Solid long-term operating performance combined with expense discipline and strong free cash flow generation continues to enable substantial investment in colleagues and capabilities around the globe. A few examples include: in Risk Solutions, we're investing in client leadership with the international rollout of the Revenue Engine and Client Promise through our greater productivity and efficiency. We're investing in innovative technology, such as the Global Risk Insight Platform. GRIP is the world's leading global database of risk and insurance placement information, capturing roughly 1.9 million trades and $100 billion of bound premium. We continue to have a growing client list of insurance carriers utilizing the platform for its analytics and services capabilities. In addition, we're driving our Aon Broking initiative to better match client needs with insurer appetite for risk, as highlighted by our ability to package similar risks and place substantial programs and facilities into the market on behalf of clients. We continue to align our global Health and Benefits platform to better capitalize on our global distribution channel and deep brokerage capabilities. And we're investing in the further development of data and analytics capability of Aon Benfield to strengthen our already industry-leading, client-serving assets.","Finally, we're expanding our footprint through tuck-in acquisitions that either increase scale in emerging markets or expand capability to better serve clients.","In HR Solutions, we're making significant investments to strengthen our industry-leading position and comprehensive portfolio of health solutions, including health care exchanges.","Health care exchanges, as Aon Hewitt's unique business model reflects, enable clients to begin transitioning their participants to a sustainable, full-service solution based on expanded choice and a competitive marketplace. Clients continue to reinforce the value of Aon's industry-leading vision for private health exchanges, as we're seeing increased interest from a broadening spectrum of industries and geographies. In Q4, we were very pleased with our enrollment results and the excellent service experience we delivered for our clients and their employees and retirees.","In the Aon active health exchange, employer participation was 6x higher, and employee covered lives tripled. We delivered on our Q4 anticipated enrollment numbers of more than 600,000 lives, including eligible dependents.","On the Aon Retiree Health Exchange, we serve more than 300,000 of our clients' retirees to evaluate the best Medicare options for their needs. Overall, we're excited about our robust pipeline of clients for the 2014 enrollment, continue to see increased interest from a broadening spectrum of industries and look forward to updating you on our progress later this year, when our primary sales cycle has ended.","Separately, across our HR Solutions portfolio, we're expanding in high-growth areas with innovative solutions to derisk pension plans. And our delegated investment solutions are opening relationships in new markets. We're also providing a broader set of advisory and advocacy solutions to our clients' employees to enable greater choice and improve decision making on their retirement and health care options. We continue to expand our industry-leading benefits administration solutions and technology platforms. And finally, we're strengthening our International footprint to support a global workforce with investments in key talent and capabilities across emerging markets.","In summary, for both the fourth quarter and full year, we delivered positive performance across each of our key financial metrics. In addition, we strengthened our industry-leading platform with strategic investments across data, analytics and solutions that we expect will drive long-term growth and greater operating leverage in 2014.","With that said, I am now pleased to turn the call over to Christa for further financial review. Christa?","Christa Davies","Thank you very much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg noted, we delivered positive performance against all 4 key metrics, while continuing to position Aon's industry-leading platform for long-term growth, strong free cash flow generation and significantly increased financial strength in 2014 and beyond.","Now let me turn to the financial results for the quarter on Page 6 of the presentation. Our core EPS performance, excluding certain items, increased 21% to $1.54 per share for the fourth quarter compared to $1.27 per share in the prior year quarter. Results of the quarter reflect strong operating performance in our HR and Risk Solutions segments, a lower effective tax rate as we deliver long-term benefits related to the company's redomicile and effective capital management reflecting the company's share repurchase program. Certain items that were adjusted for in the core EPS performance and highlighted in the schedules on Page 13 of the press release include noncash intangible asset amortization and restructuring charges related to the Aon Hewitt reconstructing program. All charges for the formal restructuring program have now been completed.","Lastly, foreign currency translation had a $0.03 unfavorable impact on EPS in the quarter due primarily to a stronger dollar, U.S. dollar, versus the Australian dollar, Canadian dollar and Brazilian real. If currency were to remain stable at today's rates, we would expect no material impact in the first quarter.","Now let me talk about each of the segments on the next slide. In our Risk Solutions segment, organic revenue growth was 3%, operating margin increased 40 basis points to 23.6%, and operating income increased 2% versus the prior year quarter. Organic growth, driven by investments in GRIP and analytics, as well as $9 million of restructuring savings, were partially offset by a $16 million or 40 basis points unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation.","Let me spend a moment on the formal restructuring program, key initiatives that have enabled concurrent funding of investments and long-term structural margin expansion. Under the Aon Hewitt program, approximately $99 million of estimated savings will be achieved in Risk Solutions. Approximately $69 million of the cumulative savings has been achieved under the program, with the remaining $30 million to be achieved by the end of 2014. A breakout of restructuring charges incurred in Risk Solutions associated with the Aon Hewitt program is detailed in the schedules on Page 14 of the press release. We would note that 100% of the charges have been incurred and the Aon Hewitt restructuring program is closed.","In Q4, we delivered solid underlying operating performance in Risk Solutions, despite an unfavorable impact from foreign currency, continued economic uncertainty in Europe and unfavorable market impact in Reinsurance.","For 2013, Risk Solutions operating income grew roughly 6% and operating margin increased 80 basis points to 22.5%, placing us firmly on track for improved operating income performance in 2014, and further margin expansion toward our long-term target of 26%.","Turning to the HR Solutions segment. Organic revenue growth was 8%, operating margin increased 440 basis points to 21.4%, and operating income increased 36% versus the prior year quarter, in line with management's guidance. Significant growth in our health care exchange business and $18 million of incremental restructuring savings were the primary drivers of our anticipated strong fourth quarter performance.","With respect to the Aon Hewitt restructuring program, approximately $260 million of the $303 million in total cumulative savings has been achieved under the program, with the remaining $43 million to be achieved by the end of 2014.","As Greg noted, we made tremendous progress in 2013, delivering on both our operational and financial goals that were laid out at the beginning of the year. This performance is exactly in line with our long-term outlook for the HR segment and places us firmly on track for improved performance in 2014.","For HR in 2014, we expect to number one, deliver organic growth; number two, generate greater scale and improve return from investments; number three, deliver remaining savings related to the restructuring program; number four, deliver, in 2014, greater than mid single-digit operating income growth and further margin expansion toward our long-term target of 22%. The patterning will be similar to 2013. Down in the first half, both Q1 and Q2; up in the second half of the year; flat in Q3; and up substantially in Q4.","Now let me discuss a few of the line items outside of the operating segments on Slide 9. Unallocated expenses increased $6 million to $54 million, reflecting an increase in long-term employee incentive compensation programs. Interest income decreased $1 million to $3 million. Interest expense increased $2 million due to costs associated with certain derivative hedging program. Other income of $14 million primarily includes gains on sales of businesses and certain long-term investments as we monetize our long-term investments and put the capital to better use for shareholders. Going forward, we expect a run rate of approximately $1 million per quarter of interest income, $45 million of unallocated expense and $60 million of interest expense per quarter.","Turning to taxes. The effective tax rate on net income from continuing operations was 24.2% compared to 25.2% in the prior year quarter. The effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2013 was favorably impacted by changes in the geographic distribution of income and certain discrete tax adjustments.","Lastly, average diluted shares outstanding decreased to 311.4 million in the fourth quarter compared to 327.5 million in the prior year quarter. The company repurchased approximately 1 million Class A ordinary shares for approximately $77 million in the fourth quarter. The company has $2.9 billion of remaining authorization under its share repurchase program. Actual shares outstanding on December 31 were 300.7 million and there are approximately 9 million additional dilutive equivalents. Estimated Q1 2014 beginning dilutive share count is approximately 310 million, subject to share price movements, share issuance and share repurchase.","Now let me turn to the next slide to highlight our significant financial flexibility and strong free cash flow on Page 10. At December 31, 2013, cash and short-term investments were $1 billion and total debt outstanding was $4.4 billion. Overall debt-to-capital decreased to 35% at December 31 compared to 37.7% at September 30. Cash flow from operations increased 18% to $649 million in the fourth quarter, due primarily to growth in net income and a decrease in pension contribution. Free cash flow, as defined by cash flow from operations less CapEx, increased 23% or $110 million, to $594 million in the fourth quarter, driven by strong cash flow from operations and a $13 million decrease in CapEx. For the full year, cash flow from operations was a record $1.6 billion, up 15% due primarily to growth in net income, strong working capital performance and a decrease in pension contribution. Free cash flow increased 22% or $254 million, to $1.4 billion, driven by a record cash flow from operations and a $40 million decrease in CapEx, a truly outstanding performance.","Turning to the next slide to discuss our significant financial flexibility. We value the firm based on free cash flow and allocate capital to maximize free cash flow returns. As you can see from this chart, based on current assumptions, we would expect free cash flow to increase by over $600 million annually over the next 5 years based only on a reduction in cash used for pension and restructuring. Continued growth in the core business, further margin expansion and a reduction in the overall effective tax rate would generate additional free cash flow growth that puts us well on track with our goal of doubling free cash flow to more than $2.3 billion annually within the next 3 to 5 years. Regarding our underfunded pension plans, we've taken significant steps to reduce volatility and liability as we've closed plans to new entrants, frozen plans from accruing additional benefits and continued to derisk certain plan assets. Our overall unfunded status improved to $1.6 billion and 91% at year end 2013 compared to $2.3 billion and 82% at year end 2012.","We currently expect contributions to decrease by roughly $138 million to $385 million in 2014 and continue to decline thereafter. Additionally, noncash pension expense was roughly $21 million in 2013, and we would expect noncash pension expense is 0 in 2014.","Regarding our restructuring plans, cash payments were $152 million in 2013. As all charges related to the restructuring programs have now been incurred, we would expect cash payments to decline by $60 million to approximately $90 million in 2014, and decline further each year thereafter.","In summary, we finished the fourth quarter and full year 2013 with solid performance across all 4 key financial metrics. We continued to make substantial investments for clients and drive future long-term growth in both Risk and HR Solutions. We delivered 22% free cash flow growth and have focused on 3 primary areas that will each contribute substantially to a doubling of annual free cash flow, more than $2.3 billion annually over the next 3 to 5 years. Combined with a strong balance sheet and significant financial flexibility, we've positioned the firm for improved financial performance and significant shareholder value creation in 2014 and beyond.","With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Adam Klauber of William Blair.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","A couple of questions on exchanges. Number one, has the sales cycle for benefit admin exchanges started earlier than normal and is it active? And then the second question, you've obviously put on a big jump in new clients this year on both the active and retiree. Do you have more capacity as you go into next year to onboard even more clients than you did this year? So 2 different questions.","Gregory C. Case","First, Adam, on your question on the sales cycle. I would say, this is part of an ongoing conversation with our clients around literally how they serve their employees and support them in a more effective way. So as we completed the cycle last year, it's really been a continuous set of conversations with clients. We're obviously in the middle of a sales cycle now, but it's been a really continuous set of conversations that, I must say, had been building in momentum. More clients are interested, cutting across a broad set of geographies and industries in all sizes and shapes. So sort of very, very active set of conversations. And then as we've said before, for us, we have plenty of capacity. This has been about building in a very thoughtful, methodical way on the active side, initially, with 3 companies this cycle, with 18 companies. The pipeline is exceptionally strong and we have capacity and fully anticipate adding some of the next set of clients. And most important is serving them in an impeccable way, which we were very pleased to do this last cycle. And the same is holding on the retiree side, too. So very, very, very positive set of developments and it's within the context of what we do in ben admin anyway. We serve 9 million employees in ben admin across the board now on the active and the retiree side. So it's part of a natural progression and it's proceeded very, very well.","Operator","Next question is Brian Meredith of UBS.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes, a couple of questions. First, Greg, I'm curious, could you give us some insight into what you see happening in the emerging markets right now? And could that have any impact on your business here in 2014, with the economic slowdown there?","Gregory C. Case","Well, actually, Brian, for us -- first of all, from an overall context, about 50% of our global business overall, and we've seen continued strong growth on the emerging markets side. I was just actually back -- I was in Beijing and Shanghai and Suzhou, and it was -- just tremendous opportunity everywhere. When you think about, it's obviously tied to GDP, that might be a bit of a headwind, but when you think about the level of incidence of insurance that have a coverage across per dollar of GDP, the growth opportunity in the emerging markets is just for us, from a risk standpoint, is substantial. And so we're seeing very strong growth across Asia, across Latin America, with particularly very high growth and well into the double digits in a number of countries. So from our standpoint, we -- this is a very positive industry, a very positive area of investment and development for us and we don't see that changing. And if it's great and it's a little less great, it's still in the great category.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And then, Christa, I'm wondering if I can just clarify your comments with respect to margin guidance in the HR Solutions business. Did you say that you expect margins to actually be down again in the first half of the year in '14, and then flat third quarter, and then up in the fourth quarter? And if so, why?","Christa Davies","Yes. So I was actually providing operating income guidance as opposed to margin guidance. And operating income, overall, we think will be greater than mid-single-digit growth in 2014. And then some of the patterning, it will be similar to 2013. Down in the first half, both Q1 and Q2; flat in Q3; and up substantially in Q4. And it's really reflecting the continued investment we make to support our clients in health care exchanges in 2014. And as you know, we incur expenses in all 4 quarters of the year in our health care exchange business and recognize the revenue in Q4. As we continue to scale more clients, really, because of the success we've had in the 2013 cycle, we are continuing to invest throughout the calendar year in 2014. That's why that patterning is continuing to occur.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Is that because there's expense in onboard-ing the clients in the first half of the year, is that what's happening?","Christa Davies","Yes, that's exactly right.","Gregory C. Case","Brian, if you think about it, we've invested substantially -- said we would achieve mid-single-digit operating income in '13, which we did. Christa guided sort of where we're going to be in '14, which we will. Within that, we will have invested substantially sort of in the exchange side. But if you think about the categories of that, '13 was about really a lot of the infrastructure and things to get it up and running and really sort of build all the components of it, what you're seeing in the discussion in '14 is our anticipation of where the pipeline is and indications we're getting now of how that's going to evolve. And that really is going to be about specific client investment in addition to continued investment around the client experience.","Operator","Next question is Jay Cohen of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes, a couple of questions. First, I may have missed this on the call, but can you give us a sense of what the tax rate will look like in 2014?","Christa Davies","Yes, Jay, as we think about the tax rate, we've given long-term guidance on the tax rate of, sort of, more than 500 basis points. As we think about the tax rate for 2014, we're not giving guidance going forward. We have given long-term guidance and we'll report updates on progress as we report our results.","Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Second question, on the reinsurance broking side, I guess, I was interested in your comment suggesting that you may be able to eke out flat or even up organic revenue growth in 2014 despite what appears to be some pretty stiff headwinds, and I'm wondering why that is. And part of the question is, when you think about your compensation on the Reinsurance side, how much is fees versus commissions?","Gregory C. Case","So Jay, if we step back and think about sort of what we've done historically, first of all, irrespective of kind of what's happening on the pricing side, the exposure side, we've said we're going to grow the Risk Solutions business. That includes the Reinsurance business, and that's exactly what our goal is for 2014. And we believe we're going to be on track to do that. You're absolutely right, there is some substantial headwinds when you think about some of the capital. There's a record level of capital in the industry now, well above $500 billion. We've had a relatively light cat year and then that's fully compounded by the continued influx of capital from nontraditional sources, which is kind of at the $45 billion, $50 billion level now. We expect it to grow over time. Having said that, from our standpoint, our view is that when you think about what we do on behalf of clients, we're really helping them understand how to create value with their balance sheet, reduce volatility, improve operating performance, that's right exactly in the wheelhouse of what we do at Aon Benfield. We've invested in data and analytics in ways no one else has really been able to -- has ever done. And we believe that's going to help us serve clients effectively and that's why we believe we can continue to grow that business over time and fully anticipate being able to do that.","Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And the fees versus the commissions, is the decent part of this fee, does that help protect the revenue to some extent?","Gregory C. Case","Yes, no, it's a mix on both sides, so fee and commission. We're about 70% commission and about 30% fee, overall. But we're doing a number of things on behalf of clients in addition to treaty placements. Some of it -- it's really just sort of adding advice and some of the things that come with data and analytics to help them think about their business overall, that's an increasing component. I would also say, for us, when you think about our leadership position, kind of, in the alternative capital area in cat bonds as an example, I mean, just -- there's clearly an acceleration on that front. If you think about since 2010, give or take, probably been about 90, 93, 94 deals done over that period of time. We've been involved in over half of them. Now there's been an acceleration of the 93. 31 were done last year. Again, we're involved in over half of them. So from our standpoint, there's lots of aspects in how we help insurers improve their performance across Aon Benfield. And that is reflected in our historical performance. I would also just say, reflect on sort of Aon over the last 5, 6, 7 years, in virtually any economic environment, we've been able to grow the business overall. And in fact, we've grown it every year except one, in which we were just down slightly. So our view is we've seen the movie before and fully anticipate being able to grow and help our clients succeed.","Operator","Next question is Gregory Locraft of Morgan Stanley.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Again on reinsurance brokerage, it looks like organic growth dropped in '04, '05 to mid-single digits. And pricing in that environment was actually pretty bad. So can you compare the business for reinsurance today versus the '04, '05 when the pricing declines were similar? Why is it different, why won't we be seeing negative organics in the future periods in this division?","Gregory C. Case","A lot of those, I just described to Jay. I can't really speak for the overall industry, where we'll all [ph] be. I would just reflect on what Aon's been able to achieve in that exact environment. In that environment, we've been able to actually grow our position and fundamentally, this is about obviously, exceptional treaty placement as we described. But it really is more broadly about what we do on behalf of clients, insurers, to help them succeed. And in our case, the investment around data and analytics is just quite substantial. We invest well over $120 million a year, real money, cash in data -- in developing content and capability to help our clients make better decisions that, again, will improve operating performance, strengthen their balance sheet, reduce volatility. In that context, treaty placement is one aspect, it's very important, one aspect, but you're adding to that now all the capital markets choices they have, as well as just very clear views around how analytics, data, insight can actually help them make better decisions. And that's really the broad-based value proposition, what is just unique about Aon Benfield. It really has been what they've been able to do, my colleagues have been able to do over many, many years. And if you look at kind of new business generation, again, it's been net positive for 11 consecutive quarters through multiple types of environments. And we fully expect it will continue to do that as we help insurers succeed at Aon Benfield.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And so basically, you have a more robust product offering today than you did in the mid-2000s, is that fair?","Gregory C. Case","No, I would say, it's continued to evolve. We have a quite more substantial product offering. Again, if you're investing $120 million-plus a year on content and capability, it's broader, it's deeper, it's more connected globally. And equally important, we believe it's highly differentiated. There aren't many players in the industry, doing what we do, could invest in content and capability the way we do on behalf of clients and haven't had any the impact that it's had on behalf of clients. Because in the end, that's what really is what generates client leadership, you're helping clients succeed. And we've been able to do that and we believe that capability has strengthened substantially, really, every year for the period of time you described. And that's why we're in a, we believe, in a very advantaged position as we look forward.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then again, on reinsurance brokerage, the reported revenues flow kind of linearly through the year, while as the renewal cycle for the industry, is Jan 1, June 1. So can you kind of tie the 2, in other words -- and the reason I'm asking is, is do you kind of have great visibility on your revenues for the reinsurance division already based on what was bound on January 1?","Gregory C. Case","Of course, just as you said, I would say there's a substantial number of renewals that happen on -- a percentage which happen on 1\/1 and then in April and then June. So we have a good visibility on the treaty front and see how that evolves, although we would recognize revenue over the course of the year. That's why you see that flatten out. But as I said before, there's a lot of activity we do on behalf of clients, in addition to the treaty portion of the equation. And all those are now part of the discussion and are active and ongoing. But you're absolutely right, in terms of how the treaty evolves, and we certainly have a -- we have a visibility on how the 1\/1s played out for sure.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Perfect. And last is just on Reinsurance again. Can you just talk about your ability to flex the margin? Let's just say you get kind of 6 months out and the world breaks to the negative a bit versus planned or perhaps, it breaks to the positive a bit versus planned. How do you flex the margin in this, what's your ability to toggle the P&L?","Gregory C. Case","Yes, we think about it. And it's less about the market and it's really about the value that we provide to clients. And fundamentally, this is the absolute focus of Aon Benfield and my colleagues sort of in this arena. And when you think about as we add value to clients -- and it turns out, by the way, oftentimes, the greatest value you add for them, particularly when you're adding advice, data and analytics on top of what you do in treaty and other arenas, in times of stress, it's actually the biggest opportunity to help clients succeed. So our ability to actually provide value, have clients recognize the value and then get paid for value, we believe, continues to increase. And that gives us the ability to actually think through sort of the ability to get a return out of the business, which we've been able to do.","Christa Davies","And just one sort of set of facts, to reinforce what Greg just said, if you look at the Reinsurance revenue growth in 2012 of 5%, in 2013, it was 2%. And despite a decline in Reinsurance growth year-over-year, risk margins are up 80 basis points. So we feel very good about our ability to grow Risk Solutions margin despite the macroeconomic headwinds we're facing.","Operator","Next question is Meyer Shields of KBW.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I think I have -- maybe more directed towards Christa. If we look at the uses of cash on Slide 11, it looks the pension contribution and CapEx forecast came down pretty significantly from the last update that we had. I was hoping you could explain what's going on there?","Christa Davies","Yes, so that's absolutely right, Meyer. So I think pension contributions came down commensurate with our unfunded pension liability, which declined from year end 2012 of $2.3 billion to $1.6 billion. So a $700 million decline in unfunded pension liability, which is decreasing our cash contributions. And you could see the pension contributions will continue to come down over the following years, and that's really in terms of -- driven by improved long-term rates. And then CapEx, you can see, we finished 2013 at a lower level than we expected. And we expect CapEx to grow in line with revenue going forward, albeit from a lower base.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Switching gears a little bit, the share repurchases slowed in the quarter compared to what we saw in the third quarter. Is that -- is there anything underlying that or is that just the way things shake out?","Christa Davies","No, as we think about share repurchase, we think about return on capital and cash-on-cash returns. And share repurchase remains our highest return investment, hence, the fact that we repurchased $1.1 billion of shares during the course of 2013, despite providing guidance sort of around the $800 million level. And if you think about it, we provided original -- we did $1.1 billion in 2012 as well, but of that, $300 million came off the balance sheet. So as we think about share repurchase, we expect share repurchase in 2014 to be similar to 2013. And then obviously, excess cash we'll deploy on a cash-on-cash return using return on capital as the metric we use to allocate all excess uses of cash.","Operator","Next question is Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo.","Elyse Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I was hoping we could spend some time highlighting more of what you're seeing going on within the U.S. economy. I know you pointed to stable exposure in your prepared remarks and kind of how you see the economic conditions in the U.S. impacting what you expect to see with your organic revenue in 2014.","Gregory C. Case","Yes, as we've said -- a couple of things, as you think about overall. First of all, just the broad-based macro trends right now, we described was kind of pricing environment, which has really been stable, around kind of flat overall, with an exposure change which has been modestly positive. So for us, from a U.S. standpoint, you can start to see aspects of the U.S. economy strengthening, not strong but strengthening overall. And so that's sort of the macro view of where we are. But I would say, though, in that context, back to our ability to make investments in the business and improve margin, we continue to make investments in the business and that really has helped us from the standpoint of just -- from -- and this is really around Client Promise and what we do on Revenue Engine, and all the different pieces of it, really helps us generate level of new business, $336 million across our Retail business, really driven across the U.S. as well, that is a record level for us. So we feel very good about sort of what we have in place, the investments we've made and the impact we're going to have over time as we grow the business organically, really, irrespective of sort of what happens on U.S. GDP. And in the end, if you look at the components, we've got a big construction book and that's obviously trending a little more positive, entries [ph] is a little more positive, tracks [ph] a little more positive from that standpoint. And then that puts -- and the exposures overall against those pieces are up a bit, as I've said before. And that really is sort of how we see the U.S. playing out, with some positive overall macro implications and -- amplified by what we do from an investment standpoint.","Elyse Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then one other question, on the reinsurance broking business, you pointed to your presence within the alternative capacity market. How big is that as compared to your overall book?","Gregory C. Case","It's very small overall. As we said before, a large piece obviously, of our treaty book. But this is a smaller percentage overall, 5% to 10%, let's say, but growing. And I'll -- what I wanted to highlight is, if you think about alternative capital, this we believe is a reality, it's an option for clients, it's highly viable. About $45 billion or so in the context of, call it, a $550 billion capital base for the insurance world. We are primary in it, but overall, it turns out to be 5% to 10% of our overall book.","Operator","Next question, Michael Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Christa, maybe following up on Meyer's question on the kind of sources -- or the uses of cash, Slide 11. So it looks like -- so pension contributions went down on forward -- or are going to decline. CapEx, looks like it's going to decline and -- but the cumulative increase to free cash flow doesn't seem to be increasing by as much as those 2 things are declining. Is there -- if we had sources of cash, what would that look like, I guess?","Christa Davies","Yes. So look, maybe the best way to start that question is, Michael, is to sort of start with free cash flow in 2012, which was $1.15 billion. The free cash flow number in 2012 is the number we're anchoring from to double, to get to $2.3 billion over the next 3 to 5 years. And included in that free cash flow, our free cash flow definition is cash from operations, straight from the cash flow statement, less CapEx. Included in cash from operations is pension contribution and restructuring. And then, obviously, the less CapEx means this CapEx number is also included in the free cash flow number. So if you think about it and your starting point obviously for free cash flow now is $1.4 billion, because it's what we produced in 2013. And so if you look at this cumulative increase, you can basically take the $1.15 billion, add $600 million, so you get to $1.75 billion, which is just from these 3 line items by themselves, that includes no improvement in operations of our business, all our revenue growth and continued margin expansion or a decline in tax rate. And so you can see that we are making good progress towards doubling free cash flow over the next 3 to 5 years.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. I guess, I mean, and I'll take it offline, I guess. But just if I look at -- just from '14 on, because '13 is behind us. If I look at '14 on and I compare it to -- it looks like you're a couple of hundred million dollars better on pension, maybe a little bit more. Couple of hundred million dollars better on CapEx, but the cumulative free cash flow is up by about $20 million over that period.","Christa Davies","So the way to think about it is, if you look at the 2014 number and, say, it's $333 million as the cumulative increase, and then you look at the $602 million, then, from $214 million to $218 million, you've got a $300 million increase in free cash flow just from the line items above. And you add that to $1.4 billion, which equals $1.7 billion.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got you. Okay. I'll take it offline. I guess -- Greg, I guess, or maybe Christa as well, on the Risk segment, so you had -- margins were up about [indiscernible] on 3 points of organic. Where do you need organic to be overall, I mean, is that -- do you think about it that way in order to continue to expand margins? Or because of GRIP and Broking, do you feel like you have levers to continue to expand margins even if organic falls below that level.","Gregory C. Case","Yes, I would just start at the top line. Our view is we are going to continue to expand the risk margin overall. And if you look across time, I've made investments, have been able to do that and at largely multiple types of organic growth environments. And that's, in fact, exactly what we intend to be able to do. A lot of the investments around GRIP, what we've done, and analytics, have really helped create leverage, operating leverage in the business, which is more substantial. So our ability to improve margin on lower growth rates is real. And you're starting to see that actually play out in the improvement this year. You'll see that play out over time. If we happen to get continued big pickup in the global economy or we happen to get rate improvement, et cetera, not something our management team has actually ever experienced, we'd love that. That would be great. But that's not what we require in order to actually improve the margin of the business. And that's really been part of the strategy over a multi-year period to invest in the business so that we could, in fact, improve margins, irrespective of the overall rate or exposure environment.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And then last one, just on the exchanges. How much capacity do you have on the exchange right now, I mean, without investing more in terms of number of covered lives that you could put on the exchange? And where do you expect to be at the end of next year, just given whatever investments you plan to make during the year?","Gregory C. Case","We have substantial capacity. Again, our goal here is to serve clients in an effective way. First and foremost, making absolutely certain that the experience that our client has and their employees have is absolutely pristine. As we've said before, we've done that through the last few cycles, feel very good about that. And now is the opportunity to continue to react and to help our clients in a much broader, more robust pipeline. We have capacity to do that. And we'll update you when we get through the next sales cycle, maybe the second or third quarter. When we have that behind us, we'll take you through kind of what the overall picture looks like at that point in time and then move forward from there. But we've got a lot of capacity as we planned it out to help our clients succeed.","Operator","Our last question comes from Mike Zaremski of Credit Suisse.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","In terms of revenues in HR Solutions, Consulting Services slowed down, Outsourcing clearly picked up a lot. Should we be thinking about a shift in dynamic, which is due to health care exchanges or are they independent of each other?","Christa Davies","They're independent of each other. And as we look at our Consulting business, we'd say it grew 3% for calendar year 2013, and we'd expect something similar for 2014. And some of the Q4 number, we really have had a very strong comparable in Q4 2012, as Greg mentioned. And so that was really what's happening there.","Gregory C. Case","Yes, and I'd add one other piece. As you think about the overall business, as I said, we're very -- we feel very positive, very pleased with sort of how our efforts on the exchange front are evolving. But within the context of broad-based Aon Hewitt and all the things we're doing there, we've made some tremendous investments on the talent solutions side, in what we're doing to help clients think about really transitioning to the cloud-based approach on HR and, really, kind of the idea of Software-as-a-Service space for HR, tremendous investments. On the retirement solutions side, we've done a lot of work in the pension space, which is very interesting, very dynamic. A number of investments there, really thinking about our delegated pension management services and what we can do and accomplish to help clients really think about overall oversight, management of their pension plans. And certainly, on the defined pension -- or on defined contribution side, we've got a couple of efforts, something called DC Nexus and SimPlus Savings you're going to hear a lot about over time. So I want to emphasize the exchange story, we believe, is compelling, powerful and emerging. But it's really within the context -- it's a small part of Aon Hewitt overall. In fact, we continue the investment in the bottom line in '13. We hope it will be slightly positive in '14 from a bottom line standpoint. But there's a lot going on across Aon Hewitt that we're very, very excited about and a lot's going on inside the Consulting business, we're very, very excited about in terms of sort of the overall picture.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. So not to -- I realize it's a small piece of revenues, but operating income, clearly, was terrific in HR Solutions this quarter. Would you say a good portion of that was due to the health care exchange impact?","Gregory C. Case","No, as I've said before, if you think about -- what we said is we're going to be able to invest in the business and invest or -- and then actually improve operating income mid-single digits, which is exactly what we did. It was actually negative from the exchange side for '13, and we expect it will be slightly positive for '14. The real operating leverage that comes to the exchanges shows up in '15 to '16, and as we continue to evaluate the pipeline and think about the -- what really has been a tremendous set of conversations coming through there, our view is that we will be at a very good place from an operating leverage standpoint in '15 and '16 and just would say again, what Christa laid out for you is that we're going to have greater than mid-single digits operating improvement growth in '14.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, got it. And finally, for Christa, back to the tax rate, so is it long run, the tax rate falls below -- you said 5 points, is that below 24%, 23%, is that how we should be thinking long-term?","Christa Davies","No, no, no. I said when we started 2012, we had a tax rate of 29%. We then filed a statement which basically said that our tax rate would be more than 500 basis points, starting at 29%. And we expect that to happen over time.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. So you got to 24% this quarter, but we should be thinking to stay at this level will be -- down in the longer run.","Christa Davies","The thing I would say is quarterly tax rate numbers get impacted by certain things like discrete tax numbers. And the 25% for the full year is sort of the rate I would look at for the full year.","Operator","All right, thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg Case for closing remarks.","Gregory C. Case","That's it, everyone. Thanks very much for participating and I look forward to our discussion next quarter. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect at this time."],"2015":["Aon Plc (NYSE:AON) Q1 2015 Earnings Call May  1, 2015  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Gregory C.

Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Operator","Good morning, and thank you for holding. Welcome to Aon Plc's First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all parties will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer portion of today's call. If anyone has an objection, you may disconnect at this time.","I would also like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded, that it is important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our first quarter 2015 results, as well as having been posted to our website.","Now, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, President and CEO of Aon Plc.","Gregory C. Case - President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2015 conference call. Joining me here today is our CFO, Christa Davies. I would note that there are slides available on our website for you to follow along with our commentary today, and consistent with previous quarters, I'd like to cover three areas before turning the call over to Christa for further financial review.","First is our performance against key metrics we communicate to shareholders; second is overall organic growth performance; and third, continued areas of strategic investment across Aon. On the first topic, our performance versus key metrics. Each quarter, we measure our performance against the key metrics we focus on achieving over the course of the year: grow organically, expand margin, increase earnings per share, and deliver free cash flow growth.","Turning to Slide 3, in the first quarter, organic revenue growth was 3% overall with solid growth across both segments and highlighted by 4% growth in the Americas Retail Brokerage and HR Outsourcing businesses. Operating margin decreased 50 basis points as underlying operational improvement in both segments was more than offset by a significant unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation, primarily in Risk Solutions.","EPS increased 7% to $1.37 including a $0.15 unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation, reflecting underlying operational improvement, other income gains and effective capital management. And finally, free cash flow growth increased $140 million, driven by a substantial increase in cash flow from operations. Overall, results reflect a solid start to the year overcoming a significant challenge from foreign currency, driven by organic revenue growth across Risk and HR Solutions, underlying operational improvement, effective capital management, and substantial free cash flow generation. We are well on track for continued improvement in 2015 and for further progress against our long-term goals.","Turning to slide four, on the second topic of growth, I want to spend the next few minutes discussing the quarter for both of our segments. In Risk Solutions, organic revenue growth was 3% overall, reflecting solid growth across Retail Brokerage, partially offset by a modest decline in Reinsurance.","As we've discussed previously, we're driving a set of initiatives that are strengthening the underlying performance and positioning our Risk Solutions segment for long-term growth and improved operating leverage. With management of the renewal book through Aon Client Promise and retention rates of more than 90% on average across Retail Brokerage, highlighted by near record levels of retention of greater than 93% in U.S. Retail. New business generation of more than $220 million across our Retail business, highlighted by double-digit new business growth in many countries across Latin America, Asia and emerging markets.","In our core treaty Reinsurance business, net new business trends reached record levels in Q1 and have been positive for 16 consecutive quarters. An outstanding performance in today's challenging marketplace that reflects Aon's Benfield long-term value proposition for clients and the application of excess capital in the industry to previously uninsured risk. An increased operating leverage from our investments in innovative technology, and data and analytics with the growth of GRIP [Global Risk Insight Platform], Review and Aon Broking.","Reflecting on the individual businesses within Risk Solutions, in the Americas, organic revenue growth was 4%, similar to the prior-year quarter. Exposures continued to be positive across the region while the impact from pricing was flat, resulting in continued stable market impact. We saw solid growth across all regions: U.S. Retail, Latin America and Canada; and continued growth across all business lines; Property and Casualty, Health and Benefits, and Affinity.","In U.S. Retail, as I mentioned earlier, we delivered retention rates near record levels, greater than 93%, driven by strong management of the renewal book portfolio. Results in the quarter also reflect double-digit new business growth in Latin America and Canada.","In International, organic revenue growth was 3%, similar to the prior-year quarter. Exposures continued to be stable, and the impact from pricing was modestly negative on average, driven by fragile market conditions in many countries across Europe and pressure in the Pacific Region. We saw strong growth across Asia and emerging markets and solid growth in New Zealand, driven by new business generation and strong management of the renewal book portfolio. Results in the quarter also reflect solid new business generation in Continental Europe, and excellent results in the region as we are well positioned to benefit from potential improvements in the macroeconomic environment across Continental Europe.","In Reinsurance, organic revenue growth was minus 1% against a strong comparable of 3% in the prior-year quarter. Excess capital in the space continues to pressure global treaty pricing, most notably in the Americas, driving a significant unfavorable market impact in the quarter. Results reflect near record levels of new business in treaty placements as well as modest growth in facultative placements, partially offset by a modest decline in capital markets transactions.","While the rate of price decline has decelerated compared to the previous year, a record amount of capital continues to place pressure on the market. As a result, clients are beginning to buy more coverage and record capital is being deployed to new markets.","New opportunities for growth combined with industry-leading data and analytics continues to position the business for long-term growth despite current industry conditions. Overall, across Total Risk Solutions we delivered solid growth in the quarter and are well on track for low to mid-single-digit organic growth in 2015 as we continue to drive new business and take a unified approach to serving clients across the portfolio despite continued pressure in Reinsurance.","Turning to HR Solutions, organic revenue growth was 4% with growth across both major businesses and in areas where we're making investments in the business including healthcare exchange solutions, Cloud-based outsourcing solutions, pension risk and delegated investment solutions.","These investments reflect Aon Hewitt's client leadership, understanding and influence of market trends, and solutions to sustainably address the long-term issues that face our clients such as healthcare reform, as healthcare costs and the associated financial risks continue to rise at a time when overall health and wellness is not improving.","Multinational clients are increasingly looking for global benefit solutions that support their global organizations delivered at the local level. Managing and transferring risk against pension schemes that are increasingly frozen, largely underfunded and facing regulatory changes. Finally, software-as-a-service models are quickly emerging as attractive platforms for companies as they provide the latest technology, access to upgrades and a flexible pricing model with minimum investment in technology infrastructure.","Turning to the individual businesses within HR Solutions. In Consulting Services, organic revenue growth was 2% compared to 1% in the prior year quarter. We saw continued strong growth in U.S. Retirement primarily from demand for pension de-risking and lump sum window activity along with continued growth in delegated investment consulting. Results were partially offset by a modest decline in Retirement Solutions in Continental Europe. For the full year we expect mid-single digit organic revenue growth across Consulting Services.","In Outsourcing, organic revenue growth was 4%, compared to 1% in the prior year quarter. Organic revenue reflects growth in our healthcare exchange business from follow-on enrollments and additional off cycle wins on the retiree exchange. The follow-on retiree enrollments that took place in the first quarter are expected to renew during the normal Q4 enrollment period in the upcoming years, returning to normal seasonality of the healthcare exchange revenue. Results also reflect new client wins in HR BPO, as an increasing number of clients are adopting cloud-based outsourcing solutions.","Overall, for HR Solutions, we delivered improved organic revenue growth in the first quarter. Looking forward, we expect continued performance to be driven by growth in high demand areas where we've made investments, as well as leadership across our core businesses and are on track for mid-single digit organic growth in 2015.","Slide 5 highlights the third topic: areas of investment. Aon has a unique and strong track record of developing innovative solutions, self-solve problems and creates differentiated value in response to specific client needs. Solid long-term operating performance, combined with expense discipline and strong free cash flow generation continues to enable substantial investment in colleagues and capabilities around the globe. These investments have enabled and are expected to continue to enable Aon to drive sustainable long-term growth while building operating leverage into the business. Aon's industry-leading platform continues to evolve to address clients' changing needs and strategic priorities with innovative, first to market solutions and unmatched advisory capability.","A few examples include: in Risk Solutions, we're investing in client leadership with a firm-wide rollout of Aon Client Promise, a unified approach to client service across Aon to drive greater productivity and efficiency. We're investing in innovative technology such as the Global Risk Insight Platform. GRIP is the world's largest leading global database of risk and insurance placement information, now capturing nearly 2.7 million trades and $119.5 billion of bound premium across 65 lines of business. We continue to have a growing list of carriers utilizing the platform of which nearly half have signed multi-year contracts, and an increasing number of clients are also adding strategic consulting services to their annual contract fee.","In addition, we're driving our AON Broking initiative to better match client needs with insurer appetite for risk and to identify structured portfolio solutions. We're investing in the continued development of data and analytics capability at Aon Benfield to strengthen an already industry-leading value proposition and client-serving capability. A great example of this is Aon Benfield Review, a reinsurer dashboard and strategic consulting approach to help insurers be more effective as they approach markets for ceding and ceding company clients.","We continued to align our global health and benefits platform to capitalize on our global distribution channel and deep brokerage capabilities in an area that is high growth in nearly every region around the world. And finally, we're expanding our content and global footprint through tuck-in acquisitions that increase scale in emerging markets or expand capability to better serve clients.","In HR Solutions, we're investing to address high growth areas. We're expanding solutions to de-risk pension plans and support increasing needs for delegated investment solutions, which fulfill our clients' needs for faster execution of their investment strategies. Aon Hewitt is able to offer a differentiated strategy based on our three pillars: of actuarial expertise, investment solutions, and pension administration. We're also providing the broadest set of health, retirement, and talent and advisory advocacy solutions to our clients' employees and retirees to enable greater choice and improved decision making.","As part of our comprehensive portfolio of health solutions covering the full spectrum of benefit strategies and funding choices, we continue to make investments to support future growth and strengthen our industry-leading position in health exchanges for active employees and retirees.","Our third year enrollment results on the active exchange have underscored the long-term sustainability of private exchanges. Well-designed exchanges can be a better way to offer health benefits by delivering on their promise to engage consumers, offer broad choice, and control costs for employers. As noted last quarter, for clients going through their second year renewal, the average cost increase was 2.6%, including administration fees and costs associated with the Affordable Care Act, which compares favorably to industry data reflecting the average healthcare cost increase for self-insured large U.S. employers was approximately 6% to 8%.","Equally important, client satisfaction for the enrollment period was outstanding for the second consecutive year with 87% of employees having liked the ability to choose among multiple carriers. Carrier satisfaction was also strong with 80% of employees giving their medical carriers a four or five-star rating","Overall, our extensive portfolio of health solutions continues to drive strong client interest and demand with both exchange and bundled solutions that cover all client segments and needs in an evolving healthcare landscape. We also continue to invest in our industry-leading benefits administration solutions and consumer technology platforms, including extensive mobile solutions and Cloud-based outsourcing solutions.","In Q1, we completed the acquisition of the UK-based Kloud, the largest dedicated workday consultancy firm outside the U.S. With this transaction, Aon Hewitt becomes the largest provider of workday services in Europe, and is fully resourced to deliver results for multinational clients, as one of the world's largest workday providers. Finally, we're expanding our international footprint to support a global workforce, with key investments in talent capabilities across emerging markets.","In summary, our first quarter reflects a solid start to the year driven by underlying operational performance and investments in innovative client-serving capabilities. Looking forward, we expect continued progress throughout the year, as we position the firm for sustainable long-term growth, increased operating leverage and significant free cash flow generation toward our goal of $2.3 billion or more for the full year 2017.","With that said, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Christa for further financial review. Christa?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you so much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg noted, our first quarter results reflect the solid start to the year, overcoming a significant headwind from foreign currency translation. We delivered solid organic growth in Risk and HR Solutions, underlying operational improvement, monetized unproductive capital and drove working capital improvement, resulting in strong earnings growth. We also delivered significant free cash flow growth which enabled the repurchase of 250 million of ordinary shares in our seasonally weakest cash flow quarter, and the announcement of a 20% increase to the annual dividend, subsequent to the close of the quarter.","Now let me turn to the financial results for the quarter on page six of the presentation. Our core EPS performance, excluding certain items, increased 7% to $1.37 per share for the first quarter, compared to $1.28 in the prior-year quarter. Included in the results was a $0.15 per share unfavorable impact related to foreign currency translation. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, earnings per share in the first quarter would have been $1.52, up 19% from the prior-year quarter.","These results reflect strong operational and financial performance, overcoming an anticipated unfavorable impact due to the U.S. dollar strengthening against most major currencies, most notably the euro, which weakened 17% versus the prior-year quarter. Impact from anticipated weakness in the euro was compounded by the seasonal strength of our EMEA business in Retail Brokerage, as the majority of our corporate renewals take place in the first quarter","Going forward, if currency were to remain stable at today's rates the impact will be substantially less than the headwind in the first quarter as we now expect a modest unfavorable impact in each quarter, principally in Q2 and Q3, as rates have continued to weaken against the U.S. dollar since our previous guidance.","Now let me talk about each of the segments on the next slide. In our Risk Solutions segment organic revenue growth was 3%. Operating margin decreased 40 basis points to 23.2% and operating income decreased 6% versus the prior year quarter.","Included in the quarter was a significant unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of $50 million, or minus 60 basis points. Excluding the impact from foreign currency, operating margin increased 20 basis points to 23.8% and operating income increased 4% versus the prior-year quarter. Underlying results reflect solid organic revenue growth and a return on our investments in data and analytics, such as GRIP and Aon Broking.","Overall, in Q1, we delivered solid underlying operating performance in Risk Solutions, despite continued headwinds from a significant unfavorable market impact in Reinsurance. We are firmly on track for improved operating income performance and further margin expansion in 2015, towards our long-term target of 26% driven primarily by the return on investments and expense discipline, as we optimize our global cost structure in areas such as IT, real estate and global procurement.","Turning to the HR Solutions segment, organic revenue growth was 4%. Operating margin decreased 10 basis points to 13.2% and operating income was flat to the prior-year quarter. Solid organic revenue growth in the quarter was more than offset by a $6 million, or minus 20 basis points, unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation and investments to support future growth. Excluding the impact from foreign currency, operating margin increased 10 basis points to 13.4% and operating income increased 5% versus the prior-year quarter.","Our first quarter results were exactly in line with expectations and management's guidance previously provided to the HR Solutions business, of down in the first half and up in the second half of the year, resulting in improved operating income performance for the full year and further margin expansion toward our long-term target of 22%.","Now let me discuss a few of the line items outside of the operating segments on slide nine. Unallocated expenses increased $4 million to $47 million. Interest income increased $1 million to $3 million. Interest expense increased $7 million due to an increase in total debt outstanding. Other income of $42 million primarily includes $23 million of gains due to the favorable impact of exchange rates on the re-measurements of assets and liabilities in non-functional currencies and certain transactional FX hedging activity to help mitigate an anticipated unfavorable translation impact.","It also includes $19 million of net gain on the sale of certain businesses. The gains resulting from the sale of certain businesses reflect our intent to continue to monetize to optimize the portfolio around the highest return on capital as well as monetization of unproductive capital. Going forward we expect a run rate of $45 million per quarter of unallocated expense, $2 million per quarter of interest income and $68 million per quarter of interest expense.","Turning to taxes, the effective tax rate on net income from continuing operations was 19.1%, similar to the prior-year quarter at 18.9%.","Lastly, diluted shares outstanding decreased to 287.1 million in the first quarter compared to 307.2 million in the prior-year quarter. The company repurchased 2.5 million Class A ordinary shares for approximately $250 million in the first quarter. The company has $5.4 billion of remaining authorization under its share repurchase program. Actual shares outstanding on March 31 were 281.7 million and there are approximately 7 million additional dilutive equivalents. Estimated Q2 2015 beginning dilutive share count is approximately 288.5 million, subject to share price movement, share issuance and share repurchase.","Now let me turn to the next slide to highlight our solid balance sheet and strong cash flow growth on slide 10. At March 31, 2015 cash and short-term investments were $721 million. Total debt outstanding was approximately $5.7 billion and total debt to EBITDA on a GAAP basis was 2.1 times, similar to December 31, 2014.","Cash flow from operations increased $147 million to $136 million in our seasonally weakest cash flow quarter driven by a decline in pension contributions, working capital improvements, and a decline in cash paid for taxes and restructuring. Free cash flow as defined by cash flow from operations less CapEx, increased $140 million to $74 million reflecting significantly higher cash flow from operations, partially offset by a $7 million increase in CapEx.","As discussed previously, we expect significant free cash flow growth to continue in 2015 driven by operational and working capital improvements, uses of cash for pension and restructuring continuing to wind down, and lower cash tax payments.","Turning to the next slide to discuss our significant financial flexibility and the opportunity to further increase cash flow generation. We value the firm based on free cash flow and allocate capital to maximize free cash flow returns. There are four primary areas that are expected to contribute to our goal of doubling free cash flow from 2012 to more than $2.3 billion annually for the full-year 2017.","From the graph on the presentation, based on current assumptions we expect annual free cash flow to increase by over $650 million based only on our reduction in cash used for pension restructuring and CapEx. Combined with operational improvement of the business, lower cash taxes, and working capital improvements, we are well on track to achieve our expectations for substantial cash flow generation.","Regarding our pension plans, we've taken significant steps to reduce volatility and liability as we've closed our plan to new entrants and frozen plans from accruing additional benefits and continue to de-risk certain plan assets. We currently expect contributions to decline by roughly $96 million to $220 million in 2015 and continue to decline thereafter.","Regarding our restructuring program, cash came in to $82 million in 2014. As all charges related to the restructuring program have now been incurred, we expect cash payments to decline by $51 million to approximately $31 million in 2015 and continue to decline significantly each year thereafter.","In summary, we delivered a solid start to the year overcoming a significant headwind from foreign exchange translation. Results reflect strong earnings growth and substantial free cash flow generation driven by continued organic growth in both segments, underlying operational improvement and working capital improvements, placing us firmly on track towards our goal of generating more than $2.3 billion of free cash flow for the full year 2017.","With a strong balance sheet and significant financial flexibility, we've positioned the firm for significant shareholder value creation in 2015 and beyond.","With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, ma'am. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question is from Mr. Adam Klauber. Sir, your line is open.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC","Good morning, everyone.","Gregory C. Case - President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Adam.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC","My first question is about the HR Cloud business. We understand you've had some good-size wins in that business. One, is that true without mentioning the names? And two, how does the pipeline look currently for more good-size clients?","Gregory C. Case - President & Chief Executive Officer","Adam, it actually looks exceptionally positive. We are very pleased with the investment in Europe, as I described, but that really is continuing to complement an already strong foundation we have in capability in workday implementation. And it's gone exceptionally well. And to describe sort of the opportunities here for clients, it's greater flexibility, great platform, modifications over time, evolution, innovation, brings a lot of things to the table on behalf of clients that are quite beneficial, and we're very excited about it. So very positive trajectory.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC","And I think you mentioned that that did help organic this quarter. Is the nature of that business lumpier once you win these clients, should it be more of a continual ramp up?","Gregory C. Case - President & Chief Executive Officer","It really is a more continual ramp up as you bring them online and service them over time. And it had an impact on the quarter as \u2013 and will have on the year as we continue to succeed in the business.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then on the retiree exchange business, I understand there is more activity in the public or municipal side of the market. One, is that true? And is that more off-season than the traditional exchange business?","Gregory C. Case - President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, the public side has evolved as you watched in the press over time. As we've focused on the private side of the business, it's gone exceptionally well. It really does complement a broad-based set of health solutions that we have and we've had some and continue to have significant wins, both on the active and the retiree side. And we saw a little bit of off cycle in the Q1, this report, but that's going to, as I said, going to even out and really show up in the fourth quarter over time and will really normalize at that point.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Gregory C. Case - President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from Mr. Dave Styblo of Jefferies. Sir, your line is open.","David A. Styblo - Jefferies LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just wanted to follow up on that when you had just mentioned the significant wins, I want to be clear, is that something that you're talking about a rolling on to the 2015 plan year? Or you're in active negotiations and finalizing those deals such that it would impact 2016? And just broader, could you talk to sort of what \u2013 how 2016 is shaping up? Are you at this point starting to see an inflection or pick up in actual enrollment?","Gregory C. Case - President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Just to sort of parse the questions. The first question was around literally the workday implementation in Cloud and the implications and how it's going to evolve over time, as that was coming online. The second \u2013 which will show up in the year \u2013 and the second was, what showed up in the first quarter, which was on the retiree exchange, some really follow-on applications that happened in the first quarter from our fourth quarter work last year. And that's going to continue to ramp up over time.","And what you've seen on the exchange business for us is as part of our overall health solutions capability, that's just continuing to build and will continue to do so. It still will continue to be fourth quarter dominated as it comes online, and we'll just continue to see very, very good progress in that.","David A. Styblo - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And as far as the inflection for 2016, is that something you're starting to see at this point? Or how \u2013 obviously conversations continue to be active and robust, and that tone seems to be similar, but just curious of the enrollment outlook for 2016?","Gregory C. Case - President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. The pipeline continues to be very strong. A lot of great conversations across the board on both the active exchange and retiree exchange. And as I described in my comments, the impact here has been substantial. In particular, the impact on, for us, the employee satisfaction levels have been exceptionally high, the opportunity to actually bend the cost curve, very, very positive from that standpoint. And we just have been very, very fortunate in terms of sort of our client wins and how that's evolved over time, and we'll report out in the third quarter as we complete the season. But we continue to make progress.","David A. Styblo - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And then just flipping gears over to the international side of organic growth of 3%. That seemed to hold up better than I thought it would in this environment. Just want to ensure that there isn't any unusual benefits in the quarter from timing. And assuming not, can you just drill into and provide a little bit more color about what you're seeing in the market, what you're doing to help maintain that decent organic growth that's going on right now?","Gregory C. Case - President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we really saw across the board really, not just in Europe but also across the Americas if you think about sort of as I described before, retention levels in U.S. Retail were exceptionally high, 93% almost near record levels. And then Europe also reflects very, very high retention levels. And then efforts we've done around Client Promise, the implementation of how we actually support and serve clients, introduce new ideas to clients as their needs change over time. And this has all been against a backdrop of the challenging pricing environment and an overall economic environment that's challenged.","But from our standpoint, we view the opportunities in Europe and in the Americas as quite strong, quite positive and our capability to serve them is quite high. And that's really what's driven new business growth, what's driven retention and what's driven the results. And our view is we're going to continue to grow and build the business as we have for the last decade every year, irrespective of the headwinds and that includes all the aforementioned, FX, our interest rates or economic conditions or pricing.","David A. Styblo - Jefferies LLC","Super. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our next question is coming from Mr. Brian Meredith of UBS. Sir, your line is open.","Brian R. Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. Greg, I wonder if you could talk a little bit about, or update us on progress on improving yield in the Risk Solutions business, monetizing that GRIP asset, that kind of stuff?","Gregory C. Case - President & Chief Executive Officer","So, Brian, we would say we continue to make very good progress and reflected in the performance as we grow and improve margin over time and what we've done on the data and analytics efforts here really is helping markets, really our market partners understand and improve their return on invested capital and that's really fundamentally what GRIP is able to help us do. And we've got 35 plus carriers who have actually signed on to this and fundamentally it helps them succeed in the business and we're essentially helping them match their capital with our demand in a more efficient and effective way and that's what the data and analytics has helped us do.","So it's progress. We're strengthening the relationships as they evolve in that area and watch and see data and analytics will continue to be a stronger and stronger part of our value proposition. It's complemented by the Singapore Innovation Center and the Dublin Innovation Centers which we've brought online. And you see it show up in the marketplace in areas like the Risk Insight platform, like Review, which we've done on the reinsurance side very, very strong, very, very positive and this is an area of substantial investment for Aon.","And in many respects we believe we've got an unprecedented level of data but we need to translate that into true insight and action for our clients, and if our clients can take that data and insight and improve operating performance, strengthen their balance sheet or reduce volatility, we provided something to the market no one else can do and we believe that's distinctive. That is sustainable and that's going to create value for them and for us.","Brian R. Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Just on the yield also, I mean, given that we're in a competitive and softening market, have you been able to boost commission rates or do other things to perhaps offset some of the price declines?","Gregory C. Case - President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. We've done a number of different things to again come back to add value for clients and help them understand it and get paid for that and do the same on the market side. So in the overall environment, this all translates and shows up in the Risk Solutions margin which we would say we're going to continue to improve in 2015 just as we did in 2014 and 2013 as we march toward our 26%. So you'll see us actually drive \u2013 taking \u2013 pulling a number of different levers to do that, this being one of them.","Brian R. Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Got you. And then just quickly on HR Solutions, Christa, the margins actually ex FX actually improved on a year-over-year basis. I would have thought per your guidance they would have actually declined. Was there something unusual that happened in the quarter?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. You're right. It did improve 10 basis points on an underlying basis. We did see some timing between Q1 and Q2, Brian, and what we would say is that the first half is going to be down exactly in line with guidance and the second half up in operating income to grow overall operating income and margin for the full year.","Brian R. Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Got you. So a little bit tougher in the second quarter? Great.","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","That's right.","Brian R. Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our next question is coming from Mr. Dan Farrell of Piper Jaffray. Sir, your line is open.","Daniel Farrell - Piper Jaffray","Thanks and good morning. Just back on the Risk Solutions margins, Greg, when you \u2013 in your prepared comments you talked about ongoing investment in that business to drive organic and then drive improved operating leverage. Do you think investments in that business right now are running higher than you ultimately think they will be? And then, is there anything else to be thinking about from a mix perspective in Risk Solutions that might be impacting margins say, whether it be Reinsurance, macro pressures there or something like that? Thank you.","Gregory C. Case - President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we would \u2013 look back, we are going to continue to make investments to sort of build and strengthen the business. As we said before, we want to do this while at the same time making meaningful progress and improving risk brokerage margin, marching toward the 26%. And so we're going just to keep doing that. And the investments actually happened across the business. They've happened on the Retail side of the business as we've invested in data and analytics as I described before, the Singapore Innovation Center, our Dublin Innovation Center, these are very, very substantial investments for us, which drive the Risk Insight Platform on the Retail side. We've invested in new product ideas in Structured Portfolio Solutions, a whole series of things we've done fundamentally to strengthen the value proposition that we provide to clients. If they understand it and it provides value in their business, we're going to \u2013 it's going to help improve Aon's performance.","We've made equal and substantial investments across the Reinsurance side of the portfolio as well, and we continue to do that. And while certainly well publicized, Reinsurance is under some pressure given capital coming into the marketplace and pricing dynamics, particularly in the cat business, we love the business. We love what we're doing on the Reinsurance side. Our capability to help insurers improve their return on invested capital and their performance we believe is high and even unprecedented from an Aon Benfield standpoint.","We're number one in treaty, we're number one in fac, we're number one in capital markets and the things we do around \u2013 with new capital coming in the industry. And so you're going to see us continue to invest. There is not a \u2013 it's not a high or a low, it's a steady set of investments we make over time that we believe will help us build the business, and we're going to continue to do that. While at the same time, we are very clear, we need to overcome headwinds that are out there, as we've done over time. This year, we're talking about FX. In previous years, it might have been interest rates or might have been the economy or it might have been pricing. We're going to overcome those, grow margin and invest in the business for the long term.","Daniel Farrell - Piper Jaffray","Got it. Thanks. That's very helpful. And just to follow up, some of your competitors have talked about needing to achieve a certain level of organic growth, say in the 2% to 3% range, before operating leverage can start to fully materialize. Is that something conceptually that you guys sort of agree with when you think about margin expansion?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I guess what we would say is, because of the investments we've made in data analytics, as Greg described, there's less of an organic revenue growth number we need to expand margins. I would note that in calendar year 2009, in the depth of the economic recession, organic revenue growth for us was minus 1% and we expanded margins.","Having said that, if you look at our expense base, the primary expense we have in the business is people, and there is an inherent inflationary push, let's call it 2%, on that expense base, and so that is absolutely a challenge we acknowledge. But we also see that the return on the significant investments we've made in data and analytics, allows us to expand margin in lower-growth environments.","Gregory C. Case - President & Chief Executive Officer","This fundamentally, Dan, comes back to Brian's question around margin and this idea of operational leverage. It's very important as you think about our performance versus the rest of the world right now. These investments we're making, fundamentally, give us the ability to both strengthen our franchise, which is really what we have to do, but also with the operating leverage accompanying the investments around data and analytics in particular, we can improve margin at lower levels of organic growth. By the way, it's not to mean we're focused on lower levels. We have high aspirations on growing the business. But the operational leverage in the business continues to grow.","Daniel Farrell - Piper Jaffray","Great. That's helpful. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our next question is coming from Miss Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo. Ma'am, your line is open.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. Just a few questions. The first, in terms of foreign exchange, I know the hit was obviously a bit larger than expected in the first quarter, and you guys had previously guided to about $0.11 for the full year. What do you think the full year level will come in at given how you set expectations for the balance of the year?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So FX is coming in a little bit higher in terms of the impact than we previously guided because since we guided last time, the euro, in particular, has declined versus the U.S. dollar. What we did say, Elyse, is that we'll have a modest unfavorable impact in each quarter in the balance of the year, most significantly in Q2 and Q3.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then in terms of looking at the share repurchase, I know Q1 is a high cash usage quarter. If we're thinking about how you might \u2013 the share repurchase level in the next few quarters, how do you kind of think about in terms of a go-forward level on your capital management outlook for the year?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So we're not giving specific guidance, Elyse, but what we would say is as you think about our free cash flow sort of growth, it's going to be substantial in the rest of the year. And obviously it's been significant in Q1 already and we expect to grow free cash flow for the year. And as EBITDA continues to grow we're very focused on our investment grade rating but we would continue to increase debt in line with EBITDA growth.","And so if you think about sort of the overall cash we then have to deploy, we use a return on capital basis to deploy across all forms of capital usage and share repurchase is definitely the highest return on capital we observe at this time. And so we'll continue to deploy capital based on that.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","On the retiree exchange, the off-cycle enrollment, just so I understand correctly, was that included in the enrollment figures in terms of the number of companies and the number of lives you guys had provided in September of last year for the 2015 year?","Gregory C. Case - President & Chief Executive Officer","It was. There's really, in many respects there's really no real new news here from the standpoint, this is just the current existing set of clients we brought online and we just had a few of the enrollments move over to the first quarter. It's going to \u2013 relatively small and this will balance itself out by Q4 and as we go forward. And it really is a little bit of off-cycle with that as well.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then one last question, you mention a decline in capital markets business within your Reinsurance segment in the quarter, just was the last Q1 a higher volume quarter so it was a tough comp? I'm just kind of curious especially we've heard a lot going on in the capital markets space why you might have seen a slowdown in the first quarter of this year, so any more information there would be helpful. Thank you.","Gregory C. Case - President & Chief Executive Officer","Well top line it really was. We had a strong comparable quarter so that's a little bit of what was going on from that standpoint, a little bit of timing. But when you think about the capital coming in, we don't want to minimize that. There's still tremendous capital coming in, $60 billion plus sort of come into the market right now. We anticipate more over time. We, again, see lots of opportunity with that.","I would just highlight in a little bit of the dynamics that as the treaty pricing comes down it looks more, it looks like more attractive relative to capital markets. So there's a little bit less of a \u2013 a little bit more of a balance than there was before. I wouldn't overplay it but we saw a little bit of that show up in the quarter.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you, ma'am. Our next question is coming from Mr. Michael Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs. Sir, your line is open.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Would it be possible to sort of quantify the aggregate FX impact for the rest of the year just so we can have an idea of what that might look like? I mean relative to the first quarter if we're saying it was $50 million or whatever it was in the first quarter, like how should we be thinking about that number, just the notional number for the rest of the year? Thanks.","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, Michael, what we can say is that the FX impact by quarter for the rest of the year will be substantially less than what we observed in Q1. It's going to be a modest unfavorable impact in Q2, Q3 and Q4, primarily in Q2 and Q3.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. But in the aggregate, just notionally, is it much smaller across the three quarters than the first quarter or...?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Great. And then one question on the tax rate, should we assume that the tax rate at the current level, is that something that you guys feel is sustainable longer term? That we should assume that, that is sort of the run rate? What are the factors that could impact that, either reverting or going lower?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Michael, as we've said previously, 19% is the right operational rate for the company going forward. We do believe it's sustainable, and that's the operational rate we're using for the company going forward. So we would expect that to be the best guide for you to use. Things that could impact it going forward are discrete tax adjustments, and they could be positive or negative in any one quarter. But we would expect that 19% is the underlying operational rate for the company.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it, great. And then I've asked this question before, I wonder if it'd be possible, just sort of thinking about the HR segment, I mean obviously you're making a lot of investments and you're making them with an eye on operating leverage in the future. Is there a way to think about the difference between or can you give us some context on how we might be able to think about a contribution margin, if you will, relative to an operating margin in that segment? And maybe with regard to the private exchange element in particular, but just as we think about that segment, is there a way to sort of peel those two out separately just to get an idea of what they look like?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And Michael, I think what you're getting to is sort of the investments we're making around the healthcare exchange and how to think about the return on that versus everything else. Is that right?","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah, that's fair.","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. And so look, one way to think about it is if you've added up the numbers we've invested in healthcare exchanges, call it about $100 million. And so if you wanted to take that out of the current base it would improve operational margins by about 200 basis points is one way to think about it. But obviously the return on that investment is going to be significant over time. We obviously mentioned that we made a loss in that business in 2014 and that we would continue to improve returns on it each year going forward.","If you think about the improvement in operating income we made in both calendar year 2013 and 2014 in the HR Solutions business, we're clearly overcoming a significant investment we're making in healthcare exchanges by the growth in our Consulting business, which is exceptionally strong, particularly around, as Greg described, pension de-risking and investment consulting as well as the improvement in the rest of our Outsourcing business. So those two things are improving whilst we're continuing to make investments in exchanges.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. And so like this year if we think about this year investments should we be thinking about that relative to that sort of $100 million or is that \u2013 was that a bigger number and that number sort of scaling down as you start to scale up on exchanges for example?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Here's what I would say and I did say this last quarter. As we think about the investment we've made in exchanges, it's really an operating expense. It's not a capital expense that's one time. It's really people and technology. And so you should think about that $100 million level as the right ongoing level going forward. And then it's really about incremental revenue and to drive an improved return on that underlying operating expense because we would say that we've largely scaled the exchanges at the end of 2014. And from here we're now going to add incremental revenue and incremental cost as we bring new clients on but not those sort of significant investments we've made historically.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our next question is coming from Mr. Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Sir, your line is open.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you. And the first question is just could you give a little bit color on the other income line? It looks like it's pretty lumpy from quarter to quarter. How should we think about that going forward?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So what we would say is it is obviously very lumpy and we in our sort of budgeting process model it at zero because we're essentially \u2013 it should be zero unless we monetize unproductive capital or sell a business which we deem as lower return or less of a strategic fit to Aon which is what you saw in the quarter. And so I would say the $19 million of gains I would say is lumpy and almost impossible to model so we do model that internally at zero.","The $23 million of FX impact on our assets and liabilities and foreign currency and the hedging gain, I would say I net that myself against the $53 million of FX impact on operating income we had, say we had a net impact of minus $30 million on our business in terms of operating income from FX. So I guess I view it as two different ways if that makes sense to you.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. That's good. And then looking underlying, basically you're taking off $0.15 of foreign exchange impact and then probably the $0.12 gain on the other income line. So you look at underlying probably run at $1.40 EPS. That compares $1.28 last year. So year-over-year growth is about 9%. It sounds like a much lower than if you look back the historical last eight quarter average, about 16%. I just wonder is there any sort of seasonality in the first quarter or you think like we should still be able to sustain a double-digit EPS growth going forward?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Look, I wouldn't over-rotate (47:48) on one quarter. As you correctly observe, we had the most significant FX impact in Q1, and we're going to have a lot smaller FX impact through the balance of the year, so I'd focus much more on the full year. And we do expect significant EPS growth for the full year. As you've seen, we've done 16% EPS growth CAGR over the last 10 years and so we feel really good about the earnings growth of calendar year 2015 and beyond. And obviously and most importantly about how that translates through to free cash flow. We're going to see substantial free cash flow growth in 2015 on track to our $2.3 billion in free cash flow for the full year 2017.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Well, lastly just follow on the buyback question, like the first quarter seasonal weak but last year you did like $600 million as well, so just wonder, the pace of buyback would be sustainable at least at the level of last year given that your free cash flow is growing and also you can also elaborate a little bit more on the debt side?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. So again, I wouldn't sort of like over-project on one quarter. I would note that in Q1 2014 we did utilize cash on the balance sheet at year-end 2013 which was much higher than normal, and so we had about $300 million, almost $400 million of excess cash on the balance sheet at year-end 2013 which contributed to higher than normal share repurchase in Q1 2014.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Well, thanks so much for all the answers.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our last question is coming from Mr. Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank. Sir, your line is open.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Well, thank you for getting me on the phone. I appreciate it. I know that you're interested in growing free cash flow in addition to operating cash flow by lowering your working capital. I was wondering if you could put some numbers around the scale of what you can do? And also last year the spread between receivables and payables went unfavorable for you. I assume you were working on it. What are the pitfalls and obstacles to making that happen?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So as we think about free cash flow growth for calendar year 2015, we think there are four major contributors to it. The first is improvement in operating income and that's obviously driven by revenue growth and margin expansion. The second is decreased contributions to pension and restructuring. The third is improvements in working capital. And the fourth is declining taxes. And so as we think about those for the full year, Josh, we look then again to sort of the growth in free cash flow for the quarter of \u2013 free cash flow grew $140 million. And the two biggest contributors to that free cash flow growth for the quarter were pension and restructuring contributions declining by $89 million and working capital improvements of $63 million.","And then to answer your specific question about working capital in 2014, I would note that we had substantial improvement in working capital in 2013 and that really created a headwind for 2014. And as you said it's a continued progress and we expect to have substantial cash flow growth from all four metrics as we drive towards the $2.3 billion in free cash flow for 2017.","Gregory C. Case - President & Chief Executive Officer","But you really are highlighting an area that as you think about the new news over the last 12 months to 18 months it really is the projections and the perspectives around how we're going to be able to build free cash flow in addition to what we do from an operating standpoint. And the move to $2.3 billion by 2017, as Christa highlights, is a substantial, substantial improvement. Another doubling since 2012, which we believe really underscores the power of the franchise.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Certainly. Certainly. And just to understand, the $63 million of improvement, that's going to jump around quarter-to-quarter, it may be positive, it may be negative. But is the $63 million, is that a really good quarter for improvement to think about? Or is that what you think you can deliver for the foreseeable future all things being equal? How should we think about the scope?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So, we obviously think it was a strong performance in terms of working capital. As we look at that $63 million we're looking at three lines on the balance sheet, our cash flow, receivables, payables, and other assets and liabilities. But we really think about cash flow growth for the full-year and so we're looking at substantial free cash flow growth for the full-year 2015.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Yeah. But there's no guidance though, around how we should think about just the payables, receivables part?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Look, we will continue to expect that we will improve cash flow from receivables and payables. We haven't given specific guidance.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much. Good luck.","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg Case for closing remarks.","Gregory C. Case - President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks very much for joining us.

","It is important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995.","Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated.","Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our fourth quarter and full-year 2018 results, as well as having been posted on our website.","Now, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, CEO of Aon plc. Please go ahead, Greg.","Gregory Case","Thanks very much and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth-quarter and full-year 2018 conference call. Joining me today is our CFO, Christa Davies. In addition, we have our two Co-Presidents, Eric Andersen and Mike O'Connor, joining discussion again this quarter to help lead our Q&A session with their frontline perspective of Aon United at work.","Like last quarter, we posted a detailed financial presentation on our website as we increasingly focus our time on these quarterly call to provide you more insight into the longer-term view for the firm.","I\u2019d like to start today by acknowledging the tremendous work of my Aon colleagues around the world. Their collective efforts drove a strong Q4 and finished the year with positive performance across each of our key metrics in the fourth quarter, including 6% organic revenue growth despite a strong comparable in the prior-year quarter, substantial margin expansion of 280 basis points, 16% operating income growth, and 19% growth in EPS.","And a similar performance across key metrics for the full year, highlighted by organic revenue growth of 5% for the overall portfolio, our strongest level of organic growth since 2006.","And EPS of $8.16 for the year delivering on our near-term target to exceed $7.97 in earnings per share, a target set nearly two years ago with the divestiture of our outsourcing business and the acceleration of our Aon United journey.","Our strong results in 2018 are a direct reflection of initial success from the strategic actions we\u2019ve progressively taken to drive Aon United.","As we\u2019ve discussed previously, we\u2019ve been laying the foundation for Aon United for over a decade, evolving our portfolio, investing in new content and capability, addressing client demand, all focused on increasing our relevance and strengthening our ability to serve clients more effectively.","In 2018, we took additional major steps to reinforce and amplify this progress through structural changes that break down barriers and make it easier to deliver the best of the total firm to clients \u2013 a single leadership team, a single P&L, a single brand, a single operating model and, most compelling, a more united global professional services firm. ","We also organized focused teams of leaders to dedicate more time to value creation, with the formation of our New Ventures Group to accelerate industry-leading innovation and identify ways to better scale internal abilities with greater speed to market.","An Enterprise Client Group to lead Aon United efforts with our largest clients to identify superior, tailor-made solutions that address their specific business objectives, both of which are unlocking significant value for clients and creating new solutions that can be applied more broadly and faster with similar clients or across industries.","As we now look ahead to 2019, we truly enter the era of Aon United. These actions taken together have already translated into accelerated revenue growth to date, as you can see from the improved trend of 3% in 2014 and 2015 to 4% in 2016 and 2017 and now 5% in 2018. And we will continue to be a driving factor toward our goal of mid-single digit organic revenue growth or greater over the long-term.","We\u2019re excited about the improved growth outlook for the firm, which is really driven by three key areas. First, as a baseline, we operate in core markets with attractive long-term growth globally. Risk continues to increase around the world, both in magnitude and complexity.","Healthcare has significant cost inflation in those geographies, with deteriorating wellness. And many of the world\u2019s pension plans are underfunded, with employees unprepared for retirement.","Our core businesses across these areas are characterized by high recurring revenue of approximately 85%, in primarily non-discretionary markets, with strong client retention rates of approximately 95% on average across the portfolio.","And as the world increasingly faces political and regulatory changes or economic pressure, we find our clients needing our advice and core competencies even more as they navigate challenges and uncertainty across the topics of risk, retirement and health. ","Second, we continue to strengthen our business mix. Our strategic focus was reinforced by the divestiture of our outsourcing business in 2017, with proceeds from the transaction directed towards high-growth areas of client need.","In 2018, we delivered a record level of organic growth across the portfolio. In fact, we generated approximately $500 million of organic-related revenue, drawn from many areas where we continue to invest heavily, delivering double-digit growth including cybersecurity, transaction liability, delegated investment management, and voluntary benefits, just to name a few, while other areas of the business are just beginning to emerge, such as intangible assets and data and analytics applications.","And third, we are creating new opportunities with clients under Aon United. With a business partner approach, we are working more effectively across geographies and solutions lines to help clients in ways that improve their growth profile, reduce volatility or strengthen their balance sheet.","One example of this work in 2018 was when our data and analytics team joined forces with our reinsurance and commercial risk colleagues to develop a new solution for an existing client.","Having already worked with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to develop the US mortgage market for single-family homes, which created $10 billion of new capacity and now accounts for 20% of the single-family mortgage market, our Aon United team brought their shared capabilities into the multi-family home market.","This is a truly great example of colleagues coming together to create new solutions for clients and create new markets for Aon.","And here\u2019s how this unique solution was developed. Our reinsurance team worked with our data and analytics colleagues to develop proprietary analytics that translate the complex multifamily exposures into risks that the reinsurance market could price, effectively creating a standard and making a new market.","Our commercial risk team then made the transaction possible by creating a financial vehicle that translated the reinsurance capacity into a primary insurance policy that could be purchased. And that\u2019s the power of Aon United, creating new solutions for clients, brought together by collaborations of colleagues from across Aon, all driven by the insight from new industry-leading data and analytics capabilities.","In summary, 2018 was another year of delivering on our commitments and meaningful progress. We took several substantial steps to strengthen our firm, all while delivering strong financial results and increased value to our clients.","As we begin 2019, our team is excited about the future outlook for our firm, which is amplified by the considerable momentum we have built together.","With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Christa for her thoughts on our progress this year and long-term outlook for continued shareholder value creation. Christa?","Christa Davies","Thanks so much, Greg. And good morning, everyone. As Greg highlighted, we delivered a strong operational and financial performance in Q4 to finish the year. Q4 results were highlighted by strong organic revenue growth that translated into substantial operational improvement.","Core operational performance contributed 10% of the 16% operating income growth and 100 basis points of the 280 basis point increase in operating margin.","Turning to the full year, I\u2019d like to start by discussing the achievement of our near-term EPS target of exceeding $7.97 per share for the full year. I\u2019m pleased to report that we delivered $8.16 of EPS for the year, far exceeding the $7.97 threshold. As Greg noted, we set expectations two years ago at the time we announced the divestiture of our outsourcing business to hold shareholders neutral from a dilution standpoint.","Over the course of the last two years, we\u2019ve had some items move in our favor, noting a positive impact from FX translation and the tax rate a bit better than when we set the target; and some items move against us, noting unfavorable impact from FX balance sheet evaluation and the implementation of new revenue recognition standards.","Strong organic revenue growth, core operational improvement, successful execution against our restructuring initiatives and effective capital management have enabled us to exceed the target, while also enabling a significant amount of investment to position the firm for future growth.","As I reflect further on full-year results, organic revenue growth accelerated to 5%, continued improvement compared to our historical trend as we deliver on our goal of mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth over the long-term.","In addition to accelerating organic growth, M&A is continuing to contribute, both improving the mix and driving total revenue growth of 8% for the full year.","We delivered substantial operational improvement with operating income growth of 18% and operating margin expansion of 220 basis points.","Core operational improvement contributed 10% or more than half of the operating income growth year-over-year and 60 basis points of operating margin expansion, noting that this includes the absorption of near-term investments to support the long-term growth initiatives that Greg mentioned.","We also continued to successfully execute against our restructuring initiatives that not only drive expense savings through the three-year program, but, more importantly, create greater scalability, productivity and operating leverage beyond 2019.","I would highlight that we provided an update to the restructuring program this quarter as we are now in the final year of the program. Total estimated savings increased by $50 million to $500 million in 2019, with $150 million increase in cash spent and an additional $50 million increase in non-cash charges. We do not expect any further adjustments to the total estimated program costs or annualized savings through the remainder of the program, which will be completed in Q4 of 2019.","Looking beyond 2019, ongoing productivity improvements, combined with accelerating revenue growth and a portfolio mix shift for higher margin businesses, are expected to drive continued long-term core margin expansion.","We have delivered 70 basis points to 80 basis points of operating margin improvement on average per year over the last decade.","Reported free cash flow increased substantially year-over-year to $1.45 billion, reminding you that the prior year included cash tax payments related to the divestiture. ","Strong operational improvement, combined with working capital improvements in both receivables and payables, contributed to year-over-year growth, partially offset by $80 million of discretionary pension contributions and certain costs related to our restructuring program. I would note that 2018 was the peak year of restructuring-related cash usage.","As we think about cash generation going forward, we are focused on maximizing the translation of accelerating revenue growth into the highest level of free cash flow through three ways \u2013 operating income growth, continued progress on working capital initiatives, and structural uses of cash winding down.","As I noted previously, 2018 was the peak year for cash usage, as shown in our presentation slide, as it was the peak year for restructuring cash outlays and certain discretionary pension contributions.","Declining uses of cash for restructuring, CapEx and pensions collectively are expected to free up roughly $620 million of free cash flow by the end of 2020. This adds significant upside to a base of $1.45 billion of free cash flow in 2018, resulting in $2.1 billion of free cash flow prior to any operational income growth or working capital improvements. ","Together, these three inputs give us confidence in our ability to deliver on our goal of double-digit annual growth in free cash flow over the long-term.","We have opportunity for substantial incremental debt as restructuring expenses wind down and pension liabilities improve, providing significant financial flexibility over the coming years to further invest in value creation or return capital to shareholders.","We are diligent about maximizing return on invested capital and make all capital allocation decisions on this basis. This is highlighted by the $1.4 billion of share repurchase in 2018, which remains the highest return on capital investment, given our free cash flow valuation.","I would highlight return on invested capital continues to improve as we shape the portfolio, with a 380 basis point increase year-over-year to 21.6% in 2018, driven by operating income growth and a reduction in capital.","In summary, we delivered on our full-year commitment to shareholders, while making significant investments to strengthen the outlook of our firm going forward and returning over $1.4 billion \u2013 $1.8 billion directly to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends in 2018.","The success we achieved this year provides momentum as we head into 2019 and supports our expectation to continue to unlock significant shareholder value creation over the long-term.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to the operator and we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from the line of Dave Styblo from Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Dave Styblo","Thanks and good morning.","Gregory Case","Hi, Dave.","Dave Styblo","First question just would be, picking a head just for 2019 \u2013 and appreciate the additional color on the cost savings. Those are obviously tracking ahead. So, maybe not at all surprised that you guys increased it, but the incremental $140 million for 2019, how should we think about that growth amount, how much of that might drop to the bottom line as you guys look at investments or have you made already a lot of large investments that you had planned on doing in the business already?","Christa Davies","Dave, as we think about the restructuring program overall and the $500 million of savings we\u2019ll deliver in total in 2019, we are absolutely reinvesting a portion of those savings as we think about return on capital as the metric we use to allocate all forms of capital usage.","And so, we haven't given specific guidance about the amounts of the $500 million we will reinvest, but you should expect us to reinvest given the substantial opportunities we have for organic investments across our portfolio. And, really, the way you can track that is you should expect us to continue to expand the operating margins long-term based on the investments we\u2019re making.","Dave Styblo","Okay. You guys had made comments of what you've done over the last decade. As the margins have increased over time, is it getting to a point where it\u2019s harder to replicate that same level of margin expansion or you guys continue to look at the business for accelerating organic growth and these operating efficiencies and productivity? Is margin expansion along those lines sustainable?","Christa Davies","Yeah. So, Dave, we actually think we have substantial room for further margin expansion over the coming years really driven by three key elements. The first is accelerating organic revenue growth. The second is portfolio mix shift. We\u2019ve done a huge amount of work on portfolio to actually continue to invest in higher revenue growth, higher margin businesses. And the third is the work we\u2019re doing on the Aon operating model overall, which of course is delivering the $500 million of savings in 2019. But much more important than that, Dave, it\u2019s actually driving productivity improvements in each year after that. And so, we feel really good about the opportunity to continue to drive margin expansion going forward.","Gregory Case","And when you think about it, Dave, when we described Aon United and the impact it\u2019s having on our firm, we principally talk about this as it relates to client-facing capability, which is we think exceptional and strengthening. And I gave one example in my comments. I can talk about more today if it\u2019s helpful. But it\u2019s good to describe. This is not only external in our client-facing world, but also internal and how we think about how we go to market, how we actually create effectiveness, benefit going to market, but also efficiency in the context of doing that. And ABS is really an opportunity to take a look at our firm in a way we\u2019ve never ever done before and actually create this opportunity. So, it really is \u2013 it\u2019s new news when you think about productivity and operational leverage that has started to already show benefit and continue to play out. I don't know, Mike, if you want to give an example of sort of what ABS is about and how you see it show up in the marketplace.","Michael O'Connor","Sure, Greg. Maybe \u2013 and there is countless examples. But maybe one that\u2019s very easy to relate to is our call centers. We are touching clients every day. And in the past, each of our solution lines across any geography would actually do that and do it exceptionally well. The reality is with Aon United, we looked across the geography. And during 2018, we took our North American call centers and basically said, listen, if we actually think about this in an integrated way, if we think about it across solution lines, what\u2019s possible? And the reality is we started to integrate those capabilities across the geography. And I think as we come out of 2018, we have two things. We have an improvement in effectiveness, which we can track; and secondly, we reduced our total cost by almost a quarter. So, for us, it\u2019s just one example. And we can, obviously, take on the road around the world, but that\u2019s an example of where we are bringing Aon United to life, increasing the effectiveness, improving the client experience and, ultimately, driving productivity and efficiency.","Dave Styblo","Great, thanks. The last one I just had was, Greg, one of the biggest pushbacks I get or questions from investors is the goal mid-single-digits are higher. Can you maybe try to unwrap that a little bit more as you go forward over the next several years and talk about those drivers? How you do that in an environment where GDP is materially lower than that? And, obviously, there are these new opportunities in cyber and flood and so forth, but they still seem pretty small relative to how they might contribute to the overall top line? So, can you help maybe investors and we understand a little bit more how you could possibly reach the higher end of the target there? ","Gregory Case","Dave, this is a terrific question. Really appreciate raising. This is really at the heart of Aon and what we are about in Aon United and what we are so excited about. If you step back and sort of what\u2019s the basic foundation for this progress \u2013 and, again, if you look back over the last number of years, you've seen the progression, right, against sort of good markets and lesser markets, good economies, lesser economies, 3% growth, 3% growth, 4% growth, 4%, now 5%. And, fundamentally, it\u2019s based on market share gain in the core business and you\u2019re seeing that all around the world, all across our solution lines. You\u2019re seeing, as Christa described, a portfolio mix which has stored faster growth areas. So, literally, as we think about reinvesting the substantial capital we generate, it\u2019s in higher growth areas fundamentally and you\u2019re seeing that play out in areas of client demand, data analytics solutions, etc.","I think, frankly, the exciting piece is net new opportunities across the system. And it\u2019s that combination is what gives us confidence to say, kind of irrespective of kind of economic changes, we are committed to and excited about continuing to progress toward mid-single-digit or greater. And maybe, again \u2013 these are interesting maybe to top line, but if you kind of dig in a little bit, the example I gave on net new with Freddie and Fannie \u2013 maybe, Eric, talk a little bit about sort of how that played out. And that literally created net new capability in a net new marketplace for us.","Eric Andersen","Sure. Let me go a little bit deeper on the mortgage market then. As you said, we are working with our clients and capital providers to make a new market. What we did was we took unique data sets about the mortgage industry, its risk factors and then we played the role using our data and analytics capabilities to be the bridge that actually creates the risk construct that the insurers and reinsurers can put their capital against. It creates an alternative funding source for our clients and it creates a new risk pool that the insurers and reinsurers can invest. But the reality is, it all started with pulling the team together across reinsurance, across commercial risk and all the various capabilities using those cutting-edge analytics and structuring expertise to be able to build that new risk area. And it really is a new market.","Dave Styblo","Helpful, thanks.","Gregory Case","A very specific example in terms of sort of where we are. Again, this is such an important area, we want you to have confidence in our ability to kind of change the way we go to market and evolve that. ACT is another example that might be worth just talking about for a second in terms of sort of how that\u2019s fundamentally different and how that\u2019s involved.","Michael O'Connor","Sure. And you\u2019re talking, Greg, about Aon Client Treaty. And for us, this is a groundbreaking solution and we\u2019ve mentioned it before where we created new solution in Lloyd\u2019s and 20% of any eligible order there. We can actually match capital there on best-in-class terms and conditions, pricing and follow-on claims. So, truly a distinctive client value proposition.","That doesn\u2019t come about without us being able to integrate the capabilities, the data and analytics and the propriety data that existed both in our commercial risk and in our reinsurance teams. And you bring those two teams together, then we had to do more. We actually went out and collected distinctive data on over 6,000 different risks. That\u2019s exposure, loss information, risk attributes. And being able to bring that together, integrate it and actually digest it and then actually be able to present that to capital providers to our carrier partners, that\u2019s how we got capacity behind the solution. And it\u2019s been absolutely terrific for our clients.","If we look back, it\u2019s been in place for three years. And if you look at 2018 alone, we saw over 20% growth in the clients who took this solution up to use. And it allows us to fundamentally think about different solutions. So, we\u2019re excited about continuing to use this to help clients. We are in the market today, binding risk.","And I think, more broadly, for us, we step back and say, from that experience, from those capabilities, from the combination and integration of capabilities across commercial risk and reinsurance, we\u2019re going to continue to work on bringing those capabilities to new markets and try to innovate with carrier providers to new solutions and new geographies.","Gregory Case","Not to pound it too much, Dave, but you get the idea. This is both market share gain, it\u2019s portfolio mix and it\u2019s these net new opportunities, and I think it\u2019s worth exploring them in terms of sort of what it can mean for us. It\u2019s not the be-all and end-all, but these net new areas are pretty exciting, pretty fundamental.","Dave Styblo","Helpful, thanks. Thanks for those examples.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Greg Peters of Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Greg Peters","Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. First, I was looking at the results in your data and analytics segment. And, obviously, strong organic in the fourth quarter. But for the year, only up 3%. I\u2019m wondering if Inpoint is housed in that segment. And I\u2019m just curious, of all the segments, that\u2019s one area where I would anticipate growth would be accelerating and it doesn\u2019t seem to have borne out at least for the full year.","Gregory Case","Yeah. Great question, Greg. Listen, we talked in the first couple of quarters about a challenge sort of in the first half to sort of influence the overall results for the year in the flood business and a contract that was transitioned and the recent \u2013 we actually exited that part of the overall business. That\u2019s really influencing the numbers you are seeing.","If you look at the last half of the year, and particularly the last quarter, you\u2019re starting to see the momentum that\u2019s there. Inpoint is, in fact, in this arena. By the way, in the back of the deck we posted this morning, it sort of breaks all that out. But the transition in the second half and what you\u2019re seeing is really kind of where the power is. And there\u2019s just a tremendous amount here. We are very, very optimistic about sort of the efforts in data analytics. And I would highlight again, data analytics for us, this is standalone data analytics that we sort of bring to the market, separate from what we do in the business. But in the business, there is a tremendous amount that goes on across the firm. And again, maybe picking on Mike and Eric for a second, not only do we have client examples, we just talked about Aon client treaties and what we did with Freddie and Fannie in the multifamily mortgage market, we also have fundamental platforms that are emerging here that are very different. And a couple come to mind. Maybe start with risk here just for a second in terms of sort of what that looks like as a platform in the future.","Michael O'Connor","Sure, Greg. And when we think about our health business and our commercial risk business, we\u2019re really focused on institutionalizing data and analytics across our network. When we think about making that come to life every day, there\u2019s two things that would have to happen. First is, we\u2019ve got to capture global transactional level data and adjust that into our innovation centers. And we\u2019ve been doing that for years and we think we have truly a distinctive data set on which we can draw upon to support our colleagues and support our clients.","And the second part of that, as you highlighted is, we\u2019ve got to build a platform that actually hosts the data and analytical tools we have and allows our colleagues to be able to access that data set in our innovation centers. And we\u2019ve rolled out a solution for our health business, which is our total benefits solutions, and we\u2019ve got one for our commercial risk business, which we call Risk\/View.","And if you just look at the progress we\u2019re making and you look at 2018 as just one example and you take Risk\/View as an example, we had over 6,000 active users as we exited 2018. And we view an active user as someone who is touching the data every day, who is actually using the tools we have available to solve client needs.","We had over 100,000 different solutions actually provided to the clients through 2018. And when we think about the momentum we have in our colleagues and our clients using this platform, we are growing at almost 250%.","So, we are excited about what we\u2019re doing for clients and supporting our colleagues today. We\u2019re even more excited about the future.","Eric Andersen","And just to pick up, Mike, I would say on the reinsurance solution line of the business, there is also a global platform that organizes all types of client data, reinsurer data, placement data, that actually provides our brokers with more insight and our clients with more insight to be able to make better choices between risk and capital.","I would also say that information, tying back to the question around Inpoint, that information actually feeds and works with our Inpoint teams to provide the front-end business consulting that our clients are looking for around their own strategies to grow, to build into markets, etc. So, it really does all tie together.","Gregory Case","Again, Greg, back to your question, we are very, very excited, bullish on the solution line, how it evolves over time. Again, the one transaction I described sort of influences the results for the year. But we are very excited about the momentum going forward as you suggested.","Greg Peters","Thank you for those thoughtful answers. I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t try and get Christa into the conversation. The IRS issued a bunch of new regs towards the end of last year. And you had a very effective tax management strategy. I was wondering if you could update us on what your views on tax are on a consolidated basis for 2019 and 2020 in the context of the new regs that were issued?","Christa Davies","Thanks so much, Greg. I really appreciate you thinking of me. So, in terms of \u2013 obviously, in December 2017, US tax reform legislation was enacted. As we noted then, we expected additional clarifications as you described, Greg. And in November and December, in 2018, there were specific proposed regulations in five key areas \u2013 [indiscernible], anti-hybrid, interest deductibility, and foreign currency gains and losses on certain repatriated earnings.","We are a UK-domiciled company. We do run a global capital pool. And as we look at the proposed regulatory changes, we feel good about where we are. We previously gave guidance of 18% for 2018. Given the impact of favorable discrete items, primarily in Q3 2018, the full-year 2018 tax rate was below 18%, coming in at 15.6%. As I look back historically, exclusive of the impact of the discrete items, which can be positive or negative, and really difficult to predict, our historical underlying rate over the last three years has been approximately 18%. And we\u2019re not going to give guidance going forward. So, I hope that helps answer your questions, Greg.","Greg Peters","It does. I was wondering if you could just follow on with a comment around share repurchase and your views towards that versus investment in your business?","Christa Davies","Yeah. So, as we think about share repurchase, we start with a cash base of $1.45 billion. If you add the declining uses of cash between now and the end of next year of $620 million, you\u2019ve really got a kind of $2.1 billion starting point before you grow operating income and working capital. So, huge cash generation capability. Plus increased debt as we think about restructuring expenses and pension coming down. So, good cash flow and opportunity for incremental debt.","Then the use of cash, we really allocate on our return on capital basis. And share repurchase remains our highest return on capital opportunity across Aon, given the DCF valuation we have of Aon today, which values are substantially above where we\u2019re trading. ","Having said that, Greg, what I would say is, we have real opportunities to invest organically in the firm in a lot of data analytic capabilities, as you\u2019ve heard describe from Mike and Eric and Greg today. And we\u2019ve got a significant M&A pipeline. Actually, the biggest M&A pipeline we\u2019ve had in our history. And so, we\u2019ll continue to actively manage return on capital in terms of share repurchase versus M&A versus organic investment, and optimize those on a return on capital basis. And you can see the progress we\u2019ve made on return on capital. The growth we\u2019ve had in return on capital this year, 21.7%, which is our return on capital for 2018 is the highest we\u2019ve had in Aon\u2019s history. So, we are managing that very actively.","Greg Peters","Thank you for your answers.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mike Zaremski of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Mike Zaremski","Hey, good morning. Thanks. Just one question, but it has two parts. I was hoping you could offer some insights about what data points investors can think about to help size up the long-term growth opportunity for two business segments. The first is delegated investment solutions. For example, I\u2019ve been asked many times by investors if that business growth opportunity is tied more to capital markets levels or perhaps you have a low level of market share and you\u2019re using your relationships in the defined benefit space to grow. And the second area I was hoping you could offer some context is the overall data analytics services segments. Investors have asked me if that growth rate is most correlated with commercial property and casualty insurance demand. That\u2019s my question. Thanks.","Christa Davies","Sure. Mike, I might take the delegated question and Greg will do data analytics. So, on delegated, it is one of our highest growth, highest margin, highest free cash flow opportunity across the firm. And you\u2019ve seen us invest organically significantly in that business and inorganically in fantastic acquisitions, like Townsend, which is integrating really well into the firm and driving substantial opportunity for us going forward.","As we think about the growth rate of that business, it\u2019s absolutely a double-digit growth rate business. And the reason we say that, Greg, is because \u2013 sorry, Mike, is because we look at the opportunity for a whole bunch of clients who are currently managing this themselves. And they have two or three people managing their investments. They are substantially smaller in scale. If you think about the $150 billion of assets we have under management, and so we can really manage that opportunity much more effectively for them. We understand the liability side of that balance sheet already and we can match assets to get the pension outcomes for clients around pension expense, pension unfunded liability and pension cash contributions. And so, whether it\u2019s the effectiveness of the return on assets we get because we have much greater scale and we can get them into better opportunities or whether it\u2019s the asset plus liability matching to get the pension outcomes for clients, we see substantial opportunity for continued market share gains there. And we love that segment.","Gregory Case","And if you think about it, this is really fundamentally driven on the delegated side for a segment of clients out there, a large segment. We have a better solution. That solution actually works irrespective of kind of market conditions in terms of where it is. It\u2019s actually a great thing to sort of see that evolve and it\u2019s really been a terrific part of sort of what we\u2019ve done over time.","Coming to the data analytics piece, it\u2019s really an important \u2013 again, back to how we see this growing over time. Your question around, is it connected to the commercial risk marketplace, in particular, and we would really encourage you to separate them. This is fundamentally content and capability that helps us work with our clients, to improve our operating performance, strengthen their balance sheet, reduce volatility in their business. Sometimes, we use insurance solutions. Sometimes we don\u2019t. This is not about insurance. Not about the cycle. In fact, our firm becomes more and more separated from the cycle over time. We just look at our history and what we\u2019ve been able to do. So, for us, the whole data and analytics effort, almost irrespective of the solution line it sort of moves into, and we talked about the applications of commercial risk, we\u2019ve talked about the applications in reinsurance and how they came together in data analytics, it really cuts across all those solution lines. It\u2019s equally true in health. It\u2019s equally true in retirement investments. And maybe I\u2019ll ask Eric to pick one example sort of on the retirement investment side since you raised it in terms of sort of that solution line. But data analytics is really an engine that actually enhances our existing businesses substantially, but also creates literally net new opportunity in terms of sort of what we could do in the marketplace. So, Eric, pick an example in retirement investment.","Eric Andersen","Sure. It\u2019s almost a \u2013 it\u2019s a great Aon United story as well. In reinsurance, there is a technology platform called ReMetrica that we use. It actually helps the insurers understand their capital requirements as they are underwriting business. That same system is useful to our investment consulting team as they try and build the right type of portfolio for the insurance company client base. So, it\u2019s just a good example of where we are able to use existing capabilities to help other solution lines drive new capability and new client demand and new client satisfaction. So, there is a couple of them out there, but just to stick with that one, it\u2019s just, I think, a great example.","Gregory Case","So, if you think about it, Mike, this is literally our investment consulting colleagues knowing their clients more and more over time, their challenges, their demands over time, looking across global Aon and seeing solutions that they can actually then apply sort of in their backyard. And then, what data analytics is really doing is really looking across the firm and pulling together our innovation centers, content and capability, A, we\u2019ve never applied across the firm and, B, we never actually brought in additional content to supplement it.","So, we\u2019ve got an engine that literally kind of \u2013 and the idea of sort of what\u2019s net new at Aon these days. A net new at Aon is the application of data analytics in an Aon United environment. Those are fundamentally different. And as we said before, that has applicability externally in the client stuff we talked about. And, ironically, also powerfully internally, and we talked about Aon business services and sort of how it played out there. So, that\u2019s really for us the power of data analytics and why we talk about the data analytics solution line so much.","Mike Zaremski","That\u2019s helpful. And I just had one follow-up on the same \u2013 on your answer. So, for the data and analytics services segment, would your competitors be the other large brokers or would these be other firms or how do you view your competitor set in that segment?","Gregory Case","Again, we certainly respect everybody who\u2019s out there, traditional and non-traditional in every way, shape or form. Ours is really not to focus on them. The beauty in the evolution of this has really been about fundamental client need. What\u2019s going on with our clients, what\u2019s happening in terms of their performance. Overall income performance, balance sheet performance, volatility, what\u2019s driving change in their business they are concerned about and what can we bring to bear. And that literally is what\u2019s driven our data analytics engine. So, Aon Client Treaty, as Mike described, was driven out of the fact that clients came to us and said, we go to London and place our business and we create all these kinds of risk because the syndicates don\u2019t actually always play together all the time, is there a way to actually think about, particularly the tail risk, the last 10% of the syndicates, and the answer is a data and analytics solution actually address that. And so, this is really driven out of client needs. You will see us \u2013 and we\u2019re investing 400 million plus a year on content capability and data analytics. You will see us continue to drive that across our solution lines across the firm, and that really is the engine that we really want to try to get better and better at. Hold us accountable to the question of, how are you helping clients succeed through data analytics. That\u2019s really what we want to address.","Mike Zaremski","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be from Adam Klauber of William Blair. Your line is now open.","Adam Klauber","Good morning. Thanks. Can we talk a bit about alternative capital? Aon has been a leader of bringing alternative capital into the reinsurance business over the last number of years. I guess I\u2019m interested in what\u2019s new and what\u2019s evolving. If you can just give us an example, what are maybe some of the newer structures you\u2019re seeing in alternative capital, number one. Number two, are you seeing alternative capital more moving to primary markets? And overall, is that a business that continues to grow rapidly over the next three, five years?","Gregory Case","So maybe, Adam, I\u2019ll start, but I think Eric and Mike can both provide really interesting color here. Look, our world is \u2013 people describe different categories of it. We don\u2019t. We describe matching capital with risk to the extent our clients need it really across the board. And as you\u2019ve highlighted, alternative capital sort of in the reinsurance world with $600 billion give or take in capital and close to kind of $100 million of it, give or take, sort of alternative capital, and I think Eric will describe, a pretty substantial increase sort of over time is important, here to stay, and important part of matching capital with risk. So, we see applicability on the reinsurance side continue to evolve and grow and on the primary side. But, maybe, Eric, thoughts on sort of overall direction of where you see this going.","Eric Andersen","Yeah. It\u2019s a great question. I would say a couple of thoughts. One is, alternative capital is essentially just a different pool of capital, right? So, we call it alternative because it is an M&A from the insurance space, in particular. It is continuing to drive closer and closer to the original client risk as opposed to where it had started which is in the retrocessional market. It continues to be innovative. It continues to be creative to try and drive new solutions in areas where we have historically not been able to create client solutions sort of solving with existing capital basis, whether it\u2019s in pandemic areas or other sort of large exposures. So, they're proven to be very good partners and thought partners to how to innovate. And I know just maybe looking over to Mike, the solutions that it is trying to drive into this market commercial risk market as it tries to get closer the front-end customers, certainly, something that we see continuing in the future.","Michael O'Connor","Sure. And Adam, what Eric was highlighting is exactly what we are seeing every day all around the world, which is that kind of capital is trying to get closer to the client and it\u2019s looking at and starting to think about, can it be applied against emerging risks like cyber and IT and others, but also traditional risks. And I think one of the things we\u2019ve done with some of the structural moves we\u2019ve made internally at Aon is we\u2019re better integrated today. We think about matching client need with capital, and that\u2019s across insurance and reinsurance. And you will see us continue to try to find ways to innovate and find the right capital to meet our clients\u2019 needs. An alternative capital will be part of the solution.","Adam Klauber","Thank you. And just to follow-up, does that revenue typically fall in the reinsurance brokerage or is that spread out depending on where the transaction happens?","Gregory Case","Really, at the end of the day, again, we\u2019re matching capital with risk and it will show up where the transaction ends up happening. Again, what you\u2019re hearing us describe, Adam, is more than just a transaction. There is advice wrapped around it. This is really more of a solution, part of a broader solution. Often, it ends up being a transaction as part of it, but it\u2019s not the only piece. And one thing we would come back to is, remember, we\u2019re talking about Aon United. We are talking about a single P&L. We want to spend less time about where the money goes and more time around have we helped the client or not. And so, for us, you\u2019ll see it more in the early days M&A, sort of in the reinsurance solutions world, but, frankly, over time, it\u2019s going to be across the firm.","Adam Klauber","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Elyse Greenspan","Hi, good morning. My first question, going back to some of our remarks, you guys have spoken of late about the goal of getting to this mid-single-digit organic growth or greater over the long-term. Now, if we can try to get some commentary to tie that back to how you see 2019 shaping up, obviously, you guys made the point of really strong 5% organic in 2018. So, how do you see your businesses running from a growth perspective in terms of \u2013 could we see an uplift from that 5% towards that long-term goal in 2019?","Gregory Case","Elyse, as we described, our objective, as we laid it out is mid-single-digit or greater over time. And so, you can calibrate mid-single-digit and calibrate \u2013 or greater. But we see achieving that.","And what I described before a little bit was why are we \u2013 why is out there and why are we excited about the ability to achieve it. And we described kind of what we\u2019ve done in market share gains, what we\u2019ve done in the portfolio mix shift that Christa described \u2013 and don\u2019t underestimate that. We are essentially putting capital in places and categories that are just fundamentally growing faster. That\u2019s a big opportunity and a big tailwind for us.","And then, this idea \u2013 and we\u2019ve spent a little bit more time on the call today, we know, around a little more granularity on net new because anybody can say that. We are trying to give you some very specific examples of what that looks like.","But if you think about these categories of net new, things like cyber, we cavalierly all talk about cyber, but it\u2019s only a $3 billion to $4 billion premium market against the $460 billion connected insured loss in the US alone. Doesn\u2019t include anything in Europe. Over time, with GDPR, the data protection laws in Europe, the entire connected cyber loss may approach $1 trillion and yet we are in the insurance marketplace at $3 billion to $4 billion in premium. Obviously, inadequate.","So, for us, we see real opportunity in the global environment. Again, it\u2019s not just market share gain and portfolio mix. It\u2019s sort of the idea of net new. Mike talked about intellectual property and how that\u2019s evolved over time. Fundamentally, 75% of the S&P 500 market cap is derived from intangible assets. That\u2019s massively increased since 1975. So, fundamentally, we've got, we believe, opportunities out there because our clients have needs out there and they continue to go up over time.","And the other piece that sort of ties into this for us is the whole idea sort of talent rewards and how that fits in in the overall equation because people, talent, is so fundamental to success for our clients over time. These things start to really tie together in the work we are doing in retirement investment and then talent really fits in in the equation and the work we\u2019re doing in health fits in into the equation.","Again, not just to pile on, but if you think about some of the work we\u2019re doing in health and retirement investment, we\u2019ve said before on these calls, there is a fundamental truth in the world, which is our clients\u2019 employees are overspending on health and underspending on retirement. And it really is tragic when you think about it, sort of the impact over the life of a family. If we can modify that by 1% or 2%, have them be smarter about how they think about their health spend and smarter about how they think about the retirement spend, we've actually impacted a family over a 10 or 20-year period. Pretty cool stuff.","And so, for us, we look at the world and say, my God, there is so much demand out there that we need to understand better and then be able to effectively address. And in doing so, that\u2019s what brings us back to kind of mid-single-digit or greater. Again, it\u2019s all easy to say. What you\u2019ve seen over the last few years is progress, 3%, 3%, 4%, 4%, 5% and we feel good about progress in 2019 and 2020 and 2021.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, great. And then, my next question is on the margin outlook. So, you guys saw about 60 basis points of core margin expansion kind of away from the saves during the year during 2018. Is that about the right level that you would envision in 2019 or are there some headwinds or tailwinds that might drive that either higher or lower this coming year?","Christa Davies","The first thing I\u2019d say, Elyse, is as we think about total margin expansion for 2018, it\u2019s 220 basis points. So, substantial margin expansion. Included in the 60 basis points of core margin expansion for the year, we are absorbing investments we\u2019re making in future growth. The core margin expansion is really higher than the 60, if you know what I mean, because you are absorbing the investments.","And so, as you think about our margin expansion over the last 10 years, we've on average increased margins by 70 basis points to 80 basis points each year for the last 10 years. We are not giving specific guidance on margin expansion going forward, but we did say that there are really three big drivers of margin expansion going forward.","The first is accelerating top line revenue growth as we just talked about, mid-single-digit or greater. The second is the portfolio mix shift towards higher revenue growth, higher margin businesses. And the third is the operating leverage from the productivity we\u2019re getting from the Aon United operating model. So, we do have real confidence in margin expansion over 2019, 2020 and 2021.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, great. And then, my last question, in terms of free cash flow with the restructuring charges lower in 2019 than 2018, I know that double-digit growth is a long-term target. But I would envision, given that tailwind to free cash flow, that you would expect to hit the double-digit growth in 2019 or is there something I\u2019m missing when thinking about that?","Christa Davies","Again, the double-digit free cash flow growth is a long-term target. We are not giving cash flow guidance for 2019. If you start with a $1.45 billion of cash in 2018, we are going to, just through reduction in use of cash, free up $620 million by the end of next year. And then, you add on top of that, Elyse, operating income growth, working capital and additional debt, and so you\u2019ve got significant financial flexibility. And then, we will use return on invested capital to drive allocation, with buyback being the highest return on capital across the firm.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. Thank you very much for the color.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Kai Pan of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Kai Pan","Thank you and good morning. So, I want to focus on the commercial risk. The organic growth, 4%, for the quarter is lower than previous two quarters, but for the full year, you still achieved like 6%. Is that because the year-on-year comparison is tougher than the prior quarters? And then stepping back, can you just comment on general pricing environment as well as the exposure growth, in particular in the lending market.","Gregory Case","Yeah. Kai, thanks for the question. Listen, if we think about overall progress \u2013 and really, this cuts across the firm. Again, we posted 5% across the firm which is the highest since 2006. We feel good about that momentum. We feel very good about the continued momentum on the commercial risk side.","And I\u2019ll add a couple of things sort of I want to just align you too, if I could. One is, first of all, as we said before, this isn\u2019t about quarter-to-quarter. It\u2019s kind of about year-to-year in terms of progress. Now, if you look at commercial risk, I think we do 6% in 2018 and 2% in 2017. So, you should sort of think about the overall momentum, feeling pretty good about sort of where that is. We did have an exceptionally strong fourth quarter in 2017. And on top of that strong comp, another strong quarter in Q4 of 2018. And we highlighted a number of different places where that emanated from. So, this is exceptional, exceptional performance and leadership on behalf of our Aon colleagues around the world.","And the second piece I would just highlight, as you think about sort of what drives this going forward, this is not about pricing, as we\u2019ve talked about before. We\u2019d really encourage you not to sort of connect us to pricing per se. This is really, if you want to, market impact overall, which is a function of insured values and pricing. And insured value is actually a more impact in terms of sort of what\u2019s going on in the context of this. ","And then, again, as you think about growth, remember, we are talking about taking share which we\u2019ve been doing. Also, when we describe kind of investing in areas, higher growth, higher margin, that\u2019s in the commercial risk arena. A number of different examples in that, as we\u2019ve talked about before. And then, this idea of net new and how that plays out. So, we feel very good about the momentum in commercial risk and feel like the performance of the year really demonstrated that.","Kai Pan","Any change in the London market?","Gregory Case","Say a little bit more. What are you thinking about the London market? What are you concerned about?","Kai Pan","No, just there was a review about the facility in the London market. I just wonder is there \u2013 and also, you saw quite a big change in the Lloyd\u2019s market in terms of both pricing and some syndicates pulling out capacities. So, what kind of role does Aon play here and where do you see opportunities?","Gregory Case","Yeah. So, for us, again, remember, our world is matching capital with risk. In the context of matching capital with risk, Lloyd\u2019s happens to be one piece of that. It\u2019s actually, on a relative basis, against institutions we work with around the world, relatively smaller.","And then, in the context of that, as it relates to the review I think you\u2019re describing, you\u2019re talking about \u2013 the level of revenue we have in that is very, very \u2013 it\u2019s a fraction, $50 million or less. It\u2019s a fraction of our global revenue. So, that\u2019s not obviously going to be a major impact either way. For us, it is how we work with Lloyd\u2019s to see them strengthen over time and be better able and capable of serving our clients.","So, in that sense, we are matching capital with risk and Lloyd\u2019s will play out over time. But I wouldn\u2019t over focus on that sort of in the context of sort of what we\u2019re doing in commercial risk.","Kai Pan","Okay. This was very clear. Then, Christa, you mentioned your M&A pipeline is very strong. So, what would be your preference? Are you looking more in the traditional brokerage areas or in this new emerging areas you\u2019re looking for higher growth?","Christa Davies","Yeah. Kai, if you look at the M&A we\u2019ve done over the last couple of years, that\u2019s probably the best example of what we\u2019re going to do in the next couple of years. And we\u2019ve really done a huge amount of work on a return on capital basis to identify the highest revenue growth, highest margin, highest free cash flow opportunity areas. And there\u2019s things like health and elective benefits, our affinity area, delegated investment management, data analytics and, of course, you can see some brokerage areas because they are very important to our business. But what we are continuing to focus on is higher revenue growth, higher margin, higher return on capital opportunity areas.","Kai Pan","Okay, great. Last one, if I may. I\u2019m just curious, because you mentioned a lot of examples of collaboration among your colleagues, how are they incentivized including compensation to drive that best behavior?","Gregory Case","So, one of the things, Kai, you come back to, and this is sort of more than compensation, it\u2019s the heart of Aon United and the work we\u2019ve done over the last decade to bring our firm together. And you ask a fundamental question.","If we work more effectively together, are we serving clients more effectively? Are we winning more? Yes or no? Are we doing more with clients? Yes or no? Are we able to understand them better in a way in which we can actually bring them net new solutions they haven\u2019t seen before? When was the last time we wowed her client? That is the energy that underpins Aon United. That either works or it doesn\u2019t. If it works, it\u2019s incredible. And we can scale and drive it around it firm and that\u2019s hard to duplicate. If it doesn\u2019t, then you\u2019re kind of back to what have you done for me lately as a personal sort of mission. And that\u2019s not our focus. That\u2019s not what we are trying to do.","And so, we\u2019ve taken a number of steps to reinforce the power of what I just described certainly with compensation. Our top 200 leaders, 65% of their bonus, for example, is tied on overall performance. What we do from a long-term compensation standpoint is truly tied around performance of the firm and performance shares of the firm.","So, we\u2019ve done a number of things on comp, but we wouldn't want you to take away from this, this is a trick and a comp plan. This is an absolute maniacal focus around how we can help clients be more effective. And it turns out, working together, Aon United is a fundamental lever, weapon in terms of being able to do that and that\u2019s what driving the energy here. And that\u2019s why it\u2019s taken a while to do this, right? This builds over time, builds momentum over time. We are starting to see it play out more and more effectively, but that\u2019s really the energy behind it. And, of course, alignment with comp along the way.","Kai Pan","Thank you so much for all the insight and good luck in 2019.","Gregory Case","Thank you very much, Kai.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Yaron Kinar of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Yaron Kinar","Hi, good morning. Two questions. So, first, on platform investments that are fueling future growth, I\u2019m assuming that you took advantage of the economic and then P&C rate tailwinds to accelerate some of that growth in 2018. Is that correct? And if so, would you slow platform investments if these tailwinds dissipate or would you need to continue to invest at this level in order to achieve the long-term growth targets?","Christa Davies","Yaron, one of the things I would say is, as you look at the restructuring program, the core of the restructuring program for us is investing in the Aon United operating model. It\u2019s allowing us to actually bring the firm together. We used to have two segments, risk solutions and HR solutions. We now have one segment called Aon. And we are bringing together the operations of Aon under an Aon United banner and we\u2019ve invested substantially in Aon level platforms, as Mike O\u2019Connor described, with the call center example, but equally on the platform examples we\u2019ve said. And so, a lot of what you\u2019ve seen in the restructuring program has been investments in platforms and bringing together disparate capabilities that used to be in each of the solution lines into one Aon platform. So, that\u2019s absolutely what we\u2019ve been doing in 2017, 2018 and now 2019. And it is forming the foundation for accelerated revenue growth in the coming years.","Gregory Case","Maybe on top of that, Yaron, I\u2019m just going to \u2013 I want to make sure \u2013 I might have read between the lines a little bit on what you described. But I think you said, given the P&C year, we had more to invest and will that change over time.","I do want to come back and just fully build on Christa\u2019s point and disconnect that. We were making 400-plus-million dollar investments in content capability for the last number of years. And our firm is not the cycle, right? It is really not the pricing cycle at all. Our view is we are more and more disconnected from that and we are more connected to how we are helping clients improve their business and succeed in their business.","And so, our investment in the platforms that Mike and Eric described, we are seeing real benefit from, and we\u2019re going to continue to drive that. And the beauty of it is, to Christa\u2019s point, we fully have the capacity to do that, irrespective of whatever happens on the pricing side because, as I said before, it\u2019s much more around market impact, insured values than it is about pricing.","So, hopefully, you\u2019re comfortable. So, that level of investment, we\u2019re going to continue to make. And again, the check on that investment is return on invested capital. If it helps client succeed, we win more clients. We get a return on the capital. We invest more. That cycle is literally that discipline, is what we\u2019ve got set up as we drive these platform investments in data analytics.","Yaron Kinar","That\u2019s helpful. And my second question, you\u2019ve talked about targeting growth in high-margin businesses with a strong growth profile. Do you also consider the cyclical or non-cyclical profile of these businesses as you\u2019re constructing the portfolio? Maybe can you give us some examples of how you're trying that portfolio from a cyclical perspective?","Gregory Case","Again, we\u2019ve come back to less about trying to do timing and really more around client need, right? This is fundamentally, what are we trying to get accomplished on behalf of clients. So, I come back to what is intellectual property. It doesn\u2019t exist at this point in time. Clients don\u2019t really understand sort of what\u2019s possible.","So, the investment we are making there are really trying to help them understand what is their intangible asset based worth, how is it evolving over time, and how are we going to protect that. We see long-term potential that\u2019s substantial. By the way, that\u2019s going to be true regardless of the cycle. And so, for us, this isn\u2019t about trying to time it. It\u2019s basically, fundamentally, what helps clients improve operating performance, strengthen balance sheet, reduce volatility. And more and more of our clients are really trying to understand the cost of volatility and how they factored in their overall performance. And so, for us, it\u2019s about that long-term impact and that\u2019s what\u2019s driving our investment.","And again, what I would highlight is, the beauty of this is, this doesn\u2019t have to be a short-term agenda. This is, over time, what are we going to accomplish. And in the context of still doing that, you see us produce the results we just laid down for 2018, which was substantial margin improvement and substantial growth.","Yaron Kinar","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Newsome of Sandler O'Neill. Your line is now open.","Paul Newsome","Good morning. My first question is, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the old rule of thumb of the relationship between margin and organic growth. The thought is that, you need to have 3% or better margin \u2013 or organic growth in a typical brokerage operation to get margin expansion. I was wondering if that relationship in your view is changing with the new Aon.","Christa Davies","So, the first thing I\u2019d say is, we understand where that comes from because you basically said the largest expense base we have is people and you have 2% or maybe 3% inflationary push on your people expense base.","One of the things we would say is, as we look at the investments we\u2019re making in the Aon operating model and we are driving from productivity, we are increasingly able to get margin expansion at lower levels of growth.","And I would note that we\u2019ve been expanding margins for 10-plus years at all levels of growth. And the best example of that is, in 2008 and 2009, in the midst of an economic recession, we reported minus 1% revenue growth and expanded margins 260 basis points over those two years, 2008 and 2009. And so, I\u2019m not sure actually for the last 12 years for us that there has been that relationship in place at all.","Gregory Case","And I would just add to that. Think about Aon. Aon again, just as we\u2019ve sort of pushed \u2013 don\u2019t confuse what we do with the insurance pricing, just completely disconnected. This is not about just pure commercial risk. The power of retirement investments and what we do there and how that\u2019s evolved over time, what we\u2019ve done in delegated, very, very powerful. The power of what we have in the health solutions area, really exceptional and growing, big opportunity over time.","What you see us doing in commercial risk and reinsurance solutions is not only in their categories, but, as Eric and Mike described, they are cutting across all of the categories. So, for us, this creates real operating leverage in the business and we are, as we said before, committed to improved performance. And you've seen us, as Christa described, able to do it year-in and year-out.","Paul Newsome","Great. And my follow-up question is on M&A. Kind of a follow-up to M&A, earlier questions. Last night, AJ Gallagher had some data that suggests they had the smaller end of the market. Valuations for acquisitions have gone up quite a bit, going from sort of 6 to 8 times EBITDA to sort of 8 to 8.5 times EBITDA. My question is, is that relationship similar in the types of markets that you\u2019re looking at? I realize they\u2019re not necessarily the same always. But do you think a similar dynamic is happening with the overall market that you\u2019re looking at?","Christa Davies","Paul, I think you\u2019re raising a very good point. We are actually, I think, in some quite different areas in terms of our M&A platform. We are very much focused on content and capability and we\u2019re approaching this from a return on capital perspective.","As we look at our M&A pipeline, it is 100% aligned with the highest revenue growth, highest margin, highest return on capital opportunity areas across our entire portfolio. And our general approach is to really map out, on a return on capital segment, high return on capital segments, what are the companies that are most attractive, get to know them early, and then really build the relationship to understand and make sure that the cultural integration will work. And we\u2019ve been successful on that. We\u2019ve actually brought in some amazing content and capability, whether that\u2019s the [indiscernible] that Greg described with intellectual property or it\u2019s the Townsend team in delegated or it\u2019s [indiscernible] capability in cyber, it\u2019s been absolutely phenomenal. And so, for us, it\u2019s much more focused on content and capability and return on capital. And we\u2019re seeing very attractive returns on capital outcomes from our M&A portfolio.","Paul Newsome","Great. Congratulations on the quarter.","Christa Davies","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Meyer Shields of KBW. Your line is now open.","Meyer Shields","Thanks. One short-term and one long-term question. The short-term question is that we are clearly seeing, I think, a better focus on pricing discipline at Lloyd\u2019s, and Kai mentioned this. But I\u2019m wondering if you could talk about the opportunities and risks as Lloyd\u2019s starts to focus on its unsustainable expense ratio?","Gregory Case","So, one of the things that we've \u2013 again, we\u2019ve come back to concept. We are matching capital with risk. Lloyd\u2019s is a source of capital. We love to see them continue to innovate, get better, bring new solutions, new ideas, new perspectives. A lot of capital out there, right? $3.5 trillion. Lloyd\u2019s is a fraction of that. So, we want to see them win that game. We want to see them sort of effective in that game. We want to see them become more efficient, more effective, all the things that come with that. But there\u2019s many, many, many solutions out there that we access on behalf of our clients.","By the way, just for reference again, $3.5 trillion sort of represents all the balance sheets of the insurance companies added up. The world that we play in in retirement investments on the pension side touches $31 trillion, of which a fraction has sort of come into the insurance world, the $100 billion that Eric talked about before. And so, net-net, it really looks like how Lloyd\u2019s is going to evolve over time.","So, for us, we\u2019re going to be supportive of our market partners as always. But for us, we\u2019re not too concerned about sort of evolution. We have high expectations for them and want to support them. But we\u2019re very comfortable we can bring client solutions that involve capital.","Michael O'Connor","Greg, just to pick up on that, I think certainly Lloyd\u2019s is getting a lot of attention and a lot of coverage in terms of its move towards creating more profitable underwriting platforms through the syndicate. I think it\u2019s also worth noting, and maybe not as well covered, that insurers all over the world and looking at their bottom 10% of their portfolios and trying to reposition their business. It\u2019s just not as well publicized. But, certainly, that move is going on everywhere where people are looking at business, where they're not getting an adequate rate of return, and either raising price, changing terms or exiting the solution line.","Gregory Case","Great point.","Meyer Shields","That\u2019s helpful. Thank you so much. And then, longer term, I think this is a question for Christa, does the ratio of investment spend to revenues change? Does it decline over time?","Christa Davies","Sorry. Can you just say more about the question, Meyer?","Meyer Shields","Yeah. I\u2019m just wondering whether \u2013 as we look forward, I don\u2019t know, three, five years, and revenues grow organically through acquisitions, does the required level of future-focused growth spend, does that decline relative to higher absolute base of revenues?","Christa Davies","Look, I guess, I would answer it based on return on capital, Meyer. What I would say is, as you think about the investments we\u2019re making, a lot of them are scalable, which I think is the point you\u2019re really getting towards.","So, if you think about data analytics, for example, we\u2019ve invested $400 million a year for the last 10 years in data analytics. And so, there is absolute scale in that platform and series of investments. And you can see that because our return on invested capital is at 21.7%. It grew, I think, 370 basis points or 380 basis points year-over-year. And it\u2019s the highest it\u2019s ever been. And so, we continue to manage return on capital to get to these outcomes. And is there operating leverage in our business model? For sure, there is.","Meyer Shields","Okay, fantastic. And just, maybe near term, can you give us a sense as to the maximum level of debt that you will be comfortable with?","Christa Davies","Yeah. So, as we think about leverage, we really think about our investment grade rating. It\u2019s incredibly important to us for financial flexibility purposes and as we sell into global, large corporates. And we are committed to our current investment grade rating. As we think about debt to EBITDA, it\u2019s really 2 to 2.5 times on a GAAP basis, which is really 3 to 3.5 times on a Moody\u2019s basis. And as restructuring charges decrease and pension contributions decrease, you can expect us to add debt 1 for 1 to keep the debt to EBITDA ratio the same. And as I mentioned in my opening script, we do have opportunities to increase debt over the coming years, as you see those uses of cash decline, particularly over the next two years.","Meyer Shields","Okay, fantastic. Thank you so much.","Operator","And the next question is from Ryan Tunis of Autonomous Research. Your line is now open.","Ryan Tunis","Hey, thanks for the question. So, I guess, what I\u2019m trying to get comfortable with, the growth story here is, clearly, great. Better organic growth than any of the big brokers last year, also phenomenal. But there\u2019s an awful lot of cash being spent on this restructuring. I\u2019m just trying to get comfortable that that number actually does go down substantially in 2020. And in particular, I\u2019m trying to understand what exactly is in that \u2013 the other associated cost pocket for restructuring costs.","Christa Davies","Sure. So, Ryan, certainly, I can say that the restructuring program finishes at the end of 2019. And as we think about the $1.35 billion of total cash generating $500 million of annual return, we think that\u2019s a terrific return on capital for shareholders. And so, we\u2019re really excited about the program and we\u2019re very confident about delivering the $500 million dollars in savings this year and, more importantly, having productivity flow through in 2019 and 2020 and 2021, which will drive improved operating leverage in future years.","As we think about the other bucket, your question, there is really kind of three things in there. The first is the separation costs related to our outsourcing business, which was obviously substantial as you're dividing Aon and a substantial portion of our business. The second was termination of contracts as, again, you're splitting Aon and our outsourcing business. And the third is professional services to actually execute the restructuring program. And so, again, we feel really good about the return on capital of the overall program and confident about delivering the savings and improve productivity going forward.","Gregory Case","Remember, Ryan, we undertook this restructuring. This is not your average vanilla restructuring to sort of take out costs. This is really \u2013 when we sold the outsourcing business, it was a chance to look at our firm in a fundamentally different way. This is net new news for us. And so, Aon business serves as \u2013 really does sort of take a look at our firm, all the restructuring goes through this perspective, really top down. And, really, this is kind of the non-salary, incentive and benefit cost we can look at differently, 2.5-plus-billion dollars in sort of spend. And this is fundamentally what we\u2019re able to look at in technology, in real estate.","Go to our New York office, for example, sort of footprint. It\u2019s very, very different. Much more open, much more client focused and client centric. Much more technology capability. You\u2019ll see that around the world. So, for us, this was an opportunity to strengthen the firm through the restructuring.","And as Mike talked about before, it\u2019s showing up in terms of quality in what we do with our clients in the marketplace. But also, rest assured, in cost saves and efficiency, that had to meet the return on invested capital test that we do with everything else. And so, we feel good about the return and, most important, feel good about what it might and will mean for Aon going forward.","Ryan Tunis","Understood. I was just trying to get a feel for why that number has been creeping up relative to the original estimate because there\u2019s separation costs associated with the admin deal where I thought you would have known that earlier on.","Christa Davies","So, I guess, what I would say overall, Ryan, as we finalize the program going into 2019, we've added some additional projects which have a terrific return on capital. And, therefore, we increased the total program estimates \u2013 $1.35 billion in cash and $500 million in savings. And again, the return on capital, we think, is terrific.","Ryan Tunis","All right. Thanks for the question.","Operator","Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg Case for closing remarks.","Gregory Case","Just want to say thanks very much to everybody for joining the call and look forward to our discussion next quarter. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. And that concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for participating. You may all disconnect."],"2025":["Aon plc (NYSE:AON) Q3 2017 Results Earnings Conference Call October 27, 2017  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Greg Case - President and CEO","Christa Davies - CFO","Analysts","Sarah DeWitt - J.P.

If anyone has an objection, you may disconnect your line at this time.","I would also like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded and that it is important to note that some of the comments in today\u2019s call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our third quarter 2017 results as well as having been posted on our website.","Now, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, President and CEO of Aon plc.","Greg Case","Thanks very much and good morning everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2017 conference call. Joining me here today is our CFO, Christa Davies.","Before beginning the discussion on our Q3 and year-to-date results, I would like to pause for a moment to reflect on the recent catastrophic events that have impacted various communities and millions of individuals around the world. Our sincere condolences go out to families who are enduring this trauma, to business owners forced to rebuild, and to those remain at risk or without sufficient resources. We are very fortunate that our 3,000 colleagues and their families across 30 Aon offices directly affected by the series of events were safe. During times of tragedy and devastation, it is heartening to see my colleagues from across the firm rise up and unite to help their neighbors, fellow collogues and clients. Aon is also a partner of Red Cross investing in their disaster relief efforts to respond in times of need and offering volunteer work on the ground to aid the millions of individuals personally affected.","I can\u2019t begin to express enough gratitude to my Aon collogues and partners who put forth tremendous effort during the time of such human need. With all hands on deck, we are fully focused on supporting our clients and our colleagues through the continued aftermath of these events.","Now, referencing back to the specific topic of this call, we\u2019d like to highlight that there are slides available on our website for you to follow along with our commentary today.","As we discussed on prior calls, Aon\u2019s current position is a result of a proven decade-long strategy that focuses on aligning our portfolio solutions around our clients\u2019 highest priorities in the arenas of risk, retirement and health. We\u2019ve taken significant steps to get here. Earlier this year, we completed the divestiture of our outsourcing platform, which provides a further catalyst for our strategy and actions to deliver substantial shareholder value.","With approximately $3 billion of additional capital to accelerate investment in emerging client needs and in our Aon United operating model, we expect to substantially strengthen our firm even further. We\u2019re already seeing improvement in our growth profile driven by investments in high-growth, high-margin areas across our portfolio. For example, our organic growth has accelerated year-to-date from 2% in 2015 to 3% in both 2016 and now 2017. And we\u2019re taking further steps to unit Aon with investments to progress toward a single global business services operating model, increasing Aon\u2019s efficiency and connectivity, and through one global P&L encompassing all of Aon\u2019s industry-leading capabilities, helping us deliver all of global Aon to their clients in their local markets.","Now turning to the quarter on page five of the presentation. Consistent with previous quarters, I would like to cover two areas before turning the call over to Christa for further financial review. First is our performance against key metrics we communicate to shareholders; second, overall growth performance including continued areas of strategic investment.","On the first topic, our performance versus key metrics. Each quarter, we measure our performance against the key metrics we focus on achieving over the course of the year, grow organically, expand margins, increase earnings per share and deliver free cash flow growth.","In the third quarter, organic revenue growth was 2%, highlighted by strong growth in Reinsurance and Retirement Solutions. Operating margin increased by 170 basis points, primarily reflecting savings from investments in our Aon United operating model and core operational improvement. EPS increased 18% to $1.29, reflecting both strong operating performance and effective capital management. Finally, free cash flow decreased $881 million year-to-date, primarily reflecting tax payments related to the divestiture.","Overall, Q3 was a quarter of continued progress with year-to-date results reflecting 3% organic revenue growth, 170 basis points of margin improvement and 17% EPS growth heading into our seasonally strongest quarter of the year.","Turning to slide seven, on the second topic of organic growth and strategic investments. Organic revenue growth was 2% overall in the third quarter. And as I mentioned earlier, on a year-to-date basis, organic revenue growth was 3%, reflecting growth across all five revenue lines with particular strength in Health and Reinsurance Solutions.","Reflecting now on each of our core growth platforms. In Commercial Risk Solutions, organic revenue declined 1% against the strong comparable of 4% growth in the prior year quarter. The prior year quarter included a benefit from certain onetime items. On average, globally, exposures are modestly positive and the impact from pricing was modestly negative, resulting in a relatively stable market impact overall. Our results in the quarter reflect modest growth internationally across EMEA, Asia and the Pacific, driven by strong new business generation and management of our renewable portfolio. In the U.S., results faced headwind from the timing of certain items.","Given recent catastrophic events and significant industry challenges, our global teams prioritize helping clients with immediate action plans, claims processing and recovery efforts in the quarter. Overall, we believe our results in Commercial Risk Solutions for the third quarter reflect the confluence of unfavorable timing and events in our seasonally smallest quarter, against the strong comparable in the prior year. We believe the underlying results are better viewed on a year-to-date basis and we would expect the fourth quarter to show growth in our seasonally strongest quarter.","In Reinsurance Solutions, organic revenue growth was 7%, an acceleration from flat in the prior-year quarter. I would note, this is the second consecutive quarter of the highest level of organic revenue growth achieved in our reinsurance business in five years. Results reflect growth across every major area including treaty placements, capital markets transactions and facultative placements. We saw a particular strength in treaty placements, driven by record new business generation including several new clients to Aon and a modest benefit from reinstatement premiums following the recent events. Results were partially offset by modest, unfavorable market impact, primarily in the Americas.","In Retirement Solutions, organic revenue growth was 5%, an acceleration from 4% in the prior year quarter. We saw a continued strong growth in investment consulting, including double-digit growth in delegated investment management solutions, reflecting an increase in client demand for Aon\u2019s tailored solutions, independent [ph] advice, as well as increase in performance fees for outperforming benchmark returns. Assets under management and delegated investment management continue to trend upward, reaching a $118 billion in the third quarter. We also saw a solid growth in our talent practice, primarily from compensation survey and benchmarking services.","In Health Solutions, organic revenue growth was 2%. We saw strong growth in health and benefits brokerage including double-digit new business generation with particular strength in the U.S. and Latin America. Results were partially offset by a decline in project-related work in the healthcare exchange business. On a year-to-date basis, organic revenue growth was 7%, an acceleration from 4% in the prior year.","In Data & Analytic Services, organic revenue growth was 3%. Results primarily reflect growth in our Affinity business, with particular strength in the U.S. Growth in U.S. Affinity was highlighted by continued strong performance in pet and financial solutions as well as the modest increase in claims processing in our employed business following the recent activity.","Now, turning to slide eight to discuss areas of strategic investment. Clients are navigating an increasingly volatile world where economic, demographic and geopolitical forces combined with the exponential pace of technology change are all converging to create a challenging new reality for businesses. Aon has a strong track record of allocating capital for developing innovative, first-to-market solutions to help solve problems and create differentiated value in response to specific client needs.","We\u2019re investing organically and through M&A across our portfolio in areas such as Data & Analytics, in our InPoint and Re\/View businesses; cyber risk advisory through the recent acquisition of Stroz Friedberg; Affinity, in multiple areas across the business; health and elective benefits brokerage through the recent acquisitions of Admix in Latin America and Univers; healthcare exchanges, where we offer the broadest set of solutions in health; geographically with the pending acquisition of UMG, reinforcing our industry-leading position in the Netherlands; and finally, in delegated investment management solutions, a business with rapidly growing client demand.","In the third quarter, we announced the pending acquisition of the Townsend Group, a leading global provider of investment management and advisory services, primarily focused on real estate. Townsend significantly expands our investment capabilities by bringing greater depth of expertise in real estate and real estate assets to Aon\u2019s distribution scale and furthers our ability to provide more attractive, alternative, pilot market asset capabilities to our clients.","Overall, our strategic investments in high growth areas and in Data & Analytics are improving the firm\u2019s long-term growth profile, driven by new business generation, strong retention rates, and increased operating leverage across the portfolio.","In summary, during the quarter, where client and colleague needs were our immediate priority, we delivered strong operational improvement and double-digit earnings growth, reflecting increased operating leverage and performance on new initiatives, in addition to the year-to-date return of approximately $2.1 billion of capital to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends. Looking forward, we expect a strong finish to the year with continued momentum amplified by an unmatched level of investment driving the next wave of innovation for clients and substantial value creation for our shareholders.","I\u2019m now pleased to turn the call over to Christa for further financial review. Christa?","Christa Davies","Thank you so much, Greg, and good morning, everyone.","As Greg noted, our performance marks a solid quarter of progress highlighted by strong operational improvement and effective capital management while continuing to take significant steps to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of our operating model. Our results year-to-date reflect growth across every major revenue line, strong operational improvement, and double-digit earnings growth heading into our seasonally strongest quarter of the year.","Turning to slide 10 of the presentation. Our core EPS from continuing operations, excluding certain items, increased 18% to $1.29 per share for the third quarter compared to $1.09 in the prior-year quarter. Certain items that were adjusted for in the core EPS performance and highlighted in the schedules on Page 11 and 12 of the press release include non-cash intangible asset amortization, restructuring charges, charges related to certain regulatory and compliance matters, non-cash expenses related to pension settlements in the prior-year quarter, and the related tax impact. Included in the results was a $0.01 per share favorable impact from foreign currency translation due primarily to a stronger U.S. dollar versus the pound and a modestly weaker U.S. dollar overall.","Turning to the next slide to discuss our strong operational performance. Operating income increased 16% and operating margin improved 170 basis points to 20.3%, compared to the prior year quarter. Operating margin improvement primarily reflects $55 million or 240 basis points of savings from restructuring initiatives and other operational improvements before any reinvestment. This was partially offset by $10 million or minus 40 basis points of transaction costs related to recent acquisitions, and $5 million or minus 20 basis points headwind, resulting from lower non-cash pension income. Year-to-date operating income has increased 14% and operating margin has improved 170 basis points compared to the prior year. From a dollar standpoint, operating income has increased $183 million with $109 million driven by savings before reinvestment and $74 million delivered by solid organic revenue growth and core operational improvements, strong progress operationally as we continue to execute against our multiyear investment in the firm.","Turning to page 12. I\u2019d like to spend a few moments discussing the investments we\u2019re making to create our next generation global business services model that allows for better scalability, flexibility and enhanced colleague and client experience. These investments are intended to create one operating model with increased operating leverage. Our primary investment areas are across IT, real estate and people.","In IT, we expect to create greater insight from data center optimization, application management and strategic vendor consolidation. In real estate, we expect to drive greater collaboration and engagement through real estate portfolio optimization. And in people, we expect to create greater scalability of operations and activity, including the use of centers of excellence and third-party providers.","As part of these operating model investments, we plan to invest an estimated $900 million in total cash out of the $3 billion total outsourcing divestiture proceeds. These investments include an estimated $700 million of cash charges expected to be incurred $350 million in 2017; $250 million in 2018, and $100 million in 2019. And an estimated $200 million of incremental CapEx, expected to be incurred $30 million in 2017; $100 million in 2018; and $70 million in 2019. There is an additional estimated $50 million of non-cash charges included as part of asset impairments and lease consolidations.","Overall, we expect these investments and other expense discipline initiatives to deliver $400 million of estimated annual savings in 2019, before any potential reinvestments. Following this $900 million investment in our operating model, we are left with approximately $2.1 billion of incremental capital from the outsourcing divestiture proceeds to invest in high-growth, high-margin areas across our portfolio and to return to shareholders. We will deploy this capital to the highest return on invested capital opportunity.","As Greg mentioned earlier, we\u2019ve returned approximately $2.1 billion to shareholders year-to-date through share repurchase and dividends. We also announced two significant acquisitions during the quarter, the Townsend Group in our delegated investment management business, and UMG in the Netherlands, which are expected to close in the coming months. With the completion of these two acquisitions and year-to-date activity, we\u2019ve committed over $1 billion of capital to M&A in 2017 in high-growth, high-margin business.","Turning to the next page. In the third quarter, we incurred $102 million of restructuring-related charges, relating primarily to workforce reduction, IT and other general initiatives. Year-to-date, we\u2019ve incurred $401 million of restructuring-related charges, representing 53% of the total program estimate. The cash impact year-to-date is an outflow of $199 million. We recognized $55 million of savings in the third quarter, and $109 million of savings year-to-date, representing 73% of the expected savings for the year and 27% of the expected total savings.","Now, let me discuss a few of the line items outside of operations on slide 14. Interest income increased $9 million to $10 million for Q3 compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting additional income earned on the balance of proceeds from the sale of the outsourcing assets. I would note that higher cash balances in the short-term resulting in additional interest income but balances are coming down through the deployment of capital to depending M&A and share repurchase such that we would not expect the same level of interest income going forward. Interest expense was similar at $70 million for Q3. Other expense of $5 million includes $15 million of net losses due to the unfavorable impact of exchange rates on the re-measurement of assets and liabilities in non-functional currencies, partially offset by $10 million of gains primarily related to certain long-term investments.","Turning to taxes. The adjusted effective tax rate on net income from continuing operations, excluding the applicable tax impact associated with certain non-GAAP adjustments, increased to 17.5% compared to 14.2% in the prior year quarter. The adjusted effective tax rate in the prior year reflects a net favorable impact from certain discrete items.","Lastly, weighted average diluted shares outstanding decreased 5% to 257.3 million in the third quarter compared to 269.6 million in the prior-year quarter, as we effectively allocate capital. The Company repurchased 5.4 million Class A Ordinary Shares for approximately $750 million in third quarter. The Company has approximately $5.9 billion of remaining authorization under its share repurchase program. Actual shares outstanding on September 31st were 250.8 million and there were approximately 5 million additional dilutive equivalents. Estimated Q4 2017 beginning dilutive share count is approximately 256 million, subject to share price movement, share issuance and share repurchase.","Now, let me turn to the next slide to discuss our solid balance sheet and financial flexibility. At September 30, 2017, cash and short-term investments decreased to $2.4 billion, which continues to reflect higher balances related to the proceeds from the sale of the outsourcing assets.","Total debt outstanding was similar at $6 billion. And total debt to EBITDA on a GAAP basis to continuing operations increased modestly to 3.3 times. As discussed previously, while debt to EBITDA will initially be elevated as a result of the sale of the outsourcing assets, we expect to return back to the 2 to 2.5 times range by the end of 2018, driven by operational improvement.","Cash flow from operations for the first nine months decreased $863 million to $289 million, primarily driven by cash tax payments associated with the divestiture, a $199 million of cash restructuring charges and $45 million of transaction costs related to the divestiture, partially offset by operational improvement.","Free cash flow, defined by cash flow from operations less CapEx, decreased $881 million to $164 million, driven by a decline in cash flow from operations and an $18 million increase in CapEx, including investments to deliver our Aon United operating model.","Turning to the next slide to discuss our free cash flow growth over the long term. We value the firm based on free cash flow and allocate capital to maximize free cash flow returns. We\u2019ve made substantial progress since introducing free cash flow as a key financial metric in 2012, reaching record free cash flow of $2.1 billion in 2016. Our disciplined capital management approach is focused on maximizing return on invested capital, which we\u2019ve consistently improved each year since 2010, increasing 540 basis points to 17.1% in 2016. We expect the recent sale of our outsourcing assets and investments in our Aon United operating model to improve this even further in 2017 and beyond.","We have taken significant steps to maximize the translation of each dollar of revenue into the highest amount of free cash flow, including working capital initiatives and actions to manage our cash pension contributions. Since 2010, we\u2019ve increased our free cash flow margin by nearly 1,000 basis points to 18.1% in 2016.","Looking forward, there are three primary areas that we expect to continue to contribute to incremental free cash flow generation. The first is continued operational improvement, driven by expected accelerated organic revenue growth and margin expansion. The second is working capital improvements, as we focus on closing the gap between receivables and payables. We expect working capital to contribute to free cash flow by over $500 million over the long-term. And third is expected lower cash tax payments, reflecting a lower effective tax rate over time.","In summary, this was a solid quarter of progress. We delivered strong operational improvement and double-digit earnings growth while continuing to take substantial steps to strengthen our firm over the long term, including investments in high growth areas and in our Aon United operating model. We believe that operational improvement combined with significant financial flexibility from transaction proceeds and underlying free cash flow generation position the firm to deliver on our near-term goal of exceeding $7.97 in adjusted EPS in 2018. More importantly, we believe this reinforces our ability to deliver double-digit annual growth in free cash flow over the long-term, reflecting what we believe is the next significant value-creation opportunity for shareholders.","With that I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Sarah DeWitt from J.P. Morgan. Ma\u2019am your line is open.","Sarah DeWitt","Hi. Good morning. First, I was wondering if you could just talk about on organic growth, what drove the decline in Commercial Risk Solutions. I think, you mentioned some timing issues. And do you expect that to rebound going forward? And then second, could you just talk about your outlook for PNC insurance pricing, post the active third quarter hurricane season?","Greg Case","Sure, happy to do that, Sarah. As we described, first of all, remember, this is our -- Q3 is our smallest quarter sort of over the course of the year heading into our strongest quarter, the fourth quarter. I talked about it, strong comparable from the Q3 last year of 4%, and essentially said, the timing was really showing up in Q1 and Q3. So, we don\u2019t expect anything coming back in Q4. But, what we really try to highlight is kind of -- if you look at our results, not just in commercial risk but really overall and kind of the year-to-date perspective, this is really where we think sort of as a best assessment overall in terms of where we are, and this we essentially said. If we think year-to-date Q3 \u201815, \u201816, \u201817, we have gone from 2% in \u201815 to 3% in \u201816, 3% in \u201817, and we believe we can continue to accelerate that over time. We see Q3 as a little of a anomaly in the context of all that.","Sarah DeWitt","Pricing\u2026","Greg Case","Pricing piece, I thought you might forget that. [Multiple speakers] Listen, on the pricing side, obviously a lot\u2019s been written and talked about. Our view is -- look, there is just a -- continues to be a tremendous amount of uncertainty out there. The ultimate losses, unclear kind of where they all shake out from time to time, just look at the ranges sort of been published, they\u2019ve been astronomical in terms of sort of how they\u2019ve come in. I would say, from our standpoint, look, we still sit in a very well capitalized industry overall. We described while substantial, more of an earnings event versus a balance sheet event in terms of sort of where we\u2019re over time. But I would highlight from Aon\u2019s perspective, we see this very much on a client by client basis. We\u2019ve invested in substantial data and analytics over time to put us in what we believe is a great position to help our clients, particularly in these kinds of environments. If you look at what we do with Aon Client Treaty for example, these are the types of investments that, frankly, reduce risk work for clients and create opportunity for them. From our standpoint, it\u2019s going to play out over time. Sarah, there is no specific answer at this point. And we\u2019re going to take it client by client as it evolves over time.","Operator","And your next question comes from Dave Styblo with Jefferies. Your line is open. ","Dave Styblo","I just want to go back to operating income. So, if we take the 476 and back out the unfavorable adjustments from pension and M&A transaction costs, and adjust for the $55 million of cost savings, I guess, I get a margin around 18.6% on underlying basis, which should be flat year-over-year. Is that sort of a right way to think about it, or did you guys plough back some of the $55 million of cost savings? And obviously, if you did that, the core margin would show some expansion. So, I\u2019m just trying to understand what\u2019s happening on a fundamental basis, when we exclude some of the larger puts and takes there.","Christa Davies","I think about this on a year-to-date basis because I think quarter-to-quarter, it\u2019s a little lumpy Dave. And frankly, Q3 is our seasonally smallest quarter. And so, if you look at it year-to-date, you can see that OI is up 14% or $183 million. If you look at that $183 million, $109 million of it came from restructuring and $74 million of it came from core operational improvement. So, you\u2019ve basically got 60% of the growth in OI from restructuring savings before reinvestment and 40% of it from core organic revenue growth and margin expansion. So, we feel really good about the operating income growth for the year, and margins for the year are up 170 basis points. So, we\u2019re very pleased with the progress so far.","Greg Case","I might add to that, Dave. If you look at it -- Christa just highlighted really Q3 year-to-date results, Q3 2017, if you did the exact same question in Q2, we\u2019re better against each one of those metrics, as you go from Q2 to Q3. So, it\u2019s plus 14, as Christa described and year-to-date Q3, the year-to-date Q2 was up 12%, we\u2019re up a 170 basis points year-to-date Q3, that was a 160 basis points year-to-date Q2, up 17% EPS that same number was 15% in Q2. So, it\u2019s actually a nice progression. And as we described it, don\u2019t overplay, but a quarter of progress in terms of where we\u2019re. And what you\u2019re seeing is really core performance and operating leverage increasing as we continue to invest in the global business services platform.","Dave Styblo","Okay, got it. And then, on your $150 million of cost savings target, it sounds that\u2019s unchanged for the year. But, if you look at how things are trending, if you just kept the same run rate from 3Q into 4Q, you\u2019re going to be above that range. And I guess, I would assume that as you progress, your cost savings should actually increase. So, are you guys in position where you might actually be trending above your cost savings target for this year or is there something that makes that come down in the fourth quarter?","Christa Davies","Dave, we are exactly on track with the program estimates and we feel really good about the progress so far.","Dave Styblo","So, it sounds like -- I mean, is there a reason why we come down? It sounds like you are holding to the $150 million.","Christa Davies","We are holding $150 million and we will update at year-end.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Klauber from William Blair. Sir, your line is open.","Adam Klauber","It looks like you\u2019ve got roughly $2.4 billion or so of cash and short-term securities on the balance sheet. And historically, you hold more like $700 million to $900 million. So, that would suggest you have roughly $1.5 billion extra cash and then for next year, on top of that you have what you generate. Is that the way to think about what you have to deploy for 2018 versus 2017?","Christa Davies","Yes. I think that\u2019s right, Adam. And I guess, what I would say is, as you look at sort of the $2.4 billion, $850 million of it is committed to the M&A we did in the quarter. We did publicly announce those two deals, Townsend and UMG. So, you have $1.6 billion left plus Q4 free cash flow going into 2018.","Adam Klauber","I think you mentioned that tax payments reduced free cash this quarter. How much were those?","Christa Davies","Yes. We haven\u2019t given that number. But, what we can say is that the after tax proceeds from the sale of the outsourcing assets were approximately $3 billion.","Adam Klauber","Okay. And then, you\u2019ve done a couple of good sized deals already in growth areas. Does that mean you have to digest those or do you still have a good pipeline, and is it possible to see some more good deals in 2018?","Greg Case","From our standpoint, listen, we\u2019ve actually done, 19 acquisitions signed closed year-to-date and as Christa described, over a $1 billion committed on the M&A front. We see, again, real opportunities here to add content capability to the overall portfolio. As you\u2019ve heard us say multiple times, so I\u2019ll repeat it here again today, we take a very, very disciplined approach to this. Christa has put in place a return on invested capital framework, cash on cash return; nothing gets through that framework. And in essence, the benchmark is buyback, which we believe is a very, very attractive investment. But, when we find opportunities that exceed buyback, we invest in those. And there is a very substantial robust pipeline, lots of opportunities out there and we see these as kind of add-on acquisitions to the Aon family that content capability that we can scale. Townsend is a terrific example of that and UMG\u2019s [ph] a terrific example of that, Admix in Latin America is a terrific example of that. So, lots of different opportunities for us out there and you\u2019ll continue to see us invest along the framework I described.","Adam Klauber","And finally on Townsend, will that deal be flowing in the fourth quarter? And are the margins at this business generally in line, better or not as good as the overall business.","Christa Davies","We do expect to close both Townsend and UMG in the coming months. We won\u2019t be more specific about timing than that. And they are very attractive businesses. They are high growth, they are high margin and they are high free cash flow generation. And that\u2019s really -- that fits with the overall story of how we are evolving the portfolio. We\u2019re exiting lower growth, lower margin, lower free cash flow generation businesses, and we\u2019re disproportionately investing. And that\u2019s what you have seen in the over $1 billion of M&A that we have committed year-to-date and we are very excited about that.","Greg Case","And we really like, Adam, is -- not only do we like the financial characteristics but what drives that is really the underlying client capability and content characteristics. And each of those bring a unique capability to the table on our behalf and we are going to -- we can then see that across the firm. And this is back to the idea of the catalyst, which is really the -- if we saw the outsourcing business, it generates another level of investment we can put back into the business, both on the acquisition side as well as investing in global business services across Aon to strengthen the firm. So, it really is we think unique opportunity over the coming two to three years, when we think about capital deployment.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley. Sir, your line is open.","Mike Phillips","It\u2019s actually Mike Phillips here in place of Kai Pan this morning. Couple of questions, one on margins. In the quarter, the 120 basis-point improvement, decent improvement. I guess, with lots of moving parts behind that, one is FX. How much of the FX impact to the margin improvement?","Christa Davies","So, there is no FX impact on margin for the quarter.","Mike Phillips","And then, same thing on margin with the organic growth being what it was, 2%. Does that mean that you can expand the margin, if organic grows even more?","Christa Davies","Yes, we can. And so, what you are seeing, due to the investments we have made in higher growth, higher margin areas over the last few years, our investments in Aon United operating model is we can grow margin at low rates of growth. And so, as Greg said, we do expect to accelerate growth based on the investments we have made. And that\u2019s where you should expect accelerating margin expansion.","Mike Phillips","Lots of brokers are talking about the excitement they have with maybe possible pricing changes and how they can take advantage of that, and you guys are closing the difference. I guess, can you talk about any possible risk to you guys because of the restructuring you\u2019re doing, and possible maybe disruptions to brokers and maybe not to focus on the possible opportunities coming with the possible price changes, is there any risk there?","Greg Case","First of all, Mike, I would just step back. As I described when Sarah asked her question at the beginning, for us, a lot of uncertainty out there in terms of what\u2019s going on. That means there is uncertainty for our clients and that is actually the wheelhouse of Aon. The content capability, analytics we have invested in over time, it literally puts us in a tremendous position. Our clients understand risk, measure risk and mitigate risk. And that\u2019s really what we are doing. I want to also emphasize, the investment we are making back into the firm is a substantial investment. It involves restructuring but it is also investment in a number of areas to strengthen our firm, in technology, things we are doing on the real estate front to create greater client areas to bring our colleagues together. So, a lot is going on across Aon. But it is all fundamentally to make Aon stronger engine, a stronger firm to serve clients. So, I\u2019d go the exact opposite. What we are doing to strengthening our firm, support clients over time and this is another example of a very high stress time for clients, so we can be helpful to them. So, I see exactly the opposite. To us, this is an opportunity to invest to strengthen the firm. And that\u2019s in fact exactly what we are doing.","Mike Phillips","It sounds like you are pretty confident that brokers won\u2019t get distracted or whatever by the restructuring making -- and you don\u2019t see any risk there?","Greg Case","Quite the reverse. Again, I think our team is fully focused on clients 24x7 and that\u2019s what Aon is all about, so don\u2019t see any concern there at all.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Newsome from Sandler O\u2019Neill. Sir, your line is open.","Paul Newsome","I was wondering about where or not the goal to exceed 7.97 next year is dependent upon the current accounting system or the one that we\u2019re going to get next year with the change in revenue recognition? And maybe just a view, an update whether or not you have a view how the revenue recognition might change your financials next year? ","Christa Davies","So, really the impact of 2018 revenue recognition accounting changes is largely immaterial to full year revenue and margin; it\u2019s really going to change the timing by quarter. There will be a significant re-phasing of quarterly revenue within a given year, particularly within reinsurance solutions, but there will be immaterial changes to full year 2018. The other thing I would note is at our Q4 full year 2017 earnings day, we will actually restate 2016 full year and 2017 full year by quarter to give you that detail for the benefit of shareholders.","Paul Newsome","Does it in any way change how we calculate organic growth as well?","Christa Davies","Because we\u2019re going to restate 2016 and 2017, no.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question over to Arash Soleimani from KBW. Sir, your line is open. ","Arash Soleimani","I just wanted to get your thoughts the protection gap in insurance and to what extent you think the events we saw in the third quarter could actually lead to a higher insurance penetration within certain lines of business?","Greg Case","It\u2019s a terrific question. And we\u2019ve talked about that -- the industry has talked about that. These types of events highlight literally sort of individuals and companies that are quite literally uncovered in sort of events and times of trauma. I would say, at Aon, we think about it a little bit differently from a kind of a protection gap. Because if you think about this from the side of a client or an individual customer, we\u2019re essentially saying, we have a gap out there in order for you to actually be in a better position, just buy more of our product. We look at it differentially. We look at it literally as, think about, how capital gets deployed, are there more efficient ways to deploy across the risk spectrum, and we believe there actually is. And there is different products and innovations that come with that.","And so, our view is, when you think about kind of the world of risk out there and you recognize sort of how little the penetration is around the world, there is just tremendous opportunities to actually strengthen and build upon that, not just the existing risk like flood which is an obvious one but the new risk like cyber. I mean, again, if you think about cyber right now, there was $450 billion of loss in the U.S. last year, or reported loss in cyber and $2.5 billion or $3 billion in premium. The laws in Europe, which are going to come into effect in May, June of 2018 are going to create another wave of reported loss. How we respond to that to support clients is really a function of how we innovate as an industry. It is also true for the more straightforward coverages like flood and which we got to respond with innovation that actually make that more attractive, different than the current product we\u2019ve got right now. So, we believe there is a very strong set of opportunities to increase the penetration, really serve clients more effectively as they understand, measure, and mitigate risk, but it\u2019s going to require our industry to innovate in order to make that happen.","Arash Soleimani","And just my one other question is since you mentioned cyber, and I know -- we heard a lot of industry estimates of cyber going from $3 billion up to $30 billion in just the matter of years. So, based on what you\u2019ve been seeing in your own books, do you see demand potentially increasing at that level or how do you think about the potential growth opportunity in the next few years?","Greg Case","Again, we look at it -- we do see a substantial growth fully driven by client needs. So, I mean, again, if you think about literally just the $450 billion of reported loss from the U.S., virtually -- I\u2019m saying U.S. because most of it was U.S. reported, that begs the question, is there just no cyber in Europe? Obviously, there is. So, why is it so much smaller? It\u2019s a function of the laws, those are going to change. Therefore, cyber is going to go a number which is some -- many multiples of that. So, we see tremendous opportunity to help clients understand and deal with cyber. And it\u2019s been a source of growth for us, will continue to be a source of growth for us. We\u2019re privileged to be the largest place for this around the world and we\u2019re doubling down our investment in it. Having said that, our industry including Aon, need to continue to innovate on behalf of clients on this category. So, we see this as a substantial opportunity because it\u2019s a substantial source of risk for our clients.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Ma\u2019am your line is open.","Elyse Greenspan","I was hoping to spend -- get a little bit more color in terms of the reinsurance growth. I know, you mentioned that there wasn\u2019t a lot of restatements there. It doesn\u2019t -- was there any kind of one timers that you would point to? It\u2019s obviously the second quarter of pretty strong growth in that business. What\u2019s the outlook there? And then, as we think about margin improvement you saw in the quarter, typically, I would think reinsurance run at better margins and then rest of your business, was that helpful to the level of margin improvement you saw this quarter?","Greg Case","Why don\u2019t I start on the revenue side and Christa you can pick up the margin piece? First of all, on the revenue side, much like we talked about sort of -- we don\u2019t look at the quarter, we look at kind of year-to-date. We\u2019re kind of 5% year-to-date. We think that\u2019s actually great progress. I would come back reflecting on multiple calls over the last few years and just highlight again, we just have a superb team on the reinsurance side, they are tremendously well-positioned to support clients. We\u2019re agnostic on the overall approach, we\u2019re essentially helping our clients again think about ways to understand and control volatility. And what you saw this quarter, it really was record new business on the treaty side. And this is with existing clients but also with new clients to Aon as we gain market share in this arena. Also, we are number one in treaty, number one in facultative placements, and number one in insurance, like securities like et cetera. So, we just got an exceptionally strong position.","This team has also taken great efforts to expand the marketplace. If you think about what we\u2019ve done on the mortgage side and literally created net new markets in an area that hadn\u2019t existed before. So, what you see on the reinsurance front is just continued progress from an exceptional team. And again, as I said clients that have lots of need out there to understand and deal with volatility, which is increasing over time. So, it\u2019s just been terrific progress from a very, very strong team in this context. In terms of impact on margin, Christa?","Christa Davies","Yes. So, Elyse, we would say that the margin growth year-to-date of a 170 basis points is really across the whole of Aon. It\u2019s driven by strong growth in each of the five new revenue lines we have margin expansion in each of those areas, and then, underpinned by the investments we are making in the Aon United operating model and the savings we are driving from that. So, it isn\u2019t disproportionately driven by any particular area of the business.","Elyse Greenspan","And then, you guys are a few quarters into this savings plan. I know in the past, you have had several and you had a good track record for seeing saves that have more than exceeded how you initially laid out some of your prior plans. So, a few quarters in, I guess, how are you seeing things as you\u2019re going along with the program? And do you think there is a potential that we could see this be revised up down the road?","Christa Davies","Elyse, we would say we are exactly on track. As I said earlier in the call, we will certainly update at year-end. But, we would say, we are exactly on track with -- to deliver $150 million this year, $300 million next year and $400 million the year after. And we feel very good about the progress.","Elyse Greenspan","And then, in terms of buybacks, the free cash flow was obviously negative in the quarter. How do we think about buybacks here, given that you have these two acquisitions that you are going to close in the near term? And you have obviously come off two quarters of pretty high level of buyback following the divestiture.","Christa Davies","Yes. I mean, what I would say, Elyse, is we have returned, as Greg said, over $2 billion to shareholders year-to-date between buyback and dividends. And we have done $2 billion of buyback roughly so far this year, and we have committed $1 billion to M&A so far this year. I think what you will see in Q4 is more M&A and more buybacks. And it\u2019s all driven by return on capital. As you think about the amount we can deploy, whether it\u2019s on buyback or an M&A, you have got $2.4 billion on the balance sheet with the M&A spend committed of 850, so you\u2019re left with $1.6 billion cash on the balance sheet, plus Q4 free cash flow generation, which is our seasonally strongest quarter of the year. And so, we are very excited about the opportunity to invest in organic opportunities, in M&A, and our highest return on capital opportunity across Aon remains share repurchase.","Operator","Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg Case for closing remarks.","Greg Case","I just want to thank everybody for being part of the call today, and look forward to our conversation next quarter. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you, speakers. Participants, that concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you all participating. You may now disconnect."],"2014":["Aon plc (NYSE:AON) Q4 2014 Earnings Conference Call February  6, 2015  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Greg Case - President and CEO","Christa Davies - CFO","Analysts","Adam Klauber - William Blair","Sarah DeWitt - JPMorgan","Dave Styblo - Jefferies","Brian Meredith - UBS","Ryan Burns - Janney Capital","Jay Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Mike Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs","Charles Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets","Arash Soleimani - KBW","Operator","Good morning, and thank you for holding. Welcome to Aon plc's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2014 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would also like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded, and that it is important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature and defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated.","Information concerning any risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our fourth quarter and full year 2014 results as well as have been posted to our Web site.","Now, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, President and CEO of Aon plc. You may begin, sir.","Greg Case","Thank you, and good morning to everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2014 conference call. Joining me here today is our CFO, Christa Davies.","I would note that there are slides available on our Web site for you to follow along with our commentary today. And consistent with previous quarters, I'd like to cover three areas before turning the call over to Christa for further financial review.","First is our performance against key metrics we communicate to shareholders. Second is overall organic growth performance. Third, continued areas of strategic investment across Aon.","On the first topic, our performance versus key metrics; each quarter we measure our performance against the key metrics we focus on achieving over the course of the year, grow organically, expand margins, increase earnings per share, and deliver free cash flow growth.","Turning to Slide 3; in the fourth quarter, organic revenue growth was 6% overall; the strongest quarter of organic revenue growth in over a decade, highlighted by strong growth in our HR outsourcing and America's retail brokerage businesses.","Operating margin increased to 180 basis points, reflecting strong operating margin improvement in both segments. EPS increased 23% to $1.89, reflecting strong operating margin improvement, a lower effective tax rate, and effective capital management.","Now, if we turn to the full year; organic revenue growth was 3% overall, reflecting solid growth in both segments, despite pricing pressure on our reinsurance business and overall economic uncertainty in Europe.","Operating margin increased 50 basis points, reflecting margin improvement in both segments, inclusive of an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. EPS increased 17% to 5.71. And finally free cash flow was roughly flat at 1.4 billion, as record cash flow from operations of 1.6 billion was offset by a 27 million increase in CapEx.","Overall, our results reflect a strong finish to the year, despite industry and foreign currency headwinds. We delivered continued growth in operational improvement. We are making significant investments in client serving capabilities across the firm, and returning a record 2.5 billion of capital to shareholders in 2014.","Turning to Slide 4; on the second topic of growth, I want to spend the next few minutes discussing the quarter for both of our segments. In Risk Solutions, organic revenue growth was 3% overall, reflecting strong growth in the Americas and improvement in reinsurance. As we've discussed previously, we're driving a set of initiatives that are strengthening underlying performance and positioning our Risk Solution segment for long-term growth and improved operating leverage, with management of our renewal book through Aon Client Promise and retention rates of more than 90% on average, highlighting strong client satisfaction in our retail business; new business generation of 36040 million across our retail business, highlighted by another record quarter of new business in U.S. retail, as well as double-digit new business growth in many countries across APAC and emerging markets.","In our core treaty reinsurance business, net new business trends have been positive for 15 consecutive quarters, an outstanding performance in today's changing marketplace. That reflects Aon Benfield's long-term value proposition for clients and the application of excess capital in the industry to previously uninsured risks, and increased operating leverage from our investments in innovative technology, and data and analytics with the growth of GRIP, ReView and Aon Broking.","Reflecting on the individual businesses within Risk Solutions; in the Americas, organic revenue growth was 7% compared to 4% in the prior year quarter. Exposures continue to be positive across the region, while the impact from pricing was flat resulting in continued stable market impact. We saw solid growth across all regions; U.S, retail, Latin America, and Canada, and growth across all businesses; property casualty, health and benefits, and affinity.","In U.S. retail and Latin America, we delivered a record level of new business generation. Results in the quarter also include 8 million of anticipated favorable timing that unfavorably impacted the third quarter. Excluding this timing benefit, underlying organic revenue growth was 6%.","In International, organic revenue growth was flat. Similar to the previous quarter, exposures were stable, but the impact from pricing was modestly negative on average, driven by fragile market conditions in many regions across Europe.","We saw strong growth across Asia in both mature and emerging markets, and solid growth across the Pacific region, specifically New Zealand, driven by new business generation.","Results in the quarter were offset by a modest decline in Continental Europe. For the full year, Continental Europe delivered modest growth driven by new business in many countries and the management of renewal book portfolio across the region; an excellent outcome against sustained market headwinds and economic uncertainty.","In reinsurance, organic revenue growth was 3%, compared to flat in the prior year quarter. Excess capital in this space continues to pressure global treaty pricing, driving a significant unfavorable market impact to the quarter. Results reflect positive net new business in treaty placements, as well as growth in capital market transaction and advisory business and facultative placements. While record capital was placing pressure on traditional treaty, clients were taking advantage by purchasing more coverage.","In addition, we're putting capital to work in new areas, such as the credit default market with Fannie and Freddie. And our industry market-leading data and analytics are bringing new solutions to the annuity market for life insurers.","Aon Benfield's unmatched level of investment and exhaustive portfolio of support and services is creating real value for clients and new products that are helping to offset near-term industry headwinds.","Overall, across Risk Solutions; we delivered improved growth in the fourth quarter as anticipated, resulting in 2% organic growth for the full year. As we continue to drive new business and to take a unified approach to serving clients across the portfolio, we expect lower to mid single-digit organic growth for total Risk Solutions in 2015.","Turning to HR Solutions; organic revenue growth was 10% with growth across both major businesses, and in areas where we're making the investments in the business including healthcare exchanges, pension risks and delegated investment solutions. These investments reflect Aon Hewitt's client leadership, understanding, and influence of market trends, and solutions that sustainably address the long-term issues that face our clients as healthcare reform, healthcare costs, and associated financial risks continue to rise at a time when overall health and wellness is not improving.","Multinational clients are increasingly looking for global benefit solutions to support our global organizations delivered at a local level, managing and transferring risk against pension schemes that are increasingly frozen, largely underfunded and facing regulatory changes.","Turning to the individual businesses within HR solutions; in consulting services, organic revenue growth was 4%, compared to 1% in the prior year quarter. We saw continued strong growth in U.S. retirement, primarily from demand for pension de-risking and lump-sum winter activity along with continued growth in delegated investment consulting and growth across businesses in Asia. Results were partially offset by a mass decline in Continental Europe as macro conditions placed pressure on discretionary spend.","For the full year, we delivered 5% organic growth across consulting services, in line with our outlook for 2014, and we expect mid single-digit organic revenue growth to continue in 2015.","In outsourcing, organic revenue growth was 15% compared to 11% in the prior year quarter. Organic revenue reflects substantial growth in our healthcare exchange business as we recognize revenue related to the majority of enrollments that take place during the fourth quarter in our actives and retiree exchanges. Results also reflect new client wins in HR BPO as an increasing number of clients are adopting cloud based outsourcing solutions. Overall, for total HR solutions we delivered improved organic revenue growth for both the fourth quarter and full year as anticipated in our outlook for the segment and would expect this level of performance to continue into 2015.","Slide 5 highlights the third topic; areas of investment. Aon has a unique and strong track record of developing innovative solutions to help solve problems and create differentiated value in response to specific client needs. Solid long-term operating performance, combined with expense discipline and strong free cash flow generation, continues to enable substantial investment in colleagues and capabilities around the globe.","A few examples include: in Risk Solutions, we're investing in client leadership with the firm-wide rollout of Aon Client Promise, a unified approach to client service across Aon to drive greater productivity and efficiency. We're investing in innovative technology such as the Global Risk Insight Platform. GRIP is the world's leading global database of risk and insurance placement information, now capturing nearly 2.4 million trades and a $119 billion of bound premium.","We continue to have a growing client list of more than 35 insurance carriers utilizing the platform, of which more than half have signed multi-year contracts. Existing client renewals have been very strong and an increasing number of clients are also adding strategic consulting services.","In addition, we're driving our Aon Broking initiative to better match client needs with insurer appetite for risk and to identify structured portfolio solutions. We're also investing in the continued development of data and analytics capability at Aon Benfield to strengthen an already industry-leading value proposition and client-serving capability.","A great example of this is Aon Benfield's review, a reinsurer dashboard and strategic consulting service to help reinsurers be more effective markets to seeding company clients. We continue to align our global health and benefits platform to capitalize on our global distribution channels and de-brokerage capabilities in an area that is high growth in nearly every region of the world.","And finally, we're expanding our footprint through tuck-in acquisitions that increased scale at emerging markets or expand capability to better serve clients. We completed 14 opportunistic acquisitions in 2014 for roughly 500 million, expanding multiple practice areas and geographies.","In HR Solutions, we're investing in innovations to address high-growth areas. We're expanding solutions to de-risk pension plans that support increasing needs for delegated investment solutions, which fulfill our clients' needs for faster execution of their investment strategies.","Aon Hewitt is able to offer a differentiated strategy based on our strong 3 pillars of actuarial expertise, investment solutions and pension administration. We're also providing a broader set of health, retirement, and talent advisory and advocacy solutions to our clients' employees and retirees to enable greater choice and improve decision-making.","As part of our comprehensive portfolio of health solutions, covering the full spectrum of benefit strategies and funding choices, we continue to make investments to support future growth and strengthen our industry-leading position in health exchanges for active employees and retirees.","During the quarter we delivered strong enrollment execution and excellent service experience for roughly 1.2 million employees and retirees, up 60% over the prior year, including the two largest employer transitions to the private exchange market in the industry.","Our active exchange model is bending the cost of health care of the clients having placed over 4 billion in health insurance premiums across the growing list of more than 30 national and regional carriers.","For clients returning to our active exchange the average cost increase was 2.6%, including administration fees and cost associated with the Affordable Care Act, which compares favorably to industry data, reflecting the average healthcare cost increase for self-insured large U.S. employers was approximately 5% to 8%.","Overall, our industry-leading portfolio of health solutions continues to drive strong client interest and demand with both exchange and bundled solutions that cover all clients segments and needs, in an evolving healthcare landscape.","We also continue to invest in our industry leading benefits administration solutions and consumer technology platforms, including extensive mobile solutions and cloud base outsourcing solutions for clients. And finally, we're expanding our international footprint to support a global work force with investments in key talent capabilities across emerging markets.","In summary, we delivered 23% growth in the fourth quarter highlighted by significant operational improvement in both segments and effective capital management for a strong finish to 2014. Looking forward, we expect continued improvement as we've positioned the firm for sustainable long-term growth, increased operating leverage, and significant free cash flow generation in 2015.","With that said, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Christa for further financial review. Christa?","Christa Davies","Thank you so much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg noted, our fourth quarter results reflected strong finish to the year with double-digit earnings growth highlighted by the strongest quarter of organic revenue growth in over a decade.","We had strong operating margin expansion in both segments and the repurchase of 500 million of ordinary shares. Validity flexibility combined with significant free cash flow generation has enabled the deployment of roughly $3 billion of capital in 2014 with a record $2.5 billion returned to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends. And roughly 500 million in acquisitions that are expected to drive future growth.","Now let me turn to the financial results for the quarter on Page 6 of the presentation. Our core EPS performance, excluding certain items, increased 23% to $1.89 per share for the fourth quarter compared to $1.54 in the prior year quarter. Results in the quarter reflect strong operational improvement, a lower effective tax rate and affective capital management. Certain items that were adjusted for in the core EPS performance and highlighted in the schedules on page 13 in the press release include non-cash intangible asset amortization, and certain expenses related to legacy liquidation assumed by us prior to 2005.","In addition, changes in foreign currency rates had a $0.06 unfavorable impact on EPS in the quarter, due primarily to a stronger dollar versus most currencies particularly the Euro. For 2014, a stronger dollar drove an estimated $39 million or $0.11 unfavorable impact on EPS. If currency to remain stable at today's rates, we would expect a similar impact in the full year 2015 as we saw in 2014, with the first quarter incurring the majority of the impact in retail brokerage due to a weaker Euro, while Q2 to Q4 should see no material impact year-over-year. We expect to drive further operational improvement and affectively allocate capital resulting in continued strong EPS growth in 2015.","Now let me talk about each of the segments on the next slide. In our Risk Solutions segments, organic revenue growth was 3%. Operating margin increased 110 basis points to 24.7%, and operating income increased 5% versus the prior year quarter. Results from the quarter reflect solid organic revenue growth and return on our investments in data and analytics such as GRIP and on broking.","Let me spend a moment on the Aon Hewitt restructuring program. Savings in the fourth quarter estimated at $25 million compared to $21 million in the prior year quarter. The AON Hewitt program is now complete. The program delivered total cumulative expense savings of $402 million, of which $99 million were in Risk Solutions.","In Q4 we delivered strong operating performance in Risk Solutions despite a significant unfavorable market impact in reinsurance and continued economic uncertainty in Europe. The 2014 Risk Solutions operating income grew 2% operating margins increased 40 basis points to 22.9% including a minus 30 basis point unfavorable impact from foreign currency translations. Excluding the impact from foreign currency underlying operating margin increased 70 basis points.","We are firmly on track for improved operating income performance in 2015 and further margin expansion towards our long term target of 26%. This is driven by the return on investments we have made giving us greater operating leverage in the business and expense discipline as we optimize our global cost structure in areas such as IT, real estate, global procurement and utilization of offshore capacity.","Turning to the HR Solutions segment; organic revenue growth was 10%. Operating margin increased 210 basis points to 23.5%, and operating income increased 19% versus the prior year quarter. Strong organic revenue growth in the quarter was partially offset $9 million anticipated unfavorable impact from certain expenses that were pushed from the prior quarter.","With respect to the Aon Hewitt restructuring program, savings in the fourth quarter are estimated approximately t $76 million compared to $73 million in the prior year quarter. Approximately $304 million of the total cumulative savings were achieved in HR Solutions.","As discussed previously, we provided guidance for Q4 to be up substantially in our seasonally strongest quarter driven by organic revenue growth in healthcare exchanges. We delivered a strong finish to the year as anticipated.","Further, for the full year operating income increased 7% and operating margin increased 40 basis points. This level of performance is exactly in line with our full year outlook for HR solutions segment of greater than mid-single-digit operating income growth and margin expansion.","As Greg noted, we made excellent progress in 2014 delivering on our financial goals that were laid out at the beginning of the year. Looking forward, we expect continued operational improvement in 2015 with quarterly [passing] or results similar to 2014, down in Q1, flat to modestly up in Q2 and Q3 and up substantially in Q4 in our seasonally strongest quarter.","Overall, we are firmly on track for improved performance with our long term target of 22% as we generate greater scale and improve return from investments.","Now let me discuss a few of the line items outside the operating segments on Slide 9. Unallocated expenses decreased $10 million to $44 million, driven by expense discipline in the current quarter and higher than normal expenses in the prior year quarter. Interest income was similar at $3 million. Interest expense increased $10 million due to an increase in total debt outstanding. Other income of $10 million included a $7 million gain due to the favorable impact of exchange rates on the re-measurement of assets and liabilities and non-functional currencies and gains on certain long-term investments.","Going forward, we expect a run rate of approximately $2 million per quarter of interest income, $45 million of unallocated expense and $68 million of interest expense per quarter.","Turning to taxes; the effective tax rate on net income from continuing operations was 19.6% compared to 24.2% in the prior year quarter. The effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2014 was favorably impacted by changes in the geographic distribution of income. The global effective tax rates for the full year were 18.9%. Lastly, average diluted shares outstanding decreased to 293.4 million in the fourth quarter compared to 311.4 million in the prior year quarter.","The company repurchased 5.4 million Class A ordinary shares for approximately $500 million in the fourth quarter. Actual shares outstanding on September 30 were 280 million, and there are approximately 9 million additional dilutive equivalents. Estimated Q1 2015 beginning dilutive share count is approximately 289 million, subject to share price movement, share issuance and share repurchase.","Further in the fourth quarter Aon plc's Board of Directors authorized a new $5 billion share repurchase program in addition to the existing share repurchase program previously authorized in April of 2012. For the full year the Company repurchased 25.8 million Class A ordinary shares for a record total of $2.25 billion. The Company has approximately 5.6 billion of remaining shares repurchase authorization.","Now let me turn to the next slide to highlight our strong balance sheet and cash flow on Page 10. At December 31, 2014, cash and short-term investments were $768 million. Total debt outstanding was approximately $5.6 billion, and total debt to EBITDA on a GAAP basis was 2.1 times compared to 2.3 times on September 30, 2014.","Cash flow from operations increased 1% to a record $1.6 billion, driven primarily by growth in net income and a decline in pension contributions offset by an unfavorable impact from timing of significant receivable collections in the prior year period. Free cash flow, as defined by cash flow from operations less CapEx, was roughly flat at $1.4 billion, reflecting higher cash flow from operations offset by a $27 million increase in CapEx. Looking forward, we expect significant free cash flow growth in 2015 driven by operational and working capital improvements uses of cash for pension and restructuring continuing to wind down and lower cash tax payments.","Turning to the next slide to discuss our significant financial flexibility; we value the firm based on free cash flow and allocate capital to maximize free cash flow returns. There are three primary areas that will contribute to our goal of doubling free cash flow to more than $2.3 billion annually by the end of 2017. From the graph in the presentation, based on current assumptions, we expect annual free cash flow to increase by over $650 million, based only on a reduction in cash used for pensions, restructuring and CapEx.","Combined with growth in our core business, further margin expansion and a reduction in the overall effective tax rate, we are well on track to achieve our expectations for substantial cash flow generation. Regarding our pension plans, reported liabilities on a GAAP basis increased to $2.1 billion at year-end 2014, reflecting a 90% funded status compared to a $1.6 billion at year end 2013 reflecting a 91% funded status driven primarily by a decline in discount rates.","Not reflected in those amounts however are $933 million of overfunded pension plans that are included in non-current assets in the balance sheet. Considered together, our net unfunded obligations are approximately $1.2 billion. Despite significant pressure from historically low interest rates the Company has taken significant steps to reduce volatility and liability as we've closed plans to new entrants, frozen plans from accruing additional benefits, and continue to de-risk certain plan assets. We currently expect contributions to decline by roughly $96 million to $220 million in 2015 and continue to decline thereafter. Additionally, non-cash pension expense with a modest benefit in 2014 and we expect pension expense to be a modest benefit in 2015.","Regarding our restructuring program, cash payments were $82 million in 2014. As all charges related to the restructuring program have now been incurred, we would expect cash payments to decline by $51 million to approximately $31 million in 2015, and continue to decline significantly each year thereafter.","In summary, for both the fourth quarter and full year we drove operational improvement across both segments and delivered double-digit earnings growth. In addition, we returned a record $2.5 billion of capital to shareholders in 2014 through 2.5 billion of share repurchase and dividends as well as the deployment of roughly $500 million of capital towards acquisitions that are expected to drive future growth. We expect strong earnings growth and significant free cash generation in 2015 as we've progressed towards our goal of generating more than $2.3 billion of free cash flow by the end of 2017. With a strong balance sheet and significant financial flexibility we have positioned the firm to significant shareholder value creation in 2015 and beyond.","With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Adam Klauber of William Blair.","Q - Adam Klauber","Good morning, everyone. Couple of different questions; one, how should we think about the margin on the health exchange as we go into 2015? As you mentioned, I think you have 1.2 million people on the exchange today. I would assume for that 1.2 million people you have already done, implementation costs and the service costs are much higher first year, so do those -- from margin perspective, do those 1.2 million people become more margin accretive in '15 versus '14?","Christa Davies","So, Adam, I would say healthcare exchanges, we made a modest loss in 2014 as you know. We'll continue to make progress in 2015, and I would describe it as an immaterial impact. We're really focused on our HR Solutions business and growing overall revenue growth as Greg described as mid single-digit revenue growth and continuing to grow operating income, and that's really the overall focus. And you should see the margin expansion towards 22% [ph] over time.","Q - Adam Klauber","Okay. And then, can you talk about -- I noticed you did a -- I think not a big deal, but another workday integrator in Europe, I think you bought the largest in the U.S. last year, that workday business, that's growing very rapidly. Is that part of your success in the -- growing your BPO outsource business? Could you discuss that a bit?","Christa Davies","Absolutely, Adam. So we have invested significantly in workday capability in our BPO business and it is driving substantial growth as you described. We brought the largest implementation firm in the U.S., in 2012, OmniPoint. And we just closed the acquisition Cloud, which is the largest implementation firm across Europe. And we're very excited about the growth prospects of that business and how it enables us to deliver that capability plans.","Q - Adam Klauber","Sorry, could you just go on to a bit of detail on that, I don't think everyone is familiar what workday does and why is that driving growth, just more specifically?","Christa Davies","Yes. I think the way we will describe the capability for larger than more sophisticated clients is it's a Software as a Service application as opposed to an on-premises application, and really the Software as a Service application enables clients to have much greater functionality. It's much lower cost. It's much easier to scale globally. And so, clients wanted to be more efficient and provide much greater analytics around the HR function.","Q - Adam Klauber","Okay. And then finally, how is the pipeline for the pension transfer business?","Greg Case","Adam, it's actually been quite strong. If you think about what our clients are going through right now with the regulatory changes and challenges and general state of pensions on the world today, you can imagine it's a very substantial area of concern and interest for clients. And so as such we've been fortunate we've led a number of the situations that have actually been completely in the last 18 months, and we are continuing to do that. And really this is one of the contributor that drives overall consulting business that has actually progressed very, very well as you've seen in the results.","Q - Adam Klauber","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is Sarah DeWitt of JPMorgan.","Sarah DeWitt","Low to mid single-digit organic growth in 2015, but P&C prices fall and we don't get much of a pick up in the global economy, to what extend do you think you can still achieve that and grow margin?","Greg Case","So Sarah, you were cut off at the beginning, but I think you're asking the question, just correct me, we grew top line and we grew margin in '14, there is lot of pricing pressure, can we still do it in '15? Am I paraphrasing where you were?","Sarah DeWitt","Right, and what to extend is your low -- can you still achieve your low to mid single-digit organic growth target in '15?","Greg Case","Right. So top line, we're very comfortable and confident we're going to continue the low to mid single-digit growth in 2015. If you step back and think about it, with the insight platform, the global risk insight platform, we capture exactly what happens across our book. And what you've actually seen is a reduction in price as you described, offset by a modest improvement or increase in exposure, that's roughly flat overall. That's what we've seen. We think it will trend toward that.","And with more pressure on the reinsurance side, that's offset quite substantially by efforts we've undertaken in the business to grow the business, both fundamentally with Aon Client Promise, but also with the investments we're making in data and analytics. And you are actually seeing that show through in almost every situation.","Our new business is literally a record level of new business in the U.S. Never been achieved before and actually it patterns us very well for 2015, and really is a reflection of the underlying investments that the team has made over the last number of years in the business.","So we're very, very comfortable. If you think about sort of progress over the last number of years, there's always been some version of a headwind out there and there will be in 2015, but we're quite confident we can move through that and grow the business and improve margin.","Sarah DeWitt","Okay, thanks. And then on the pension, I heard your comments, but I still don't understand why are the future pension cash contributions decreasing when the liability on the balance sheet increased?","Christa Davies","Yes, really because of a lot of moves we've made, Sarah, over the last five to seven years; we have frozen the plans, we've closed them, we decreased the benefits, and we continue to de-risk certain plan assets. And so that means that the cash contributions are really much more stable and on a path of decline, then they would otherwise be if we hadn't taken those steps.","The other thing I would say, which I mentioned earlier is there is an overfunded asset in other assets of approximately 900 million, and if you add that to the minus 2.1 unfunded liability, you get a net of 1.2 billion, which is fairly sort of similar to last year of about 1.05 billion.","Sarah DeWitt","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is Dave Styblo of Jefferies.","Dave Styblo","Sure. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions; I just want to start out a little bit more on the FX headwinds and how you guys think about that for '15? I guess my understanding is that the stronger dollar against your British pound or Rupee are actually positive, and how much does that help mitigate currency pressure against the other currencies out there? And I guess the short one I'm trying to get to sense of how much of an EPS headwind are you expecting in '15 from the net\u2026","Christa Davies","Yes. Dave, your question is absolutely right. We have a positive impact from the Rupee and Pounds and then a negative impact really from most other currencies. And really what I said earlier is the total impact of 2014 was $39 million negative or about a $0.11 unfavorable impact on EPS for the full year 2014. We would expect a very similar total impact for 2015 entirely in Q1, and the Q2 to Q4 impact is essentially zero. And that's really where that positive impact from the Rupee and Pound offsets negative impact from other currencies. Does that make sense?","Dave Styblo","Sure, that does. Thanks. Sorry, I missed that earlier; I was hoping across. Shifting gears over the reinsurance side here; I won't name names, but one of your competitors who are also having to report today also have strong organic growth of 3% to 4% in both retail and reinsurance brokerage businesses; I mean just wondering what do we need to take from that? Are you guys seeing something in a market broadly that's making it easier to sell into the market or some of the pressures abating, what are you broadly seeing, and are we just in a sweet spot at this point?","Greg Case","Well, David, if you step back and think about, first, fundamentally there continues to be exceptional demand out there to improve fundamental insurers' performance. That's what the reinsurance world is all about, perhaps to be a tremendous amount of capital chasing that. And that's what's been discussed and talked about with more capital of 575 billion underpinning the industry right now. That's the greatest level that it's ever been with more set up on the horizon.","Having said that, when you think about the product; it's become less expensive, we are seeing actually insurers point different ways to buy increasing amounts; that's one piece. The second piece is if you think about Aon Benfield's level of investment and content capability over the last number of years, it's been expensive. And with that, we are actually bringing capital to different solutions. So what we did in the mortgage industry is an area of growth. What we've done in the life world is another area of growth, and essentially if you think about Aon Benfield, we believe it's the best in the world with matching capital with fundamental demand around risk in different categories around the world. And what you're seeing is a bit of reflection of that. I would say, again, back on the new business front, it's one of the strongest quarters in years we've had. It's been a long, long time, our new business generation. And we're just doing more to the existing clients we have as well.","So from our standpoint, our capability and financial strength to invest behind this business and data and analytics fundamentally we believe will frankly separate us from what others can do in the space, and we think clients value that and are going to utilize and put their benefit and pay for.","Dave Styblo","Okay. And then last if I can sneak one in on the exchanges; you guys did mentioned your 2.6% increase for clients returning and other competitor is pretty low in that range, and these the impressive results and I'm just wondering how much of this is resonating with potential clients that you are talking to? Are you starting to see any sort of inflection point as we're going forward and selling for the 2016 sales cycle? What are the conversations looking like at this point?","Greg Case","Dave, it really reflects overall -- first of all, the team just did a phenomenal job in 2014. Again, we got 1.2 million enrolled. I want to emphasize enrolled lives on our exchanges versus eligible, as you think about it. When you consider, it's really -- for us as we've seen from a cost standpoint at 200 to 500 basis point change against a comparable plan design; that's our 2.6 versus the industry's 5.8. By the way, that's against a fully insured answer. That means volatility is next to zero versus a much more expensive and much more volatile answer.","So you can imagine that's one of the reasons, that plus by the way, 87% individual employee satisfaction is one of the reasons why we've had a 100% retention on the exchange, and why as other companies look at it, they're seeing a highly viable option for them. So we've had very robust and active set of conversations with the pipeline. We're excited about the continued progress of this aspect of what we do in health, we do a lot of other things too with this aspect; and we are looking forward to 2015 and 2016 as we continue to expand exchanges.","Dave Styblo","Okay, thanks for the questions.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is Brian Meredith of UBS.","Brian Meredith","Yes. Good morning, everybody, a couple of questions here; first, Christa, I'm wondering if you could break out for us a little bit the growth that you saw in the outsourcing, I know part was BPO, part, obviously healthcare exchanges, anyway can you give us a sense of how much of that was related to the BPO, and is that BPO revenue kind of continuing? My thoughts are those are for the longer term contracts, right?","Christa Davies","Yes, I mean I would say we had growth across the outsourcing business brand. We had growth in BPO. We had growth in our traditional benefits administration business and we had growth in healthcare exchanges. And I don't want to over rotate on healthcare exchanges. I think while it's an incredible business for us and we're incredibly proud of the progress we made this year. We've also had great performance at our benefits administration and our BPO business. We don't actually break them out, Brian, but while the healthcare exchange growth year-over-year is also the highest it's the smallest of those three businesses too. So -- they're all growing to get to that total outsourcing growth number.","Brian Meredith","So is it fair to say the contribution for the BPO kind of the year-over-year growth of 13% -- actually 15% organic that was a big part of this, just a pick up there?","Christa Davies","I would actually say the BPO contribution to overall outsourcing growth for the year was modest. And I would say -- but it came from all over, Brian, it came from BPO, it came from Ben admin, and it came from healthcare centers.","Brian Meredith","Great, great thanks. And then on healthcare exchanges as well, can you give us a sense of what the pipeline looks like right now for potential new signees coming into the fourth quarter of 2015? Are we seeing a pickup in interest levels this year?","Greg Case","Brian, revenue -- I had said it in substantial number of conversations and dialogs, we feel very good about the pipeline and the progress we're making. As we've described, the outcome for the last few years where clients have been on -- it's just been exceptionally strong as I mentioned before to one of the other questions. Literally, we're seeing cost savings -- truly bending the curve the cost curve here. That's a level of 200 to 500 basis points which is exceptional and then when you combine that with the idea that this is not just reduction but it's also in price, but a reduction of volatility and so these are fully insured outcomes with clients set our individual employee sat at 87% plus that's been very, very strong. In assets we got three years with the data that we're looking to on behalf of clients and so you could imagine against that backdrop the interest is actually quite strong.","Brian Meredith","Right and then just lastly, on the reach the insurance growth in the quarter -- how much was period now they can be kind of lumpy?","Greg Case","You captured it very well. Obviously the capital markets transactions are achieved in both -- in capital markets also in fact another just had an exceptionally strong quarter that was a big piece of it. But I also want to emphasize the new business story here is exceptionally strong. It's one of the business strongest new business generation periods ramp until history of 5 consecutive quarters of new business generation. But we ended the year with a lot of momentum in that category. So it was really a combination but certainly reflects the lumpiness as you described on capital markets.","Brian Meredith","So would you say most of that was that?","Greg Case","No, I would say substantial now for Q4 result.","Brian Meredith","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is Ryan Burns with Janney Capital.","Ryan Burns","Great. Good morning, everybody. I'm not sure I may have missed it earlier, but did you guys give any sort of guidance for adjusted income in the HR Solutions segment. I know you gave kind of margin in quarterly basis. But just want to see if you had any guidance for the operating -- sorry adjusted income?","Christa Davies","What I did say Ryan was that we expect revenue growth of mid single-digits for the HR Solutions business in 2015. We expect operating income to continue to grow so we expect growth in operating income and growth in margins in 2015. And we expect to pattern very similar to 2014; with operating income down in Q1 flat to modestly up in Q2 and Q3 and substantially up in Q4 which is our seasonally strongest quarter.","Greg Case","2014 was a level on year of progress we see 2015 exactly the same way.","Ryan Burns","Great. Thanks for that color. And then just my last one is -- obviously the payout ratio this year if I do dividends plus buybacks, it get around 150% of operating earnings; and I realize there's roughly $300 million of excess cash heading into the quarter or into the year. Just want to think about or just get your ideas as to how we should about that going forward?","Christa Davies","Yes, I mean the way we think about capital allocation Ryan is really around return on capital on a cash on cash basis. And we did deploy substantial amount $2.25 billion of into share repurchase because we believe was substantially undervalued today as we look at our own discounted cash flow view of the firm. And that's why are deploying much more capital on share purchase versus dividends. And so that's the way -- you should think about that forward. As we think at the total amount of capital we might -- deploy our return to shareholders in 2015 if we looked at the 2014 -- if you looked at free cash flow growth of -- 1.4 billion and in 2014 we'll continue to grow free cash flow in 2015. As free cash flow grows there is opportunity for incremental leverage. And maybe unproductive capital and then that results in the cash that we can return to shareholders and continue to look at that on a return on capital basis to the highest return n capital opportunities.","Ryan Burns","Great, thanks for answers, guys.","Operator","Thank you next question is Jay Cohen, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jay Cohen","Yes, thank you. Looking forward, one of the sources of I guess additional cash that you say is a lower tax rate and I don't know if you were talking about 2012 forward or from today forward? Do you expect the tax rate to go down more from where it is now?","Christa Davies","Jay, we think the 18.9% tax rate for 2014 is the right operational rate going forward. What we would say is that as you think about the cash flow growth over time the cash tax is likely to be lower in 2015 because there are often timing differences between the effective tax rate saw in 2014 and cash taxes.","Jay Cohen","Okay. I think you can't really quantify that?","Christa Davies","No.","Jay Cohen","Okay, but the tax rate on a reported basis should be similar or relatively equal?","Christa Davies","Right. Yes.","Greg Case","Eventually -- it evens out. There are just say timing in such transitions\u2026","Jay Cohen","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is Mike Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs.","Michael Nannizzi","Thank you, I guess one question that i had was on the pension expense and the impact of lower interest rate I saw in your presentation that you have the cash proceeds to pension declining, and so just trying to reconcile that I'm guessing there is some risking -- continuity risking activities that you undertook in the year to maybe offset some of the impacts of that but love to get more color. Thanks.","Christa Davies","Yes, and Mike we did say on pension expense. Pension expense was a modest benefit in 2014 and we expect it to be a modest benefit in 2015 again. And absolutely right market is due to the fact that we've taken substantial actions over multiple years. We froze the plans, we close them, we've de-risked the certain plan assets over time as you described, and all those things have led to lower cash contributions and sustained and pension expense being a modest benefit again in '15.","Michael Nannizzi","Got it. And then if I could just one on the exchanges is it possible now I mean we're couple of years in to the cycle and probably have better handle on -- the economics in the build out of the platform, is it possible to get an idea of how you think about the operating leverage that you get from 8customer being a traditional benefit customer versus on exchange -- how do you think about the return how do you think about the -- the drivers of whether its contribution margin or operating margin obviously there's a lot of expenses still so you've -- that net margin number probably still looks similar to the other business. But just trying to get an idea of underneath once you've factored out the platform investments how shall we think of how're they thinking about the one versus the other and the operating leverage of one versus the other? Thanks.","Christa Davies","Yes, and so, Mike, the way we think about it is return on capital unsurprisingly, and really when we made the initial investment in exchanges both in active in retiree we thought about our return on capital basis cash-on-cash. And you're absolutely right process; the investments are substantial in both operating expense people as well as the technology platform. And we are still investing as you know because we made a lot of an exchange in 2014. And what I would say is we do expect the return on capital of our investment to be substantially superior to the rest of our business which is why we invested so much in that area. And so we do expect it to have higher than average returns because -- the fixed cost are largely fixed and as we continue to get scale we'll get disproportionate returns on those incremental lives and clients.","Greg Case","Of course I do -- exactly the same way we looked at the other organic investment substantial across the firm, and what we've done in data and analytics across the insights platform is the exact same approach. Ultimately, we are making use of assets because they -- we believe we will serve clients fundamentally better. That absolutely has to be in place. And that certainly is in place for the exchanges but they also have to give us greater operating leverage. And so we're essentially investing cash flow back into the business to create greater operating leverage and that's in fact what the exchanges are doing -- that's what data analytics has done. That's the risk insight platform is doing. That's what U.S. is going to do, et cetera, et cetera. So that's the philosophy; everything you see us do sort of follows that same track.","Michael Nannizzi","Got it. When we think about timing, if we were to quarantine the revenues and expansions from exchanges and put those aside, because you're basically flat, it sound like. Then the margins on the rest of the business are expanding more than the segment, margins would indicate. And then at some point that investment that you are making is going to result in margins as well. So just trying to think about, like, what's the timing of that, and when -- because once we switch flips I mean that we should start to see that in margins\u2026","Christa Davies","Yes, and Mike, you are absolutely right about that, because we also achieved margin expansion and operating income growth in '14, which we did in HR Solutions. We are continuing to invest and make lots in exchanges. Then you are absolutely right, the rest of the business is expanding margins and growing operating income growth substantially. So that is absolutely true.","And then we would say as we look at exchanges, it is a long-term investment or a long-term return, and we would expect that to happen over a multi-year period of time.","Greg Case","And again, if I could I would broaden this is as a broader firm; if you think back philosophically to the question earlier on the call, which is, \"Can we grow in 2015 and gets more headwinds?\" Answer is we've grown every year and increased profitability and increased margin, and invested heavily in the business. And part of the reason we're confident in our continued progress against whatever headwinds are out there are these specific types of investments, because as they come online and create operating leverage for us, that's really what's going to fuel bottom line.","By the way if the headwinds went away, that would be magnified, but irrespective of the headwinds, these investments, in exchanges, in risk insight platform, in ReView, in additional data and analytics, in the Singapore Innovation Center, in the Irish Innovation Center; these types of things give us operating leverage we believe is unique to the industry.","Michael Nannizzi","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is Charles Sebaski, BMO Capital Markets.","Charles Sebaski","Good morning. Thank you. I guess the first question I have, Greg, is on the healthcare exchange, and the cost save that you talked about -- the 2.6% rate increase. I guess, if I go back to a press release you guys put out in November talking about the healthcare exchanges and the increasing costs, that document said that the 18 returning customers to the healthcare exchange actually saw a 5.3% rate increase anticipated for 2015 versus the 2.6%. And I'm just wondering how you can help us rectify that?","Greg Case","Great. So, literally as were talking about, we were talking about the total set of companies online and what we see coming in, and in two-year average for the company, so I think we're little bit apples and oranges. What I was trying to do is give you the latest and greatest hot off the presses, what exactly is going on in the market and what we are seeing. I guess the overall market trend and what we are seeing; and so that's the 200 to 500 basis points.","You still come back and essentially say, you're getting fundamental cost save in a substantial way; again, 200, 300, 400, 500 basis points cost save and no volatility, because it's fully insured versus self-insured, plus the client sat that I described before, that could be employee sat. So from our standpoint we feel very, very good about and we are trying to give the latest and greatest sort of what's going on in the market.","Charles Sebaski","All right. . Give a little update on M&A, both forward, but also what happened in 2014? You made $500 million of acquisitions in the year. But when I look at the revenue detail for the Company, it was kind of zero for the year on revenue impact. And so, I guess, in this $500 million you bought, what's the acquired revenue base? Where should we see that come up in dollars, or should it all be in 2015? And then, what's your expectation for the upcoming year?","Christa Davies","Yes. So you are absolutely are, Charles, we spent about 500 million on acquisitions in 2014. We invested in a number of geographies, the U.S., the U.K., the Pacific region and a number of specific capability areas, National Flood Services and LARK [ph] employee benefits being two great ones. The majority of these acquisitions were in our Risk Solution business.","The thing I would say is as you look at the mix on M&A, it's mix of acquisitions and divestitures, because there were some divestitures during the year too as we continue to optimize our portfolio around return on capital. And what I would say is these are terrific capabilities. They are unbelievable teams. They really place the teams in the capability sub front and they will generate great returns in the long-term.","Charles Sebaski","Okay. But will they show up? Is it a capability that helps your current Business grow, as opposed to net new revenue where we would see in an acquisition line?","Greg Case","A lot of these are tuck-in acquisitions that are impacting the overall business. You're going to start to see them in top line. You will also see them with existing business we've got, magnifying and expand that business. So it will be a combination of both. The investments of 500 million or so investments in '14, you're going to certainly see in '15. A lot of it depends on timing when they come in.","You are going to see us still continuing to make in the order of 200, 300, $400 million of acquisitions per year, where we can build content capability, and we've been doing that quite well.","Charles Sebaski","And then finally, one of your initiatives that you mentioned is the global consulting initiative that you mentioned, Greg; and I believe this is more of a management consulting initiative for insurance companies?","Greg Case","Yes, what I would, it wasn't really broad-based consulting. In essence, what the team is doing is really a step-forward is they brought very, very unique data and analytics capability to bear on behalf of our insurance clients, much likely we've done with insights platform. And they not only brought what's called ReView. They not only brought that to bear. They also offered around that some wide space services to actually not only help and provide new insights, because essentially we're matching capital with client need, and they are doing that for at the reinsurance level now. But in addition to this, the fundamental raw analytics, they're also bringing an element around advice. And a number of clients have really valued that. And so that's an added component.","Our view is data is interesting; a lot of people have it, we happen to have a tremendous amount, but data is basically work loss and that's what actually changes client behavior. That client behavior has got to drive performance and things like operating performance, balance sheet strengthening and reduction of volatility, and the way to help clients do that is to add some components around advice to it. So that's really the nuance that we wanted to try to convey.","Charles Sebaski","So, that won't be a stand-alone product within risk that might -- it's part of the overall value proposition, as opposed to a new stand-alone group within the risk organization?","Greg Case","It is going to be -- its part of what we are doing in terms of something we bring to bear on behalf of our reinsurance clients. So in that regard, it is capability that we are continuing to develop. It's actually gone through a tremendous start with lots of interest in demand in the marketplace. And so you will see it's part of our overall Aon Benfield offering.","Charles Sebaski","What's the size of that? How many people are dedicated things providing the service today?","Greg Case","Well, we haven't disclosed that, but if you take a step back and think about the capability of Aon Benfield, we spent over a 100 million in year in content, data and analytics with literally -- it's better part of 400 to 500 colleagues involved and dedicated to that. Again, back to the idea of how we create operating leverage in the business. This is just one more important, albeit, one more important step as we continue to build up that capability.","Charles Sebaski","Could you explain the legal settlement in risk for $35 million in the quarter?","Christa Davies","So that what a legacy litigation of liability we incurred as part of 2005, and a decision was made in the court against the expense incurred.","Charles Sebaski","Thank you very much for all the answers.","Greg Case","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from Arash Soleimani of KBW.","Arash Soleimani","Thanks. Good morning, I just have a couple of questions; I know you mentioned the impacts of organic growth -- reinsurance organic growth coming from capital market; is there anyway to quantify the margin impact in risk solutions from capital markets this quarter?","Greg Case","We don't really break that out as we said before; it's a tremendously positive business for our clients and for us. We lead the market in it. It is something that we've built over the last number of years, it's exceptional strong and particularly lumpy, sort of up and down across the quarters and it was quite strong in the quarter.","Arash Soleimani","And was any of the lumpiness attributable to just timing differences, working capital markets?","Christa Davies","No.","Arash Soleimani","Okay. And my other question was in terms of the FX impacts, I know you quantified it on the income statement in the press release; how does that flow-through on the cash flow statement?","Christa Davies","I mean it's really flowing through net income, but it's hitting operating income, as I've described. It's basically $31 million lower in operating income and Risk Solutions is the way you should think about it. But I would say that if you listened to what we said, we said it's going to be the same FX impact overall in operating income and EPS impact in full year '15 as we saw in full year '14. And against that headwind in 2014, we grew EPS 17%. And so we feel really good about our ability to grow earnings substantially in '15 and grow cash flow substantially in '15, despite the headwinds.","Greg Case","In many respects FX has come up quite naturally two times on the call, it is a headwind as Christa described we will work through it and have it very, very effectively just like pricing was the headwind just like in interest rates or headwind et cetera; all these things are out there. Our ability to grow top line and improve margin in the phase of that, we believe is pretty proven and with the organic investments we've made or increased operating leverage, we think bodes very well for 2015.","Arash Soleimani","Okay, thank you for the answers.","Operator","Thank you. I would like to turn the call back over to Greg Case for closing remarks.","Greg Case","I just want say thanks to everybody for joining the call, and look forward to our discussion next quarter. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you for your participation. That does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect at this time."],"1829":["Aon Corporation (NYSE:AON) Q1 2014 Earnings Conference Call April 25, 2014  8:30 AM ET","Executives","","Greg Case - President & CEO","Christa Davies - CFO","","Analysts","","Brian Meredith - UBS","Adam Klauber - William Blair","Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee","Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill","Elyse Greenspan - Wells Fargo","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs","Jay Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Meyer Shields - KBW","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley","Charles Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets","","","Operator","","Good morning and thank you for holding. Welcome to Aon Plc\u2019s First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions). I would also like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded and that it is important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements that are forward looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from statements that are subject to certain risk and those that are anticipated information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in press release covering our first quarter results, as well as have been posted to our website.","Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, President and CEO of Aon plc.","Greg Case","","Thanks very much and good morning everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2014 conference call. Joining me here today is our CFO, Christa Davies. Consistent with previous quarters, I'd like to cover three areas before turning the call over to Christa for further financial review. I would note that there are slides available on our website for you to follow along with our commentary today.","First is our performance against key metrics we communicate to shareholders. Second is overall organic growth performance. and third is continued areas of strategic investment across Aon.","On the first topic, our performance versus key metrics. Each quarter, we measure our performance against the four metrics we focus on achieving over the course of the year, grow organically, expand margins, increase earnings per share and deliver free cash flow growth.","Turning to Slide 3. In the first quarter, organic revenue growth was 2% overall, driven by solid growth across Risk Solutions. Operating margin increase 30 basis points primarily reflecting strong margin improvement in our Risk Solution segment. EPS increased 15% or $1.28 reflecting strong operating performance, a lower effective tax rate and effective capital management.","And last free cash flow decreased 60 million in our seasonally weakest quarter as solid underlying performance was more than offset by timing of certain payments in the quarter.","Overall our results reflected solid start to the year driven by strong performance in Risk Solutions and double digit earnings growth. As we invest in innovative solutions and strength our industry-leading platform the long term growth, strong free cash flow generation and increased financial flexibility. We\u2019re returning a record amount of capital to shareholders highlighted by the repurchase of 600 million of ordinary shares in the quarter and the recently announced 43% increase in our quarterly cash dividend.","Turning to slide 4, on the second topic of growth, I want to spend the next few minutes discussing the quarter the growth of our segments. In Risk Solutions, organic revenue growth was 3% reflecting solid growth across all businesses. As we have discussed previously we\u2019re driving a set of initiatives that are strengthening underlying performance and positioning our risk solution segment for long term growth and improved operating leverage. With management of our renewal booked through client promises and retention rates of more than 90% on average highlighting strong client satisfaction in retail brokerage.","New business generation of more than 240 million across our retail business with double digit new business growth in many markets globally across Latin America, Asia and the EMEA region. Investments in innovative technology and service capabilities with the growth of GRIP and Aon Broking deliver increased operating leverage and in our core treaty reinsurance business net new business trends have now been positive for 12 consecutive quarters or three full years, a truly outstanding performance reflecting Aon Benfield's long-term value proposition for clients.","Reflecting on the individual businesses within Risk Solutions, in the Americas, organic revenue growth was 4% a solid performance to strike despite a strong comparable in the prior year quarter. Exposures continue to be relatively stable across the region and the impacts from pricing was modestly positive on average reflecting a steady pace of market impact. We saw growth across all regions, U.S, retail, Latin America and Canada including growth across all businesses, property casualty, health and benefits and Affinity.","In U.S. retail growth was driven by solidly business generation while strong management of the renewal portfolio drove growth in Latin America and Canada. In International organic revenue growth was 3%, exposures continue to be stable and the impacts on pricing was modestly negative on average driven by continuous softness in many regions across Europe.","Results reflect strong growth across emerging markets in Asia with solid growth in number of other markets, New Zealand, Germany and France to name a few. In Continental Europe with leadership positions across this region we continue to deliver solid growth against the same economic and market headwinds driven by strong management of our renewable portfolio and new business generation in a number of countries.","Well macroeconomic conditions still remain relatively fragile across many core markets; we\u2019re seeing signs of economic stabilization in this region. In reinsurance, organic revenue growth was 3% compared to 1% in the prior year quarter. Results were a bit stronger than anticipated driven by solid growth in (indiscernible) replacements and capital markets transaction advisory services which tend to be lumpy quarter-to-quarter.","In treaty as mentioned before net new business won was positive for the 12th consecutive quarter offset by an anticipated unfavorable market impact. As we have previously noted record capacity continues to be available to meet demand and cedents are retaining more risk, driving expected negative market most notably in the U.S. Absent in an event in the industry, macro factors will continue to be a headwind in the balance of 2014.","Against those headwinds, we expect our results to reflect flat to modest growth for the full year highlighted by continued positive net new business trends and growth at our capital markets and advisory transactions business.","Overall, this level of performance and strength in new business generation reflects Aon Benfield's unmatched level of investment and long-term value proposition for clients, while strengthening operational performance and reducing volatility through unmatched data, analytics and advisory capability.","Turning to HR Solutions, overall, organic revenue growth was 1% similar to the prior year quarter with modest growth across both consulting and outsourcing. Underlying performance in the first quarter reflects growth in areas where we\u2019re making investments in the business, including HR BPO, investment consulting and delegated investment solutions. These investments reflect Aon Hewitt's client leadership, understanding an influence of market trends and the long-term issues that face our clients as health care reform, health care costs and the associated financial risks continue to rise unchecked at a time when overall health and wellness is not improving; multinational clients are increasingly looking for global benefit solutions that support their global organizations, delivered at a local level.","Managing and transferring risk across and against pension schemes that are increasingly frozen and largely underfunded.","Turning to the individual businesses within HR Solutions. In Consulting Services, organic revenue growth was 1% similar to the prior year quarter. Underlying results reflect solid growth in compensation consulting and across our retirement business for investment consulting and delegated pension management services.","Despite continued economic weakness in Continental Europe we\u2019re capitalizing on high demand areas for our clients around the globe on the effective regulatory changes in the retirement space and the increased IPO market activity and mergers and acquisitions.","Results in the quarter include an anticipated unfavorable timing of revenue in compensation consulting, that will be recognized in the second half of the year. For the full year we continue to expect low to mid-single digit organic growth across consulting services. In Outsourcing, organic revenue growth was 1% similar to the prior year quarter. We saw modest growth in HR BPO driven by new client wins and in benefits administration we saw modest growth driven by demand for discretionary services, partially offset by certain client losses that have become less of a headwind throughout 2014.","For the full year we would expect stronger organic growth in outsourcing, we\u2019re taking into consideration of seasonality of revenue recognition in the health exchanges.","Slide 5 highlights the third topic, areas of investment. Aon has a unique position and strong track record of developing innovative solutions to help solve problems that create differentiated value and response to specific client needs.","Solid long-term operating performance combined with expense discipline and strong free cash flow generation continues to enable substantial investment in colleagues and capabilities around the globe. A few examples include, in Risk Solutions, we're investing in client leadership with the international rollout of the Revenue Engine and Client Promise to drive greater productivity and efficiency. We're investing in innovative technology, such as the Global Risk Insight Platform. GRIP is the world's leading global database of risk and insurance placement information, now capturing over 2 million trades and over a $100 billion of bound premium. We continue to have a growing client list of insurance carriers utilizing the platform for its analytics and services capabilities.","In addition, we're driving our Aon Broking initiative to better match client needs with insurer appetite for risk, as highlighted by our ability to package similar risks and place substantial programs and facilities into the market on behalf of clients. Our sidecar facility with Berkshire Hathaway was a first to market solution in this area. The ability to accurately match clients with the right sources of capacity is becoming increasingly important with the growing contribution of third party capital in the market.","And we continue to align our global health and benefits platform to better capitalize on our global distribution channel and the brokerage capability. And we\u2019re investing in further development of data and analytics capability at Aon Benfield to strengthen our already industry-leading, client-serving capability.","A great example of this is our Impact Forecasting Center, the only catastrophe modeling center integrated slowly into a global reinsurance broker which enabled us to provide real time information on catastrophic events and analyze the financial locations for our clients as incidents unfold.","And finally we\u2019re expanding our footprint through tuck-in acquisitions that either increase scale in emerging markets or expand capability to better serve clients. In HR Solutions, we continue to invest in innovative solutions and high growth areas. We\u2019re expanding solutions to derisk pension plans and are seeing tremendous growth in our delegated investment solutions which will fulfill our clients\u2019 needs for faster execution of their investment strategies.","These investment solutions are also helping us expand our services and other asset pools such endowments, foundations and insurance companies. We\u2019re also providing a broader set of advisory and advocacy solutions to our clients' employees to enable greater choice and improve decision making on their retirement options especially important is regulatory changes around the world require more involvement from individuals.","We continue to make significant investments to support future growth and strengthen our industry leading position in health exchanges through active employees and retirees. As part of our comprehensive portfolio of health solutions covering the full spectrum of benefit strategies. Nearly 1 million employees, retirees and their eligible dependents will serve through Aon suite of health exchanges for coverage in 2014.","The clients on our active exchange, the average cost increase in fully insured premium for 2014 was 5.1% including fees associated with the Affordable Care Act which compares favorably to industry data reflect in the average healthcare cost increase for large U.S. employers for comparable plan designs which was approximately 6% to 8%, an outstanding result as not only benefiting and bending the cost curve for healthcare for clients but eliminating the volatility previously associated with our self-insured medical plans.","Equally important, client satisfaction through the enrollment period was outstanding with 87% of employees have been likely the ability to choose among multiple carriers with great transparency and comparable information. Overall our pipeline of total (indiscernible) we expect enroll in 2014 continues to grow and we look forward to updating you on our progress later this year when our primary sale cycle has ended. We also continue to invest in our industry leading benefits and administration solutions, technology platforms including expenses mobile solutions in cloud based outsourcing solutions.","And finally with strength in our international footprint to support our global workforce with investments in key talent and capability across emerging markets.","In summary, we delivered organic revenue growth across both segments. Expanded margin while continuing to make strategic investments that will drive greater long term growth and operating leverage and deliver double digit earnings growth as well as a returning record levels of capital to our shareholders.","Moving forward we are firmly on track to improve the operational performance, and significantly increase financial strength in 2014. With that said I\u2019m now pleased to turn the call over to Christa for further financial review. Christa?","Christa Davies","Thanks so much Greg and good morning everyone. As Greg noted our first quarter results reflect a solid start to the year with strong operational performance and effective allocation of capital highlighted by the repurchase of 600 million of ordinary shares in the quarter. I would note this is more share repurchase than we have done in any quarter since 2008.","Now let me turn to financial results for the quarter on page 6 of the presentation. Our core EPS performance excluding non-cash intangible asset amortization increased 15% to a $1.28 per share for the first quarter compared to a $1.11 in the prior year quarter.","Results from the quarter reflect strong operating performance in our risk solution segment, a lower effective tax rate and effective capital management. Lastly foreign currency translation had no material impact on EPS in the quarter. Its currency were to remain stable at today's rates, we would expect a modest unfavorable impact in each quarter for the rest of 2014.","Now let me talk about each of the segments on the next slide. In our Risk Solutions segment, organic revenue growth was 3%, operating margin increased 110 basis points to 23.6%, and operating income increased 6% versus the prior year quarter. Margin expansion in the quarter was driven by organic growth across all major businesses, $11 million of restructuring savings and underlying expense discipline.","Let me spend a moment on the formal restructuring programs, key initiatives that have enabled in concurrent funding of investments and long-term structural margin expansion. Under the Aon Hewitt program, approximately $99 million of estimated savings will be achieved in Risk Solutions. Approximately $80 million of the cumulative savings have been achieved under the program to-date, with the remaining $19 million to be achieved by the end of 2014. We have incurred a 100% of the charges necessary to deliver the remaining savings. ","In Q1, we delivered solid underlying operating performance in Risk Solutions, despite continued economic uncertainty in a number of regions around the globe and an unfavorable market impact in reinsurance placing us firmly on track for margin expansion for the full year and continued progress towards our long term target of 26%.","Turning to the HR Solution segment, organic revenue growth was 1%, operating margin decreased a 100 basis points to 13.3% and operating income decreased 6% both at the prior year quarter. Modest organic revenue growth and restructuring savings from the quarter were more than offset by an increase in expense to support our future growth in our healthcare exchange business and as Greg previously described an anticipated unfavorable impact from timing of certain revenue in our consulting business.","Our first quarter results were exactly in-line with expectations and management\u2019s guidance previously provided to the HR Solutions business. With respect to the Aon Hewitt\u2019s restructuring program approximately $280 million of the $303 million in total cumulative savings has been achieved under the program, with the remaining $23 million to be achieved by the end of 2014.","As discussed in the previous quarter we provided commentary regarding the outlook for HR Solution segment in 2014 and that outlook is unchanged. For HR Solutions in 2014 we expect to number one deliver organic growth, number two, generate greater scale and improve returns from investments. Number three; deliver remaining savings related to the restructuring program. And number four deliver greater than mid-single digit operating income growth and further margin expansion towards our long term target of 22% with the patenting unchanged, down in the first half both Q1 and Q2 and up in the second half flat in Q3 and up substantially in Q4.","Now let me discuss a few of the line items outside of the operating segments on slide 9, unallocated expenses increased $2 million to $43 million reflecting an increase in long term employee incentive compensation programs. Interest income increased $1 million to $2 million. Interest expense increased $6 million due to an increase in total debt outstanding and cost associated with certain derivative hedging programs. Other income of $1 million primarily includes gains on certain long term investments.","Going forward we expect the run-rate of approximately a $1 million per quarter of interest income, $45 million of unallocated expense and $60 million of interest expense per quarter. Turning to taxes, the effective tax rate on net income from continuing operations was 18.9% compared to 26.1% in the prior year quarter.","The effective tax rate in the first quarter of 2014 was favorable impacted by changes in the geographic distribution of income and is in-line with our previous expectation of more than 500 basis point reduction over the long term. However, potential unfavorable discreet tax adjustments in future quarters of 2014 could cause the effective tax rate to the full year 2014 to be higher than the effective tax rate reported in Q1, 2014 of 19.9%.","Lastly average diluted shares outstanding decreased to 307.2 million in the first compared to 320 million in the prior year quarter. The company repurchased 7.2 million Class A ordinary shares for approximately 600 million in the first quarter. The company has 2.3 billion of remaining authorization under its share repurchase program. Actual shares outstanding on March 31, were 296.5 million [ph] and there are approximately 9 million additional diluted equivalents. Estimated Q2, 2014 beginning diluted share counts is approximately 305 million subject to share price movement, share issuance and share repurchase.","Now let me turn to the next slide to highlight our strong balance sheet and cash flow on page 10. At March 31, 2014 cash and short term investments were 678 million and total debt outstanding was approximately 4.7 billion. Overall debt to capital increased to 37.4% at March 31 compared to 35% at December 31, primarily driven by an increase in total debt outstanding. In Q1, cash flow from operations decreased by $65 million to a use of $11 million. The first quarter is historically our seasonally weakest quarter from a cash flow perspective due primarily to annual incentive compensation payout. Organic growth and $64 million of unfavorable timing more than offset solid underlying working capital performance and a decrease in both pension contributions and cash taxes in the quarter.","We would expect the impact from unfavorable timing to reverse itself in the second quarter. Free cash flow as defined by cash flow from operations, less CapEx decreased by $60 million to a use of $66 million in the first quarter driven by a decrease in cash flow from operations partially offset by a $5 billion decrease in CapEx.","Turning to the next slide to discuss our significant financial flexibility. We value the firm based on free cash flow and allocate capital to maximize free cash flow returns. There is three primary areas that will contribute to our goal of doubling free cash flow to more than 2.3 billion annually within the next 3 to 5 years. From the chart in the presentation based on current assumptions we expect annual free cash flow to increase by over 600 million over the next five years based only on a reduction in cash used for pensions and restructuring. Combined with growth in the core business, further margin expansion and a reduction in the overall effective tax rate we\u2019re well on track to achieve our expectations for substantial cash flow generations.","Regarding our underfunded pension plans, we have taken significant steps to reduce volatility and liability as we have closed plans for new entrants, frozen plans from incurring additional benefits and continued to derisk certain plan assets. We currently expect contributions to decline by roughly a 138 million to 385 million in 2014 and continue to decline thereafter.","Regarding our restructuring plans, cash payments were 152 million in 2013 as all charges related to restructuring program have now being incurred would expect cash payments to decline by 54 million to approximately 98 million in 2014 and decline significantly each year thereafter.","In summary, our first quarter results reflect a solid start to the year with strong operating performance and effective capital management placing us firmly on track to generate more than 2.3 billion of annual free cash flow over the next 3 to 5 years. Combined with a strong balance sheet and significant financial flexibility, we have positioned the firm for significant shareholder value creation in 2014 and beyond.","With that I would like to turn the call back over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","(Operator Instructions). And our first question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS. You may ask your question.","Brian Meredith - UBS","","Hey Christa I guess a couple of questions for you here, the first one, I was hoping you could elaborate a little bit on your comments with respect to the tax rate and some discreet tax adjustments we will see here going forward, perhaps you can give us some thoughts and kind of where the tax rate could potentially end up for the year?","Christa Davies","I think the comments I made in my prepared remarks were essentially that the rate we saw in Q1, 2014 we may expect the full year rate of 2014 to be higher than that Q1, 2014 rate of 18.9%. Brian we\u2019re not giving specific guidance for 2014 but what I can say is that the full year tax rate could be higher because of unfavorable discreet tax adjustments in future quarters and if we looked at 2013 we did have 200 to 300 basis points of unfavorable impact from discreet tax items.","Brian Meredith - UBS","So you are saying higher than the 18.9% not necessarily higher than last year?","Christa Davies","Correct. That\u2019s right.","Brian Meredith - UBS","And then the second question Christa I wonder if you could talk a little bit about share buyback in the quarter. Little surprised that how high it was particularly given this is your weakest cash flow quarter. Is this something that we could expect going forward that despite the weak cash flows you generally have in the first quarter, you could have significant share buyback?","Christa Davies","Yes Brian, we would actually say that if you looked at the share repurchase in the quarter it was higher than we expected and it's higher than we would normally do in Q1 given it is our seasonally weakest quarter, we did take a significant amount of cash off the balance sheet and so that was a big portion of what you saw contributing to that share repurchase for the quarter.","As we think about the rest of the year we would not change expectations for share repurchase and we would really say it, we think about overall cash flow allocation, return on capital the way in which we allocate free cash flows as you know and share repurchase remains our highest return on capital use of cash.","Brian Meredith - UBS","The fact that you bought back so much stock, this is for Greg also, reflect your investment spend you anticipate for the year as well as maybe what\u2019s your thoughts are on the M&A environment here?","Christa Davies","Yes so I guess what I would say Brian is we definitely have a discounted cash flow view of the firm and we repurchased stock based on that discounted cash flow view of the firm and so what you\u2019re seeing in Q1 is definitely a reflection of the value we see at Aon and how much we think it's going to grow overtime.","Greg Case","I would add to that Brian, it does not change in any way shape or form, our outlook and perspective. We will continue to make acquisitions as we have been doing, $200 million to $400 million and keep doing that. We\u2019re going to continue to do, that\u2019s very heavily in our organic growth, organic investments which have been very substantial when you think about the investments in GRIP and investment consulting side and the health exchanges, Aon Benfield analytics et cetera, et cetera. We\u2019re going to continue to do that. So nothing has changed there, it really is this overlying against everything around return on invested capital and the fact that we have access to more cash just as Christa really led [ph] with which was we\u2019re going to continue to increase free cash flow in the firm and double it over the next 3 to 5 years.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Klauber with William Blair.","Adam Klauber - William Blair","","On health exchanges benefit administration segment, from what we understand this selling season actually kicked off pretty early, it actually kicked off real more year-end I guess, when is that so and along with that I guess clients comfort level looking at new benefit platforms compared to year ago.","Greg Case","I would say Adam this is really a conversation we have with clients all the time, there really is that a defined selling season per say. There is a decision point where clients have to get comfortable if we\u2019re going to make different changes that they really are comfortable to explain and make sure their employees know exactly what they are doing to really enforce the benefits they are providing. So that\u2019s really a continued, I would say the activity as you wanted to think about that continues to be very, very strong. Our clients are excited about the opportunities to support their employees more effectively and take some steps to think about their overall cost curve and how they can shape that in context of really serving their employees better.","Adam Klauber - William Blair","And just one follow-up, it seems like this business is relatively seasonal, that obviously a lot of enrollment season comes year-end and implementation of new systems comes couple of months before that. How are you trying to smooth out some of that infrastructure, some of that seasonal infrastructure?","Greg Case","Well I would say couple of things, first of all remember this is an investment we\u2019re making in the business that\u2019s growing well and there are a set of characteristics that the revenue is captured more in the fourth quarter and lot of the investments are in the first, second, third quarter as you ramp up and part of the reflection now it is our success and actually bringing clients onboard and we\u2019re making investments to do that. So we\u2019re quite comfortable with this, we have a high degree of predictability in terms of what\u2019s going to happen which is why we\u2019re comfortable saying we\u2019re going to grow operating income mid to greater single digits for the year which is what we\u2019re thinking about overall.","Christa Davies","And so absolutely greater than mid-single digit operating income growth for the year and as we think about this Adam we really think about it on the full year basis and we continue to make progress on health exchanges each year that goes on a return on the original investments we made and as Greg described in terms of you know client and pipeline and the experience that our clients had in 2013 which was very impressive and Greg referred in his original comments of having cash flow was only 5.1% compared to an industry average of 6% to 8%. So a significant benefit the clients are achieving, it's part of the exchange.","Greg Case","And all it really does is reflect against this annual view on the financials how do we strengthen our business to serve clients more effectively is to represent one really important step in that direction and we will continue to do that to support our clients and ultimately really drive the financial performance that comes with that.","Adam Klauber - William Blair","And one just quick final, and am I right in thinking that as the book of exchange client seasons, in other words clients that are on the exchange 1-2 years, does the margin go up on the season book of business compared to the new business?","Greg Case","Well there is obviously clearly a set of ramp up cost that comes with bringing new clients on board, ramping them onto this. So yes overtime you can expect to sort of see that trend in the underlying business which we fully expect but I would emphasize we\u2019re very comfortable with the upfront investment required to do that for two reasons, one is the absolute fundamental benefit they were bringing to our clients, their employees and also obviously the resulting financial the result that comes with that when you\u2019re supporting clients.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Farrell with Sterne Agee.","Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee","Just a question reinsurance, brokerage and the solid organic this quarter, you mentioned good new business wins and I\u2019m wondering if you could talk about, do you feel that\u2019s coming from share gains from peers, share gains from the direct market or do you think it's driven by an expansion of the pie that might be happening from alternative capital or geographic expansion or anything like that, just a little more color on there.","Greg Case","Our fundamental position that really resulted in the specifics are, when we look at our treaty business we captured a very micro level sort of wins and losses and for 12 consecutive quarters now that has been very positive or have been positive for three full years and that is a function of about everything. The buy sort of we look at in terms of how we think about helping clients succeed, how do we help improve the return on invested capital, reduce our volatility and that comes from lots of different categories and whether it's in a classic treaty business where we have got the number one platform or in faculty, also the number one platform or in the whole world around capital markets in transaction and advisory services where we got the number one platform. Those three capabilities we bring to our clients on an integrated basis and our goal is not a product based goal it is a client value based goal. How do we help them improve performance? And decrease volatility? And that\u2019s what\u2019s led to what we believe is strong traction of the business and will continue to be going forward. ","Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee","And then just one follow-up, on the capital markets side can you talk a little bit more about trends there and maybe talk about the impact that that had on the quarter as well?","Greg Case","Well as we said before, as you think about sort of we thought we will kind of be modestly positive for the year overall, we came a little stronger in the quarter that was due to facultative and some of our transaction advisory business which tends to be lumpy with little more in the first quarter but we don\u2019t change our view for the year kind of modestly positive for the year, overall and when you think about sort of the impact on capital markets and this whole new transactions advisory piece, it could be very important particularly as alternative capital comes into the market place and if you think about it we reported a level of capital of 540 billion and it's literally an all-time high, up 7% from year-end 2012 and probably underlying that 540 billion is about 50 billion in alternative capital in the context of that just over 9%.","We expect that to be a 100 billion over the next 3, 4, 5 years. So a lot of dynamics happening that our clients did react to which means we have to help and think about it and react to that which is one of the real strengths of what we bring to the table and why we\u2019re excited about this platform and how we can help clients going forward.","Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee","Just one really quick item, to just on the tax rate again and the discreet items that you talked about that could happen later this year. Are those unusual items or do you think there are things that can recur again? I\u2019m just trying to just think about 2015 trend relative to \u201914.","Christa Davies","Yes I mean discreet tax adjustments happen every year and as I mentioned we had a 200 to 300 basis point unfavorable impact from discreet tax adjustments in 2013. There are things like prior period adjustments as we continue to close out, audit and some things like that around the globe and so I would expect them to continue.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neill.","Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill","Is there a way to look at the organic growth in HR Solutions if we back out the impact of the timing issues as well as the exchanges?","Christa Davies","If you back out the impact of the timing, it's approximately 4% underlying to the quarter and it's very similar to some of the low to mid-single digit growth that we would expect in HR Consulting for the year and similarly for the overall HR segment for the full year.","Greg Case","Now the quarter really reinforced our view for the year just as Christa described.","Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill","And then little bit broad question, you and Gallagher actually mentioned this in their earnings earlier that the organic growth for your business seems to be increasingly backend loaded and is that purely a function in your opinion of what\u2019s going on with the exchanges and maybe even talk about mechanically why that\u2019s happening but also are there other factors that are affecting the organic growth from your business that means that you\u2019re just seeing more revenue shift basically towards the back half of the year.","Greg Case","Paul there really isn't -- there really isn't that much about sort of structural shifts on there, it really is very straight forward. When you think about our risk business nothing really has changed, we have always had a relatively fourth quarter weighted in the U.S. from a renewal standpoint; by the way the first quarter is heavily weighted for EMEA. So nothing has changed at all on the Risk side of the business which is a very, very large percentage of our overall business obviously and the HR Solution side that the new news [ph] here is what we\u2019re on the exchange front which is an offering which happens to be more fourth quarter weighted which is just because the way the enrollment cycle works. So not a lot going on here, pretty straightforward. You\u2019re starting to see this move in HR Solutions because of the work on the exchanges.","Operator","Thank you. Next question, Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.","Elyse Greenspan - Wells Fargo","","I just had a couple of other questions on the HR Solutions business, I know every quarter we kind of see except the fourth quarter the margins offset to a degree by the investments you\u2019re making in the healthcare exchanges. Anyway to sort of pinpoint the level of margin improvement we might be seeing and the rest of your book just outside of the private healthcare exchanges?","Greg Case","When you come back basically you think about where we\u2019re and really as Christa described this is really an outlook that should be viewed as over the course of a year which is quarter-to-quarter. What you saw in margins in the first quarter and you\u2019re going to see in the second quarter too really is the investment as we bring clients on the exchange front. Nothing at all has changed in our view around operating income which is mid-single digit and greater over the course of the year that\u2019s really what we said, Christa can comment on that and it really is that investment upfront it's sort of puts us in a position where operating income is down for the first couple of quarters, kind of flat for the third and up for the fourth and that picture hasn\u2019t changed at all.","Christa Davies","And the other thing I would say Elyse is if you think about our healthcare exchange business we will generate a modest profit in that business in 2014 which means it's dilutive to our overall margins therefore the margins in the rest of our business are growing substantially to generate greater than mid-single digit operating income growth as Greg said for the full year.","Elyse Greenspan - Wells Fargo","And then just following-up you did put that modest positive earnings kind of number out there last quarter, did anything kind of happened during the enrollment season last year and looking forward that might cause you to be a little bit more positive or are you just kind of waiting for the enrollment season to potentially update your view on that side?","","Greg Case","Well nothing has really changed since -- last year we said we would be mid-single digit that\u2019s exactly where we were this year, we said our mid-single digits are greater that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re based on first quarter and as we said things going exactly as planned. We\u2019re very excited about progress and we\u2019re looking forward to updating you once we finish the enrollment cycle.","Elyse Greenspan - Wells Fargo","And then just if we could spend a little bit just discussing the retail brokerage business, I know in your commentary you did point to stable exposures and some modest benefit from rate increases and I was just trying to get a little bit more of a view as we look forward for the balance of 2014 kind of how you see trends panning out there and how maybe the level of organic growth you would expect to see from here.","Greg Case","Maybe I will start that between sort of market view and just a thought on Aon. We track this with a Risk inside platform in a very granular level. So we\u2019re tracking across our regions and across the world for everything we place and we would, if we think about we\u2019re really talking about market impact here which is a function of both price and ensured values and if you take a look at market impact overall it's flat to slightly positive and it has been flat to slightly positive for a number of quarters, we expect that for the remainder of the year. So if you think about the overall market and the measurement called market impact flat to slightly positive and as it relates to Aon and we intend to grow our business and if it's in the environment we\u2019re going to grow our business and we would expect -- you know what you saw in this quarter it's going to be reflected what you\u2019re going to see for the year. Well mid-single digit growth and against the book as we\u2019re investing to grow as I described before.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Nannizzi from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs","Greg is it possible, maybe Christa to talk about and we haven't talked about GRIP for a little while. I\u2019m just curious to know how much of an impact did GRIP have on margins in risk this quarter and what\u2019s been the take up there I don\u2019t know if you can give us sort of notionally or how much the fee stream there has increased over the last year? Thanks.","Greg Case","We\u2019re not going to break out GRIP as we haven't before and too much detail other than to say GRIP is really a function of all the efforts in data analytics investments are around improving our Aon broking capability and we have continued to get very strong uptake from insurance carriers and sort of their ability to use GRIP information to actually help them decide where they are going to make investments and get frankly do better in matching their capital with our client needs, that has worked exceptionally well and continues to do that.","The GRIP is really part of -- its really part of the overall effort to drive to a 26% and it has actually helped us do that. I would say we\u2019re up over 30 carriers now which is continued progress it's obviously a lot more out there but sort of (indiscernible) very, very good progress and GRIP continues to contribute to grow from a margin standpoint.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs","Do you think you can raise prices or do you anticipate raising prices for GRIP for current or for potentially new sign ups?","Greg Case","Yes this is not for us about raising pricing, the way it should perform. This is about really trying to drive value on behalf of our clients first and foremost and when we drive by on behalf of clients we\u2019re really helping markets get better aligned against client needs. One of the real breakthroughs on GRIP, let's just the fact that we have got the largest data base in the world around placement information but we have got colleagues who now work with our data, working with clients, our insurance carriers to help them think about how do they shape their capital and the way that\u2019s more value added to our clients. That is powerful that actually is what gives GRIP meaning to our insurance carriers and real meaning ultimately to our clients and that\u2019s how we think about it.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs","And then in terms of the healthcare exchanges, can you -- is it possible to understand like the amount of investment you\u2019ve made this quarter versus last year and when do you expect, I mean clearly you\u2019re having a lot of success and you\u2019re gaining a lot of traction. When do you expected that sort of balancing between investing and revenue generation turn so that the margins out of exchange are consistent with the rest of your benefits business?","Christa Davies","Yes so what we would say is if you look back over the last two years we invested and therefore made a loss in exchanges. In 2014 we have said that we\u2019re going to be modestly positive and every year after that we\u2019re going to drive greater scale and therefore greater return on those investments and we\u2019re absorbing the investments in 2014 to drive greater than mid-single digit operating income growth in HR Solutions and so each year that growth pass by we will get greater return on that investment and we think it is a very attractive business to be in and therefore it's worth the upfront investment we\u2019re making and as you know we do allocate our capital whether it's organic investments in healthcare exchanges and GRIP and other things or it's M&A or share repurchase or it's dividends, on a free cash flow return on capital basis and so this is one of the most attractive segments across our entire business.","Greg Case","It's really interesting when you think about; the exchange investment is not different than the investments we made in GRIP, the investments we made in other areas on investment consulting side. What we are really focused on doing is make substantial organic investments where we believe they can strengthen our platform and we said we will fully absorb those investments and still improve margins or improve operating income as we\u2019re in the HR Solutions side and margin on the Risk side. We have to be able to absorb those and strengthen our platform and for us that\u2019s been one of the most gratifying things over the last few years since we will be able to make meaningful investments to grow our business but at the same time grow organically and improve margins and that really is fundamental to what we think at least is for our investors.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs","And you think the 22% margin that you talk about on slide 8; at scale is that a reasonable goal or target for your exchange platform?","Greg Case","Again the 22% and the 26% are not specific to individual areas. Really the 26% is more -- is a next step on resolutions. The 22% is the next step on HR Solutions and we feel like we\u2019re marching towards those and we will continue to do that when we reflect on a year-over-year.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs","Is reinsurance, how do you think about the weakness in heading into 61 [ph] renewals and how that could potentially impact you guys before than potentially including the capital markets potential activity and thanks again for all the answers, sorry for so many questions.","Greg Case","We don\u2019t provide pricing guidance in the market on the reinsurance side. It's something that\u2019s sort of we have got a tremendous amount of data and analytics behind that we provide it directly into our clients. We think it's quite beneficial and highly competitively positive for them. Having said that when you think about the market overall, obviously a lot of pressure out there. The new capital I described before, a lot of pressure out there but fundamental you step back and answer the question, do clients need help from the standpoint of improving operating performance or reducing volatility? I think that continues to be yes, lots of different opportunities for them to do that and that\u2019s where we come in whether it's on treaty or faculty or capital markets and advisory business that\u2019s what we do. And that\u2019s why I said from our standpoint we expect to be flat to modestly positive for the year on the reinsurance side, top line irrespective of what\u2019s happening in the overall market.","Operator","Thank you. Next, Jay Cohen, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jay Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes just a follow-up on the reinsurance, obviously these capital markets transactions are becoming more numerous and you guys are playing a very important rule there. When you assist one of your ceding [ph] company clients in that form versus buying traditional reinsurance. From your standpoint is that more profitable? In other words if a company instead of buying a particular layer to the traditional reinsurance market will you place that or you underwrite catastrophe bond as a specific example same terms which approach is more profitable for you?","Greg Case","So Jay I would say we don\u2019t really think about on a product basis that way. There is a kind of clinical way you can sort of parse those up, obviously one is recurring one is not, there is a whole series of things to go into that. We think of it very much around an overall client view, so what do we do to help that client succeed by the way very measurable operating performance, balance sheet, strength, volatility as I said before against that very specific set of metrics, what did I or we bring to the table and when we bring value to the table we have been very fortunate our clients are very clear about wanting to pass for value but they hold a very bar, they should and we want to do it for everybody.","We all need to provide guidance, if we do we\u2019re going to do fine economically and if we don\u2019t there all will be challenged economically but that\u2019s exactly the bar you want if you are providing value into the market as we\u2019re. We want more transparency around that, more clarity around that and we think that actually serves very, very well given our privilege positions in treaty, in fac [ph] and in the capital market side.","Jay Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Second question on a tax rate, you had talked about reducing the tax rate I think 500 basis points and you always said overtime. It just feels like that happened a lot faster than one might have expected. I know the full year tax rate may not be as low as what you saw in the first quarter but still it was quite a bit lower than certainly we expected and I think others and did something change here or were you able to recognize that tax setting quicker than you might have originally expected?","Christa Davies","Jay I would really say that we have been on a path as you to reduce that tax rate by more than 500 basis points over the long term and the rate in Q1 is very much in-line with that sort of previous expectation and I would reinforce the point you made which is we do think that the full year rate of 2014 could be higher due to discreet tax adjustments. And so whilst the Q1 rate is really a reflection of the geographic distribution of our income which does change from quarter-to-quarter as a mix of our business shifts and as you look at sort of the mix of our business Jay, you can see things like emerging markets have grown disproportionately higher than developed markets and then the areas in which we have disproportionately invested whether it's GRIP or healthcare exchanges or other areas have grown much faster than our core business too and so we do expect the mix to change over time as well.","Jay Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So this tax rate didn\u2019t surprise you on the favorable side at all?","Christa Davies","No, it's very much in-line with our expectation of the more than 500 basis points over the long term.","Jay Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","You keep saying long term but it has been a lot quicker I guess. Thanks Christa I appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Meyer Shields, KBW.","Meyer Shields \u2013 KBW","","Two margins questions if I can, one I think Christa you mentioned that there was some lumpiness in the revenues associated with capital markets and transactions that helped reinsurance brokerage organic growth, does that have any impact on margins? Is there sort of operating leverage embedded in that?","Christa Davies","Not really. I mean we would say as Greg said definitely capital market transactions and facultative transactions are lumpy and therefore as we think about the reinsurance organic growth for the full year 2014 we would say we would expect it to be flat to modestly positive but these capital market transactions and in fact it's a much smaller part of our business but 85% of our revenue in reinsurance is treaty and so that is the majority of what you\u2019re seeing in the quarter.","Greg Case","And obviously the margin numbers that we report are Risk Solutions margins overall and report margins on Aon Benfield and as Christa described we expect to make progress on margin in Risk Solutions in 2014, first quarter reflects progress.","Meyer Shields \u2013 KBW","Second I guess going forward if you did see this discreet tax adjustments driving the tax rate higher in future quarters in 2014 is that going to have any impact on compensation expenses either at corporate or in individual segments?","Christa Davies","As we think about the overall business we think about the total company results and as we look at our compensation we have actually done a lot of work on compensation to align with driving value to shareholders. Example, you know our annual bonuses are really based on growing profit year-over-year and the stock for our senior most executive across the company is cumulative three EPSs we report to shareholders.","Greg Case","So nothing in sort of the overall sort of compensation structure or reward structure of our senior leadership team. It's time based, everything is performance based, very, very large percentage we do is performance based. So anything that affects performance is going to ultimately affect compensation.","Meyer Shields \u2013 KBW","Last question if I can, is there any breakthrough from the significant dividend increase in terms of the relative effectiveness of share repurchases?","Christa Davies","Obviously you can see we did more share repurchase in Q1 in 2014 than we had since 2008 and as I said earlier share repurchase remains the highest return on capital we have in terms of uses of cash and look I would just say that the dividend increases are third year of increase of dividends and we returning capital to the shareholders and we will continue to you know to go on that path.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley","","I\u2019ve two questions; one is just on the margin side. You have 3% organic growth in Risk Solutions; you showed a 110 basis point margin improvement. I\u2019m just wondering if we sustain this sort of low to mid-single digits organic growth will we be able to see the continuing margin expansion in the Risk Solutions.","Christa Davies","Yes we absolutely think that\u2019s the case. If you think about sort of we expect mid-single digit organic revenue growth in Risk Solutions in calendar year 2014, if you look at our underlying expense save, you know it's mostly people, there are largest expense, you know you would see a natural sort of inflationary impact of let\u2019s call it 2% growth in expenses therefore even a 3% organic revenue growth level we can absolutely drive margin expansion that\u2019s what you saw in calendar year 2013 and that\u2019s what you have seen in Q1, 2014.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley","Then on the margin and the HR side, you have put out long term target 22%, I guess before the long term healthcare has changed. I just wonder the outlook for the private healthcare exchange and the margin of the business will that be sort of like increasing or sort of like be above your long term target for the business 22%?","Christa Davies","We absolutely believe that the returns on the healthcare exchange business will help us achieve our 22% margin target in HR Solutions. We haven't given specific long term margins for our healthcare exchange business but we have said that it's one of the best return on capital opportunities across the firm. Obviously the profile of this investment is we\u2019re making significant investments on behalf of clients upfront and we expect to return that overtime.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley","And lastly on the buyback the source of fund, so I just wonder could you remind us like how much of your cash (indiscernible) was sitting in the U.S. versus international and how do you funded the buyback and through like increasing through like debt or from operating cash flow from the U.S. operations?","Christa Davies","Yes so as we think about our cash flow we really have a central sort of treasury operation, it's a combined cash pool that\u2019s a result of our moving to the UK in April 2012 and so we really think about it as a common cash pool. If you look at how much of the share repurchase was funded from cash and short term investments on the balance sheet you saw at year-end 2013, cash and short term investments were about a $1 billion and it has come down to 678 million and so that gives you a sense that 322 million roughly came off the balance sheet. So that was a significant portion of the share repurchase contribution. I don\u2019t know if answered every part of your question?","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley","Yes so if I just wonder of these the share buyback has to use the cash available in the U.S. right?","Christa Davies","Yes we don\u2019t think about it like that, we have a globe cash pool.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from Charles Sebaski with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Charles Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets","I just wanted to get an idea of the investment profile that you\u2019ve been talking about in HR Solutions and just sort of is that in people or is that in technology or infrastructure and sort of how does the level of investment is being made this year compared to 2012 or 2013 when we think about how that business and that investment is ramping up overtime?","Greg Case","So let me start broad and then maybe Christa can talk about the exchange per say but this is one of the just exchanges, our team in HR Solutions has really taken a broad based view around very important topics, retirement, pension, health, rewards, talent, et cetera and made very substantial investments on the investment consulting side and what we\u2019re doing there in pensions, very, very substantial set of investments in addition to the investments that we talked about on this call around the health exchanges and on the talent reward side. So it's really a broad brush based set of investments with a specific set -- I guess a specific set of criteria starting with how do we help clients succeed and then against the return on invested capital, cash on cash metric that Christa has talked about. So that\u2019s how we think about it overall.","Charles Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets","","I guess my question is when you say those investments I mean are those people, are those teams being hired or is that infrastructure and technology? Like I\u2019m just trying to understand when you say investment are you referring to the people you\u2019re putting in since it's such a people heavy business or is this technology and infrastructure type investments?","Christa Davies","It's mostly people. It's also technology and infrastructure, so if you think about the healthcare exchange business it's people, it's process and it is a significant amount of technology in the platform to run a scale and so but the majority of the investment is people to service clients and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing and so as we think about the client growth each year the underlying expense size is going to increase because we\u2019re serving far more clients in talent [ph] in 2014 than we did in 2013.","But as we said the profitability is improving each year and the return on capital is improving each year.","Charles Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets","And then just one other question on compensation overall, normally first quarter seems to be a higher compensation quarter on a relative basis and the compensation growth seemed a bit lower this year and I was just wondering if there is anything that has gone into that or any change on the compensation make up corporate wide?","Christa Davies","Yes so as we think about our compensation programs corporate wide we put in place a number of years ago as Greg described aligning our compensation programs with performance as delivered to shareholders whether that\u2019s operating income growth, year-over-year or whether that\u2019s cumulative EPS growth or free cash flow growth and they have -- compensation programs have not changed over the last couple of years. We think they have aligned management incentives with shareholder returns and therefore we have kept them stable.","Charles Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets","Was there any benefit to the level of compensation for the company from the restructuring program? I mean I guess given the returns and the hurdles you guys have hit I would have expected compensation growth to sort of stay more in-line with last year as opposed to the growth slowdown, that\u2019s all I\u2019m trying to understand.","Christa Davies","I mean we obviously as we invested in restructuring we did get a return in terms of reduced compensation from those programs but we\u2019re balancing investments in restructuring both in investments and organic ideas for the business with all of our other opportunities for investing across Aon and so I wouldn\u2019t say that\u2019s particularly out of line with trends in previous years.","Operator","Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg Case for closing remarks.","Greg Case","I just want to say to everyone thank you very much for participating with us today. We look forward to the call next quarter. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Thank you all for attending today\u2019s conference. You may now disconnect."],"2175":["Aon Corporation (NYSE:AON) Q2 2018 Results Earnings Conference Call October 26, 2018  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Christa Davies - Executive VP & CFO","Eric Andersen - Co-President"," Gregory Case - CEO & Executive","Michael O'Connor - Co-President","Analysts","Sarah DeWitt - JPMoran","Yaron Kinar - Goldman Sachs","Elyse Greenspan - Wells Fargo","Meyer Shields - KBW","Operator","Good morning, and thank you for holding. Welcome to Aon plc's Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) I would also like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded, and that it is important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our third quarter 2018 results as well as having been posted on our website.","Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, CEO of Aon plc. Please go ahead, Greg","Gregory Case","Thanks, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter conference call. Joining me today is our CFO, Christa Davies. In addition, we are excited to have our Co-Presidents, Eric Andersen and Mike O'Connor, join the call today. As highlighted last quarter, we intend to use our time on the call to provide you with more insight into the longer term view for the firm, with greater transparency into strategic initiatives. Also, like last quarter, we posted our detailed financial presentation on our website. We believe this approach provides a more thoughtful, long-term focus towards operational performance, including examples of investment in growth areas that are strengthening our capability to serve clients. Mike and Eric will be great additions to this discussion to give you another perspective on the power of leading Aon United.","With that opening, we'd like to start by noting that our colleagues around the world delivered another strong result for the third quarter, with positive performance across each of our key metrics, including: 6% organic revenue growth; 190 basis points of margin expansion; 18% operating income growth; and 34% growth in EPS; and a similar strong performance across our key metrics year-to-date, reinforcing our continued long-term momentum, which Christa will discuss a little bit more in a bit.","This continued momentum is a direct result of the strategic actions we've progressively taken to build upon the idea of leading Aon United and the impact it's having at scale on our business.","As discussed last quarter, we've been laying the foundation for Aon United for over a decade, evolving our portfolio, investing in new content and capability and aligning client demand through programs like Aon Client Promise, all focused on increasing our relevance and strengthening our ability to deliver value for clients.","More recently, over the last few quarters, we've taken steps to further reinforce and amplify this progress. In doing so, we've truly entered the era of Aon United, through structural changes that break down barriers and make it easier to deliver the best of the firm to clients: a single leadership team; a single P&L; a single brand; a single operating model. Most compelling, a united global professional services firm.","Just last week, we announced another reinforcing step in this journey: The formation of our New Ventures Group, a team of leaders from across the firm who've created additional capacity to build on our already industry-leading record in innovation and further accelerate new sources of value for clients, led by Tony Goland as Chief Innovation Officer. The benefits that accrue when our global firm effectively works together are distinctive and unmatched in the industry and are unlocking significant value for our clients through greater innovation and superior, tailor-made solutions that fit their specific business objectives. Let me give you 2 quick examples. The first is an example of how our strategic investment in client-serving capabilities led to connections across solution lines and geographies in our core business that created unique client value. And the second is an example of how we're expanding the marketplace by attacking new business challenges on behalf of our clients.","The first example. I was recently with one of our enterprise client leaders, which is a team of business advisers that coordinates Aon's value proposition for a select group of significant clients and a large private equity client. And we were discussing the needs of their portfolio companies. And in doing so, it became clearer that they wanted to put their balance sheet to work in new ways and that they aspired to create value outside of traditional PE opportunities. Our enterprise client leader connected that aspiration to our pension de-risking capabilities, and we began a conversation about the opportunity to apply their capital to help de-risk the pension obligations of their portfolio companies and potentially, beyond that, in the broader marketplace. By doing so, we expanded the conversation from risk mitigation to value creation. This is likely to be a new source of value for the client over the coming years and was made possible by the connection our enterprise client leader made between our commercial risk solutions capabilities and related offerings in Retirement Solutions. This example also demonstrates how the enterprise client group could help us create a templated approach to value creation and that we can replicate across sectors. And more broadly, how that, that team is helping us institutionalize our approach to Aon United growth opportunities and developing best practices designed to make it easier for all of our client-facing colleagues to bring the best of our firm to clients.","This second example is all about marketplace expansion, as we continue our focus on expanding the marketplace by developing solutions to our clients' most pressing business needs. In Q3, we continued to invest behind cyber, with the launch of our silent cyber solution, driven by analytics and backed by an evolving reinsurance solution to help carriers respond to expanding cyber risk and regulations.","Our actions are translating into accelerated revenue growth. Aon United equals growth, which you can see from both the quarter and the year-to-date in 2018 versus 2017. More important, it'll be driving -- a driving factor toward delivering on our goal of mid-single-digit organic revenue growth or greater over the long term as we expand the market, shift towards faster-growing areas of client demand and continue to increase market share.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Christa for our thoughts on our progress year-to-date and long-term outlook for continued shareholder value creation. Christa?","Christa Davies","Thanks so much, Greg, and welcome, everyone. As Greg described, the steps we're taking to lead Aon United drove another strong performance for the third quarter. I would note that our progress year-to-date continues to reinforce both our short- and long-term financial targets. Our performance year-to-date through the third quarter reflects: organic revenue growth of 4%; an acceleration from 3% year-to-date in 2017.","In addition to accelerating organic growth, M&A is continuing to contribute, both improving the mix and driving total revenue growth of 10% year-to-date. Adjusted operating margins increased 210 basis points year-to-date and acceleration from our historic average of 70 to 80 basis points a year over the last decade. Accelerating revenue, combined with significant margin expansion, is delivering strong operating income growth of 19% year-to-date, with core operating income growth reflecting 10% or more than half of the year-over-year performance.","Core margin expansion year-to-date is up 50 basis points, and I would note this includes the absorption of near-term investments in client-facing capabilities to support the Aon United growth initiatives that Greg highlighted.","EPS growth of 29% year-to-date, placing us firmly on track to exceed our short-term target of $7.97 in EPS in 2018.","And lastly, reported free cash flow increased substantially, reminding you that the prior year included cash tax payments related to the divestiture. Strong operational performance contributed to year-over-year growth, partially offset by increased restructuring outflows reflecting this is expected to be our peak year of restructuring cash usage.","Adjusting for the impacts of the divestiture, underlying free cash flow grew 5% year-over-year, including a discretionary strategic decision to pull forward $80 million of pension contributions into the third quarter.","Our continued momentum and long-term outlook are amplified by the investments we're making across the portfolio to support Aon United growth objectives of mid-single digit organic revenue growth or greater over the long term, and in our Aon United operating model to drive ongoing productivity improvements.","As Greg discussed, we're investing organically and inorganically, in both talent and in capabilities across the portfolio in the highest return on invested capital opportunities, which are often driven by areas of client demand, where we find new ways to add value or more effectively service clients' unique business needs.","One example is the operating leverage we're creating in our Affinity business, by designing and building an application that will create a differentiated solution for small businesses who prefer digital channels to help navigate their buying process. Through the creation of our next- generation global business services model, we're creating greater scalability, productivity and operating leverage, including the continued expansion of captive and outsourced service delivery centers, which will contribute to the substantial cost reduction. This is just one example of productivity improvements from our single operating model that will continue beyond the near-term restructuring program. Ongoing productivity improvements, combined with accelerating revenue growth and a portfolio mix shift to higher-margin businesses, are expected to drive continued long-term core margin expansion.","More importantly, an accelerating growth profile, increased operating leverage and continued progress on working capital initiatives gives us confidence in our ability to deliver on our goal of double-digit annual growth in free cash flow over the long term. As I mentioned before, 2018 is expected to be the peak year of cash usage related to the restructuring initiative. Declining uses of cash for restructuring, CapEx and pension are expected to free up $650 million of free cash flow by the end of 2020, significantly increasing our capital flexibility to invest in value creation opportunities.","With an expectation of strong free cash flow growth, combined with an opportunity for substantial additional leverage in 2019 and 2020, we're diligent about maximizing return on invested capital and make all capital allocation on this basis. This is highlighted by the $1.25 billion of share repurchase year-to-date, which remains the highest return on capital investment given our free cash flow valuation.","In summary, we continue to accelerate revenue growth through significant investments in client-facing colleagues and capabilities to deliver Aon United, and we're driving substantial free cash flow generation that's expected to unlock significant shareholder value creation over the long term. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Greg.","Gregory Case","Thanks, Christa. As mentioned earlier, we are glad to have Mike and Eric join us on the call to help provide further insight into how Aon United creates value for our clients and drives growth for the firm. Now going back to questions from our Q2 call, several questions revolved around the very topic, around creating value day-to-day. And today, we want to pick up on that line of questions from the last call and kick off today's discussion with a perspective from both Mike and Eric on this topic.","However, before we turn to that question, I'm going briefly talk about each of these leaders and their importance to our firm. Eric has spent over 20 years at Aon and in that time, he's led and contributed to virtually every part of our business: he's held regional leadership roles in our commercial risk and health businesses; he's taken on the global leadership role in Reinsurance Solutions; he's most recently added Retirement Solutions, working with our colleagues to create connections between our insurance clients and our Investment Solutions. And of course, all those solutions are incubators for some of the most innovative uses of data and analytics. So he's had the opportunity to support this portfolio and understand the power of the insights we deliver to clients through data and analytics. Eric is also very well-known and trusted by our market partners. And perhaps most important, Eric's been in the ring as Aon has evolved over the years and has a unique appreciation for the importance and potential of our Aon United growth strategy.","Mike has been with Aon for over a decade. His background in client service, coupled with excellent operational leadership, provides unique perspective on how we develop and commercialize insight and most effectively connect it to client need. Like Eric, Mike has held a broad range of leadership roles at Aon, most recently as CEO of our Commercial Risk Solutions, Health Solutions and Affinity Businesses. In that role, Mike championed an M&A agenda that has seen us build new capabilities related to emerging risks like cyber, intellectual property, both of which are consistent with our commitment to create new sources of value for clients. It's also worth noting that Mike spent a great deal of time in London working out of our global headquarters, which provided him more global perspective on the firm and a more nuanced understanding of the Lloyd's marketplace, and that's important to our clients.","Now back to the question on Aon United and its impact at the front line of our firm. Eric, can I ask you to take the first cut at addressing that, and Mike, you can follow on.","Eric Andersen","Thanks, Greg. It's a privilege to be here with you and Christa, and thank you for the great question. Before I begin, I just want to echo Greg's comments on Mike and tell you how excited we are to be working together. As Greg referenced, we've known each other and worked together closely for over a decade, and that collaboration has been a great foundation and is really the spirit of Aon United.","So on the Aon United question, where to begin? This is just something that has become so fundamental to the success of our firm. When I talk about the unique benefits of Aon United with our clients, I always start with our colleagues because that's really where the value originates. Our colleagues are incredibly engaged by the potential of Aon United. They have seen us systematically bring down the structural barriers over the last few years, and they have leapt at the opportunity to work closely together for clients. They were always inclined to work together, but sometimes we made it more difficult than it needed to be. By making it easier for them to bring the best of the firm to our clients, we have helped them create deeper, more meaningful relationships. And that's a good thing because ultimately, we're getting paid for value. And Aon United makes it easier to deliver more value for clients. In return, that strengthens our financial performance, with greater retention in our core business and increased relevance with clients through advice and solutions. Let me give you an example. If you look at our Reinsurance Solutions business, you'll find that we serve many of the largest insurers in the world. Historically, that was more of a transactional relationship. We were there to support their book of business. But over the last decade, you've seen us become more advice-driven, using data and analytics to better understand our underwriting appetites and more efficiently transfer the risks they were assuming to the secondary market. That success builds loyalty and intimacy. Those CEOs know that we understand their business better than any other type of partner they have. So as we built our investment consulting business, we've earned the right to introduce that new capability to an installed base of clients that already trust us and are conditioned to accept new insights. With 1 client in particular, we had a great relationship in the traditional reinsurance area supporting their book of business. With our investment consulting capability, we were able to help them on the asset side of their balance sheet. Being able to partner with this client across their business, we were able to take our relationship to an entirely new level of interaction where we improved operating performance and strengthened their balance sheet. That's just one example of the depth of our expertise in 1 solution line and our colleagues' understanding and belief in Aon United that translated into an opportunity to introduce a new capability to our clients in a manner that created unique value for them and drove growth for our firm.","Mike, I know you see Aon United in action every day and have a few additional examples.","Michael O'Connor","Thanks, Eric. Listening to your description, well, I complete -- I agree completely that Aon United excites our colleagues, and we see that ultimately leading to greater client loyalty and growth. Let me take a moment and describe another example connected to the transportation sector that really reinforces this benefit.","Across many geographies today, there's enormous growth around small trucks and fleets being put to work to complete the last mile of delivery. We see demand both from large clients and middle-market clients. However, the growth of these transportation businesses are challenged as there is need for more efficient and effective insurance solutions, both vehicle insurance and health and benefits solutions for their workforce. This client need has spurred within our team a truly Aon United response. Our team stepped back and brought together an array of capabilities: Industry expertise from our transportation logistics practice; operational and platform capabilities from our Affinity business that serves small businesses and consumers; reinsurance expertise to access and support capital providers; our captive team can assist clients that desire self-insured solution. We brought data and analytics expertise from our global risk consulting team for the vehicle solutions and our talent practice that can help assess driver performance.","And lastly, health and voluntary benefit solutions for this gig economy workforce from our health practice. The integration of talent and capabilities from across the firm, which does not come together without an Aon United approach, allows us to deliver a customized solution to clients that enables them to operate and grow their business. This delivers an obvious benefit to a client, but these types of opportunities also is what excites our colleagues. They are incredibly engaged and motivated when working across solution lines and geographies to join forces to deliver unique value to clients. And that's been a big part of our journey towards becoming a professional services firm.","Eric and I are seeing more and more Aon United efforts across the firm, similar to the transportation example I just shared, where colleagues are working together to create custom solutions, underpinned by insights from data and analytics that increase our relevance with clients and earn the right to provide advice and solution to our clients that help them grow, improve profitability and reduce risk.","Gregory Case","Thanks, Mike and Eric. I appreciate those examples of Aon United has generated impact with both clients and colleagues. Really helpful insight as we work to make -- make it easier really for our colleagues to bring the best of Aon to clients and help us deliver on the growth potential of our firm. And obviously, we can go on with a lot more examples, but let's see what's on the minds of everyone else. And operator, please open up the lines for our next question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Dave Styblo [ph].","Unidentified Analyst","I wanted to maybe continue the conversation with Mike and Eric. And Aon is in a, obviously a very good position financially, the cash flow is strong, going to get better. You've laid out $650 million of incremental savings that you'll get over the next couple of years. You've got more restructuring savings that will be coming through. I guess, as business leaders, how do you, Mike and Eric, see that flexibility being able to benefit the business in terms of investments that you'd make? What are things that you'd like to do that would either enable you to improve retention, improve organic growth, improve margins through your lenses.","Gregory Case","So Dave, it's Greg. And I'll start and then sort of -- we'll flip back and forth here as sort of we interact. First, really appreciate the question. You are really underpinning one of the strengths of the firm, so not only with the financial flexibility and capability, but really have an opportunity to look at client need and the evolution of client need and how it's changing and then react to that. So you've seen us make investments sort of on the acquisition side with Stroz in cyber, across-the-board with Townsend, sort of on the delegated side in exceptional ways. You've seen us make acquisitions with Admix in health and data analytics and ACT and in mortgage and the exchanges, et cetera. So we got a whole pallet of things we could look out across the firm to improve performance, both from an acquisition standpoint and organic standpoint. And I think Eric and Mike have really been at the helm of sort of how we've directed that and how we've driven that. And you're seeing that start to really provide yield in the overall business. Maybe, Eric start with you, just in terms of just places you're seeing it show up every day and I think the point Mike made around our colleagues are reacting to that, not just clients is important, too.","Eric Andersen","Thanks, Greg. And I think really comes down to a couple of big areas. Certainly, we're continuing to invest in our teams. The capability and the development that they have to be able to provide the right insight I think is critical. Certainly, data and analytics is something that we talked about consistently, trying to drive content-driven insight and creating new areas of demand and, essentially, growing the pie in the business is also a major focus. And then obviously, having the right tools to be able to execute for clients. Is -- we see investment opportunities and growth areas across all 5 solution lines.","Gregory Case","Terrific. Mike, thoughts?","Michael O'Connor","Yes. I think, as Eric said, we see opportunities with new clients and existing, and maybe I'd highlight a couple of things that come to mind. First, we're using data and analytics to draw out insight to be able to serve clients more effectively, and a great example of that is Aon Client Treaty. We talked about that before. That is data-driven insight for us to be able to provide better solution for clients all over the world. It's driven by client demand and the ability for us to unite capabilities within our Insurance and Reinsurance businesses to provide a distinctive solution, and we see continued growth and continued benefit for clients. And then there are many parts of the business we are very excited about. Transaction liability, we highlighted, continues to be a real area of client need, and we continue to invest behind that to continue to deepen our team and grow our geographic coverage, both to serve corporates and private equity and investors. So very excited about that space and see continued investment opportunity there","Gregory Case","Perfect.","Unidentified Analyst","And then just a follow-up on the numbers a little bit, may be just for Christa. The restructuring savings. If we keep that flat again in the fourth quarter from the third quarter, you guys are going to be at nearly $360 million of restructuring savings for this year versus your $300 million goal. I guess where is the upside coming from? And is that more something that we should think about as a pull forward,, realizing the savings earlier? Or are we at a point where you start to have some visibility where you think you'd have upside of the $450 million target for next year?","Christa Davies","Yes. So Dave, thank you so much for the question. We're extremely excited about the restructuring program and its ability to invest in building the Aon United operating model that's going to deliver the $300 million of savings in 2018 to $450 million of savings in 2019, but much more importantly than that, productivity gains and operating leverage in each year after that. And I would say in terms of where we're up to, we're very excited about the progress year-to-date, in the program. It's really a lot of investments in real estate, in IT and in people around our operating model. We're not in the business of updating guidance. As we think about this restructuring program, it's a 3-year program which will continue until the end of 2019. What I can say is that we're very excited and confident about delivering the $300 million in savings this year and $450 million in savings next year.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And then just lastly on organic growth, that was really strong across -- especially the commercial book and Reinsurance and in some ways surprisingly strong against the comp, a tough comp. Are you guys seeing more so an uptick in end market demand or is some of this, do you think, some market share gains that you guys are enjoying?","A \u2013 Gregory Case","It's really -- it's a combination, Dave, across the board. Again, as Eric and Mike both highlighted, we're look -- in essence, looking at client need, client demand and we're actually driving ways to actually improve and bringing new solutions to the -- to bear on behalf of clients. So some of the things that Eric and Mike talked about in cyber and transaction liability, et cetera, sort of our new opportunities we're bringing to the market. We've been very fortunate from a market share standpoint, that continues to improve. That's improving because, again, candidly, we're bringing better solutions to clients. So that's -- we think that will improve over time. And net-net, you're seeing strength across -- really across the solution lines. And again, look for it not in any 1 quarter in particular but over the course of the year, you're going to see us continue to progress. As we talked about, mid-single digit or greater goal over the coming years is really our focus from a growth standpoint and you're going to see us do that. Obviously, as you sort of think about the quarters, Q4 was a particularly unique quarter last year. So we're going to be pushing against that as we end the year, but look for continued progress and that's what our team's most excited about.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Sarah DeWitt, JPMoran.","Sarah DeWitt ","As far as -- one of your competitors recently announced a large acquisition. Could you just talk about how your thoughts on how this could impact the competitive dynamics and how important is scale?","Gregory Case","Yes. So from my standpoint -- look, success in our world is -- fundamentally starts with understanding client need and really understanding client need and how it evolves. And we will come back to -- there's always lots written about sort of the market view or the intermediary view or what have you. But frankly, it's all irrelevant when you compare it against sort of how client need is evolving over time. And our perspective is if you get a very clear view on that, and for us, it's all things risk, all things retirement, all things health, how is that evolving over time? And then very specifically, how are we building a unique capability to address that need, both in the traditional way and the emerging risk way. So I'd come back to, if you think about sort of the investments we've made, in Stroz, that was directly against the cyber opportunity. In Townsend, against delegated. In Admix, against health. In cut-e, in talent. And then organically, the investments we've made in data analytics and ACT and in mortgage and et cetera and the exchanges. So from our standpoint, this is -- has to be absolutely maniacally focused on sort of delivering more effectively for client need. And in doing so, we're creating net new demand and competing in the traditional market we think very effectively. Our view is, that approach to the world, combined with what is unique financial flexibility and a focus on translating revenue into free cash flow, we're not only going to serve clients effectively but also create a set of economic results that we think will be very, very positive for our partner shareholders. So from our standpoint, obviously, elements of scale and size matter. You'll continue to see movements in the marketplace, but it's really that focus, we think, is going to determine victory.","Sarah DeWitt ","Okay, great. And then on the restructuring initiative. You talked about how this should then drive improved productivity over the long term. Can you just elaborate on that? Or are you saying that there is potential for expense savings opportunities above and beyond the $450 million that you've identified? And could you just explain that a bit more?","Christa Davies","Absolutely, Sara. So yes it is the answer to your question. We think that if you think about delivering $450 million of savings in 2019, then your run rate exiting '19 is higher than $450 million, so we'll continue to deliver more savings in 2020. But much more importantly than that is productivity and operating leverage built into the platform because when you aggregate your operations under 1 operating model, Aon United, then we are able to apply automation, AI, machine learning and really continue to drive productivity savings in future years in 2020 and '21. And so we're very excited about that future productivity benefits. And that really gives us confidence in long-term margin expansion, driven by top line revenue growth acceleration, improvements in the business mix and productivity.","Gregory Case","One other piece I'd just throw in, Sarah, is Christa and the team have orchestrated this effort. What's also unique about it, it's not just the cost saves now, as you know, and the productivity improvement over time, and this is really sort of an offshoot of Aon United and the leadership approach we've taken. As we continue to connect the firm and see opportunities, this isn't just about cost. This isn't just about efficiency, it's about effectiveness. We believe what we're going to be delivering in service and approach on behalf of clients is going to improve as we get more efficient in the process. So that really is how this is very different than anything we've seen undertaken in our industry and certainly anything we've undertaken before.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Yaron Kinar of Goldman Sachs.","Yaron Kinar","My first question is around organic growth kind of long-term and maybe some thoughts from your perspective in terms of your positioning in the market, especially given some consolidation initiatives we've seen among some of your peers as of late. It seems like your -- with your guidance of kind of mid-single digit organic growth or better over the long term, you're pretty confident in your positioning, but would like to hear more about that if we could. And also maybe a little bit of clarity on the -- kind of what gives you the confidence that over a long period of time, you can achieve organic growth that seems just above and beyond what we've seen others guide to over several years on and across different companies.","Gregory Case","Yes. I'll start with that and Mike and Eric can comment as well. Listen, as we think about this, again, we start with a formulation focused on clients, client need and client evolution in terms of how it's playing out over time. And you see us addressing that need. And what we would remind you of, in the categories we play in, risk, retirement and health, these are highly fragmented in terms of sort of who serves those markets and underpenetrated. So you think about the risk market overall and what's happening in the global economy, of top 10 risks in the world, only 3 really have -- this is, by the way, the top 10 risks based on our client input, only 3 really have great insurance solutions against them. So in essence, the world is becoming more risky, and we have an opportunity to actually keep up. And if you just keep up, we're going to grow. Now, what if we did better than that? What if we actually provided a cyber solution that really provided more insight and helped clients reduce volatility more effectively? Or opportunities to actually protect our balance sheet more effectively. So from our standpoint, we see an underpenetrated risk market in which we can create net new demand and serve clients more effectively over time. And in doing so, ironically, what happens is we do better in our traditional business. So the example Eric described was a great one because not only do we take a great reinsurance client and offer some things from our retirement solutions area, our -- and Eric just talk about this, our reinsurance relationship strengthened and as a result of that combination. So that's really the whole piece. When you think about some the things we've done in government de-risking. The World Bank cat bonds, and I know I talked about it last time, I love this example, because literally, we took 4 countries, Colombia, Chile, Mexico and Peru. We addressed their quake risk in a way that's never been done before. It was an actual investment purchased by pension money, orchestrated by the World Bank. And given back -- that money was actually given back to the economies. That is net new demand. Now I would ask you, how many economies around the world that are underdeveloped or developing, would actually benefit from a cover like that. Then you're off to the races on a brand new category. So for us, this is about addressing current client need and addressing net new, and doing so in a way in which we can both go after both -- do this through organic and in M&A and that's all going to play back to organic growth. So just -- thoughts Eric or Mike, in terms of sort of pieces? Eric, you want to...","Eric Andersen","I would just say, Greg, because I thought the way you described it was perfect, but also just to underscore the Aon United strategy within the firm, I think is really compelling. Mike and I both shared examples, but there are dozens of those examples that exist in the firm where, for example, one of our client leaders working with firms out West to deal with wildfires or bringing insurance linked securities, capability to look at that risk in a new way. Or where there's a commercial risk leader that is handling the traditional insurance business for an insurer, was able to underscore or uncover during the Client Promise discovery period a need for additional reinsurance capital in part of their business and made those connections. So the ability to bring all the different solution lines to any given firm should be able to drive us that growth that we're talking about.","Yaron Kinar","So is it that the degree of underpenetration of insurance in the market has been increasing over time? Or is it your capability of addressing that underpenetrated that's been improving over time?","Gregory Case","Go ahead, Mike.","Michael O'Connor","Well, I think it's both. I mean, the reality is, we see opportunities to continue to build capabilities within our solution lines to serve clients more deeply and bring more clients into the firm, and that's underpinned by our investments in data analytics. And it's also crossing capabilities across solution lines. And I think we highlighted Aon Client Treaty where that does not happen without insurance and reinsurance capabilities. And you could think about some of the things we're doing with our retail clients, bringing reinsurance tools to bear like Impact Forecasting where we're bringing real insight through data and analytics to our retail clients. So I think it's both.","Gregory Case","Yes. The other piece, Yaron, just -- and we've talked about this on previous calls. This, for us, is not just conceptual. This is our life every day around the battle for relevance, and it really is a battle for relevance in entire industry. In essence, are we helping companies address volatility in a more effective way? And I think you can make an argument, the answer is the industry as a whole, us in the middle of it, has not. We have not kept up. If you look at kind of claims as a percent of GDP back in the '60s and '70s, it's kind of essentially 1.5%, 2%, give or take. It grows, by the way, virtually every year until the late '80s to about 3%, 3.5%. And then systematically it's come down every year since. So it's back to where it was in the 60s. So net-net, as the global economy has grown -- if you think about another fact, 75% of the market cap of the S&P 500 is driven off of intangible assets. That's fundamentally changed from 1975 where it was about to 25%. And so as that world has changed, we have not collectively kept up. We have not actually addressed volatility. We see that as a huge opportunity to actually help clients grow and drive opportunity for them and reduce risk. You've also seen us, by the way, done -- we've done some analysis with some very large tech companies. And by the way, some of these large tech companies are bigger than our insurers. They don't need the capital to protect their balance sheet, but we've used insurance solutions as a way to actually create demand for them. In fact, they put a demand in the marketplace, so it's way beyond insurance. They're putting a product in the marketplace and consumers are buying it because we've actually provided cover to protect them from cyber risk on their product. And so these are kinds of things we're doing to create net new demand that we think a real opportunity, and frankly drive relevance, not just for us, but for the global -- insurers in the global economy.","Yaron Kinar","Got it. And my second question was just around the effective tax rate, so you're guiding that down for the year, to below 18%. With some guidance expected on the BEAT later this year. Any thoughts as to how the effective tax rate plays out in '19 and beyond?","Christa Davies","Yes. Thanks for the question. We did previously give guidance of 18% for this year, and given the impacts of discretes we saw in Q3, the 2018 full year tax rate will be below 18%. As I look back historically, Yaron, what I would say is, exclusive of the impacts of discretes, which can be positive or negative and unpredictable in any year, our historical underlying tax rate for the last 3 years was approximately 18%. And so we're not giving guidance going forward but I think that gives you some sense.","Yaron Kinar","Just asking about the BEAT tax itself. Any clarifications that are expected this year?","Christa Davies","Yes. So I guess, Yaron, the way we think about it is an all-in underlying rate, and what we would say is if you look at the last 3 years, it's been about 18%. And for 2018 in particular, it will be slightly below 18% really just driven by the discretes you saw in Q3.","Operator","Our next question from Kai Pan.","Q \u2013 Unidentified Analyst","Thank you very much for making Eric and Mike available for this discussion. I just want to follow up around the conversation to ask Eric and Mike. What has changed in terms of your day-to-day operations in the responsibility under Aon United. And you gave a lot of good example how the work could drive collaboration and drive growth. But are there any execution risks or potential pitfalls you are worried about in terms of speed of execution as well as accountability?","Gregory Case","We think, Kai, as they respond to their day-to-day piece. I'd start with what are the changes beyond just the copresidents. Remember, we talked about a single P&L. We talked about a single opco and a single brand, all steps that, frankly driven by Eric and Mike and our broader team, sort of really were a catalyst to sort of accelerate Aon United. And has implications, of course, for their day-to-day, which they'll talk about, but it really was built on that foundation. So thoughts, gentlemen?","Michael O'Connor","I can jump in, Greg. I think as Eric highlighted, Eric and I have a long history of working together. And I think it's been -- this is the culmination of that to actually bring to life Aon United. And I think our leadership team has stepped up over a number of years. We have intimacy in that group. We have great connectivity. So I think as we come together and unite the firm, run through 1 global operating committee, have great confidence that not only will we not miss a beat, I think we have expectations we can accelerate our execution capabilities. Eric?","Eric Andersen","And I would just say the connectivity that we're trying to bring to the firm as a partnership, I think is really beginning to get momentum. And Mike and I have been spending a fair amount of time around the world with our colleagues and our clients, just reinforcing the fact that we have to work, work closer together and that the reality is the clients are pushing us to do it. They're looking at the degree of risk that they are facing, and they're looking at the solutions that we have across the firm. And we said earlier about bringing down structural barriers, the ability for us to bring the entire company to help solve a client's problem builds great momentum inside the firm. You asked about risks as well, and I would just say the execution risk for us is speed. The clients problems are here and they're now, and if we don't find a way to solve them and be able to bring the firm together as quickly as we need to do, then they'll be solved by someone else in some other way. So I think what drives us the most is the fact that we see the need. We know we have the tools, it's just how fast we can get it together to get it in front of the clients.","Q \u2013 Unidentified Analyst","That's great. My second question and margin front. If you're looking into 2019, your cost saving $450 million versus $300 million this year would be $150 million. That equates about 130 basis points of margin expansion, if assuming half of that flows through bottom line, would be like 60 basis points. And your core margin expansion, underlying core margin expansion, you mentioned year-to-date about 50 basis points. If you can sustain that, you could add up to like, more than 100 basis points year-over-year margin expansion into 2019. Christa, I'm just wondering, is that a right way to think about your margin potential going forward?","Christa Davies","Kai, we don't obviously give margin guidance going forward. But what we can say is we're very excited about continuing to be able to expand margins through 3 key sources. One is accelerating revenue growth, which you've seen in calendar year '19. But you also saw, for the last couple of years, we've been continuing to accelerate organic revenue growth and M&A's contributing to total revenue growth of 10% year-to-date. The second is mix shift. We continue to invest in higher revenue growth, higher margin businesses, both organically and inorganically. And Greg gave some great descriptions of those businesses earlier. And the third is the restructuring savings and ongoing productivity beyond 2019. And so we feel really good about the future margin expansion potential of the firm.","Q \u2013 Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Last one, if I may. It's on your cyber and also transaction liability business. You said it had been growing double digits. I just wonder how big are this business relative to your overall portfolio and specific on the silent cyber initiative you're doing, you worry about it becoming competitor of your clients, not the clients on the insurance side but also you're using reinsurance. Is there any residual balance sheet risk to Aon?","Gregory Case","There's -- just to start with that one, there's no residual balance sheet risk. As you know, Kai, we're not in the business of sort of taking balance sheet risk. Ours is sort of to connect capital with need, and we do that around the world with our insurers and with alternative capital and all the different pieces around that. What we would say on the cyber side, just generally, is look, this is about net opportunity and it really starts again with our recurring theme around client need. Clients, if you think about it -- we've talked about it before. And the numbers are sort of connected to cyber trauma. Incurred $450 billion of pain, of loss in 2017 and against that's -- that's against $3 billion to $4 billion in premium that was written. So we might be the largest and it might be growing double digit and we're very excited about it. And by the way, our team's done an exceptional job. When you think about $3 billion to $4 billion in the context of $450 billion, Kai, that's massive opportunity to help clients succeed. And then remember, that $450 billion as I described on previous calls is really a North American figure. The European figure is close to 0 because they didn't actually need to report cyber. It wasn't required. Until May of 2018. So just a few months ago, the European data laws sort of kicked in, and those are incredibly onerous. So the cyber connected loss, not -- connected loss is going to go to $1 trillion on the dial, and the industry has responded with $3 billion to $4 billion. So for us, we see massive opportunity, for our clients, if we get this right, when we get this right. Frankly, for the industry as well and real opportunity. And so this is back to the idea that Mike and Eric were talking about in terms of emerging real risks that we can help clients succeed. And again, as Eric described, if we don't sort it for them and solve it, they're going to find other ways to do it. We see this as a substantial opportunity.","Q \u2013 Unidentified Analyst","Okay. How big are they now relative to your portfolio?","Gregory Case","Very small, very, very small. These are kind of new initiatives we've put in place, think good representative examples of sort of steps we've taken but they're very, very small, tiny in terms of the broader overall Aon but we think they have tremendous potential.","Operator","You're next question is coming from Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo.","Elyse Greenspan","My first question. Pretty strong Reinsurance growth this quarter. You guys had pretty -- a tougher comp last Q3, about 10% organic when you adjust for rev-rec, and you have a 20% comp in the fourth quarter, obviously a lot of reinstatements and cap ons after the hurricanes last year. How do you see that? Is that a headwind or is it something that you can kind of offset to a certain degree like you did this quarter? And should we think about that being -- I know you highlighted the 50 basis points of kind of core underlying margin expansion year-to-date. Is that going to be a headwind in the fourth quarter just because Reinsurance is such high margin business or does it help that I guess you have less revenue coming through in the fourth quarter?","A - Gregory Case","Well, listen, overall, again, you just got to step back and look at the trend line, sort of what our colleagues have been able to do in Reinsurance Solutions and I would just highlight, it's been exceptional. If you look at the last few years and our ability to actually win new clients and do more with clients is actually continuing to progress. And you're seeing that, Elyse, and that's played out sort of in the first 9 much of the year. Look, Q4 -- I just want to emphasize that trend line, that overall progress is exceptional, and the team's been great on the treaty side, on the fact side, the alternative side just absolutely exceptional, and I think we see that trend line. Again, we always come back to sort of those trend line on a particular quarter. As you highlight, Q4 is unique. It's unique sort of in history, it's, by the way, our smallest quarter as you've described. The comp is very unique. We know what was going on last year is going to create a sort of headwinds in the fourth quarter, no doubt, in terms of where we are. But the overall time line and the overall trend has been exceptionally positive. But Q4, the comp is -- there's no doubt, very, very difficult from that standpoint. Eric, anything you'd add to that?","A - Eric Andersen","Yes. I would just add, Greg, a couple of things, One, we continue to see good success in the build out of the core treaty business in terms of new clients and expanded business with existing clients. Our facultative business in the third quarter was exceptionally strong and we were able also to do new things with some new client groups, whether it's government entities or firms like that, that are a little broader than the normal remit. People think of reinsurance for insurance companies. I think the combination of the 3 has been positive for us all year. And so it's led to a good 9 months.","A - Gregory Case","I would say -- this goes back to, Elyse -- very specifically, trends, exceptionally positive. Q4, definitely, definitely a major hurdle as we think about sort of the comparison.","Elyse Greenspan","And as we think about a few months forward and as you start having conversation with clients, do you guys have kind of a high level little view on what kind of prices we could expect in the Reinsurance market January 1 renewals?","A - Gregory Case","As we talked over time, really don't spend a lot of time on the -- talking about sort of predictions on the pricing front in particular, just given sort of our analytics and what we do day-to-day with our clients. Overall, we'd say, Elyse, when you look at pricing against sort of the progress for the first 9 months of the year, it's really sort of continues to sort of being at par, if you will. There's pluses and minuses depending on sort of what you've encountered as a client and what kind of trauma you've encountered. But overall, the overall marketplace for us continues to be relatively stable.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. And then one on the expense saves. I know we had a few earlier questions. So you guys are at $308 million, the end of your target for this year was $300 million. And Christa, are you implying that you guys aren't, even if you guys get well ahead of that by the end of this year, that you guys won't potentially raise the program again? Or is it just that, that's not something that you kind of looked in to date? I just kind of want to understand how we can tie that all together and our thoughts around that.","Christa Davies","Sure, Elyse. I guess the simple thing I would say is we're not in the business of updating guidance. It's a 3-year program. We've got until the end of 2019, and we're very excited about the progress we've made to date. And we're on track to deliver $300 million of savings this year and the $450 million of savings next year.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, great. And then one last question. Repurchase was a little bit lighter than what we had modeled. Was there anything in the quarter that caused that to slow down a little bit? Or it's just kind of timing, when buyback kind of comes during the year, maybe your stock actually did better this quarter. Did that play into kind of thoughts around repurchasing shares?","Christa Davies","Yes. So Elyse, as you know, we allocate capital based on return on capital, cash on cash returns. Share repurchase remains the highest return on capital opportunity across Aon. What did happen in the quarter is we did accelerate $80 million of pension contributions from future years into Q3. And so that was 1 factor that impacted us. But long-term, we see a very highly valued internal valuation of Aon, which is why the return on capital opportunity is so substantial for us.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Meyer Shields of KBW.","Meyer Shields","I have two, I think, somewhat related questions. The first is based on really, everything that you talked about on this and previous calls, should we expect what you term the market impact to be less of a factor in either direction going forward?","A - Gregory Case","Again as we come back, we talk about market impact, it really is the insured value part of the world and the pricing part of the world and as we've described before, insured values, sort of if you think about those actually has a more material impact over time than the pricing piece. And all I've tried to highlight is, if you think about sort of what we said on previous calls around the influence of pricing, that hasn't changed that dramatically. But if you think about the long-term view, maybe Eric, you want to start. Mike, you want to chime in?","A - Eric Andersen","Yes. I would just say, Greg, that the overall structure of the business remains largely unchanged from the beginning of the year. Even with natural catastrophes in Japan, Florida Panhandle, some of the man-made losses like the Genoa bridge disaster. The total cap budgets are largely in line with what the reinsurers and the insurers expected. So our senses is that with the supply and demand that was there at the beginning of the year, that's relatively unchanged. I would say the interesting part though is we try and bring that capital to provide cover for new risk, I think that's where there's growth in the business.","A - Michael O'Connor","Yes. And the only thing I would add is with our investments in the Reinsurance business and insurance business and data and analytics, we think about this risk by risk. We are spending our time making sure we understand our clients intimately well and can think about the right answer for them, and we will source solutions for them anywhere in the world that makes sense.","A - Gregory Case","And the final piece, I think to throw into this, Meyer, is the following. Listen, these conversations around pricing in this marketplace are obviously important and relevant, et cetera. We try to put them in context. And again, ours is not about pricing, ours is about client value and how we deliver on that. But what I really want to come back to is, this is about Aon, right? This is about, literally, we put 6% up, sort of in, a though -- in the quarter. It's about progress, and if you think about sort of the overall portfolio of Aon, the retirement side, the investment side, the health side. What we do in data and analytics more broadly. Less and less of our business is even connected to this in any way, shape or form and even in the context of the risk business, less and less -- obviously important, but less and less relevant over time. So I just want to put in the overall context in terms of sort of how this fits into the broader Aon portfolio, single opco, single operating model, single P&L.","Meyer Shields","That's helpful, that's really where I was driving at. So that really clarifies things. Second question, and clearly, I understand the bottom line impact of what you're talking about. But how do you think about areas of technology actually reducing risk. And I guess, autonomous cars, if I mean we could flip a switch and have them tomorrow, would be a good example of one major current risk significantly evaporating. How big of a factor is that?","A - Gregory Case","Again, this is back to -- if you think about -- sort of -- I think I understand your question. Will technology actually reduce volatility and risk in the world over time? And we would say, listen, we would love to find areas where that's true. More and more of what our clients actually come to us with, and this is a point Eric and Mike were making, they come to us with implications on how technology changes the business model but also changes the risk profile, and in a number of respects, increases the risk profile. And at this point in time, with technology change, even if they think they have it figured it out, there's massive uncertainty. So for us, this is the perfect time to sort of be in a changing global economy in which there is so much change going on, and risk overall is going up. By the way, it's not just risk in the classic risk business. It's risk in the retirement world. It's risk in the health world. So it really is volatility in the world today that we think is greater than ever before. I described intellectual property. All these things are sort of areas that actually are changing over time, and net-net, you'd be very hard-pressed not to say that the basket of risk in the world today is not going up. And to the point we've made on the call already, ours is the question of can we maintain relevance? Can we keep up? Can we bring solutions, either capital or risk transfer solutions that matter, retirement solutions, health solutions that matter, that help our clients improve performance or reduce their volatility? So that's why in the end, this is really about how we evolve and why that evolution can't be the traditional evolution. It isn't just about getting bigger, it's really got to be getting better and bringing higher quality to clients.","Operator","Last question is coming from Adam Klauber [ph].","Unidentified Analyst","Could you flesh out the New Ventures Group? It sounds very interesting. So a couple of follow-ups. One, I think you relate that at -- it really has to do with increasing value for a client. You gave 1. Could you maybe give another example or 2 of what those activities could be? Two, could that be an area where you direct more -- do some more acquisitions? And then three, and I think you mentioned your first. Does this area involve more potential activity with private equity and venture capital?","A - Gregory Case","Yes. So Adam, just to step back. In essence, this is just another step in the journey. We think an important one, but another step in the journey. Mike and Eric both talked about innovation and what we're doing to bring new solutions to clients. New Ventures is essentially saying, listen, we've gone proven approaches. They work exceptionally well. Can we be faster? This is to Eric's point on speed matters. Can we be faster at identifying opportunities and then scaling them globally? So this is an internal effort in which we got a group of senior leaders. Again, one of the manifestations of having the single opco and single P&L and our copresidents doing what they're doing, it's allowed us to free up leadership time to focus really more strongly on this. If you think about sort of what we're doing in data and analytics and all the pieces around that and John Bruno's area. Efforts around -- really across the firm. Ours is really about how we can accelerate those. So that's fundamentally what really New Ventures is about, and you'll see us pick 2 or 3 or 4 areas and we'll have a portfolio in which we're really trying to identify where and how we can accelerate. This is not about third-party investment, private equity investment, it's not about that at all. It's really about how we take ideas and scale them more globally, more effectively. And we've got, I'm not going to go through the portfolio today. We want you to see them evolve over time. I think they're going to be pretty interesting. But -- and reasonably significant but we have to prove it out and we have to drive it. But we know without this capability, it's very hard to actually get enough energy and effort to really scale something effectively. And that's really what New Ventures is about and I think under Tony Goland's leadership, I think with our broader group across the group, it will be a very interesting set of steps that will strengthen the firm.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. And then on Health Solutions, a very strong quarter. New business in EMEA region. Is that more multinational clients? Or is that more European or other EMEA-based clients. And I guess is there -- is that a growing pipeline in that type of business?","A - Gregory Case","Listen, first of all, thanks for recognizing and drawing out health. Again, as you know, we love this category. We think globally it represents a monumental opportunity to assist clients and what is really a frankly, pressing and intensifying set of needs, back to the question on is demand going up or going down? We think it's going up. And what's going on in EMEA, by the way, you're seeing throughout the course of the year, across the world. It's not only serving local clients with what we think are better sense of solutions. It's also serving global clients who want more consistent health beats around the world, very, very important. And in addition, augmenting what they have, voluntary benefits and things that actually make the value proposition stronger. So you're seeing that. In EMEA, in this quarter, you've seen it across the world, and we think it's actually going to continue strongly. And it's, again, one of the reasons we like this category so much.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And you touched on it, but voluntary benefits in the U.S. Strong growth there. Is that your increasing your product set, increasing your capabilities? I guess what's driving some expansion there?","A - Gregory Case","Again, it's both. Again, back to client demand. Clients really want to see new opportunities, they want to see solutions that actually improve well-being and you go beyond a specific product area. And you've -- sort of you've seen us bring a number of new solutions to markets that have actually served, again, our clients well. And we think have great trends ahead of them.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. And 1 final for Christa. On the free cash, I think you mentioned in the range of $600 million plus would be freed up in the next 2 years that had been used in restructuring, if I'm correct. Is that weighted more towards '19 or '20 to the extent you could say?","A - Christa Davies","Yes. So Adam, what we would say is as you look at the slide deck, I'm just finding the slide. We've actually outlined this. So it's $650 million of cash flow reduction. So a reduction in use of cash on pension restructuring and CapEx. It's Page 23 of the slide deck posted on our website. So $650 million, it's not just from restructuring. It's a reduction in CapEx and it's reduction in pension contributions as well.","Operator","Thank you. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Greg Case for closing remarks.","Gregory Case","I just want to say everybody thank you very much for joining call, really appreciate it and look forward to our discussion next quarter. Thanks very much.","Operator","That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

Welcome to Aon plc\u2019s Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all parties will be in listen-only mode until the question-and-answer portion of today\u2019s call. I would also like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded.

Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our second quarter 2019 results as well as having been posted on our website.","Now, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, CEO of Aon plc.","Greg Case","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter 2019 conference call. Joining me here today is our CFO, Christa Davies. In addition, we have our two Co-Presidents, Eric Andersen and Mike O\u2019Connor, joining the discussion to help lead our Q&A session with their frontline perspective of client impact and Aon United at work.","Like previous quarters, we posted a detailed financial presentation on our website, as we focus our time of these quarterly calls to provide you more insight into longer-term view for the firm.","I\u2019d like to start today by acknowledging the tremendous work of my Aon colleagues around the world. Their collective efforts continue to strengthen the firm and create long-term momentum, reflected through strong operational results in the second quarter, including 6% organic revenue growth; I would highlight this is the fourth consecutive quarter of achieving 6% organic revenue growth, reflecting continued acceleration of our historical trend; substantial operating margin expansion of 240 basis points; 13% operational income growth; and 9% EPS growth, overcoming further FX headwinds in the quarter.","Our results reflect continued progress this year and are in direct reflection of the strategic actions we\u2019ve progressively taken to drive Aon United and achieve our potential, operating as one united global professional services firm.","As we\u2019ve previously discussed, we\u2019ve been laying the foundation for Aon United for over a decade, evolving our portfolio, investing in new content capability and breaking down internal barriers, all focused on increasing our relevance and strengthen our ability to serve clients.","Helping the client improve operational performance, reduce volatility or strengthen their capital position is at the core of our mission. In today\u2019s evolving world, nearly every organization, industry and economy are confronting greater challenges than ever before, while at the same time many organizations report that they are less prepared than ever before. This is what we\u2019re hearing from CEOs and other business leaders across the globe. And it was validated in the global survey Aon conducts every two years.","The latest report released in April was informed by the largest number of respondents to ever participate, reflecting insights from more than 2,600 clients across 33 industries, spanning small, medium and large organizations from 60 countries around the world.","One critical insight is that organizations must be more prepared for a broad range of traditional risks, such as a slowing economy, damage to brand and volatile global trade conditions, as well as emerging risks such as cyber attacks, intellectual property and business interruption from non-physical risks that threaten their ability to continue driving growth, protecting their assets and developing talent.","Further, a list of the top 15 ranked challenges within the survey reveals another insight. Most of these risks are underserved, if at all today, because they\u2019re not well understood due to less historical experience and data available to predict, measure or manage these challenges. As a result, risk readiness has declined to its lowest levels in 12 years.","Only 12% of those responded in the survey reported that they use risk modeling and a mere 24% said they could quantify their top 10 risks. The complexity of the situation our clients face today is substantial, perhaps more concerning that these challenges are very likely to grow in intensity over the next few years.","New risks will become even more prominent, including the dynamics of an aging workforce, the impact of climate change, the growing prevalence of cyber-risks and the emergence of disruptive technologies.","Reflecting on the implications for Aon, client demand is higher than ever before and clients are pushing us to find new ways to address their growing needs. As we said previously, we must innovate faster than our clients on all these topics to stay relevant and create value on their behalf. The steps we have taken around Aon Untied combined with significant investment and focus on content and capability all reinforce and amplify our ability to increase our relevance with clients.","At Aon, we\u2019re responding, we\u2019re focused on brining the full force of our firm to our clients, by developing innovative solutions and applying data and analytics to better inform and prepare them for their future.","I\u2019d like to highlight one example that demonstrates how Aon United led to an innovative solution addressing a common challenge that organizations of all sizes continue to face. Managing their ever-increasing healthcare costs will not impact in their ability to attract and retain key talent. I\u2019d also note that the failure to attract and retain top talent was ranked among the top 15 risks identified by the client survey.","In response to broad client demand, our team came together with actuaries, data scientists, user design experts, software developers and subject matter experts across solution lines and in combination with the IT capability of Aon Business Services to deliver a data-driven cloud-based tool called Aon Architect.","Aon Architect uses machine learning science to help clients design optimal health benefit packages that balance employer financial objectives and employee satisfaction. This innovative tool is a customizable interactive model that identifies the most cost effective and relevant combinations across thousands of different benefit program options based on an employer\u2019s actual population demographics and Aon\u2019s proprietary employee perception data.","Aon Architect launched in 2018 has already been used with nearly 100 clients so far in 2019. That\u2019s just one example of how we\u2019re responding to broad client demand with innovation. We\u2019ve also organized focused teams of leaders to dedicate more time to value creation for client-driven solutions that can be applied more broadly and faster with similar clients or industries.","Our Enterprise Client Group was formed to lead Aon Untied efforts with targeted clients, by identifying superior tailor-made solutions that address their specific business objectives. And we established our New Ventures Group to accelerate industry-leading innovation, scale our capabilities with greater speed to market and expand our relevance with clients.","Last quarter, we announced that the New Ventures Group would formally sponsor our Intellectual Property Solutions business. This quarter, the group announced the formation of a public sector partnership which will enhance our position to serve governments and leading social sector organizations as clients.","Obviously, these institutions play a very significant and active role in the global economy. Building innovation at scale to support the mission of these groups at the national, regional and local levels represents a significant long-term growth opportunity.","For example, we\u2019re investing in capabilities to help governments more effectively manage natural disaster risk, deliver housing stability and create more resilient public balance sheets. In addition, the work we recently completed for the World Bank is a powerful illustration of potential impact. Bringing together Chile, Mexico, Peru and Colombia, we placed the largest ever sovereign risk transaction in the history of the insurance market using parametric triggers to protect against earthquake risk.","Our Aon United efforts put in place over the last decade are translating into accelerated revenue growth, as you can see from the upward trend of 3% organic growth in 2014 and 2015; 4% in 2016 and 2017; 5% in 2018; and now 6% year-to-date in 2019 as well as 6% for the trailing 12 months period. We are confident that these actions were continued to be a driving factor, reinforcing our goal of mid-single-digit organic revenue growth or greater over the long-term.","In summary, our clients are demanding, better insight, advice and solutions to navigate and address the complex and evolving challenges they face. We continue to strengthen our ability to create value on behalf of clients through investments and not just industry-leading, but many examples, industry-defining content and capability, while also achieving the strong financial results and increased value to our shareholders.","With that overview, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Christa for her thoughts on our progress in the first half of the year and long-term outlook for continued shareholder value creation. Christa?","Christa Davies","Thanks so much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg highlighted, the steps we\u2019re taking to drive Aon United in response to increasing client demand combined with significant investment in content and capability, is amplifying our ability to serve clients and our ability to deliver improved operational and financial performance.","We delivered continued progress to both the quarter and year-to-date. For the first half of the year, we\u2019ve translated strong organic revenue growth into double-digit operating income and earnings per share growth, while also delivering on restructuring initiatives and funding significant investments across the firm that will drive future growth.","As I reflect on our performance through the first half of the year. First, as Greg noted previously, organic revenue growth both year-to-date and for the trailing 12 months with 6% overall, reflecting continued improvement compared to our historical trends as we deliver on our goal of mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth over the long-term.","As mentioned previously, in addition to strong performance across our core portfolio from net new business generation and improved retention. Our disciplined focus on maximizing return on invested capital continues to shape the portfolio towards our highest growth and return opportunities. As highlighted by the divestiture of certain businesses and Retirement Solutions in the second quarter.","Second, we delivered strong operational improvement with double-digit operating income growth of 10%, operating margin expansion of 210 basis points, and double-digit EPS growth of 11% for the first half of the year.","As we noted in the earnings material, FX rate continue to have an unfavorable impact from results in the second quarter due primarily to a stronger U.S. dollar, resulting in significant net unfavorable impact of approximately $0.18 or $53 million impact on operating income. I would also note that the second quarter included $5 million of additional interest expense resulting from the $750 million of 3.75% senior notes issued on May 2, 2019.","Going forward, we expect approximately $81 million at interest expense per quarter, reflecting both the issuance of additional term debt and higher average debt balances compared to the second quarter. Additionally, we continue to successfully execute against our restructuring initiatives with $38 million of incremental savings in the second quarter.","I would highlight that we provide an update to the restructuring program in this quarter, as we are now two quarters away from the end of the program, and a better clarity into projects and program initiatives. We now expect to deliver $510 million of annualized savings in 2019 and $535 million of annualized savings in 2020, reflecting an increase of $35 million in total expected savings.","Total cash investment is expected to increase a $100 million, reflecting a $125 million in cash restructuring charges offset by $25 million decrease in CapEx associated with restructuring program. All restructuring charges will be completed by Q4 of 2019.","Our ongoing restructuring initiatives are driving expense savings near-term, but more importantly, they\u2019re enabling growth of the firm as we unlock additional operating leverage through our Aon Business Services single operating model. For example, we\u2019re driving digitization within our centers of excellence as part of our Aon Business Services organization.","Our centers of excellence were created to focus on automation of common services across Aon with the goal of increasing process efficiency and reducing manual error-prone activity. More specifically, we are automating the manual aggregation of insurance data from carriers to improve data quality and accuracy. Reducing turnaround time for clients and enhancing the overall client experience.","We can apply similar automation to a variety of common services across our businesses to reduce late time, improved quality and accuracy as well as free uptime for our client-facing colleagues to be more productive. We anticipate automating approximately 500,000 hours in 2019.","Looking beyond 2019 in our restructuring initiatives, organic growth, portfolio mix and ongoing productivity improvements are expected to drive continued operational performance and long-term core operating margin expansion annually. Similar to the 70 to 80 basis points of operating margin improvement achieved annually over the last decade.","Lastly, free cash flow declined $47 million to $255 million. Strong operational performance through the first half of the year and decline in restructuring cash outflows was more than offset by approximately $85 million of net cash payments made in the first quarter related to legacy litigation.","As we think about cash flow generation going forward, we\u2019re focused on maximizing the translation of acceleration revenue growth into the highest level of free cash flow through three ways: operating income growth; continued progress on working capital initiatives and structural uses of cash winding down.","2018 was the peak year for cash usage as shown in our presentation Slide 27. Declining uses of cash for restructuring CapEx and pensions collectively are expected to free up $585 million of free cash flow by the end of 2020. With the update to restructuring estimate this quarter, we now expect to modestly higher cash outflows related to the program in 2020, primarily offset by a $35 million increase in annualized savings, resulting in a neutral impact to our strong free cash flow growth outlook from 2018 to 2020.","We continue to have significant upside to a base of more than $1.45 billion of free cash flow in 2018 prior to any operating income growth or working capital improvement. Together, these inputs give us confidence in our ability to deliver on our goal of double-digit growth in free cash flow over the long-term.","Further, we have the opportunity for incremental debt, while maintaining current investment-grade rating. As EBITDA grows, restructuring costs wind down and pension liability improves, providing significant financial flexibility over the next few years to further invest in value creation or return of capital to shareholders.","We are diligent about maximizing return on capital and make capital allocation decisions through this discipline. Share repurchase remains the highest return on capital activity today, given our free cash valuation and outlook, highlighted by the $1.15 billion of share repurchase year-to-date.","In summary, our Aon United initiative continue to create momentum as highlighted by our strong top and bottom line performance through the first half of the year, including significant investments to strengthen the long-term growth profile for our firm.","Our disciplined approach to return on invested capital, combined with expected significant free cash flow growth and increased debt opportunity over the next few years, provides financial flexibility to unlock significant shareholder value creation over the long-term.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to the operator, and we\u2019d be delighted to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Dave Styblo from Jefferies.","David Styblo","Hi, good morning. Thanks for the questions. Greg, I want to maybe start out with a higher level question that the broader management team could answer over the next few years here. So you guys have been running a quarterly organic growth rate of 6% for a year now as you guys mentioned. I know you\u2019re targeting mid-single-digits or better over time. And it seems like you\u2019re already in that range. Curious what has maybe gone better than expected and how sustainable are the results.","Maybe in that context you could talk a little bit about the survey work that you did and bringing value to the clients in the areas of risk readiness and what Aon can do different than competitors that allow you more opportunities to serve the client.","Greg Case","Well, Dave, I appreciate the question. Really \u2013 it is really very much at the heart of what we mean when we talk about Aon United. In essence, we have an approach, which as we break down barriers and bring our global firm to bear on behalf of client needs opportunities come to pass and they\u2019re very, very strong.","But you start really with client need. The survey I described is really quite unique. It relates to survey that goes out every two years. It\u2019s around the world. We actually quantify with our or ask our clients what are the things that are most on your mind, what affects your business. And I\u2019m looking at the survey going back to 2007, and you essentially look at the top 10 risks and ask the question, which one actually are \u2013 which ones are insured and which ones are not, which ones can you really match capital. And when you look in 2019, of the top-10 risks, only one, only one is fully insured, 4 others are partially insured and the rest 5 are not insured at all.","So the opportunities from a client demand standpoint continue to go up. That means our world as we lean into it from an Aon standpoint is not just winning from \u2013 in the current business, which we\u2019re then very, very effective at and very, very fortunate. Win rates are at an all-time high and momentum is very positive. But really it\u2019s also the net new. It\u2019s addressing client issues around cyber, intellectual property and all things that come with that.","And in that regard, what we\u2019ve been able to do is actually think about a world in which how can we address client needs more effectively over time. And for us, that is really across every solution line we have, all the pieces and you are seeing progress in each one of those.","So our view is we are making good progress as we\u2019ve highlighted. When we describe the impact of Aon United it really is around, truly around client value and growth and greater opportunity for our colleagues. And you\u2019ve seen us drive net new client opportunities from the Aon United behavior. You\u2019ve seen net new ideas and innovations around cyber, IP, mortgage and reinsurance for an example, delegated sort of on the retirement investment side.","You continue to see share gains, I described before. And really, you\u2019ve also seen portfolio mix in terms of sort of what we\u2019re doing overall. And when you think about \u2013 this really comes back to kind of how our colleagues are working together in a little bit different way. And I\u2019ve used examples, we used examples on the call and maybe Mike, pick an example so that highlights sort of overall, sort of how the colleagues are working together differently and really to Dave\u2019s question, what does it mean at the client level and how does it affect what we do.","Michael O\u2019Connor","Sure, Greg. Maybe I just pick a client, an existing great client of ours, happens to be in the financial services space, and plays in the payments world. This a great client of ours, but with our Enterprise Client Group, we\u2019ve identified a process by which we want to have colleagues take a lead for us and actually have our entire team that was connected around the world step back and think about this clients, really think about the strategic priorities that that client is facing and how we might actually help serve them more effectively.","And in this case, they step back and say this client had a couple of things that really popped out that we thought were important. One was they\u2019re in a war for talent. At the end of the day, if you think about the payments world, this is a technology game and they\u2019re actually in a war for talent around technology talent.","The second was their core business. How do they drive retention in their payments products and increase spend with their clients. And the third was they\u2019re always in the world trying to think about how they reduce risk and pre-deploy capital. Our team came together across the globe and tackled these 3 strategic priorities for that client.","In the war for talent, our health team and our rewards and performance team came together and thought about how can we better optimize the entire proposition to their employee base, whether that\u2019d be existing employees, they can help retain or attract new ones. And working with that client we\u2019re able to improve the actual proposition that they could give to their employees.","Our Affinity team jumped in, in their core product, and brought together our proprietary insights around \u2013 the analytics around their insurance offerings on their payment products. And by actually optimizing those solutions in the marketplace, we actually improved the client experience around claims and that led to better retention and increase spend on their core products.","And lastly, we looked at their retirement plans and said there is an opportunity here to de-risk. In the environment they\u2019re in, we can de-risk and re-deploy the capital. You come away across those three strategic priorities we\u2019re able to touch and improve with that client, their operating performance and make them more competitive. And to us, that\u2019s the manifestation of Aon United and that\u2019s what really inspires our teams to have impact with clients.","Greg Case","And I think, Mike, just to pick up on the point, because I think what you\u2019re describing is our enterprise client network, which is essentially a group of high performing individual client executives who deal with our largest clients. We\u2019ve created a group that actually pulls them all together. So instead of just having one individual insight, we\u2019re able to create the pattern recognition that actually allows us to scale that insight and get it across the globe in a way that brings all of our solution lines to bear on any given particular client problem.","So it really does help us consistently improve as time goes on, but also to learn from each individual client experience and get it to all of our leading client executives. So, Dave, all of our questions, I promise we won\u2019t answer at that length. But you\u2019re \u2013 this is truly fundamental. This is really what\u2019s happening at the cool phase, which we think is different and we think really changes. It isn\u2019t just about winning in the current world; it\u2019s changing the size of the pie and doing things on behalf of clients that actually help them succeed.","So we\u2019re \u2013 you can tell, we\u2019re pretty excited about it. We think it\u2019s having an impact. And we think we will continue to build over time. But thanks for the question, really appreciate it.","David Styblo","Thanks. Just a quick follow-up for Christa on the cost savings, can you talk a little bit about what the additional fine there is? And then as I look at the guidance for this year to achieve this year\u2019s $510 million target, the average in the second half would imply a quarterly run-rate of about $140 million, I suspect that would actually be ramping up as you exit the year, but even if we took the $140 million average and annualize that, I get about $560 million of savings for 2020.","So my question for that side would be: why isn\u2019t your 2020 target more like the \u2013 higher than the $535 million that you\u2019ve established?","Christa Davies","Thank you so much for that question, Dave. So I think your first was quite a long question, so let me try and answer it and you can come back and tell me I\u2019ve missed a bit. So I think the first question was where are the activities coming from that are increasing the program. And I guess, what I would tell you is we\u2019re two quarters away from the end of the program until we got better clarity into the projects and program initiatives, both the projects currently being implemented as well as the addition of certain remaining projects in the program.","So to give an example, Dave, a lot of the increases in workforce reduction, we formed great partnerships with outsourced providers to actually outsource significant activities to centers of excellence in India and Poland. And they\u2019re actually improving the quality and standardizing processes for us and reducing error rates for our clients. And so, we\u2019re thrilled about that outcome, whether that\u2019s occurring in shared services in areas of finance or whether it\u2019s occurring in our middle office as I describe with the automation of claims and premium processing for clients.","And so, we\u2019re very excited about that sort of \u2013 that level activity, because it\u2019s overall improving efficiency and improving quality. Then I think your next question was really around the math of \u2013 on the second half of the year. I think your estimates were roughly right in the second half of the year. We\u2019re, obviously, improving savings in the second half of the year.","I think your next question was around the $535 million in 2020 and why doesn\u2019t higher. I mean, I guess, you could always ask that question, Dave, but I think we feel really confident about delivering the $535 million in 2020 and we have great visibility to that now that we are two quarters away from the end of the program. And the last thing I would say is all restructuring charges will finish in Q4 2019 as originally anticipated.","David Styblo","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Yaron Kinar from Goldman Sachs.","Yaron Kinar","Thank you very much. Good morning. First question is just around the organic margin improvement of just over 90 basis points. Can you maybe talk about some of the moving parts there specifically maybe FX?","Christa Davies","So FX had an immaterial impact on margin in the quarter. I mean, the real \u2013 the biggest driver of margin expansion, it continues to be accelerating organic revenue growth, portfolio mix shift as we continue to invest in higher revenue growth, higher margin areas. And then the operational leverage we\u2019re getting from Aon Business Services. Those three drivers remained consistent overtime. I would say that\u2019s contributing to margin expansion in the quarter, in the first half of the year, and frankly the same for 2018, but equally going forward.","Yaron Kinar","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then, if I look at the free cash flow number for the quarter, not year-to-date, on an underlying basis, I think, there is slight deterioration year-over-year. Can you maybe talk about what has \u2013 what\u2019s caused that?","Christa Davies","So what we would say actually is strong growth and operating income growth, which is driving strong growth in free cash flow, both in Q2 and in the first half of the year. And what you\u2019re really saying is strong growth operationally, offset by a onetime payment of legacy litigation of $85 million. If you took out the $85 million, what you see is underlying good growth in free cash flow. The thing, I would also noted, the first half of the year is our seasonally weakest half. And so combined with litigation payment of $85 million resulted in lower free cash flow for the first half. The second half is \u2013 free cash is strong. And long-term, we are absolutely on track for double-digit free cash flow growth.","Yaron Kinar","So I think the litigation expense was a first quarter event. I\u2019m looking at second quarter here, I think by my calculation, you have about $350 million of underlying free cash flow in the second quarter, when I just back in the $110 million or so of the cash restructuring costs in the second quarter. And then, I think that is a bit weaker than where numbers were a year-ago.","Christa Davies","So we really think about on a first half basis, I appreciate your second quarter guidance. And what I would tell you is, we see strong underlying growth and free cash flow driven by strong operating income growth. And again, the second half of the year is going to be stronger and free cash flow as it is seasonally every year, and so we\u2019re well on track to strong growth for the year.","Yaron Kinar","Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo.","Elyse Greenspan","Hi, guys. My first question, I guess, just following up on that on free cash flow, I thought that you guys had expected double-digit adjusted free cash flow growth in 2019, when we adjust for the restructuring cash spend. So with that still be the case? And then assuming, Christa, you just add seasonally stronger and half year two. So do you still expect the half year two to drive you guys to double-digit for the full year?","Christa Davies","Thank you so much for the question, Elyse. So what we\u2019ve said consistently is that where double-digit free cash flow growth over the long-term is absolutely our goal, and we are well on track to that. We\u2019ve not given specific guidance in this year, Elyse, but what I would say is, we expect strong growth and free cash flow in the second half of the year and strong growth for the full year. And we are well on track for accelerating growth in 2020, driven by accelerating organic revenue growth, which is driving improvements in operating income growth. A reduction in working capital and a significant reduction in the uses of cash on pension CapEx and restructuring.","And so those three drivers are continued to accelerate free cash flow growth and there will be a substantial acceleration of free cash flow growth in 2020, simply driven by reduced uses of cash.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. Thanks. And then in terms of the share repurchase picked up significantly in the second quarter over $1 billion, you guys also did issue some debt during the quarter. So just in terms of the timing, I\u2019m sure, when the debt was issued versus when the shares were purchased. I\u2019m assuming, I\u2019m sure if some level of buyback was frontloaded from other quarters of the year. Could you just give us a sense of just thoughts around repurchase and the debt and kind of timing when that took place in the second quarter?","Christa Davies","Yeah. So the debt was issued May 2, 2019, that was $750 million of debt at 3.75%. And what I would say, Elyse, is as we think about the overall free cash flow generation of the firm is incredibly strong. As we think about the spend of that free cash flow. We used return on capital, as the way in which we allocate cash between buyback, which remains our highest return on capital activity as you\u2019ve seen first half of the year $1.15 billion invested in buyback. And we continue to see share repurchase as our highest return on capital activity going forward.","And so we have strong free cash flow in the second half of the year, as we talked about, and frankly, in 2020 onwards. And we expect a return on capital to drive our cash allocation and share repurchase will be at the top of that list.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. And then lastly on the organic side, four quarters in a row of 6%, I listened to the comments throughout the call, you guys seem pretty bullish on the growth environment. So should we think about this as just kind of being a 4%, would you expect going forward would at least meet this 6% level, especially as you pointed divesting of businesses also good new business generation, strong pipeline it seems based on your survey work. So should we think of the 6% as kind of a 4% on the organic side that you should see not only the second half of this year, but into 2020 and beyond as well?","Greg Case","Well, I would say, Elyse, listen, we talked about mid-single-digit or greater, and what we try to do is give you a clear view and the tactics behind that, the mechanics behind that, the investments behind that. And we are confident we\u2019re going to achieve that over time. And this quarter and the first half of the year and the last four quarters have done nothing, but underpinned that confidence. So we\u2019re looking forward to achieving that on your behalf.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Paul Newsome from Sandler O\u2019Neill.","Paul Newsome","Good morning. Congrats on the quarter. Can you maybe talk about just the organic growth lift you may or may not be getting in the PC Brokers business from the current environment and perhaps the insurance price?","Greg Case","Sure. Happy to do that and just a couple of thoughts on that. First, we would say when you think about sort of the impact on our results. This is Aon. This is sort of single P&L, single op-co, single brand in terms of what we\u2019re trying to do. And you look at overall to, Elyse\u2019s just question around mid-single-digit or greater. That\u2019s we\u2019re on track to achieve, that\u2019s we want to achieve over time, and over half of Aon is really unattached to anything sort of related to the risk market or risk pricing overall.","But we would say specifically when you think about commercial risk and reinsurance the impact from pricing was modest for the quarter and for the first half of the year. And remember when you think about pricing, it really is around market impact, which is a function of insured value and a function of price. And from our standpoint the real driver has to start from a client view. We\u2019re essentially matching capital with risk in a way to support their performance. And they react to changes in the marketplace and we help them react to changes in the marketplace, and there\u2019s lots and lots of different options out there to do that and accomplishes work.","And so the real driver of our growth is we\u2019ve described is really around client opportunities, Aon United behavior, new opportunities I\u2019ve described before in cyber and other innovations, continued share again and portfolio mix shift. So that\u2019s really what\u2019s underpinned the book of what we do and the impact on pricing really was modest.","Paul Newsome","Maybe some similar thoughts on the global economy and how that is helping you or not helping you?","Greg Case","Again, we\u2019d come back and say, the whole idea on the global economy everyone\u2019s talked about sort of the pending efforts and what\u2019s going to happen on the recession. We have not actually seen that materialize. But beyond the economy, we talked about growth and irrespective of the environment. And I would come back to the kind of the survey that I talked about before, this is truly from a client\u2019s view. What risks are we serving on their behalf and how are those risks changing. And in essence, there is massive opportunity for us to continue to really address client needs, increase our relevance and change what we\u2019re doing.","I talked about the New Ventures Group and what we\u2019re doing in many different areas, the work I described in public, the public sector world is very, very different. And just think about an example of sort of what that might be maybe, Eric can just talk about what we\u2019re doing on that front now. This is a net new idea, fully net new idea, Paul, that\u2019s not out there. These are the kinds of things are trying to do to drive growth, and maybe just talk about the public sector piece. Eric?","Eric Andersen","Sure, Greg. And maybe I\u2019ll try and tie the public sector piece along with the demand creation and some of the growth questions as well. Ultimate with public sector, we\u2019re seeing the private market tools on the derisking solutions become more available to them. The benefits to the sector itself are pretty significant in terms of reducing their risk profile that helps them with their mission. It reduces the risk of taxpayers, but it also helps them continue on and do what they\u2019ve been set up to do. We\u2019ve talked historically about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the GSEs and transfer that credit risk exposure into the private market using essentially tools that were developed historically in the reinsurance business, but repurposed to be able to bring new demand, new capability to a whole new sector.","We\u2019re also doing that and you mentioned before the World Bank bond, but also with the Export-Import Bank and other government agencies both in the U.S. and around the world. So ultimately, it\u2019s taking the analytic capability that we\u2019ve been building and investing in, and being able to create new demand and new opportunity to help a whole new set of clients. So it really does come together with both the investment that we\u2019ve made in the analytic capability, but also the opportunity to bring private market solutions to public sector entity.","Greg Case","And so fundamentally, Paul, this is about us investing in innovation, new ideas. That\u2019s why the spend in data analytics is so substantial, we believe fundamentally. If we innovate on behalf of our clients faster than they do, we\u2019re never going to know their businesses better than they do. But we can innovate faster them on the topics of risk, retirement and health. We do that investments, we do that effectively you create net new ideas, like Eric\u2019s described and that\u2019s what for us is going to be the fundamental driver of growth over time.","Paul Newsome","Great. Thank you for your thoughts.","Operator","The next question is from Brian Meredith from UBS.","Brian Meredith","Yes, thanks. A couple of quick question. Greg, I\u2019m just curious, I\u2019m looking into Reinsurance Solutions growth you see in the first half, I think I go back, and it\u2019s probably off sort of the best growth you\u2019ve seen since, call it, 2003 in a hard market, so obviously, some great things going on there. Can you talk a little bit about what\u2019s driving that?","Greg Case","Yeah. Let me just step back a little bit, Brian, just sort of the overall mechanics and again get Eric to sort of offer some thoughts on sort of the general state of the market sort of at the client level. But listen, the Q2 12% was a terrific result. Colleagues have just done some great work, really just 10% for the first half. Remember, also the first half really reflects the 3D book more than anything else, the [one-ones, the four-ones, and the six-ones.] [ph]. The second half is less 3D, and more fact in the ILS transactions.","But we\u2019ve talked many of these calls around the win\/loss record has been exceptional for multiple years, and this is a place where again back to data analytics point, we spend more heavily in content capability here than perhaps any place else, and that shows up from a client standpoint. So for us, this has been continued progress and support and a good result. And we expect over time will continue to sort of help clients succeed in the category, but maybe, Eric, talk about a client example or so.","Eric Andersen","Yeah. I mean, I think, what I would sort of walkthrough also is certainly there is growth in the treaty business as you talked about, but also in the facultative reinsurance business and the banking business. So we\u2019re seeing good opportunity across all the different capabilities that we have. And I would say a lot of the demand is coming from the insurers, who are looking to use reinsurance capability, whether it\u2019s the analytics in the modeling or the sort of positioning and use of reinsurance capital to help them grow their own businesses, whether it\u2019s in the traditional high risk natural catastrophe areas, but also in the growing areas of cyber and others specialty liability areas.","So we\u2019re seeing good growth globally and the demand has been continuing as the carriers look at this marketplace and try and position themselves the best that they can do to help their ultimate clients grow and manage their own risk.","Greg Case","Yeah. I want to be clear. As you think about 12% in Q2, we\u2019re not 12% over there. What we\u2019re essentially saying we don\u2019t look at the quarter-to-quarter for us it\u2019s less relevant. The trend line has been very, very positive. And Eric just described two or three net new areas that didn\u2019t exist before, an example that didn\u2019t exist before driven by data analytics. Our view is there are a number of clients out there, who really want to improve their return on invested capital, and reduce their volatility, as we have solutions to do that. We\u2019re going to continue to grow their business, that\u2019s we\u2019re really excited about.","Brian Meredith","Great. Great. And then, Greg, I\u2019m just curious, and Eric, tell a little bit about what you\u2019re seeing as far as the commercialized pricing environment. And you\u2019re talking with your own numbers, it just a modest benefit. But it was some of the carriers it sounds like things really have picked up quite nicely, and we\u2019re kind of this farming marketplace. Is that what you guys are seeing?","Greg Case","I would say again, I want to emphasize the impact on us we described as modest, we would say modest upward pressure overall maybe a little more on the cat exposed areas are really modest overall. Again we would come back to the real relevant question is market impact, insured values and price, Brian, and as you know well. The real point of view from the question really from our standpoint, every time it\u2019s asked, we believe it has to be repurposed and it has to be from a client view. The work of what we do every day is going to be about matching capital with risk and weighted that supports client performance operationally, reducing volatility, stronger balance sheet, et cetera. Again, you know this very well.","That work from our standpoint is fundamental and there are many, many options out there, many, many permutations. And clients really have to be the drivers of that. And that\u2019s where we would say there\u2019s been some modest impact. But this is really a client-driven set of conversations.","Brian Meredith","Right, right, great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Josh Shanker anchor from Deutsche Bank.","Joshua Shanker","Hi, there. Thanks for taking my question. Good morning.","Greg Case","Good morning, Josh.","Joshua Shanker","Following on Dave\u2019s question little, but I just want to understand the process of \u2013 I guess the restructuring is just a little bit more expensive than you thought it was. And I was interested in hearing from you about like the process, when you identified that going on, what happened, and why should we should be confident there\u2019s no more restructuring charges in 2020 and beyond.","Christa Davies","Sure. So thanks for the question, Josh. The uptight climb just reflects better estimates now at two quarters away from the end of the program. We\u2019ve got better clarity into projects that are currently being implemented, as well as the addition of new projects as we optimize the overall Aon operating model.","And so, what we would say is overall we\u2019re delivering $535 million of savings. We\u2019re spending $1.425 billion in cash. It\u2019s a 38% ROIC. We feel really good about that. And so, we are absolutely confident, Josh, to your question that the last charges will be completed in Q4 2019. We\u2019ve been consistent about that from the beginning.","We\u2019re very keen to get back to GAAP EPS equaling adjusted EPS and running the business on free cash flow as we always have.","Greg Case","So I notice you had a couple of just points on sort of the restructuring, particularly that\u2019s coming to the close. Remember, this is not about cost saves. There\u2019s a lot of cost saves in concert with it. This is really about fundamentally changing and strengthening our firm. And fundamentals of this is what we\u2019re doing in ABS and sort of \u2013 and that engine that\u2019s being created never been done before in our industry.","We have the opportunity to step back and invest to do that. And we made real progress against it. But it really is an engine that really we are very excited about that\u2019s going to deliver productivity going forward and client impact going forward. But the piece around this is really sort of on the client side and sort of how they see this and how this comes out.","And I figured that Mike could give an example of sort of the ABS front and sort of what we\u2019re seeing and how it\u2019s not just cost, but also it\u2019s more than cost.","Michael O\u2019Connor","Sure, Greg. I mean, I think with Aon Business Services, this is all about improving our effectiveness, our impact with clients, and obviously, on productivity. And there\u2019s countless examples that come to mind.","You can think about our single global platform for health. We\u2019ve delivered, rolled this out now into 50 countries and we actually now operate with one single system, able to touch clients around the world in single way.","We have one single system that will run and to support our Commercial Risk business, around policy management and the way we actually interact with clients. Our Risk\/View platform is what we call it internally. And you think about those that\u2019s changing the way we touch clients every day. It\u2019s giving us a single way a single approach.","And for us being able to actually bring all of our data together, which allows us provide insight that we couldn\u2019t do before. So those are just two examples that we\u2019re really excited about.","Greg Case","And it\u2019s about cost saves for sure and ROIC. And then, fundamentally, we end up with a stronger firm, which is why were we were excited and we initiated the program to begin with. And we\u2019re looking forward to 2020 and 2021, and the benefits that come with the investment we have made and completed by the end of 2019.","Joshua Shanker","Thank you for the answers. And then dovetailing on Brian\u2019s question a little bit, can talk about the organic growth in reinsurance in the context of, how much of that was taking share from competitors and how much of that was creating new solutions for clients that didn\u2019t exist before?","Greg Case","Well, listen, as we said before it\u2019s a combination and we love both pieces. And in fact, a lot of the a data and analytics investments we\u2019re making out, are really about net new. And think about some of examples that Eric gave that really is around kind of net new ideas in net new areas, and whether it\u2019s sort of in \u2013 the areas we describe sort of on the mortgage side or on the cap on side, now with governments, a whole series of things that are happening that we\u2019ve never done before.","Our win\/loss you know continues to be favorable and strengthening. But it\u2019s more than just win\/loss. Our view is the risk needs of clients is more than a zero-sum game, because the industry is fundamentally not \u2013 we have not fundamentally addressed a growing set of needs they have.","So for us, this is really the opportunity, not just on the reinsurance side, but also on the commercial risk side.","Joshua Shanker","Would it be crazy to say 50\/50?","Greg Case","Again, I think it\u2019s less helpful I think to sort of talk about pure win\/loss. Eric\u2019s itching to sort of give you that exact answer. Do you want to go on it?","Christa Davies","But I think, Josh, your question really is how much of it comes from whole new areas of growth and how much it comes from win\/loss. And interestingly, a lot of our new wins are actually new solutions to clients that we\u2019ve never even done with them before. And so, as it features in our win\/loss, it\u2019s actually kind of hard for us to tell candidly, Josh, because we are \u2013 our win rates are at all-time highs across the firm, across commercial risk in our top 10 countries, across reinsurance.","But a lot of the wins are actually coming through Aon United investments and the investments we made in data and analytics, which allow us to develop new solutions for clients we couldn\u2019t otherwise serve them with.","Greg Case","So just think about, what Christa is really touching on perfectly is when we\u2019re in a tender we don\u2019t show up in the classic way. We can actually show up with new ideas and new insights driven by data and analytics. And so is that a win sort of in the zero-sum game world from a competitor or is that really sort of net new? So really that\u2019s the combination we\u2019re seeing.","And then, occasionally mortgage, pure net new. That\u2019s a $10 billion sort of opportunity that\u2019s been developed over time. I think, Eric, 20% of the mortgages in the U.S. now are connected to insurance linked capital. So this is an incredibly powerful net new, but it really is a combination. What we want you to get a sense for is, this is this is fundamentally about delivering more on behalf of clients using data and analytics, and the investment to do that is substantial, but the impact can also be quite high.","Eric Andersen","And I think also part of it is when people think of reinsurance they think of the traditional 3D transfer of portfolios. But there\u2019s also other work that we\u2019ve been creating to help clients and reinsurers think about their own portfolios. And maybe just a quick example is a mid-size reinsurer I\u2019m thinking about, that wanted better insight into how many of their clients would either put them into the market or not renew with them. And we were able to use some machine learning and predictive analytics to help them focus on where they needed to spend their time either building relationships with their existing clients to be able to target to know where they were at risk.","And so, just having that kind of insight helps them improve their retention capability, helps them know where to focus their management attention on maintaining the share that they had earned over a period of time in the marketplace. So it\u2019s not just about, hey, we want to transfer this portfolio of casualty or natural disaster risk to a marketplace, but it is actually helping each of the individual players be smarter and how to position their own businesses for growth and success.","So there\u2019s a lot to it, but not just traditional share, but is actually bringing new services to the market.","Joshua Shanker","Well, thanks for the answers and congratulations on the quarter.","Operator","Our last question, it is from Meyer Shields from KBW.","Meyer Shields","Thanks. I want to talk a little bit about the M&A environment, so one general question, one specific one. The press release noted that you divested, I guess, a unit within Retirement Solutions that offset organic growth. And I was hoping you could reconcile that with the general approach of actually increasing acquisitions, faster growing units.","And then, more broadly, I was hoping you could talk about the opportunity, the M&A environment globally and how it\u2019s been evolving over the last 12 months.","Christa Davies","So what I would tell you overall is we are active managers of our portfolio. We have been over the last 5 years; we\u2019ll continue to be in the future. And so, we will continue to disproportionately invest organically and inorganically in higher revenue growth higher margin higher return on capital businesses.","And we\u2019ll divest lower revenue growth, lower margin, lower return on capital businesses. And that\u2019s what we saw happen in the quarter with a small portion of the talent business that sits on the retirement that was divested on June 30. So it did not impact our organic growth calculation in the quarter, but it was lower growth.","And so that is what you saw. And then, I guess, what I would say about the overall M&A environment is we \u2013 I said last quarter, our M&A pipeline is the largest. It\u2019s been in the company\u2019s history. It is aligned to our highest revenue growth, highest margin, the highest return on capital categories, so we\u2019re very excited about that. And we continue to engage with these companies to actually build long-term relationships to we\u2019re the buyer of choice, because what we don\u2019t really want to be is in an RFP where we\u2019re competing with a whole bunch of people.","We actually want to get to know firms that are really attractive in our highest return on capital areas and really bring them into the firm in a way that\u2019s building content and capabilities for clients and enabling a cultural fit that really makes that integration successful.","Greg Case","And in many respects, Meyer, it really is about the content capability and what net new comes to Aon from an inside standpoint, and then how do we scale that. And you\u2019ve seen that in many, many of our acquisitions we\u2019ve brought into the firm. And you\u2019ll continue to see that as a primary driver, because without that, you really don\u2019t get a return on invested capital that beats buyback.","And our view is from a discounted casual standpoint, there\u2019s tremendous value sort of in the buyback that\u2019s why it continues to be sort of at the top of the list and sort of everything is measured against that. And it really is opportunities around content capability that really drive that sort of actions.","Meyer Shields","Okay. That\u2019s what I needed. Thank you so much.","Greg Case","Okay.","Christa Davies","Thanks, Meyer.","Operator","Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg Case for closing remarks.","Greg Case","Just wanted to say to everyone, thank you so much for joining us in our Q2 call and we look forward to the discussion next quarter. Thanks again.","Operator","That concludes the conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect."],"1825":["Aon (NYSE:AON) Q1 2013 Earnings Call April 26, 2013  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Gregory C. Case - Chief Executive Officer, President, Executive Director and Member of Executive Committee","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President","Analysts","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Operator","Good morning, and thank you for holding. Welcome to Aon plc's First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would also like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded and that it is important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995 (sic) [Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995]. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our first quarter results, as well as having been posted on our website.","Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, President and CEO of Aon plc.","Gregory C. Case","Thank you very much, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2013 conference call. Joining me here today is our CFO, Christa Davies.","Consistent with previous quarters, I'd like to cover 3 areas before turning the call over to Christa for further financial review. And we note that there are slides available on our website for you to follow along with our commentary today. First is our performance against key metrics we communicate to shareholders; second is overall organic growth performance; and third is continued areas of strategic investment across Aon.","On the first topic, our performance versus key metrics. Each quarter, we measure our performance against the 4 metrics we focus on achieving over the course of the year: grow organically, expand margins, increase earnings per share, and deliver free cash flow growth.","Turning to Slide 3. In the first quarter, organic revenue growth was 2% overall, driven by strong growth in Retail Brokerage. Operating margin was essentially flat, as a significant increase in Risk Solutions margin was offset by a decline in HR Solutions and the unallocated section. EPS increased 13% to $1.11, reflecting both solid operating performance and effective capital management. And finally, free cash flow increased $80 million in our seasonally weakest quarter, driven by strong working capital performance. Overall, a solid start to the year as we strengthen our industry-leading platform for long-term growth, strong free cash flow generation and increased financial flexibility.","Turning to Slide 4, on the second topic of growth. I want to spend the next few minutes discussing the quarter for both of our segments. In Risk Solutions, overall organic revenue growth was 3% compared to 4% in the prior year quarter, with growth across every major business. As we've discussed previously, we're driving a set of initiatives that are strengthening underlying performance and positioning our Risk Solutions segment for long-term growth and improved operating leverage with management of our renewal book through Client Promise and retention rates more than 90% on average, our record level of performance, highlighting strong client satisfaction in Retail Brokerage; new business generation of approximately $240 million across our Retail business, with double-digit new business growth in many markets globally across the Americas, Asia and Pacific regions; investments in new product and service capabilities, with the rollout of GRIP and Aon Broking globally; and in our core treaty reinsurance business, net new business trends have now been positive for 8 consecutive quarters.","Reflecting on the individual businesses within Risk Solutions. In the Americas, organic revenue growth was 6% compared to 4% in the prior year quarter. Exposures are relatively stable, and the impact from pricing was modestly positive on average, reflecting a steady pace of change over the last 12 months. We saw solid growth across all regions, including Latin America, U.S. Retail and Canada.","In U.S. Retail, we delivered solid growth, driven by double-digit new business growth, including growth in property\/casualty, health and benefits, construction and Affinity, as well as strong management of the renewal book portfolio with improved retention and rollover rates.","In international, organic revenue growth increased 3% compared to 4% in the prior year quarter. Exposures are relatively stable, and the impact from pricing was flat on average, with firmer pricing in cat-exposed regions and softer pricing in most regions across Europe. We saw strong growth in emerging markets, New Zealand and many markets across Asia, including double-digit growth in areas such as Korea, Philippines and Singapore.","In the U.K. and continental Europe, macroeconomic conditions remained fragile across many core markets. However, with leadership positions across this region, we saw strong retention rates, and management of our renewal book portfolio delivered modest growth. Overall, a solid performance against economic and market headwinds.","In Reinsurance, organic revenue growth was 1% compared to 5% in the prior year quarter. As we noted last quarter, record capacity continues to be available to meet demand, and cedents are retaining more risk, driving an unfavorable market impact in the quarter. Results reflect growth in our capital markets advisory and transaction business, as well as facultative placements. In treaty, as mentioned before, net new business won was positive for the eighth consecutive quarter. Overall, this level of performance and strength in new business generation reflects Aon Benfield's value proposition for clients, while strengthening operational performance and reducing volatility through unmatched data, analytics and advisory capability.","Finally, we would observe that absent an event in the industry, macro factors will continue to be a headwind in 2013.","Turning to HR Solutions. Overall, organic revenue growth was 1% compared to 3% in the prior year quarter. We saw modest organic growth across both Consulting and Outsourcing despite weak discretionary spend globally and continued economic pressure in continental Europe. Underlying performance also reflects growth in areas where we're making significant investments in the business, in areas such as healthcare exchanges, investment consulting, pension and risk management consulting and HR BPO. These investments reflect Aon Hewitt's client leadership, understanding of market trends and the long-term issues that face our clients as healthcare reform, healthcare costs and the associated financial risk continue to rise unchecked at a time when overall health and wellness is not improving. Multinational clients are increasingly looking for a global benefit solution that supports their global organizations delivered at the local level, managing and transferring risk across pension schemes that are increasingly frozen and largely underfunded. And finally, after continuing to work through the worst economic recession in the last 70 years, clients are just beginning to renew their focus on talent, retention, development and engagement to prepare themselves for renewed long-term growth.","Turning to the individual businesses within HR Solutions. In Consulting Services, organic revenue growth was 1% compared to 1% in the prior year quarter. Underlying results reflect growth in communications consulting and strong demand across our retirement businesses, for investment consulting, pension administration services and talent rewards. And despite continued pressure on discretionary services and overall economic weakness in continental Europe, for the full year, we continue to expect low- to mid-single-digit organic growth across the Consulting Services business.","In Outsourcing, organic revenue growth was 1% compared to 3% in the prior year quarter. Organic growth reflects net new client wins and demand for HR BPO, healthcare exchanges and discretionary services, partially offset by a modest decline in benefits administration. As we noted last quarter, we continue to make progress in our healthcare exchanges, and the pipeline for growth during the fourth quarter of 2013 enrollment period continues to grow. If you think about the corporate exchange, the progress of the team has been a truly outstanding accomplishment, from concept in 2011 to launch last quarter of the industry's only active corporate exchange; enrollment of roughly 100,000 employees plus eligible dependents; and all participating clients are referenceable, with representation for both existing and new clients on the exchange. Great progress from the team in healthcare exchange area, reflecting the strength of our industry-leading platform across employee benefits design, brokerage and administration.","Slide 5 highlights the third topic, areas of investment. We believe Aon is in a unique position. Solid long-term operating performance, combined with expense discipline and strong free cash flow, continues to enable substantial investment in colleagues and capabilities around the globe. A few examples include, in Risk Solutions, we're investing in client leadership to drive greater productivity and efficiency, with the rollout of the Revenue Engine internationally, as well as the rollout of Client Promise, which is driving greater retention and rollover rates. We continue to invest in innovative technology such as the Global Risk Insight Platform. GRIP is the world's leading global database of risk and insurance placement information. We now have roughly 1.6 million trades, more than $83 billion of bound premium and a growing client list of insurance carriers utilizing the platform for its analytics and service capabilities. In addition, we're driving our Aon Broking initiative to better match client needs with insurer appetite for risk, as highlighted by our ability to package similar risks and place substantial programs and facilities into the market on behalf of clients. A great example of this is a sidecar facility agreement we announced with Berkshire Hathaway, providing clients efficient access to AA+-rated capacity for eligible business placed by Aon Risk Solutions. Clients are expressing considerable interest in this facility, especially in traditionally capacity-challenged sectors, as a way to augment capacity for products within those sectors.","We're also investing in continued alignment of our global Health and Benefits platform to better capitalize on our global distribution channel and deep brokerage capabilities. And we continue substantial investment in further development of data and analytics capabilities at Aon Benfield to strengthen already industry-leading client servicing capability.","And finally, we're expanding our footprint through tuck-in acquisitions that either increase scale in emerging markets or expand capacity to better serve clients, as well as adding key talent across Asia in specialty sectors and in our GRIP solutions business.","In HR Solutions, we're making significant investments to strengthen our industry-leading position in healthcare exchanges, both in retiree and active markets. Healthcare exchanges enable clients to begin the shift of their participants to a market-based, defined contribution model for healthcare while addressing unsustainable healthcare cost increases and decreasing population health. While already a growing leader in the retiree market, we launched the industry's first and only fully insured, multi-carrier corporate exchange in Q4 and will be focused on driving greater scale in 2013 and improved returns in 2014. We're also expanding in high-growth areas for both current clients and new markets. Innovative solutions to de-risk pension plans are in high demand with our existing retirement client base. And our delegated pension solutions are opening relationships in new markets. We continue to expand our industry-leading benefits administration solutions and technology platforms, including extensive mobile solutions. And finally, we're strengthening our international footprint to support a global workforce with investments in key talent capabilities across Asia and emerging markets.","Overall, we've proved the concept for these major investments in 2012, and we're on plan to drive greater scale and increased operating leverage in 2013. In summary, we delivered organic revenue growth across both Risk and HR Solutions, continued to ramp up significant strategic investments that will drive greater long-term growth and operating leverage, delivered double-digit earnings and strong free cash flow growth.","With that said, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Christa for further financial review. Christa?","Christa Davies","Thanks so much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg noted, our performance reflects a solid start to the year with double-digit earnings growth. We continue to position Aon for long-term growth, strong free cash flow generation and increased financial flexibility, as highlighted by the repurchase of $300 million of ordinary shares in the quarter.","Now let me turn to the financial results for the quarter, as highlighted on Page 6 of the presentation. Our core EPS performance, excluding certain items, increased 13% to $1.11 per share for the first quarter compared to $0.98 in the prior year quarter. Results reflect the strong performance in our Risk Solutions segment, a lower effective tax rate and effective capital management in the quarter. Certain items that were adjusted for in the core EPS performance and highlighted in the schedules on Page 13 of the press release include noncash intangible asset amortization, restructuring charges and redomicile costs primarily for legal and advisory fees to complete the transaction.","Foreign currency translation had a $0.02 favorable impact on EPS in the quarter. If currency were to remain stable at today's rates, we would expect no material translation impact to EPS in the second quarter of 2013.","Now let me talk about each of the segments on the next slide. In our Risk Solutions segment, organic growth was 3%. Operating margin increased 110 basis points to 22.5%, and operating income increased 9% versus the prior year quarter. Organic growth, restructuring savings and a 40-basis-point favorable impact from foreign currency translation more than offset a minus 20-basis-point unfavorable impact from a significant decline in investment income due to lower short-term interest rates globally.","Let me spend a moment on the formal restructuring programs' key initiatives that have enabled concurrent funding of investments and long-term structural margin expansion. Associated with the transfer of the Health and Benefits business at Jan 1, 2012, an estimated $52 million of restructuring savings under the Aon Hewitt program will be achieved in Risk Solutions. Approximately $45 million of the $52 million in cumulative savings have been achieved under the program, including an estimated $5 million of incremental savings in the first quarter. A breakout of restructuring charges incurred in Risk Solutions associated with the Aon Hewitt program is detailed in the schedules on Page 14 of the press release.","In the first quarter, we delivered strong operating performance in Risk Solutions despite continued economic uncertainty in Europe and an unfavorable impact from decline in investment income, placing us firmly on track for margin improvement for the full year and continued progress towards our long-term target of 26%.","Turning to the HR Solutions segment. Organic revenue growth was 1%, operating margin decreased 220 basis points to 14.3%, and operating income decreased 13% compared to the prior year quarter. An unfavorable impact from legacy litigation and the timing of certain expenses of $10 million or minus 100 basis points, continued investment in long-term growth opportunities and an unfavorable revenue mix shift more than offset organic revenue and incremental restructuring savings in the quarter.","With respect to the Aon Hewitt restructuring program, we incurred $26 million of charges in the quarter. Cumulative savings related to the formal restructuring program in the first quarter are estimated at $69 million compared to $48 million in the prior year quarter, of which approximately $5 million of the incremental savings were achieved in the Risk segment. Excluding the $10 million of legacy litigation and the timing of certain expenses that negatively impacted the quarter, our results are exactly in line with expectations and guidance previously provided for the HR Solutions business.","As we noted in the previous quarter, we provided commentary regarding the outlook for the HR segment in 2013, and that outlook is unchanged. We expect to, number one, deliver continued organic growth; number two, drive greater scale from the investments made in 2012; number three, deliver additional savings related to the restructuring program; number four, deliver performance down in the first half and up in the second half, resulting in mid-single-digit operating income growth and margin expansion for the year.","Now let me discuss a few of the line items outside of the operating segments on Slide 9. Unallocated expenses were $41 million, including certain expenses related to the company's redomicile to the U.K. Interest income decreased $2 million to $1 million due to lower average interest rates and lower average cash balances; interest expense decreased $7 million to $52 million due to a decline in the average rate and the total amount of debt outstanding during the quarter; other income of $9 million includes a net gain due to the favorable impact of exchange rates on remeasurement of assets and liabilities in non-functional currencies and net gains related to certain long-term investments. Going forward, we expect a run rate of approximately $1 million per quarter of interest income, $45 million of unallocated expense and $55 million of interest expense per quarter.","Turning to taxes. The effective tax rate on net income from continuing operations decreased to 26.1% in the first quarter compared to 28% in the prior year quarter, due primarily to changes in geographic distribution of income. We currently anticipate an effective tax rate of approximately 26% in 2013. Minority interest was $11 million, similar to the prior year quarter. Based on performance, we expect minority interest to be approximately $11 million per quarter going forward.","Lastly, average diluted shares outstanding decreased to $320 million -- sorry, 320 million in the first quarter compared to 336.6 million in the prior year quarter, due primarily to our share repurchase program. The company repurchased 5 million Class A ordinary shares for approximately $300 million in the first quarter and has approximately $3.7 billion of remaining authorization. Actual shares outstanding on March 31 was 309 million, and there are approximately 10 million additional dilutive equivalents. Estimated Q2 2013 beginning dilutive share count is approximately 319 million, subject to share price movement, share issuance and share repurchase.","Now let me turn to the next slide to highlight our strong balance sheet and cash flow. At March 31, cash and short-term investments was $760 million, and total debt outstanding was $4.6 billion. Overall, debt-to-capital was 37.6% at March 31 compared to 34.9% at December 31. The increase is primarily driven by the timing for certain long-term debt placements between the fourth quarter of 2012 and the first quarter of 2013. Cash flow from operations increased by $69 million to $54 million in the first quarter compared to a use of $15 million in the prior year quarter. The first quarter is historically our seasonally weakest quarter from a cash flow perspective, due primarily to incentive compensation payouts. Significantly improved working capital performance more than offset a $106 million increase in cash taxes and a 40 -- sorry, an $86 million increase in cash contributions to the major pension plans in the first quarter. Free cash flow, as defined by cash flow from operations less CapEx, increased 93% or $80 million, reflecting a significant increase in cash flow from operations and an $11 million decline in CapEx.","Turning to the next slide to discuss our long-term financial flexibility. We value the firm based on free cash flow and allocate capital to maximize free cash flow returns. As you can see from this chart, based on current assumptions, we expect free cash flow to increase by over $500 million over the next 5 years, simply due to a reduction in cash used in pensions and restructuring.","Regarding our underfunded pension plans, we've taken significant steps to reduce volatility and liability as we've closed plans to new entrants, frozen plans from accruing additional benefits and continue to de-risk certain plan assets. We currently expect contributions to decline $90 million to $548 million in 2013 and continue to decline thereafter.","Regarding our restructuring plans, cash payments were $143 million in 2012. As our restructuring plans continue to wind down, we would expect cash payments to decline $26 million to approximately $117 million in 2013 before declining further each year thereafter. As we continue to grow, improve operating performance and our required uses of cash decline, we expect our strong free cash flow to continue to be a significant source of value creation for shareholders.","In 2012, we took significant steps to unlock that value for shareholders by increasing our strategic position and financial flexibility with the redomicile to the U.K. The company completed its change of jurisdiction of incorporation on April 2, 2012, and we believe the transaction will help drive shareholder value through, number one, greater global access to expected increases in future free cash flow; number two, an increase in future cash flows through a significant reduction in our global tax rate over the long term, more than what we've done over the last 5 years, which was approximately 500 basis points; number three, enabled us to access $300 million of excess capital held internationally on our balance sheet during 2012.","In summary, we delivered double-digit earnings and strong free cash flow growth and are firmly on track to deliver improved performance in 2013. While we're investing to further strengthen our industry-leading portfolio, we're focused on 3 primary areas that will each contribute to substantially stronger free cash flow over the next several years: first, continued growth and operating margin improvement towards our long-term targets; second, declining uses of cash, primarily for pension and restructuring; third, greater capital flexibility and increased cash flow from a lower effective tax rate resulting from our redomicile to the U.K. Combined with a strong balance sheet and increased financial flexibility, we have positioned the firm for significant shareholder value creation.","With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from Adam Klauber, William Blair.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","In the Consulting segment, it sounded like Europe was somewhat weak. What was the growth in the -- just the U.S.?","Gregory C. Case","We don't talk overall, Adam, sort of a specific region, but as we would describe is, net-net, expectations for the year continue to be exactly where they were as we left off last year, kind of low mid-single digits across the board for the year. U.S. was stronger than Europe for obvious reasons when you think about discretionary spend and how clients are reacting under the current situations they're in. But the underlying programs we've put in place to build client retention and obtain new clients, strong in the U.S., strong in Europe, and obviously, the headwinds are a bit stronger in Europe than the U.S.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then as far as the healthcare exchange, you mentioned that the pipeline for new potential clients is looking good. After you signed up several large clients at the end of the year, did that really raise perception, I guess, number one? And number two, as we think about the year-end 2013 enrollment season, any -- I know you can't set a number on it, but is it possible to sign up materially more clients than you did at the end of 2012?","Gregory C. Case","Yes, if you step back and think about the exchanges overall, remember we've got a retiree exchange. Navigators has actually been in place and is working very, very well with a pipeline that's growing. You're referring to the corporate exchange, and you're exactly right. We were the first to put a multi-carrier exchange in place and actually bring it live. And we brought it live with clients in the last renewal period. And as you just described, having done that successfully, all those clients are referenceable, very positive reaction. As you might expect with a proven concept, that has tremendous benefits for companies and even for employees over time, you're getting a lot more demand in the context than we saw last year. Exactly what we expected. Let's say, from our standpoint, what we want to do is continue to grow and build out that -- the exchanges on the corporate side. The team's done a terrific job in doing that. We've got a very robust pipeline going into this renewal season, and we expect to continue to see that grow and see the return from that investment. So from our standpoint, it's going exactly as we had expected, with probably even a little more robust demand than we thought. And certainly, as you look at the competitive environment, you're seeing a lot of other folks think about this space as well.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And one final question on HR Solutions margin. Clearly, first quarter is a slower seasonal quarter and you had some expenses. Without putting a number on it, do you think the margin goes up from 1Q from here?","Christa Davies","Yes, we do. What we would say is it's going to improve sequentially each quarter during the year. And as we gave guidance, we still think we're exactly on track for mid-single-digit operating improvements for 2013, down in the first half and up in the second half. And due to the seasonality you described, you're exactly right, that Q4 will be seasonally higher than it has been historically, primarily due to healthcare exchanges.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Brian Meredith, UBS.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","A couple quick questions here for you. First, Christa, on the guidance in the HR Solutions business for income for the year, did that include the $10 million of litigation, or should we strip that out when we're thinking about growth for the year?","Christa Davies","No, it's exactly in line with what we said at the end of Q4, Brian, so we do think we're going to get the $10 million back.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So you'll get the $10 million back also. Okay, great. Second question, Greg, more for you. On this Berkshire deal that you all did. I guess the question I have there is, what has the Lloyd's market kind of reaction been from your perspective? And is there any risk, kind of from a revenue perspective, perhaps Reinsurance or something, where some of the Lloyd's syndicates may not be too happy about it?","Gregory C. Case","Yes, Brian, as we've looked at this, this really is a client solution, first and foremost. It's a client solution, as we've described it, that brings AA+ rated capacity into the market in a way it's never been brought into the market before. I would also say, as I know you know, RIMS is just concluding now on the West Coast, and the client reaction from the announcement has actually been quite positive. If you think about it, if you're a client in an area of constrained capital, this is now another area of capacity that just wasn't there before. As we've described, so it's truly a focus on kind of client need and client benefit. As we've also talked with Lloyd's about is, currently is linked to Lloyd's. So it really, we think, will actually provide some positive momentum into the Lloyd's marketplace overall, and we're going to continue to discuss it with them. Lloyd's is, obviously, a very important partner, and we're going to continue to work with our partners to serve our clients. But at its coal face [ph], this is truly a client-focused effort, and it's beginning to play out exactly like that.","Operator","Next question is Meyer Shields, KBW.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Greg, you've mentioned the client interest in the acceptance of the Berkshire deal. Is there going to be any negative impact on Reinsurance revenues from, let's say, other Lloyd's participants that feel like they're getting squeezed out?","Gregory C. Case","Well, listen, again, back to -- here, our focus really is on the client-serving capability of this. And by the way, Lloyd's is also a very client service-focused partner as well in the context of what we do. So from our standpoint, we see this as a net positive overall. We're obviously in active conversations, as we are with Lloyd's. We're roughly 22%, 23% of Lloyd's business overall, so I think probably the single largest partner with Lloyd's. So it's a very, very important partner. But in the context of that, we think this initiative is going to be very -- it has already been extremely client-friendly and beneficial. And in that context, it really reflects the strength of our data and analytics and our approach to the overall market that we can bring to bear on behalf of clients that others haven't been able to do. So that's how we've looked at it, that's how it's playing out, and we're going to keep focused on client benefit.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay, I understand. And Christa, you mentioned that unallocated expenses were high in the quarter because of the redomicile. Is that a run rate, or this just a set of expenses associated with the move that should wind down pretty quickly?","Christa Davies","No, it is going to be run rate, so we've now reforecasted the unallocated expenses to be $45 million a quarter going forward.","Operator","Next question is Jay Cohen, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","A couple questions. The first is, the organic growth in the HR Solutions business really fell pretty significantly from the fourth quarter, which may have been overstated. And I'm wondering if -- what the change was between the fourth quarter and the first quarter.","Gregory C. Case","So Jay, as we -- if you step back and think about the year overall, don't overplay in any single quarter too much, our view is exactly as we left off in the fourth quarter of last year. And really, it's true for top line and bottom line. We think it's going to be mid-single digits for the year across -- from a growth standpoint, both in the Consulting side and in the Outsourcing side. We saw a little more pressure than expected in the first quarter. There are -- there's a couple things that were timing, a couple things that were sort of client discretionary pressure in Europe, as we described before. But the takeaway we want you to have from this call is that we really expect low-single digits for the year overall, and that's fully online. And as Christa described as well, we expect the same on the operating income growth side too, low-single digits.","Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And then on the timing, so when you have a timing issue, you're losing revenue either from future quarters, so it will come in future quarters, or you earned it earlier. How does the timing work here? Is this stuff that will come in later in the year that you didn't see in the first quarter?","Gregory C. Case","Yes, it's a little bit of stuff that will come in later, as we described before, but it's also a little bit more on the seasonality side as we've pushed on the healthcare exchanges, and those are going to be more of a fourth quarter event than they are a first quarter event. But net-net, as we look at the years, as I said, we expect low single-digit growth on the top line, both on the Consulting side and the Outsourcing side, and that hasn't changed at all.","Operator","Next question is Greg Locraft, Morgan Stanley.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just again to sit on the European slowdown and the impact in HR. If I go back to my notes in the second quarter of last year, you all mentioned that the first quarter is seasonally the most important quarter for Europe. What I'm wondering is, is was that commentary based on the overall corporation, was it an HR Solutions comment, or was it a risk management comment?","Gregory C. Case","No, the -- as you think about the patterning of revenue across Aon, this is really what you're describing is truly focused on Risk and not on HR Solutions. So if you think about our Risk business overall, the first quarter is very important from a European standpoint. The fourth quarter is very important from an Americas and a U.S. Retail standpoint. So that's how the Risk business plays out. So that commentary was directly focused on Risk and not HR Solutions.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. Perfect. And then, I guess, just a follow-up then. The organic and the international division of Risk, actually, was fine. I'm assuming Europe is sitting in there. And so therefore, there's no slowdown there. You sort of hit it seasonally well. I'm sort of scratching my head as to why the miss out of Europe in HR Solutions, but I'm also appreciating that maybe it wasn't a miss relative to what you guys thought you were going to do this year anyway because the guidance remains the same.","Gregory C. Case","Yes, and if -- you're exactly right. If you parse the two, stay on risk for a second, 3%, we feel good about across international, always like it to be stronger. International also includes Asia and Pacific. Those are particularly strong. I want to be clear, there is real headwind in Europe. Our colleagues are doing a great job fighting through that with very, very strong positions we have in the marketplace, managing the renewal book. So there's real pressure there. There's certainly less pricing benefit, if any, in that theater. So there's real pressure there, and our colleagues have done a good job sort of overcoming that to kind of get to the 3% outcome. And as I said before, certainly, positively impacted by Asia and Pacific. And then as we've said on HR Solutions, we are exactly as we expect to be for the year, mid-single-digit growth across the board on Consulting and Outsourcing. A little more pressure than we thought in the first quarter, but it'll play out the same over time.","Operator","Next question is Mike Nannizzi, Goldman Sachs.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Greg, could you talk a little bit more about the trends that you're seeing in the domestic risk book and, in particular, kind of on the renewals side? What do you think is contributing other than some exclusive actions you're taking? What is contributing to the fact that renewals are -- the profile of the renewal book is improving? And I have just one follow-up.","Gregory C. Case","So this really starts back to the investments we've made over a period of time, which we're rolling out globally, started in the U.S. and are now rolling out around the world. And as we have talked over the last number of quarters, we've invested heavily to put those in place. By the way, in the context of doing that, it's cost us some margin. And as those have come to fruition, we feel like we're going to get operating leverage, and that's really what you're starting to see. And that shows up in areas like Client Promise that we've rolled out, and the Revenue Engine, also areas as we've rolled out GRIP in the U.S. and now around the world. So these are fundamental investments that we believe are strengthening the business and strengthening our ability to both bring new clients in but also improve the value proposition to existing clients. And in doing so, you're going to increase retention and increase rollover. And that's really what we're seeing in the U.S. and we anticipate seeing around the world.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Can you tell me just in terms of like your relationship with clients, and we've had a couple years of rate gains here, are you able to secure better rates for your clients than the market overall? And is that a factor as people become a little bit -- maybe a little bit more bristled about further rate gains? Is that a relevant dynamic?","Gregory C. Case","Yes, what I would say is, so against -- we're not going to speak to specific competitors. But Aon is fundamentally built and has made what we believe to be unprecedented investment in content and capability that enable us to actually understand the market, measure risk and then bring the market to bear on behalf of our clients, respectfully, better than anyone else in the world. That's really the focus of the firm. You think about Aon Benfield. Aon Benfield spends in excess of $120 million a year on content and capability to help clients understand how to understand, measure risk, reduce risk, change volatility, reduce volatility. And in that regard, these are truly industry-leading investments. The purpose of these investments is to help drive better value for clients, and that shows up in multiple ways, terms, conditions, price, et cetera. And the same is true on the Retail side when you think about what we've done with the Global Risk Insight Platform. The Risk Insight platform, literally, is the single biggest database of risk information in the world. And as we mine that on behalf of our clients and better match carrier capital to client needs, we believe they benefit substantially. And if clients understand value, they'll pay for value. And that's what we're starting to see.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And just one follow-up, if I could, for Christa. I was trying to understand just the math on HR operating income. Let me know if this is wrong, but I think with kind of low-single-digit growth on the organic side, it would seem like you would need a couple hundred basis points of improvement year-over-year in the back half of the year to hit that mid-single-digit operating income increase year-over-year. Is that right or -- and if so, is that kind of what you're expecting?","Christa Davies","Yes, we are. And what we would say is, as we think about the year, we originally gave guidance to say that we would be down in the first half and up in the second half. We still believe that's right. And in terms of operating income patterning, it's really essentially down in Q1, essentially flat in Q2 and 3 and up in Q4. And the up in Q4 is substantial, as you described, really driven by seasonality, healthcare exchanges and restructuring savings.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. So it's further back-loaded. So it's not really not back half, it's really fourth quarter?","Christa Davies","Yes, it's mostly fourth quarter, that's right.  Really primarily driven by the seasonality, because the healthcare exchange investment and the revenue from healthcare exchange is really just showing up in Q4, makes Q4 sort of much more seasonally acute than it's previously been.","Operator","Last question is Mike Zaremski, Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Christa, could you update us on the client invoicing issue that took place last year and whether we should still expect a $350 million benefit to free cash flow this year? And I had a follow-up.","Christa Davies","Yes, we do expect to receive that benefit this year. We are continuing to make progress every quarter. And so we feel good about that progress.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And in regards to the Aon Hewitt restructuring plan, the 2012 10-K cites expected personnel reductions of 2,000. I noticed that number was up from 1,500 to 1,800 in the prior guidance or 10-K. So should the increased reduction result in eventual -- eventually, additional cost saves?","Christa Davies","Look, as we continue to implement the plans, we continue to update the numbers. And you see the numbers move slightly, as we update the most accurate numbers in the press release, as you can see, and we'll have them in the Q this quarter. Overall, we are on track to receive the $355 million of savings. So exactly where they come from does shift slightly between workforce reduction and leases on a quarterly basis as we complete the activities.","Operator","I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg Case for closing remarks.","Gregory C. Case","Thanks. I want to thank everybody for being part of the call this morning. We appreciate your interest in Aon and look forward to the conversation next quarter. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect at this time."],"2172":["Aon Corporation (NYSE:AON) Q4 2017 Results Earnings Conference Call February  2, 2018  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Gregory Case - President and Chief Executive Officer","Christa Davies - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Analysts","David Styblo - Jefferies","Sarah DeWitt - JPMorgan","Adam Klauber - William Blair","Elyse Greenspan - Wells Fargo","Meyer Shields - KBW","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley","Brian Meredith - UBS","Operator","Good morning and thank you for holding.

At this time, all parties will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer portion of today\u2019s call. If anyone has an objection, you may disconnect your line at this time.","I would also like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded and that it is important to note that some of the comments in today\u2019s call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our fourth quarter and full year 2017 results as well as having been posted on our website.","Now, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, President and CEO of Aon plc.","Gregory Case","Thank you and good morning everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2017 conference call. Joining me here today is our CFO, Christa Davies.","For your reference I would note that there are slides available on our website for you to follow along with our commentary today.","Before we discuss the financial results of the quarter, I'd like to reflect on Aon overall in 2017 and the efforts of my colleagues to further strengthen our firm consistent with Aon's record of value creation. This year was a pivotal year for Aon. As we completed significant steps to reinforce and build upon a decade long strategy to be a leading global professional service firm delivering a broad range of risk, retirement and health solutions enabled by proprietary Data and Analytics.","Earlier this year we completed the divesture of our outsourcing platform, a meaningful acceleration of our strategy and a tremendous accomplishment made possible by the tireless united efforts of our colleagues around the globe. The divesture provided a further catalyst for our strategy and actions to deliver shareholder value. And as it reinforced our focus to provide advise solutions and further align Aon's portfolio around our clients highest priorities.","It generated significant capital to accelerate investment and emerging client needs and in our firm. Noting over 1 billion invested on high growth areas of M&A again in 2017. It's part of the catalyst to further unite our firm and our one operating model creating greater efficiency and operating leverage across the firm.","And finally, the divesture reinforces our return on invested capital, decision making priority, and emphasis on delivering double-digit free cash flow growth over the long-term, highlighted by a record amount of capital returned to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends. Overall our optimism is got through conviction that the actions we're undertaking will substantially strengthen our firm on the heels of a decade of improvement in innovation for our clients and shareholders.","With this momentum we are already seeing improvement in our growth profile driven by new investments, high growth, high margin areas across our portfolio. Organic revenue growth has increased from 3% in both 2014 and 2015 to 4% in 2016 and 2017 and noting that we end the year with four of our five major revenue lines delivering 5% or greater organic revenue growth for the fourth quarter.","Again, I'd like to acknowledge my young colleagues who achieved these results while addressing many challenges, including working with our valued market partners to assist clients and navigating through one of the most challenging loss years in recent memory.","Now turning to the quarter on page 5 of the presentation, consistent with previous quarters, I'd like to cover two areas before turning the call over to Christa for further financial review. First, is our performance against key metrics we commit to shareholders; second is overall organic growth performance including continued areas of strategic investments.","On the first topic, our performance versus key metrics. Each quarter we measure our performance against the key metrics we focus on achieving over the course of the year. We organically expand margins, increase earnings per share and deliver free cash flow growth.","In the fourth quarter organic revenue growth was 6% overall highlighted by strong growth in every major revenue line, including double-digit growth in Data and Analytic Services. Operating margin increased 200 basis points primarily reflecting core operational improvement and savings from investments in our Aon United operating model. EPS increased 18% to $2.35 reflecting both strong operating performance and effective capital management, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate and a loss on the disposal of businesses.","If we turn to the year, organic revenue growth was 4% overall including growth in every major revenue line, [indiscernible] by strong growth in areas of continued strategic investment. Operating increased 180 basis points. EPS increased 17% to $6.52. And finally free cash flow decreased $1.2 billion primarily reflecting tax payments related to the divestiture of our outsourcing business and investments in our operating model.","Overall, a strong finish to the year with results of both the fourth quarter and full year reflecting strong organic revenue growth, core operational improvement and substantial progress in the first year of our Aon United operating model initiatives and effective capital management, highlighted by record return of capital for the full year.","Turning to slide 7, on the second topic of organic growth and strategic investments. Organic revenue growth was 6% overall in the fourth quarter. Further, four of our five revenue lines delivered organic growth of 5% or greater with particular strength in data analytic services, reinsurance and health solutions, reflecting on each of our core growth platforms. In commercial risk solutions, organic revenue growth was 5%, an acceleration from flat in the prior year quarter. On average globally exposures were modestly positive and the impact from pricing was marginally negative resulting in a relatively stable market impact overall.","Our results in the quarter primarily reflect strong growth in U.S. retail driven by double-digit new business generation and strong management of our renewable book portfolio. Internationally, we saw continued solid growth set by both Asia and Pacific regions. Results also entailed strong growth in our captive management business driven by multiple new client wins in the quarter, reflecting our leadership position in this space as we leverage our diverse risk consulting expertise to help clients relativesuccessful risk management program.","In Reinsurance Solutions, organic revenue growth was 8%, an acceleration from 1% in the prior year quarter. I would note this is the highest level of organic revenue growth achieved in our reinsurance business in over a decade. Results reflect growth across every major category including three placements, faculty replacements and capital market transactions.","Marketing path [ph] was neutral to results in the quarter reflecting both a continuation of moderating pricing as well as a modest upward pressure to loss exposed geographies. We saw particular strength in three placements driven by another quarter of record net new business generation. Results also reflect a modest nonrecurring benefit from many saving premiums as clients purchase more cover following the catastrophic events earlier in the year.","Overall, this was a tremendous year of growth for our reinsurance business, reflecting our leadership and unmatched level of investment in data and analytics, our record level of cap on issuance and additional revenues from Cat driven reinstatement premiums.","In Retirement Solutions, organic revenue growth was 4% acceleration from minus 2% in the prior year quarter. Results reflect growth across all major businesses and geographies. We saw particular strength in our talent rewards and performance practice primarily in [indiscernible] as well as assessment services. Results also reflect strong growth in investment consulting, including double-digit growth in delegated investment management solutions reflected an increase in client demand for Aon's tailored solutions and objective advices as well as an increase in performance fees for outperforming benchmark returns.","Assets under management delegated investment management continued to trend upward increasing from $118 billion in the third quarter of 2017 to $134 billion in the fourth quarter driven primarily by client wins. With the recent close of the Townsend Group acquisition our total assets under management heading into 2018 are now approximately $150 billion up more than 60% compared with the prior year quarter.","In Health Solutions, organic revenue growth was 6% against a strong comparable of 30% in the prior year quarter. We saw strong growth globally in health and benefits brokerage reflecting continued strength in the U.S. and double-digit growth in Canada, Latin America, EMEA and Asia. In Healthcare Exchanges we saw a solid growth in our Active Exchange, while results in [indiscernible] exchange were impacted by certain project work that benefited the prior year quarter.","In Data & Analytic Services, organic revenue growth was 12% an acceleration from 4% in the prior year quarter. Results primarily reflect continued growth in our Affinity business with particular strength in the U.S. growth in U.S. Affinity was highlighted by continued strong performance in Cat and travel solutions.","Lastly, following significant catastrophic flooding events in the second half of the year we also saw an increase in certain nonrecurring revenue relating to claims processing activity on our flood business during the quarter.","Turning to slide 8, to discuss areas of strategic investment. Clients continue to navigate in increasingly volatile world, but 2017 with 2017 being a costless year on record for weather related disasters, had an estimated $344 billion of economic losses. Weather related disasters, combined with economic, demographic, geopolitical forces and the exponential pace of technology change are all converging to create challenging new realities for our businesses and clients. ","Aon has a strong track record of allocating capital to developing innovative first to market solutions to help solve problems and create differentiated value and response to specific client needs. Driven by strong operating performance, underlying free cash flow growth and transaction related proceeds, we deployed more than $1 billion of capital to attractive M&A in both 2016 and 2017. These strategic investments in high growth areas while improving the firm's long term growth profile and increasing operating leverage across the portfolio.","We're investing organically and through M&A across our portfolio in areas such as Data & analytics and our important review businesses, in cyber risk advisory, in health and elective benefits brokerage through the acquisitions of Admix in Latin America and Universe and healthcare exchanges where we offer the broader set of solutions in health, geographically with the acquisitions of UMG and Henderson reinforcing our industry leading positive in the Netherlands and UK.","And finally, in delegated investment management solutions, a business with rapidly growing client demand with the acquisition of the Townsend Group. The addition of Townsend significantly expands our investment capabilities by bringing greater depth of expertise in real estate and real estate assets to Aon's distribution scale and furthers our ability to provide more attractive alternative private market asset capabilities to clients.","In summary, we finished the year with a strong performance in the fourth quarter reflecting 5% or greater organic growth across major revenue lines. Substantial operational improvement and significant progress in the first year of our Aon United operating model initiatives and effective capital management highlighted by the return of the record amount of capital to shareholders in 2017.","Looking forward, we head into 2018 with continued momentum. The growth profile of the firm is improving, amplified by an unmatched level of investment as we continue to focus the portfolio around our highest value solutions and our clients' brightest needs. Combined with core operational improvement and savings of the Aon United operating model we believe we're on track to exceed $7.97 of earnings per share in 2018 and deliver double-digit free cash flow growth over the long term driving the next wave of substantial value creation for shareholders.","I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Christa for further financial review. Christa?","Christa Davies","Thank you very much Greg and good morning everyone. As Greg [indiscernible] our results reflect a strong performance in the fourth quarter and a solid year of progress in 2017. During such a pivotal year for the firm we delivered strong organic revenue growth, substantial operational improvement and underlying free cash flow growth while continuing to take significant strength steps to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of our operating model.","In addition we deployed $3.8 billion of capital in 2017 including the return of record $2.8 billion to shareholders through share repurchasing dividends and $1 billion dollars in acquisitions in high-growth, high-margin areas of our portfolio.","Turning to slide 10 of the presentation, our core EPS from continuing operations excluding certain items increased 18% to $2.35 per share for the fourth quarter compared to $2 in the prior year quarter. And within the results was $0.06 per share favorable impact from foreign currency translation due primarily to a weaker U.S. dollar.","In addition, we incurred $0.06 per share unfavorable impact recognized through other expense from the sales of certain businesses in the quarter and losses on the re-measurements of assets and liabilities in nonfunctional currencies. If currency were to remain stable at today's rates, we would expect foreign currency translation to have a similar favorable impact in the first quarter of 2018. With full year EPS included a $0.13 per share unfavorable impact recognized through other expense primarily for losses on the re-measurement of assets and liabilities and nonfunctional currencies partially offset by an $0.08 favorable impact on EPS from foreign currency translations.","Certain items that were adjusted for in the core EPS performance and highlighted in the schedules on page 11 of the press release include non-cash intangible asset amortization, non-cash restructuring charges, non-cash expenses related to pension settlements, certain tax related impact due to changes in the statuary legislation and $14 million reduction in charges related to certain UK regulations and compliance matters on further review as we believe that UK regulator risk is less than previously anticipated. The prior quarter also included transaction costs related to the sale of the outsourcing businesses.","Turning to the next slide to discuss our strong operational performance, operating income increased $123 million or 18% with more than half of the dollar increase year-over-year driven by core operational improvements. Operating margin improved 200 basis points to 27.5% compared to the prior year quarter. Operating margin improvement reflects $56 million or 190 basis points of savings from restructuring savings and other operational improvements before any reinvestments.","This was partially offset by $3 million or minus 10 basis points of transaction costs related to recent acquisitions. FX translations have an immaterial impact to margin in the quarter. For the full-year operating income increased 15% and operating margin improved 180 basis points compared to the prior year. Operating margin includes up 20 basis points favorable impact from FX translations, offset by a minus 10 basis point impact to transaction costs related to acquisitions completed within the year and a minus 10 basis point unfavorable impact from lower non-cash income from pension and postretirement benefits.","From a dollar standpoint operating income increased $306 million with $165 million driven by savings before reinvestment and $141 million driven by solid organic revenue growth and co-operational improvement, a strong performance operationally in the first year of execution against our multiyear investment firm.","Before turning to the next slide, I want to spend a moment discussing the accounting changes that Aon will adopt beginning in the first quarter of 2018. There is a new accounting guidance related to the treatment of revenue from contracts with customers and new accounting guidance related to the presentation of costs associated with pension and other postretirement benefits. Ultimately these changes will have an immaterial impact on our full-year results. However, there will be a shift of certain revenues between courses most notably in our reinsurance business.","In order to help you understand the impact of these changes and to easily update your model, the company has released unaudited pro forma financials for the last eight courses that present the retrospective impact of both of these standards on 2016 and 2017 results. These schedule can be found on page 15 to 21 of the press release as that of an Excel format on the investor relations area of our website.","Moving on to page 12, I'd like to spend a few moments discussing the investments we're making to create the next generation global business model services model that allows for better scalability, flexibility and enhanced colleague and client experience. These investments are intended to create one operating model with increased operating leverage. Our primary investment areas are of course IT, real estate and people.","In IT we expect to create greater insight from data center optimization, application management and strategic vendor consolidation. In real estate we expect to drive greater collaboration and engagement through real estate portfolio optimization. And in people we expect to create greater scalability of operations and activity including the use of centers of excellence and third-party providers.","Our initial estimates were to invest $900 million of cash over a three-year period to deliver $400 million of annual estimated savings in 2019. After evaluating the current progress of the program and identifying further opportunities to improve our operating model, the program estimates have been updated to reflect an increase of $50 million in total expected savings for 2019. We now expect to invest an estimated $1.175 billion in total cash over three year period.","These investments include an estimated $975 million of cash charges. We have incurred $497 million of expense and spent $280 million of cash to date. Future cash outlay is expected to increase modestly in 2018 then expected to decline each year thereafter. And an estimated $200 million of incremental CapEx investments with $27 million incurred in 2017 and approximately $100 million expected in 2018 and $70 million expected in 2019. There is an additional estimated $50 million of non-cash charges included as part of asset impairments.","Overall we now expect these investments and other expense discipline initiatives to deliver $450 million of estimated annual savings in 2019 before any potential reinvestments. Further, we've been investing the balance of the transaction proceeds to the highest return on capital opportunities. As Greg mentioned, we returned a record $2.8 billion to shareholders in 2017 through share repurchases and dividends and we deployed over $1 billion of capital in acquisitions in high-growth, high-margin areas across the portfolio.","Turning to the next page, in the fourth quarter we incurred $96 million of restructuring -related charges relating primarily to workforce reduction and other general initiatives. Year-to-date we've incurred $497 million of restructuring related charges representing 48% of the updated total program estimates. The cash impact in 2017 was an outflow of $280 million. We recognized $56 million of savings in the fourth quarter and $165 million of savings for the full year, representing 37% of the expected $450 million total program savings.","Now let me discuss a few of the line items outside of operations on slide 14. Interest income increased $4 million to $7 million for Q4 compared to the prior year quarter reflecting additional income and on the balance of proceeds from the sale of the outsourcing business. As I noted last quarter higher cash balances in the short term have resulted in additional interest income, but balance of the coming down through the deployment of capital such that we would not expect the same level of interest income going forward.","Interest expense increased $1 million to $71 million in Q4. Other expense of $19 million primarily includes a loss on the sale of certain businesses and losses due to the unfavorable impact of exchange rates from the re-measurement of assets and liabilities and nonfunctional currencies. The prior year quarter reflects $9 million of income primarily including gains due to the favorable impact of exchange rates from the re-measurement of assets and liabilities in nonfunctional currencies.","Further, as I noted earlier, beginning in Q1 of 2018 we will adopt a new accounting standard that will shift the financial components of net periodic pension expense and net periodic postretirement benefit cost from above the line in compensation and benefit expense to below the line in other income expense. You can see the historical impact in our restated pro forma financials for 2016 and 2017 on pages 15 to 21 of the press release schedules or in appendix D of the presentation.","Based on current assumptions we believe that approximately $10 million per quarter is the right run rate to model for other income expense in 2018. Excluding all other items we do not forecast, that could be favorable or unfavorable in any given period.","Turning to taxes, the adjusted effective tax rate on net income from continuing operations excluding the applicable tax impact associated with certain non-GAAP adjustments increased to 15.5% compared to 12% in the prior year quarter. The adjusted effective tax rate in both periods reflects a net favorable impact in certain discrete items. The underlying operating rate was 17.9% based on geographic mix of income in the fourth quarter of 2017.","I [indiscernible] that this quarter includes $345 million of additional tax expense on GAAP earnings that was adjusted from the non-GAAP effective tax rate in the fourth quarter. This amount represents the provisional estimate of the impact of the U.S. tax reform based on Aon's initial analysis of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and may be adjusted in future periods.","Approximately $260 million of additional expense was incurred as a result of the transition tax related to repatriation of the cumulated foreign earnings and we would expect the cash associated with this expense to be paid out over the course of eight years. The balance of expense occurred in fourth quarter primarily relates to the write down of deferred tax assets to the reduction of the U.S. statutory tax rates. We expect that U.S. tax reform will have a modest upward pressure on effective tax rate.","Based on initial interpretation of the changes in U.S. legislation, current assumptions of geographic mix of income, and impact of discrete items, we believe the best estimate of our full year non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 19%. This legislation is very new and it is possible that will be further guidance from the U.S. Treasury and others on interpretational application of the new rules. This can result in adjustments to our estimates.","Lastly, weighted average diluted shares outstanding decreased 5% to $54.5 [ph] million in the fourth quarter compared to $268.3 million in the prior year quarter as we affectively allocate capital. The company repurchased $3.5 million class A ordinary shares for approximately $500 million in the fourth quarter and a record $2.4 billion of shares for the full year.","The company has approximately $5.4 billion of remaining authorization under the share repurchase program. Actual shares outstanding on December 31st were $247.6 million and there are approximately $4.5 million additional dilutive equivalents. Estimated Q1, 18 beginning diluted share count is approximately $252 million subject to share price movements, share issuance and share repurchase.","Now let me turn to the next slide to discuss our solid balance sheet and financial flexibility. At December 31, 2017 cash and short term investments decreased to $1.3 billion including the completion of both the Townsend and UMG acquisitions in the fourth quarter. Total debt outstanding was similar at $6 billion and total debt to EBITDA on a GAAP basis for continuing operations decrease modestly 3.2 times. As discussed previously, while debt to EBITDA will be initially elevated as a result of the sale of the outsourcing business, we expect to return back to the 2 to 2.5 times range by the end of 2018 driven by operational improvement.","Cash flow from operations for the full year decrease $1.2 billion to $669 million primarily driven by $940 million of cash tax payments associated with the divesture of the outsourcing business, $280 million of cash restructuring charges and $45 million of transaction costs related to the divesture of the outsourcing business, partially offset by operational improvement.","Free cash flow as defined by cash flow from operations less CapEx, decreased $1.2 billion to $486 million driven by a decline in cash flow from operations and $27 million increase in CapEx including investments to deliver Aon United operating model. Excluding the tax payments and transaction costs associated with the divesture as well as the investments in restructuring activities resulting from the divesture underlying free cash flow growth was 6% for the full year 2017. Given the strong organic revenue growth reported in the fourth quarter higher receivable balances increased working capital in the near term.","Turning to the next slide to discuss our free cash flow growth over the longer term, we value the firm based on free cash flow and allocate capital to maximize free cash flow returns. Disciplined capital management approach is focused on a decision making process that maximizes return on invested capital which we've consistently improved each year since 2010 increasing 610 basis points to 17.8% in 2017.","Either to feel so comfortable, We've also taken significant steps to maximize the translation of each dollar of revenue into the highest amount of free cash flow including working capital initiatives and actions to [indiscernible] cage our cash pension contributions. Since 2010 we've increased our free cash flow margin by nearly a thousand basis points. In 2017 free cash flow margin on underlying basis excluding the impacts of the divestiture was 17.8%.","Looking forward, we expect two main drivers to contribute to free cash flow growth over the long term. The first is continued operational improvement driven by organic revenue growth and margin expansion. The second is working capital improvements as we focus on closing the GAAP between receivables and payables we expect working capitals contribute to free cash flow by over $500 million over the long term.","In summary, we finished the year in a position of strength with momentum behind us as we head into 2018. We delivered strong operational improvements and double-digit earnings growth of 17% while continuing to make substantial steps to strengthen our firm over the longer term including investments in high growth areas and in our Aon United operating model.","We believe that continued operational improvements combined with significant financial flexibility and underlying free cash flow generation positions the firm to deliver on our near term goal of exceeding 7.97 or exceeding 7.977 target. Yes, it's a great question youre ho ? ies adjusted earnings per share in 2018. More importantly, we believe this reinforces our ability to deliver double-digit annual growth in free cash flow over the long term reflecting what we believe is the next significant value creation opportunity for shareholders.","With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Dave Styblo of Jefferies. You may now ask your question.","David Styblo","Hi there, good morning guys. How are you?","Gregory Case","Good Dave.","David Styblo","Good, so this is arguably the best organic growth quarter you've had in several years, not only from a total 6% standpoint, but also from a well balanced view where all the segments are contributing strong performance. And as always I can appreciate the margin profile and those puts and takes, but there are up 200 basis points in 4Q and that seems to be almost entirely driven by restructuring savings. And I know you guys have talked about reinvesting some of those savings at certain points. So I guess the question is, did you do that a material way this quarter and if not then why did margins expand more given the strong organic growth?","Gregory Case","So may be David a couple things, we'll hit the growth piece first and then sort of talk about the overall expansion as we think about improving the business overall which includes restructuring and core and Christa can talk about that a bit. First on the organic side, you're absolutely right, we feel very good not just about the quarter but really about across the year in terms of where we are and why we don't give specific guidance on expected levels of organic growth. If you look at our history and actual performance and put in perspective we think that's pretty interesting. If you go back and look at from '14 and '15 we're going roughly 3% across the board.","Now in '16 and '17 that\u2019s elevated to 4% and we're doing so in a way as Christa described, by investing in higher growth, higher margin areas in M&A and organically, as well as improving operating leverage of the firm. And that fundamentally is what's going to drive margin improvement overall and you're seeing that actually play out and it's played out in \u201917, played out in \u201916 and we would say as you go forward and think about organic growth, you're going to see that measured progression into \u201918 and \u201919. Now in terms of overall economic leverage and the operations we get out of it and Christa may be talk about the tradeoff between the two.","Christa Davies","Yes and Dave we\u2019re absolutely true with the operational performance in 2017, 15% operating income growth we're very, very pleased with. As we think about that 8% operating income growth driven by restructuring savings and 7% growth driven by co-operational improvements. As we think about the growth in operating income and margin going forward it's really going to be a blend of core improvements in operations, restructuring savings and a return on the investments we've made in M&A we really invested over $2 billion in M&A in the last two years.","And so we\u2019re driving up operating leverage on a sustainable basis and you can see that through the accelerated revenue growth that Greg described, so improved top line which is really leading to a much stronger bottom line performance. And you can see that historically accelerating as well, so we\u2019re very pleased with 2017 and we believe that we are very well positioned for a very strong 2018.","Gregory Case","That really does Dave put you on track if you think about the platform now, higher organic growth, higher margin, higher operating income growth across the board and we think \u201917 proves that out and \u201918 will show the same.","David Styblo","Okay, great and then, how do you guys think about the go no go decision for pay offs when you're generating incremental savings from restructuring plans versus making more restructuring investments. And kind if I take a step back and look at your additional $900 million investment looks like that was about a two-year, just over two year payback from the $400 million of savings and now you're spending about another $275 million.","It looks like that's going to generate $50 million of incremental run rate savings. So that's more like a, seems like more like a five to fix year payoff. So can just help me understand, how you guys think through that process of whether to invest and when not to invest for the savings?","Christa Davies","Yes, David it's a great question, because we really do think about this as we think about all forms of cash usage on a return on capital basis, cash-on-cash return. And so whether we're spending money on share repurchase which is really our highest return on capital opportunity, we spent $2.4 billion on that this year or its M&A where we spent $1 billion dollars on that and we spent money on M&A you've really got to get at a higher return on capital than share repurchase which we have across that range of terrific opportunities we've invested in this year, or on the restructuring program where we're generating a great return for shareholders.","And so it's a blend of all of these that gets us to return on capital as you can see for the firm at 17.8% in 2017. And so we're driving overall return on capital and as we think about that restructuring range of initiatives, we're very excited that we found incremental opportunities to generate more savings, overall a $450 million savings outcome in 2019 against $1.175 billion in cash that's a great return across that portfolio of activities.","Gregory Case","And again in essence if you think about sort of where we anticipate ending 2018 as you pull all this together the operating engine and the platform the Christa described and what we're doing with the operating model, we'll end \u201918 again with an engine called Aon with a higher organic growth profile, higher margin, higher operating income growth, higher return on invested capital and that really is sort of the reason we undertook all the activities post the divesture of our outsourcing business to really reinvest and strengthen the firm.","So the catalyst we talked about in June is really playing out we think quite effectively as we move into \u201918 and we want you think about sort of what we look like at the end of \u201918 when we get all this completed.","David Styblo","Okay, thanks and then just real quick on tax rates, I know you talked about 19% for this year. Previously you had talked about perhaps being able to have that drift over time, is there still an opportunity in \u201819 and beyond to see that tax rate possibly nudge down a little bit?","Christa Davies","What we would say is, our underlying effective rates were 17.5 for to 2017 and we do expect modest upward pressure based on U.S. tax reform. And what we would say is, based on what we estimate so far, our best estimate of full year non-GAAP for 2018 is 19% and we'll always look for opportunities whether that's tax rates coming down due to the tax rate, tax reductions across the world and we are very fortunate to be domiciled in the U.K. with a territorial system and a global capital structure where we manage all that capital and cash on a global basis.","Gregory Case","And one of the things, if you look at the punch line for tax rate overall and our history and sort of our capability in that arena, I think the punch line for us is really this is a marginal event overall as you think about all that's written about it. It doesn't change our views on what we're going to achieve for 2018 as Christa described at 7.97 plus doesn't change what we're doing from an operational improvement standpoint all the things we're doing that really is a marginal event overall in terms of what we're trying to accomplish and free cash flow generation of the firm nothing has changed in the context of any of this as we push forward.","David Styblo","Right, got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sarah DeWitt of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Sarah DeWitt","Hi, good morning. On the increase in the expense savings target, could you just talk about what areas drove that? And then secondly, at $450 million that's still only above 6% of cost, so to what extent do you think there could potentially going to be some more for further upside?","Christa Davies","Yes, Sarah as we think about it we're creating the next generation global business services model. I'm really driven by running Aon as one firm, Aon United and it's going to drive better scalability, flexibility and really operating leverage for the firm we're building in productivity savings as we scale the business going forward. And really as we looked across this operating model across the firm, it's really the same three areas that we're driving the increased savings in.","It's IT, it's real estate and it's people and as we bring Aon together really out of the two segments we used to operate in, in 2016 into one Aon operating model under Aon United, we're really identify further savings. $450 million is our current estimate of savings and that will be delivered in 2019 and we don\u2019t see further upside at this time Sarah, but we'll continue to optimize the model and we\u2019re very excited about the progress so far.","Sarah DeWitt","Okay, great thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Klauber of William Blair. You may now ask your question.","Adam Klauber","Thanks. Amazon had a big announcement obviously in the health industry. One are any of those companies your clients and two how do you think that will just some broad strokes how will that impact the industry over the like next five years or so?","Gregory Case","So Adam from our standpoint we don't talk about clients specifically, although I would say we're in a very privileged position in terms of who we serve across the world. And in terms of sort of what was announced, there's not a lot of clarity on it, but we love the spirit of it. We just absolutely love the spirit of it, you how much we love this category, it's just such a monumental opportunity and it's driven out of a set of needs both for companies and in their employees which is so high. I mean you know the statistics overall health is challenge.","Per unit cost health care is going up. You know the $150 million Americans that we address and this is really a U.S. story principally, although for us it's a global opportunity. But for $150 million Americans and employer sponsored plans there's just substantial pressure everywhere. And our whole, monitor our whole approach has been, you know when you can create greater alignment between employers and employees, greater transparency give them choice, they are least better decisions, healthier employees and lower costs and we are absolutely excited in favor of anything that moves in that direction because this opportunity is so massive.","And you know, we've invested very, very heavily and innovated around active employees as well as retirees and in a word we believe in a very, very unique position to shape this outcome and see in a movement my company has taken initiative in this arena is just absolutely terrific, so looking forward to see how this evolves.","Adam Klauber","Great and then Data and Analytics had clearly a strong quarter. Could you give just one or two examples of the type of wins that drove that could be a positive number.","Gregory Case","Well, actually Adam it really comes across the board. So the daytime expense is particularly on the Affinity side as that's an exceptional wins with clients. And again this is where we're taking segments of clients understanding sort of overall needs, aggregating those needs and coming up with very innovative solutions to address those needs and we've seen a great example of that across the board on the on the Affinity side.","We also have the business in point is in this category as well. We're actually helping insurers and broader companies think about more holistically how they think about their risk management needs. This is outside the placement in a consulting and advisory basis done exceptionally well in that. And as we added before we also benefited a bit given the activity in the second half of the year on the flood side.","So really this is for us, we love this category, this is obviously a category we're breaking out Data & Analytic services. We want to put a spotlight on it. It will be variable sometimes up a lot sometimes up a little bit. Over time, we think up a lot and it's an area of substantial investment we're going to make over time and we think it's going to be beneficial for Aon, for our clients, and for our shareholders.","Adam Klauber","Okay and then thanks. This is finally for Christa, operating cash at roughly $2.3 billion, $2.2 billion, $2.3 billion in \u201916 you are investing the business in \u201917, you're investing in \u201918, so by \u201919 do you think we get back to those levels or could we possibly exceed those levels by \u201919?","Christa Davies","Yes, look we certainly think that's true Adam and what we would say is our goal is really double digit free cash flow growth over the long term and we\u2019re obviously driving improved return on capital on a cash on cash basis driven by strong operational improvement, restructuring savings, and the return on the investments we're making in M&A. And so we feel all three of those are going to contribute strong free cash flow growth combined with working capital improvements which are going to be substantial over $500 million over the long term.","Adam Klauber","Okay great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar of Goldman Sachs. You may now ask your question.","Yaron Kinar","Good morning everybody. Thanks for taking my call. So my first question is with regards to the reiteration of the $7.97 EPS target for 2018, the adjusted EPS and I guess if I look at the net impact of tax reform and the $50 million of additional cost savings not all of which I'd expect to flow through in \u201918.","I think I get a negative impact between the two. So I'm just trying to better understand what else is driving either to feel so comfortable in that 7.97 or exceeding 7.97 target?","Christa Davies","Yes it's a great question Yaron, and what we would say is, we delivered 7% EPS growth in 2017, including a headwind from both a higher effective tax rate and significant one-time impact tin other expense year-over-year. Our underlying effective rate was 17.5 for2017 so you've got a modest upward pressure based on the changes in your tax reform, but despite the high tax rate of 19% we believe strong operational performance, savings and Aon United model, returns on the investments we've been making in high growth, high margin M&A areas, we'll continue to reinforce our confidence in exceeding 7.97 on 2018 and delivering double-digit free cash flow growth over the long term.","Yaron Kinar","Okay, just so it sounds like it's may be more of a margin improvement story given the investments you've undertaken?","Christa Davies","Absolutely, I mean it's operating income gross and it's operating income growth and it's operating income growth coming from the core, coming from restructuring and coming from the M&A investments we've made in high growth high margin areas.","Gregory Case","Understand as well, what we're doing on the one Aon approach on the operating side that Christa described, that's creating operating leverage in our business. This is just about a dollar tax save this creates greater operating leverage so as we grow organically we get disproportionate benefit from that and then if you think about sort of the investments and acquisitions and higher growth, higher margin areas all these things come together to give us the confidence that Christa described.","Yaron Kinar","Okay and then with regards to free cash flow generation so and you have a long term target of double digit growth. If I think let's say the next year, you think it's reasonable to expect that level of growth in 2018 on an underlying basis.","Christa Davies","Yes, I mean what we would say Yaron is we're looking at double digit free cash flow growth over the long term so that\u2019s every year over the next couple of years and what we would say is it's driven by \u201918 is absolutely going to improve and you still 6% underlying free cash flow growth in 2017 and really it was actually looking much higher that and really driven by very strong organic growth in Q4 we had slightly higher working capital and, so you can say that you're generating then even in 2017 with everything going on. We think 2018 will improve and 19, 20 and 21 will continue to accelerate form that.","Yaron Kinar","Okay, got it and one final question. Just you have very strong growth in the reinsurance brokerage business. Can you maybe walk us through your thoughts as to the ILS market in 2018. I think we've seen a lot of replacement of capital of the last quarter and a bit. How do you see that market develop over the course of this year.","Gregory Case","Yaron with first of all, we had a remarkable year and reinsurance for colleges just have done a terrific job sort in that category as we are number one in 3D, we're number one in fact, we're number one in ILS and make another additional investment sort of outside that, that sort of arenas sort of really was a remarkable year and we actually had progress on the organic side in all categories wasn't just one category.","And we also continue to make substantial sort of investments across the board to sort of strengthen or do nowadays in the context of that. So against that backdrop, when you think about sort of the ILS market number one of that marketplace that performed exceptionally well, if you look at now was about $600 billion in global reinsurance capital overall and alternative capitals to increase to about $82 billion give or take, so it's kind of 14%, 15% of the overall global reinsurance capital pool.","It was all terrific performance there and again our colleagues were just absolutely remarkable and both the level and quality of work they did throughout \u201917 and actually into \u201918 as we watch capital come back and [indiscernible] market come back in and replenish losses, so you're right it was a remarkable year for us on the reinsurance side across the board included in the ILS world.","Q - Yaron Kinar","And do you have any thoughts with regard to how that continues to develop an \u201918.","Gregory Case","Well, listen if you think about growth overall for us in \u201918 and you mention growth at the beginning and I would sort of say, sort of in that context we're going to continue to make progress as I mentioned we had some small benefit. In terms of sort of the reinstatements that happened sort of at the end of the year, so there's a bit there but we really saw growth in all the different areas I describe before.","You'll see a continuation of growth across Aon I don't think we always think about it from an Aon standpoint 3% in \u201814 and \u201815, 4% in \u201816 and \u201817 and you'll see that trend continue as we move into \u201918.","Yaron Kinar","Thank you. I appreciate all the color.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields of KBW. Your line is now open.","Meyer Shields","Thanks. Good Morning. Sort of a small ball question when you've got reinstatement premiums driving to a limited extent reinsurance organic growth are there any expenses offsetting those incremental revenues.","Gregory Case","There are some and again I would think about this moralistically, we've got the level of service required in the complexity of what went on sort of at the end of the year is just absolutely astronomical, so the things that cause those sort of that in ecosystem of sort of comes together in sort of the service of the client.","The payment of claims, the movement of service overall so for us this is, this kind of all blends together, so there is a little bit of potentially some upward pressure our upward benefit on the margin side but I wouldn't overplay that. Nor would I reply to the impact of the reinstatement they were there, they were real but when you think about performance overall it was really driven by fundamentals on the reinsurance side.","Meyer Shields","Okay, that's helpful. And then I guess this is for Christa, can you walk us through I guess directionally our changes in interest rate affect or interact with the new pension accounting.","Christa Davies","I'm not sure, Meyer I just [indiscernible] little bit more about your question because obviously interest rates if interest rates were to rise. They have a positive benefit to out pension unfunded liability and pension contributions by the time 100 basis point increase in the discount rate which is really equivalent to AA corporate bond rate reduces our pension unfunded liability by about $400 million and so I mean I don't know if that's helpful or what you were looking for.","Meyer Shields","It is, I just want to put that in the context of the new standards above the line versus below the line items.","Christa Davies","Sorry, there is no impact on the above the line, below the line. It's just a movement in the location of the P&L. Used to be in comp and benefits affects it's now in other income and expense there's no change the absolute dollar in the P&L. I mean we\u2019ve given guidance that what you should expect in other income and expense on that pension specific item is about $10 million in expense a quarter.","Meyer Shields","Right, so just close the loop if interest rates continue to rise, then obviously or I\u2019m asking not obviously that would benefit the expenses going forward.","Christa Davies","Yes, it would. ","Christa Davies","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from the line of ","Thank you very much. Thank you next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo. You may now ask your question.","Elyse Greenspan","Hi good morning. My first question you guys are pretty strong. Pick up and growth in commercial risk. I think there were some timing move in the third quarter, if you could just give us kind of a little bit of an outlook in that business and would you expect you guys pointed to a stable market impact overall in the fourth quarter, would you expect exposures and prices to move when we think about the market impact for 2018.","Gregory Case","So at least a couple perspectives first on commercial risk and again remember we're breaking out commercial risk differently than anyone else so we used have all these together now we\u2019re breaking out this specifically. We'd encourage you to look at that over the course of the year and you see \u201917 has continued progress over \u201916 our collogues continue to do a terrific job net new business generation was at record levels, so really terrific on the commercial reside.","And from a pricing standpoint your question we have to look at all and as we look at our overall book and we calculated down to the individual risk, exposures are modestly positive as we described pricing was marginally negative, still marginally negative leading to a relatively stable market in impact overall. I would have there as we said before insured values are what's most important, they drive more the economic impact and than anything else.","And as we absorb the global economic environments, we believe it looks slightly better in \u201918 then it is \u201917 which has positive implications but I would emphasize as we continue to do our work and make our investments in data analytics it means we're evaluating risk at a very detailed micro client level which we believe enables much better outcomes in pricing. In terms of issues for our clients and ends up being much less about the state of the market and more about individual client dynamics sort of the drive, sort of what happens for us overall.","And there's already a [indiscernible] for us in our client - and sort of what we've done there. The investments in these kinds of capabilities, we think create great outcomes for clients again analyze at the individual level and in our client for as example we got 800 clients, so there are now 300 placements. The clients were up 25% and so in this [indiscernible] we totally their choice. They're seeing an up and outcome an opportunity which is much better for them and so it's less about the overall market and where they are specifically we even had a client in energy client, Caribbean energy client.","That frankly it undergone some trauma was worried about literally whether you were going to come out in overall process to Aon client 3D and other analytics and end up actually at roughly stable pricing with very strong terms conditions and absolutely thrilled sort of the overall outcome, so I want to put in perspective on how we think about sort of the overall market environment much more clients and market.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, thank you and then in terms of the tax paid out well on the 19% going forward does that Christa this I know in the first quarter of last year there was obviously a benefit from stock comp, so we think about the 19% is that excluding if we can see any kind of benefit from the stock comp accounting in the first quarter and kind of X any other discrete items.","Christa Davies","At this stage Elyse it is all encompassing on that we would say it based on our initial interruption and changes in U.S. legislation, kind of functions of geographic mix and impact of discreet and therefore that\u2019s our full year non-GAAP effective rate at \u201919 and then based on what we see during the year this great could be up or down.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, great and then another question in terms of you guys have raised on the savings program by $50 million this quarter but the cash charges to go up by $275 million. I'm just trying to understand if we think about those two numbers together why would it have, why is it taking $275 million of additional charges to yield $50 million of additional saves. And basically reducing the yield, the yield on the charges of the entire program, what kind of really drove the higher cost with the $50 million this quarter.","Christa Davies","So Elyse we don't really think about it that way we think about it as an overall portfolio of the program and therefore we think about $1.175 billion in cash driving $450 million in savings which is a terrific return on investment as I said earlier on restructuring. We do really think about restructuring, share repurchase, M&A any kind of cash investment on a return on invested capital basis, cash-on-cash return.","And so we're looking at this cash-on-cash returning and saying that as an exception return. And we identified for the savings and we thought that it made sense to deliver those savings and so that's really how we're managing this on an overall portfolio basis as suppose the incremental way in which you described it.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, great and then one last question on the share repurchased obviously it's been [indiscernible] bit this year just given some of the acquisitions and when they closed, how should we think about the level of share repurchase going forward for 2018.","Christa Davies","So first of all we don't give guidance on share purchase what we can say is we've got a strong balance sheet, cash [indiscernible] from investments $1.3 billion at year end 2017 were generating strong free cash flow growth through the operating income growth and working capital improvements as we said and we look at allocating capital based on the highest return on capital on share purchase remains the highest return on capital activity across Aon which is why you saw as to $2.4 billion share repurchase in 2017 and we expect to continue share repurchase in 2018.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, thank you very much. I appreciate the color.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Kai Pan of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Kai Pan","Thank you and good morning. So I just follow up this question on the share buybacks. I just working through my math about the 2018 free cash flow is that like if you adding back the $940 million of onetime like a tax payments in 2017 we've got $1.4 billion is that run rate like a baseline run rate, is the correct way to look at it.","Christa Davies","I mean they're obviously some onetime cash outlays Kai in 2017 the two biggest ones with a $940 million of cash taxes as you said and the restructuring charges and so look what I would say is you so underlying free cash flow growth of 6% in 2017. There was one time items that you should back out to get your run rate and then we do expect strong free cash flow growth in 2018, driven by strong operational performance in the call, restructuring savings, return on the investments we've made from M&A and improvement from working capital.","Kai Pan","Okay, so if you could do the math 1.4 starting points you're going to spend same amount or leave it even more little bit more on the restructuring cost then you grow double digit on that and then you take $400 million, dividends you have more than a little bit more than a $1 billion dollars spend between acquisition and buybacks which will be significantly less than what have to seen in 2017.","Christa Davies","Kai, I\u2019m not going to give guidance from free cash flow for 2018. We don't give out that number what I can say is we do expect strong free cash flow growth in 2018. We do have an elevated cash and short term investments on the balance sheet $1.3 billion on left over from that cash in the transaction obviously we expect to generate substantial free cash flow in addition to the cash and short term investments have in the balance sheet to drive overall deployable cash in 2018.","We believe the highest return on capital activity to use that cash is share repurchase and we expect obviously to look at M&A. We've got a terrific M&A pipeline and to continue organic investment. As we have in 2017 in high growth areas of the business.","Kai Pan","Okay, that's great. My follow up is on is different topic on the FCA investigation if I heard it correctly you mentioned that there are some reduction in term of regulatory related costs in the quarter could you explain a bit the what's behind that and also did you have any updates on the FCA investigations.","Gregory Case","One of my start just overall and Christa can talk specifically about sort of what we did in the quarter because indication sort of how we feel about the process overall at this point. First we welcome the opportunity to assess wise to make our industry more effective and responsive to clients fundamentally that's what this is all about. I\u2019d reserve three things sort of in the context of this. One is around the client imperative what this all means, the second is kind of the size of our work in this area.","Aon\u2019s work in this area because it seems the numbers don't quite make sense to us and then overall profitability and the impact that this might have been in London that's been written about two which also don't seem to square with totally the fact but the most important piece of this is the clients in all aspects what we do has to focus on client value and clients [indiscernible] it really is a reason our industry exists and why Aon exists.","And we invest in huge amount in the city to innovate for our clients and even the restaurants got to drive value for our clients be fully transparent to them in our approach and also the optional. And every respect, they've got to be able to decide where they want to begin to approach out of the approach and as I described before Aon client 3d is a great example. We spent years develop the analytics behind it and we're able now to look at our book of business risk by risk than aggregate it's a portfolio level.","This creates enormous benefit for our clients and by the way 1800 of opted into this their choice it's grown by 25% in \u201917 coming up on 4000 placements I think 3800 placements and gave the examples of the Caribbean energy company. I kid you not this company was in a situation where it was really struggling in terms of what the risk programs and look like going forward and to be able to take advantage Aon client 3D 20% guarantee capacity literally fully set on followed price, followed form, followed claims.","From really care was incredibly helpful even more some may be in the lifesaver in terms of how they thought about it, so very, very positive and would highlight, what we do there is it's a lot of service, lot of activity under are urge has to do, so we do the underwriting a policy issuance, the administration etcetera. So the care doesn\u2019t bear that cost we do, I'm really trying to highlight is one point around the client imperative of this. And the second is just the size of our work in this area I've just highlight for the perspective on this call I put everything into this category called facilities although we would argue Aon client 3D is long way from a classic facility.","And the amount we place in on the market amounts to less than $40 million in revenue just for reference which is sort of lot of suspect written but that's the facts and then finally the one I find most interesting is sort of that the overall profitability is impacting the London market operating costs, just for reference it's just not actually correct if you look at sort of store everything and our overall benefit what we get paid is we place premium in a London market that yields so we moved over denominator very straightforward everything and including the cost and client 3D everything.","It\u2019s basically then flat for last five or six years, so there's no kind of super normal return here when you put everything together and anything we get extra sort of on the client 3D piece again we're investing heavily to actually do services that underwriters used to do, so for us the most important piece of this all things as I were started was we just see such great value for clients and getting our risk place and getting our claims paid. This is an area of substantial investment for us. And we absolutely welcome the opportunity to assess how we can make our industry more competitive on these fronts. Now against that backdrop the punch line of that is you ask us, how do we assess our risk is it going up or down you know Christa may be you can talk about both the action we took in the quarter.","Christa Davies","Yes and so what you saw in the quarter Kai was that we took a reduction a $14 million in charges related to certain U.K regulatory and compliance matters. As we believe our U.K. regulatory risk is less than we previously anticipated.","Kai Pan","I really appreciate all the color.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome of Sandler O'Neill. You may now ask your question.","Paul Newsome","Just want to see if you could give us a little bit of color about the margin impact on the acquisitions that you've made whether or not we should see the compression or expansion related to the acquisitions themselves and if those impacts are change over time when you peers talked about sort of margin compression.","Christa Davies","And Paul that is exactly right. I think what we observed in the first year of an acquisition is margin compression and you saw in the quarterly close you know two fantastic acquisitions the Townsend Group and UMG and we certainly saw margin compression in Q4 due to acquiring those businesses and so what you usually see is margin compression in the first year and then they contribute to margin expansion and operating income growth in the years thereafter. And really the reason for that margin compression in the first year is just the transaction cost to close the acquisition.","Paul Newsome","So if that's acquisition cost it presumably you're essentially putting businesses on at the same that have the underlying same margin as opposed to trying to buy something that you\u2019re hearing expand the margins.","Christa Davies","Yes, so we are obviously investing in higher growth, higher margin opportunity areas and we certainly see that, that was the case in 2016 and 2017 and then as you bring them into Aon we can really scale those businesses on to expand margins over time.","Gregory Case","One of the realities Paul for us is that you think about the foundation of the return on invested capital approach that Christa described and we take in every investment of capital we make we don't invest this to get bigger I mean our is has to be we are bringing in content that we can scale and in doing so we create we think superior economic value. Christa describe in the transition costs of doing that and what you've got the fees etcetera up front but there's no business we bring in sort of say we're just going to continue to have a performance performed.","We're taking their business and scaling across Aon are finding ways to improve that business based on Aon assets and I fundamentally drives the transactional capital approach we take otherwise you don't make acquisitions because buyback looks better.","Paul Newsome","Fantastic congrats in the quarter.","Gregory Case","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith from UBS. You may now ask your question.","Brian Meredith","Hey thanks. Couple of quick questions for you, first Christa, just I believe you give what your kind of free cash flow based on that for 2017 is in the presentation that's like $1.8 billion is that correct, the Appendix G gives us 1778.","Christa Davies","Yes, that's right.","Brian Meredith","Okay, so that's what we can used as a baseline here kind of looking forward okay.","Christa Davies","Yes.","Brian Meredith","Second question is, I'm just curious when you think about the expense saves and stuff kind of going forward and kind of benefits, what are you thinking about and I guess as far as wage inflation because we're definitely seeing some upward pressure on that going forward?","Christa Davies","Yes, Brian one of the things we would say is, we normally expect wage inflation let's call it, 2% on your biggest expense base call people. What we would say though is, we're obviously investing a significant amount of money, $1.175 billion in the Aon United operating model and the reason why I'm investing that kind of moneys drive $450 million of savings is because we are trying to get better operating leverage throughout our business.","And improved productivity going forward and so we expect the investments we're making in the operating model to offset some post and that wage inflation to give us greater operating leverage in our business going forward.","Brian Meredith","Hey great, and then last question Greg or Chris could you talk a little bit about stars Freberg, how is that kind of perform for you since you brought it in and also I know you were looking to come to develop then bunch of insurance products around cyber which stars Freberg can you talk about progress there, how is the market accepting et cetera?","Gregory Case","Yes, Brain for us we love this investment and it really just speaks to what innovation means and how one pursues it. Again if they're back and think about their well cyber marketplace just for reference pick your number $2.5, $3 billion of premium in 2017 give or take, by the way going up substantially, so the industry is celebrating. We've got a category, it\u2019s new, its going up, it's terrific by the way Aon places as much or more than anybody in the marketplace you've got an incredible group of colleagues have driven this and led this having said that our colleagues would be the first to say look when you think about client need.","Client need and our ability to meet their increasing needs on Cyber pick take your numbers its $450 billion of loss connected to related to cyber in \u201917 so think about Brian $2.5 billion to $3 billion in premium, $450 billion and reported loss connected thereof. And by the way just for reference that includes zero for Europe and by the way just for reference that includes roughly zero for Europe because they didn't require you to report cyber losses that will obviously change in May, June of this year when GDBR kicks in and the regulations require cyber laws sireqiinI [indiscernible] and the regulations require cyber loss reporting which means cyber loss on a global scale is going to a trillion dollars.","And yet worse our industry and by the way we're the leader, our industry is $2.5 billion to $3 billion. We are not meeting the needs of our clients, so we said listen what's the root cause of that how do we understand that and that's why we brought in [indiscernible]. This was not a set of is not a set of colleagues who knew insurance but they knew cyber better than anyone in the world. They do cyber remediation, identification, they work for boards extensively. They've got a database of 45,000 cyber events and growing every day.","So if we could actually help capital underwriters understand where and how to address the cyber we would end up with a much better set of products on behalf of our clients and we're seeing great uptake in terms of sort of that it's going to take time no doubt this is not an easy thing to do but watch the press and you'll see some announcements all over the coming bit of time that we think will be interesting in terms of sort of innovations but it will be proper you know be steps at a time around all the progress.","One thing is for sure if we as an industry don't innovate on behalf of our clients in the topic of cyber they will leave us behind and so we have got to be on front of it in [indiscernible] Freberg is a great example as how you get out in front of it as well as bring in another capability that we have around the firm, so we're excited about it. It will take time, will take energy but credit to my Aon colleagues who've really sort of embraced that challenge enter and are working to through and we're excited about it for clients.","Brian Meredith","Great, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg Case for closing remarks.","Gregory Case","I just want to say thanks everybody for taking part today. We look forward to discussion next quarter. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. That concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."],"1830":["Aon Plc (NYSE:AON) Q2 2014 Earnings Conference Call July 25, 2014  8:30 AM ET","Executives","","Greg Case \u2013 President and CEO","Christa Davies \u2013 EVP and CFO","Analysts","","Elyse Greenspan \u2013 Wells Fargo","Jay Cohen \u2013 Bank of America","Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore","Brian Meredith \u2013 UBS","Ryan Barnes \u2013 Jamie","Meyer Shields \u2013 KBW","Adam Klauber \u2013 William Blair","Paul Newsome \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill","Michael Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Kai Pan \u2013 Morgan Stanley","","Operator","Good morning and thank you for holding. Welcome to Aon Plc\u2019s Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I would like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded and that it is important to note that some of the comments in today\u2019s call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature as defined in the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject of certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results of those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our second quarter results, as well as having been posted on our website.","Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, President and CEO of Aon.","Greg Case","Good morning everyone, and welcome to our second quarter 2014 conference call. Joining me here today is our CFO, Christa Davies. Consistent with previous quarters, I\u2019d like to cover three areas before turning the call over to Christa for further financial review. I would note that there are slides available on our website for you to follow along with our commentary today.","First is our performance against key metrics we communicate to shareholders. Second is overall organic growth performance. And third, continued areas of strategic investment across Aon.","On the first topic, our performance versus key metrics, each quarter, we measure our performance against the four metrics we focus on achieving over the course of the year, grow organically, expand margins, increase earnings per share and deliver free cash flow growth.","Turning to Slide 3. In the second quarter, organic revenue growth was 2% overall, highlighted by solid growth in our international retail brokerage and HR outsourcing businesses. Operating margin decreased 30 basis points as continued improvement in Risk Solutions, was more than offset by unfavorable currency and an anticipated decline in HR Solutions. EPS increased 13% to $1.25 reflecting underlying operational improvement, a lower effective tax rate and strong share repurchase.","Finally, free cash flow increased 5% as solid underlying working capital performance was partially offset by higher cash taxes.","Overall our second quarter results reflect continued underlying progress in effective capital management, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings growth, despite industry and foreign currency headwinds. We\u2019re returning a record amount of capital to shareholders, that\u2019s highlighted by a return of $1.4 billion of capital through the first 6 months of 2014. While continuing to make strategic investments that will drive greater long-term growth, strong free capital generation and increase financial flexibility.","Turning to slide 4, on the second topic of growth, I want to spend the next few minutes discussing the quarter for both of our segments. In Risk Solutions, organic revenue growth was 1% reflecting solid growth in retail brokerage, partially offset by an anticipated decline in reinsurance. As we discussed previously, we\u2019re driving a set of initiatives that are strengthening underlying performance and positioning our Risk Solution segment for long-term growth and improved operating leverage. With management of our renewal booked portfolio through client promise and retention rates of more than 90% on average, highlighting strong client satisfaction in retail brokerage.","New business generation of $280 million across our retail business highlighted by record new business in US retail and double digit new business growth in most markets across Asia and Latin America. Investments in innovative technology and service capabilities with the growth of GRIP and Aon Broking delivering increased operational leverage. And in our core treaty reinsurance business, net new business trends have now been positive for 13 consecutive quarters. An outstanding performance in today\u2019s changing marketplace that reflects Aon Benfield\u2019s long-term value proposition for clients.","Booking on data, analytics and the application of excess capital in the industry, to previously uninsured risks. Reflecting on the individual businesses within Risk Solutions, in the Americas, organic revenue growth was 2%. Exposures continue to be positive across the region, while the impact on pricing was flat to modestly negative; we\u2019ve all seen continued stable market impact. We saw growth across all regions, U.S, retail, Latin America and Canada, including continued growth across all major businesses, property casualty, health and benefits and Affinity.","In U.S. retail, we saw solid growth turned by record levels of new business generation and strengthening in construction. In International, organic revenue growth was 3%, similar to the prior year quarter. Exposures are stable and the impact from pricing was modestly negative on average, driven by continued softness in many regions across Europe.","Results reflect strong growth across Asia and emerging markets, driven by double-digit new business generation in many countries, with solid growth in a number of other markets, mainly New Zealand, Italy and the Netherlands. In Continental Europe, we\u2019ve continued to deliver solid growth against sustained economic and market headwinds driven by strong management of our renewable portfolio.","And while economic conditions still remain relatively fragile across many core markets; we continue to see signs of economic stabilization throughout the region. In reinsurance, as we noted on previous calls, we expect macro factors to be a headwind in 2014. Overall organic revenue growth was minus 4% and in-line with expectations. Results reflected anticipated unfavorable market impact in treaty and a decline in faculty replacements, which tend to be lumpy quarter-to-quarter. We saw strong growth in our capital markets transaction advisory business, as I mentioned earlier, positive net new business for the 13th consecutive quarter in treaty placements.","As we\u2019ve noted previously, reinsurance capital is at an all time high, and seasons are retaining more risk, driving an expected negative market impact, most notably in the US, but have an impact globally. Absent in an event in the industry, macro factors are expected to continue to be a significant headwind for the balance of 2014, with results lumpy quarter-to-quarter given the timing of growth and faculty replacements on our capital markets transactions and advisory business.","Turning to HR Solutions, overall organic revenue growth was 2% similar to the prior year quarter, with growth in both consulting and outsourcing. Underlined performance in the second quarter reflects growth in areas where we\u2019re making significant investments in the business, including pension risk and delegated investment solutions.","These investments reflect Aon Hewitt\u2019s client leadership, understanding an influence of market trends and the long-term issues that face our clients. As healthcare reform, healthcare costs and the associated financial risks continues to rise at a time when overall health and wellness is not improving; multinational clients are increasingly looking for global benefit solutions that support their global organizations, delivered at the local level.","Managing and transferring risk against pension schemes are increasingly frozen and largely underfunded.","Turning to the individual businesses within HR Solutions. In Consulting Services, organic revenue growth was 1%, a solid performance against the strong comparable of 6% growth in the prior year quarter. Underlying results reflect solid growth in U.S. retirement, primarily from investment consulting and delegated pension management services.","As long as growth and talent solutions, which is benefiting from M&A and IPO activity. Results were partially offset by a modest decline in retirement in Continental Europe.","Now onto Q1, results include an anticipated unfavorable timing of revenue in compensation consulting that will be recognized in the second half of the year. For the full year, we continue to expect low to mid-single digit organic growth across consulting services.","In Outsourcing, organic revenue growth was 3% compared to flat in the prior year quarter. Growth reflects new client wins and benefits administration the projected revenue, driven by demand for discretionary services.","For the full year we would expect stronger organic growth in outsourcing, when taking into consideration of seasonality of revenue recognition in the healthcare changes in Q4.","Slide 5 highlights the third topic, areas of investment. Aon has a unique and strong track record of developing innovative solutions to help solve problems and create differentiated value in response to specific client needs.","Solid long-term operating performance combined with expense discipline and strong free cash flow generation, continues to enable substantial investment in colleagues and capabilities around the globe. A few examples include, in Risk Solutions, we\u2019re investing in client leadership with the international rollout of the Revenue Engine and Client Promise to drive greater productivity and efficiency.","We\u2019re investing in innovative technology, such as the Global Risk Insight Platform. GRIP is the world\u2019s leading global database of risk and insurance placement information, now capturing 2.1 million trades and a $108 billion of bound premium. We continue to have a growing list of more than 30 insurance carriers; utilizing platform for its analytics and services capabilities and increasing number of clients are also adding strategic consulting services.","In addition, we\u2019re driving our Aon Broking initiative to better match client needs with insurer appetite for risk, as highlighted by our ability to package similar risks and place substantial programs and facilities into the market on behalf of clients. We continue to align our global health and benefits platform to better capitalize on our global distribution channel and deep brokerage capabilities. Furthermore we\u2019re developing analytics to create globally consistent actuarial valuation and benchmarking models for health and other employer sponsored benefits.","We\u2019re also investing in the further development of data and analytics capability at Aon Benfield to strengthen an already industry-leading value proposition and client-serving capability.","A great example of this is our Impact Forecasting Center, the only catastrophe modeling center integrated into our global reinsurance broker. Another example of this is Freddie Mac where we\u2019re bringing insurance capital to bear against mortgage risk in the U.S.","Finally we\u2019re expanding our footprint through over $500 million of tuck-in acquisitions so far in 2014 that either increased scale in emerging markets or expand capability to better serve clients. Year-to-date we\u2019ve completed seven acquisitions in the areas including flood, employee benefits and consultancy, spread in multiple geographies including the U.S., UK and the Pacific region.","In HR Solutions, we continue to invest and innovate solutions in high growth areas. We\u2019re expanding solutions to de-risk pension plans and are seeing tremendous growth in our delegated investment solutions, which fulfill our clients\u2019 needs for faster execution of their investment strategies.","We\u2019re also providing a broader set of advisory and advocacy solutions to our clients\u2019 employees, to enable greater choice and improve decision making under retirement options, especially important is regulatory changes around the world require more involvement from individuals.","We continue to make significant investments to support future growth and strengthen our industry leading position in health exchanges for active employees and retirees. As part of our comprehensive portfolio of health solutions, covering the full spectrum of benefit strategies.","As we progress through the sales cycle, we feel good about the pipeline. We\u2019re focusing on client and employee satisfaction during the upcoming global period. And we would anticipate a solid mix of both new and existing clients with a broader range of industries participating. We look forward to updating you on our progress later this year when our primary sales cycles has ended. We also continue to invest in our industry leading benefits and administration solutions and technology platforms, including extensive mobile solutions and cloud based outsourcing solutions.","And finally, we\u2019re strengthening our international footprint to support our global workforce, with investments in key talent and capabilities across emerging markets.","In summary, our second quarter results reflect strong earnings growth of 13% including growth in each segment, underlying operational improvement and effective capital management, despite challenges from both foreign currency translation and market impact.","We\u2019re firmly on track to deliver continued growth across each segment, operational improvements and returns on investments. And significantly increase financial strength in 2014.","With that said I\u2019m now pleased to turn the call over to Christa for further financial review.","Christa Davies","Thank you so much Greg and good morning everyone. As Greg noted, our second quarter results reflect underlying operational improvement, double-digit earnings growth for the fourth consecutive quarter and effective allocation of capital, highlighted by the repurchase of 650 million of ordinary shares in Q2. I would note this is more share repurchase than we\u2019ve done in any quarter since 2008, reflecting our long-term belief and the strengthening free cash flow of the firm.","Now let me turn to the financial results for the quarter on page 6 of the presentation. Our core EPS performance excluding non-cash intangible asset amortization increased 13% to a $1.25 per share for the second quarter compared to a $1.11 in the prior year quarter.","Results from the quarter reflect underlying operational improvement, a lower effective tax rate and strong share repurchase. In addition, foreign currency translation had a $0.03 unfavorable impact on EPS in the quarter due primarily to a weaker dollar versus the British pound. Its currency to remain stable at today\u2019s rates, we would expect a similar unfavorable impact in both Q3 and Q4.","Now let me talk about each of the segments on the next slide. In our Risk Solutions segment, organic revenue growth was 1%, operating margin increased 20 basis points to 22.7%, and operating income increased 1% versus the prior year quarter. Margin expansion in the quarter was driven by modest organic revenue growth, return on investments and underlying expense discipline, partially offset by a $15 million or minus 80 basis points unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding foreign currency, adjusted operating income increased 5% and operating margin increased 100 basis points.","Let me spend a moment on the formal restructuring programs, key initiatives that have enabled concurrent funding of investments and long-term structural margin expansion. Under the Aon Hewitt program, approximately $99 million of estimated savings will be achieved in Risk Solutions. Approximately $88 million of the cumulative savings have been achieved under the program to-date, with the remaining $11 million to be achieved by the end of 2014. We have incurred a 100% of the charges necessary to deliver the remaining savings.","Overall in the second quarter, we delivered solid underlying operating performance in Risk Solutions, despite challenges from foreign currency translation and an unfavorable market impact in reinsurance, demonstrating solid underlying progress as we generate returns on our investments and manage expenses. For the first six months Risk Solutions margins were up 70 basis points including a minus 40 basis point unfavorable impact from foreign currency, placing us firmly on track for margin improvement for the full year and continued progress towards our long-term target of 26%.","Turning to the HR Solution segment, organic revenue growth was 2%, operating margin decreased 170 basis points to 13.2% and operating income decreased 8% versus the prior year quarter. Modest organic revenue growth and restructuring savings in the quarter were more than offset by an anticipated increase in expense to support future growth in our healthcare exchange business. We also had an unfavorable impact from timing of certain revenue in our consulting business, similar to Q1.","In our second quarter, results were exactly in-line with expectations and management\u2019s guidance previously provided to the HR Solutions business. With respect to the Aon Hewitt restructuring program, approximately $294 million of the $303 million in total cumulative savings have been achieved under the program, with the remaining $9 million to be achieved by the end of 2014.","As discussed previously we provided commentary regarding the outlook for the HR Solution segment in 2014 and that outlook is unchanged. For HR Solutions in 2014, we expect to \u2013 number one, deliver organic growth, number two, generate greater scale and improved returns from investments; three, deliver remaining savings and related to the restructuring programs; and four, deliver greater than mid-single digits operating income growth and further margin expansions towards our long-term target of 22%.","Overall, we are firmly on track for greater than mid-single digits operating income growth in 2014 with Q1 and Q2 down as expected. We expect to be up in the second half of the year with the patterning unchanged, relatively flat in Q3 and up substantially in Q4 related to strong organic growth driven by healthcare exchanges.","Now, let me discuss a few of the light items outside of the operating segments on slide 9. Unallocated expenses decreased $3 million to $41 million, interest income was similar at $2 million, interest expense increased $17 million due to an increase in total debts outstanding in the second quarter and cost associated with certain derivative hedging programs. Other expenses $2 million primarily including $5 million of net losses due to unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates on the re-measurement of assets and liabilities in nonfunctional currencies, partially offset by gains on certain long-term investments. Going forward, we expect a run rate of approximately a million dollars per quarter of interest income, $45 million of unallocated expense and $66 million interest expense per quarter.","Turning to taxes. The effective tax rate on net income from continuing operations was 17.5% compared to 26.4% in the prior year quarter. The effective tax rate in the second quarter of 2014 was favorably impacted by changes in geographic distribution of income and certain discrete items. As previously noted, potential unfavorable discrete tax adjustments in the second half of 2014 could cause the effective tax rate for the full year 2014 to be higher in the 18.3% effective tax rate reported in the first half of 2014. Lastly, average diluted shares outstanding decreased to $301.6 million in the second quarter compared to $317.1 million in the prior year quarter.","The company repurchased $7.4 million Class A ordinary shares for approximately $650 million in the second quarter. The company has 1.6 billion of remaining authorization under its share repurchase program. Actual shares outstanding on June 30th were $291 million and there are approximately $8 million additional diluted equivalence. Estimated Q3 2014 beginning diluted share count is approximately 299 million subject to share price movements, share insurance and share repurchase. Now let me turn to the next slide to highlight our strong balance sheet and cash flow on page 10.","At June 30th, 2014 cash and short-term investments were $726 million. Total debt outstanding was approximately $6 billion and overall debt-to-capital increased to $43.6 billion at June 30th compared to 37.4% at March 31st driven by an increase in total debt outstanding at the end of the quarter. However, I would note that at June 30th the company held $681 million as a deposit with the trustee included in other current assets in the balance sheet, which was used subsequent to the close of the quarter to repay $681 million of notes due July 1st.","Following this repayment, total debt outstanding was approximately $5.3 billion and overall debt-to-capital was 40.6%. Cash and short-term investments remain at $726 million. In Q2, cash flow from operations increased 3% to $344 million driven primarily by solid underlying working capital performance, partially offset by higher cash taxes and organic revenue growth. Free cash flow as defined from cash flows from operations less CapEx increased 5% to $284 million in the second quarter driven by an increase in cash flow from operations and a $2 million decrease in CapEx.","Turning to the next slide to discuss our significant financial flexibility. We value the firm based on a free cash flow and allocate capital to maximize free cash flow returns. There are three primary areas that will contribute to our goal of doubling free cash flow to more than 2.3 billion annually within the next three to five years. From the graph in the presentation based on current assumptions, we expect annual free cash flow to increase by over $600 million over the next five years based only on a reduction in cash use of pensions and restructuring.","Combined with growth in the goal business, further margin expansion and a reduction in the overall effective tax rate we are well on track to achieve our expectations with a substantial cash flow generations. Regarding our underfunded pension plan, we have taken significant steps to reduce volatility and liability as we\u2019ve close plans\u2019 for new entrants both in plants from accruing additional benefits and continue to de-risk certain plan assets.","We currently expect contributions to decline by roughly a $138 million to $385 million in 2014 and continue to decline thereafter. Regarding our restructuring plans, cash payments were a $152 million in 2013, as all charges related to restructuring program have now been incurred we would expect cash payments to decline by $54 million to approximately $98 million in 2014 and continue to decline significantly each year thereafter.","In summary, we delivered strong earnings growth and underlying operational improvement in the second quarter. We are firmly on track to generate more than $2.3 billion of annual free cash flow over the next three to five years. Combined with a strong balance sheet and significant financial flexibility, we continue to strengthen the firm through significant shareholder value creation in 2014 and beyond.","With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question comes from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Elyse Greenspan \u2013 Wells Fargo","Hi, good morning. I was first hoping to start off just in terms of more commentary in terms of the reinsurance market, it just seems like a sharp shift to go from the 3% growth you saw last quarter to the 4% decline this quarter and I know the competitive dynamics have seemed to intensified a bit, if you can just talk about what\u2019s specifically changed in the second quarter a little bit more, and then also in terms of an outlook for the balance of the year, would you look for a similar decline in about that 4% range; I know you mentioned some one-time items that are \u2013 to negatively impact that number in the quarter?","Greg Case","Couple of thoughts on this. First, let\u2019s think about sort of the evolution on the reinsurance side it has been \u2013 we\u2019ve talked about, we\u2019ve been talking about this last couple of years, is we talked about first more capital in the industry, we\u2019re an all-time high, little over $550 billion at the end of Q1 \u201814, and against that we knew that there would be pressure and pressure movement on price and there certainly has been, and again largely as expected. A little maybe more in this quarter, as we said before, there is a little bit of lumpiness looking back at the business, but we expect to be offset to the balance of the year.","So, generally as we said before, overall pressure in the overall market, what we would also highlight though as we\u2019ve been talking about \u2013 look at the end of this day this is really about helping match capital with client need and while this brings about some challenges, it also brings about lots of different opportunities, as you think about some of the opportunities in the insurance linked security world, and the cap on world really bringing capital and do things we haven\u2019t done before as we\u2019ve have done with Freddie Mac, the example I gave in my commentary.","So we would say that on balance there is pressure, no doubt. There will continue to be pressure on the second half of the year but it also marks with an opportunity. For the first time ever, we are starting to see the retentions which were going up start to actually stabilize as clients see more opportunity they have seen before to actually utilize our reinsurance capital.","So, we see the market pressure. I would continue to put in context though, if we look at our overall Risk Solution business and in the context of our Risk Solutions business, we finished the first half of the year with the market pressure and with the FX pressure having grown the business, increased margin and we fully expect that to continue. We believe as much conviction now we had at the beginning of the year, but our team will finish the year with organic growth and Risk Solutions and with margin expansion Risk Solution irrespective of the other pieces. So that\u2019s roughly where we are.","Elyse Greenspan \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay, thank you. And then in terms of the share repurchase we saw the level remained kind of elevated from where you trended last year and the first two quarters of this year, and then in the second quarter I know you guys did issue some incremental debt on, so I was wondering how that played into your decision surrounding share repurchases, and where you would kind of look for that number on a quarterly basis from here?","Christa Davies","So as always the least, we evaluate all forms of capital usage based on return on capital, share repurchase was high in the first half, but it will be in the second half, due to incremental leverage in Q2 as you said we did, you know, raise that quite substantially. And we also utilized cash from the balance sheet at year end 2013. And so those two things really meant that our share purchase in the first half will be much higher than the second half. We are leveraging the opportunity as we grow free cash flow to continue to deploy capital in the highest return opportunities for shareholders, and share repurchase remains the highest ROIC usage. As cash flow continues to grow, you\u2019ll expect us to redeploy capital on our return on capital basis.","Elyse Greenspan \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay, thank you. And one last question, in terms of a tax rate, I know you guys mentioned last quarter about 200 to 300 basis points benefit from discreet adjustments was the level the same this quarter. And then also, if we\u2019re looking at a quarterly basis, are there any quarters that we tend to potentially have a higher tax rate to exude as a revenue for instance, when the healthcare exchange business comes on in the fourth quarter, will we potentially see the tax rates just from that business coming on, kind of kick up in the fourth quarter?","Christa Davies","As we think about the tax rate Elyse, for the full year 2014, what I would say is our first half 2014 tax rate was 18.3%. As we discussed in Q1, we do expect potential unfavorable discreet tax adjustments in the second half of 2014, could cause the rate to be higher for the full year 2014. We\u2019re not giving specific items for full year 2014, what we can say is, full year 2013 rate had 200 to 300 basis points unfavorable impact from discreet items.","Elyse Greenspan \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And then our next question comes from Jay Cohen from Bank of America, your line is open.","Jay Cohen \u2013 Bank of America","Yes, thank you. You talked about some timing issues in the HR Solutions business, which hurt the revenue comparison should help in the second half, can you quantify that?","Christa Davies","So as we think about, it was really on the consulting side Jay, it was in our compensation consulting business. And it really decreased organic revenue growth in both Q1 and Q2. And so if you normalize that consulting organic revenue growth it would be somewhere around 3% to 4% in both Q1 and Q2, and what you\u2019ll see Jay is that will show up in the second half of the year. And so if we think about our consulting organic revenue growth for the full year, it\u2019s really in the low to mid-single digit organic revenue growth, it\u2019s exactly where we think it should be. And it\u2019s really is a patterning issue between Q1 and Q2 in the second half of the year.","Jay Cohen \u2013 Bank of America","That\u2019s helpful. And then secondly, you guys have done a good job of de-risking the pension obligations, but we have had a drop in interest rates. Have you done enough work so that drop in interest rates this year, shouldn\u2019t have a big impact on your pension expense going forward?","Christa Davies","As we think about pension expense Jay, we definitely think that pension expense for 2014 is immaterial and we expect that to continue. In terms of the work we\u2019ve done in our pension plans, they certainly are closed, they\u2019re frozen and they\u2019re de-risked. As you know, we measure our pension, liabilities at year end for 12-31-2014, and at that point we\u2019ll look at asset returns, discount rates and locality are the three biggest drivers. Pension expense rise is a lot less volatile as a result of the closed and frozen and all the work we\u2019ve done on our pension plans.","Jay Cohen \u2013 Bank of America","Right, thanks Christa.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Vinay Misquith form Evercore, your line is open.","Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore","Hi, good morning. The first is, could you give us some color on the slowdown in the organic revenue growth in the risk in insurance segment in the Americas?","Greg Case","Yeah sort of back up, is we didn\u2019t go to the overall instead of putting in the overall commentary. We saw organic growth in the Americas on the retail side we\u2019re actually at 2%, very, very strong in business generation in the U.S. retail, for example a record levels of new business generation. So really overall across the property and casualty, health benefits in Affinity, we saw growth U.S. retail, Latin America and Canada. So from our standpoint we have very strong prior year comp our view is, the year\u2019s progressing very, very fine from a retail risk standpoint and we expect the year to finish well also.","And again, if you step back and look at the sort of overall Risk Solutions our risk business more than offset some of the challenges on the reinsurance side, we talked about it. For us, it just reflects what Aon\u2019s all about; we\u2019re an incredibly diverse business, geographically, product, client segment, etcetera. And that showed up in the first half of the year on the Risk Solution side as well as showed up in the Americas too.","Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore","What do you think should be the normalized organic growth in the Americas?","Greg Case","Yeah, we\u2019ve essentially talked about low to mid single-digits overall and that\u2019s roughly how we see things will be playing out.","Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore","And was last year\u2019s second half very strong, and so should we see a slight slowdown versus last year\u2019s second half?","Greg Case","Yeah I would \u2013 plus or minus. If you look at this over the course of a year, so from us again I would say for the year, low to mid single-digits and that\u2019s roughly what we\u2019ve been able to achieve. I would also say as we\u2019ve invested in the business or able to actually improve margin at lower levels of growth, we\u2019ve got more leverage, operating leverage in the business. So that\u2019s why we\u2019re comfortable as we look at Risk Solutions overall, to say we\u2019re going to grow organically and we\u2019re going to improve margins in the face headwinds we talked about before. It\u2019s an evolving business and our belief a stronger business than it was a year ago and a year before that.","Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore","Okay great. The follow-up is on margins in that segment, so those improved I believe 60 basis points for the first six months if you exclude the restructuring savings and if you exclude the FX headwinds. Do you think that pace of margin expansion can increase over time if your organic growth picks up a little bit?","Christa Davies","Here\u2019s what I would say, we think about Risk Solutions margin for the first half of the year is 70 basis points, because we certainly include the restructuring savings because we\u2019ve worked very hard to achieve those. And included in the 70 basis points was negative 40 basis points of FX impacts for the first half of the year, so underlying operational margin expansion of 110 basis points for the first half of the year.","As we look at the second half of the year, we see that the FX impact on Risk Solutions margin will remain similar at minus 40 basis points. And we do believe that we\u2019ll drive Risk Solutions margin expansion with the full year driven by the investments we\u2019ve made in GRIP and the return they\u2019re getting. Aon Broking and continue to expense discipline. And we do believe we\u2019ll drive Risk Solutions margin expansion to full year 2014 and on track for our 26% long-term Risk Solutions target.","Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Meredith from UBS, your line is open.","Brian Meredith \u2013 UBS","Hi, a couple of questions. First Greg, I was hoping you could expand a little bit on what\u2019s going on with the corporate healthcare exchanges is and just what the pipeline is looking like, I know you kind of gave us couple of comments. And then specifically how it\u2019s going on with the corporate, with respect to the Medicare and how that\u2019s going as well?","Greg Case","Overall this is, we feel very good about the pipeline. As I emphasized before, for us it\u2019s very much about focusing on clients, employee satisfaction as we go into Q4 enrolment. So that\u2019s been absolute focus of our team, we\u2019re very excited about some of the progress there, that\u2019ll be our priority, but against that backdrop, pipeline\u2019s been exceptional. And by the way, a very solid mix of new and existing clients, we\u2019re very pleased with the industry breadth, it\u2019s a much, much broader mix and continues to broaden. We\u2019re also pleased with the fact that over half the clients we\u2019re seeing are new in our cost of profits.","So for us, we feel really good about the pipeline, as I said before, we\u2019re looking forward to updating you all later in the year, once we complete the enrolment, the sales cycle I should say. But net-net we feel very, very good about the overall progress. And then on the retiree side, also equally positive, we\u2019ve got to value proposition that is literally really focused on the retiree and exactly what they\u2019re experience is like. And we invest heavily to sort of make that happen, as a result of that valued proposition; we\u2019ve been very privileged to be able to serve some of the largest, including the largest client in this space.","And so for us, that value proposition we\u2019re truly focusing on the retiree experience, and has proved out very, very well. So we would say, another quarter of continued progress on the exchange front, recognizing by the way as we said before Brian, the exchange world fits into a much broader world today on Hewitt when you think about what we do on the benefit side, 7.5 million active employers in our Ben Admin business and another 2 million retirees sort of in the Ben-Admin business. So it\u2019s a business we know well, now augmented and reinforced by what we\u2019re doing on the exchange front, so that\u2019s the background.","Brian Meredith \u2013 UBS","And on that topic, are you still seeing a pricing pressure in the Benefit Administration business?","Christa Davies","We are Brian, and it\u2019s very much what we expected, it\u2019s slightly less than what we experienced last year. So it\u2019s mitigated slightly, but we expect that trend to continue.","Brian Meredith \u2013 UBS","Great, and last question, I\u2019m just curious. On the reinsurance business, as there\u2019s more and more of the capital markets activity that kind of picks up here, is that going to have a long-term depressing effect on your margins in net business?","Greg Case","As we step back \u2013 it\u2019s in a day for us, it really is about bringing capitals to bear on client needs. And as we said before we don\u2019t think about the sort of product or product basis, which is why in the end we invest behind this business and are very strong believers in the opportunity for our clients in this business. It\u2019s why we\u2019re number one in treaty, number one in facultative, number one \u2013 in the cap on insurance link security world. We think all the whole compliment as you bring it to bear on behalf of clients it creates potential great client value.","Our view is recurring client value you know, our compensation will take care of itself overtime. Even though you\u2019ve got sort of inter digital moves on specific product areas up and down, some recurring, some not recurring all the pieces that go into that. Our view is the opportunity here is substantial. Even equally exciting is the fact that we see opportunities to really move beyond, it\u2019s just the core demand. So the things we\u2019re doing bringing capital to bear in areas, as I described before, in the mortgage arena in the U.S. we\u2019re really excited about.","We\u2019re excited for our clients, so for us, we\u2019re very optimistic about the business long-term and feel like the opportunity to serve clients and create value for them is quite high. And our capability against that demand is also quite strong, based on all my colleagues leadership, so we\u2019re optimistic and we don\u2019t think about it product by product.","Brian Meredith \u2013 UBS","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Barnes from Jamie your line is open.","Ryan Barnes \u2013 Jamie","Great. Thanks for taking my call. I just had a couple of questions. You guys recently closed on a flood acquisition, just wondering if you guys could give any parameters there or maybe the size of the transaction. And maybe also the margins, because I know one of your competitors recently purchased the flood company and very strong margins in that business.","Christa Davies","So personally just a technical thing we have signed, but we have not completed closing yet. And we haven\u2019t disclosed the price, but I think we\u2019re very proud of the content and capabilities that we\u2019ve acquired to deliver value to clients and Greg you may want to talk more about the actual acquisition.","Greg Case","Yeah I think again just another example of sort of building capability in content in area we know well and we like our great deal. So this is really is a group that\u2019s going to strengthen our ability by outsourcing services really flood placement and claims to insurance carriers. It\u2019s part of a broad range set of programs. So we\u2019re very excited about it and feel like it\u2019s going to add content and capability in terms of sort of what we\u2019re doing.","It is in \u2013 back to the context we\u2019ve completed seven acquisitions in 2014, again all of these have the same theme. How do we strengthen content capability or broaden our geographic footprint to the extent that strengthens content capability. And NFS, National Flood Services were just one example around that.","Ryan Barnes \u2013 Jamie","Okay and then lastly you guys mentioned that there was a higher cash tax payment was the headwind for free cash flow, just wanted to figure out what caused that. And should that be, should we expect that to go away going forward?","Christa Davies","Yeah I would describe that as just lumpiness quarter-to-quarter. And it really is a timing item related to prior years. And so I would not expect that to continue.","Ryan Barnes \u2013 Jamie","Okay, great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Meyer Shields from KBW. Your line is open.","Meyer Shields \u2013 KBW","Greg you talked about a number of areas I\u2019m thinking like US retail that is doing very well in terms of generating growth. Are the areas that are underperforming are they \u2013 have they been consistent over the past year or so, or is there some sort of shift?","Greg Case","Yeah we\u2019d say from our standpoint yet again one of the things that, that we\u2019re very proud of and we\u2019re excited about is really the global capability of Aon. And you may think about \u2013 we\u2019re in many respects we\u2019re a global focus group we\u2019re in every country in the world, 122 countries. We serve a range of all the segments, large, medium size or smaller all types of sectors, all types of client\u2019s etcetera.","And that really does Meyer, in our respect sort of clear the level of stability that we think from an investor standpoint should be a very much a positive for you. So things have been flown, some areas, strong in some respects, loss in other respects you think about it 2.5 and three years ago we were talking about the strength of Europe and weakness of the U.S. and now that\u2019s kind of shifted when you look at underlined insured values.","Little strong in the U.S. dollar, little weaker in Europe, it really does create for us a truly stable, relative stable set of opportunities. Its why, as we reflect on the year and the progress for the first six months we feel very good about the progress, it\u2019s very consistent we thought it would be. We push through the first six months grown, improved margins \u2013 context of an up and down market you could pick any specific area around the world, but we\u2019d essentially as Christa described, we increased margin by 70 basis points including 40 points of FX so that\u2019s over 100 basis points improvement. So for us certain things do have a flow, if anything stays down for a long time you can expect \u2013 but overall feel really good about Risk Solutions and some of the progress we\u2019re going to be able to make.","Meyer Shields \u2013 KBW","Okay, thanks. And Christa when you look at the intangible asset amortization schedule, so there were increases in the forecast for Risk Solutions in 2015 and beyond really is that related to the flood acquisition or is that a change in sort of anticipated future acquisitions.","Christa Davies","Yes. No it\u2019s not related to flood acquisitions; we\u2019ve not yet closed that. It is related to other acquisitions that we\u2019ve made in the first half of the year as Greg described.","Meyer Shields \u2013 KBW","Okay but there are no, when you put up this number. This doesn\u2019t anticipate acquisitions that haven\u2019t been closed yet?","Christa Davies","No it does not.","Meyer Shields \u2013 KBW","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Klauber from William Blair, Your line is open.","Adam Klauber \u2013 William Blair","Thanks. Good morning everyone. The growth in consulting expenses in the first six months how much of that growth would you attribute to the healthcare exchange investment. And can you give us more of a detail idea what that investment is actually going to?","Greg Case","Overall a large portion of the expense investment really is bringing online a number of our clients on the healthcare exchange sides as we said before. And it really is going to match the sort of \u2013 it really is across overall Aon Hewitt as we think about sort of what we\u2019re doing. It was what I\u2019m describing, so that\u2019s the biggest part of the investment across Aon Hewitt in the second quarter getting prepared for year end.","Adam Klauber \u2013 William Blair","Okay. Another question in HR Solutions, I know in the past you\u2019ve talked about \u2013 you\u2019ve had some success helping, helping corporations de-risk retentions. How does the pipeline look to do more of this type of transactions?","Greg Case","Yes we said before \u2013 and Chris can talk about this as a client as well, in terms of what we\u2019ve been able to do, but it\u2019s more than a little success. We\u2019ve actually had substantial success. One of the exciting parts about what we\u2019re doing on the consulting from a growth stand point really is our retirement business really across the board. And that\u2019s in delegated investment solutions, investment consulting overall, but also a sort of pension de-risk involved that\u2019s really has been quite exceptional.","And so we\u2019ve got a broad range of clients, as we said before, all of whom have the issue around making sure they need their obligations for employees, but do it in a way that, that helps them address obviously the capital challenge, the expense challenges and the substantial volatility challenges which come with that which is \u2013 and our team\u2019s just done an exceptional job there and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve dealt so well in this space.","Adam Klauber \u2013 William Blair","How is the pipeline of business going forward there is, how\u2019s that looking?","Greg Case","Well it turns out if you travel the world it\u2019s really strong. If you travel the world, there\u2019s still a whole range of underfunded pension funds that have to be addressed by companies. And there the priority for them is as high as ever around trying to get that done. And we see tremendous opportunity in that going forward.","Christa Davies","And one of the other things we\u2019d say is that the pace of regulatory changes is accelerating and that\u2019s creating opportunities to work with our clients on the impacts of their pension plans. The U.S., the UK and Canada have all had recent regulatory changes proposed or implemented. And we\u2019re addressing areas such as the pension risk as Greg described, lump sum windows, liability driven asset allocations and planned designs. And I can certainly say as a client its one of the best parts of the Aon Hewitt acquisition, is having the team of \u2013 from AON Hewitt actually help us navigate through our pension challenges and they\u2019ve done an exceptional job.","Adam Klauber \u2013 William Blair","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Newsome from Sandler O\u2019Neill. Your line is open.","Paul Newsome \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill","Good morning. And thanks for the call. I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about your financial leverage as we look out over the next couple of years and maybe the relationship between coverage ratios. And it looks like \u2013 you tell meif I\u2019m wrong, that you would probably be raising more debt as the pension liability goes down as well. Is that fair assessment?","Christa Davies","Yeah, so Paul, we would say that we certainly as we grow EBITDA and grow free cash flow, we do expect to sort of grow leverage overtime. And obviously as the pension on some of the liability comes down, that creates further opportunity. We\u2019re very proud of the fact that we\u2019re able to take advantage of the market and increase leverage during the quarter. And in particular do 550 million of that 800 million U.S. debt placement at 30 year, which is managing liquidity in a very good way for shareholders.","And so we will continue to manage our current investment grade rating, it\u2019s very important to us for our clients and for the future financial flexibility around leverage and coverage ratios, to ensure that we continue to manage those. As you said, as free cash flow and EBITDA grows and then as the lumps on pension liability comes down we expect to increase leverage over the coming years.","Paul Newsome \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill","And then just to be careful on the reinsurance fund separately, last quarter, I think you said that you expected organic growth for reinsurance for the year to be sort of flat to positive, is that outlook changed?","Christa Davies","Yeah, I think from our standpoint as we reflect sort of think about through the, where pricing was market pressure was, sort of in the mid-term renewals, we would see slightly more negative than that at this point in time just given where things have played out, but we still step back and say, to be really clear, in the Risk Solutions overall that has it, essentially we are going to grow that as organically across the board and improve margin.","And so this is really back to a question from before, sort of our overall portfolio, at some point of time we\u2019ll be talking about the robustness of the reinsurance and pressures elsewhere at this point, little more pressure than we expected, but not unmanageable and we expect, as I said, have growth in Risk Solutions throughout the year with improve margins.","Paul Newsome \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Nannizzi from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Michael Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thanks. Greg, maybe \u2013 kind of trying to square you mentioned North America new business is very strong and you talked about retention there, it looked like organic, though organic was 2%, that was little bit less than kind of we are looking for, so I am just trying to square lower organic growth with your really strong new business and that return to mid years maybe there\u2019s a plug missing there? Thanks.","Greg Case","There isn\u2019t too much \u2013 again there\u2019s not that much of a difference in terms of the overall sort of decline as you\u2019re describing a point, but we look at a couple of things as we lay them out, Michael, one is we are the underlined sort of what\u2019s the good quality, what\u2019s going on in the business, and that\u2019s what we\u2019d say before, new business was as, all time high. It was up substantial, it was up substantially. Renewals were also strong.","When you look at something called rollover which is literally not just retaining the client, retaining the business but also how much is bought or what it looks like, and if you think about that, that\u2019s \u2013 with the rollover\u2019s decline slightly. If you look at pricing, overall, we basically look at exposure times rate, that gets you to something we call market impact. And market impact, it was down a bit, not hugely, but if you think about last four quarters just to be precise and we can\u2019t with GRIPs.","So this is exactly what\u2019s reflected in our system, it\u2019s actually or cross our entire system, I\u2019ll just go in that direction. We were 0.83 in Q3 2013. In Q4 2013 0.92, in Q1, 2014 0.24 and we are down a little bit in Q2 2014 so, roughly at the same place. So, in essence we\u2019re seeing a bit more of marketing that is not substantial, it\u2019s not like we are seeing on the reinsurance side but it\u2019s there and sort of affects overall performance.","Michael Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Got it. And I guess, you mentioned GRIP, a bit there as well and I am just curious over this period of time where we\u2019ve seen some softness particularly on the reinsurance side, how much has your insurer take up a GRIP increased. I would imagine that potentially as insurance companies are maybe more aggressive about trying to get business that platforms like GRIP could see, bigger takeaway, have you seen any of that corresponding or is it been sort of a continuation of an adoption trend that you saw, two years ago or something like that?","Greg Case","It\u2019s been a continued trend. We haven\u2019t tried to push it, what we do is with GRIP, it\u2019s very clear, we\u2019ve got more than 30 markets where we are fully engaged on the GRIP platform now. This is very much around matching their capital with client need. Obviously we guarantee nothing but we do as we put them in a position where they can actually add value to our clients than a more pr\u00e9cised and sustaining way and that actually creates significant opportunity for them. That\u2019s the value of proposition behind GRIP.","That\u2019s worked very, very well continues to work very well, and our carriers get, we believe tremendous value out of it because our clients get tremendous value out of it. So from our standpoint we continue to grow the business, we continue to add on the wise component around it to truly help carriers add value not just in areas around coverage, new laws what they provide at the marketplace.","So from our standpoint, we are very pleased with the progress of GRIP, it continues, and we think it\u2019s a way to use data and analytics to help clients, make choices would be different and our markets bring things to \u2013 on behalf of clients that are different. And so, for us it\u2019s been positive, we think that will continue.","Michael Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs","And how relevant of a tool is that to potentially offset the negative impact of pricing in certain markets as far as your margins are concerned?","Greg Case","Well, from our standpoint as Christa said, the margin improvement for Aon is really a function of, we\u2019ve created greater operating leverage for our business and we\u2019ve done it through Aon Broking and all the things we do as far as we think about our pricing premium on behalf of clients. We\u2019ve done it through GRIP, we\u2019ve done it through expense reduction. And so from our standpoint all things sort of contribute to this. These are fundamental investments to change the way we go about the business and in turn help our clients and in turn Aon improved margins at lower overall growth.","And so in the end for us, that\u2019s why we believe this is really an opportunity to see our investments pay off, and it\u2019s why as I said before, Risk Solutions, we believe will organically, we will improve margins in the face of whatever, where the headwinds are out there. Specifically now to your question, the biggest driver, one of the biggest drivers of margin improvement\u2019s going to be, is going to be component like GRIP.","Michael Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Great. Thanks. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh [indiscernible] from Deloitte. Excuse me.","Unidentified Analyst","[indiscernible] from Deloitte now. Hello, everyone, how are you?","Greg Case","Hey, Josh, we will get that name right.","Unidentified Analyst","No worries, no worries. Maybe, \u2013 look I understand that Christa is not going to give any guidance around the discreet tax movements but maybe you could educate me a little bit on cash taxes versus GAAP taxes. And are the numbers coming through on tax and related to cash paid and there is some a steadier number if we looked on a GAAP basis or incurred basis, I am no tax expert but maybe you can teach me a little bit?","Christa Davies","Yeah, so here\u2019s what I would say Josh, as you think about the cash taxes we are paying you really need to look at it over multi-year period of time, because a lot of what we are paying out in cash taxes today, a resolutions of prior years. And so, there always is going to be a lag between what gets reported in GAAP taxes and what\u2019s gets reported in cash taxes. So I hope that helps.","Unidentified Analyst","Net-net, can you tell me if the deferred tax liability on the balance sheet is rising as you have these low tax quarters?","Christa Davies","I actually \u2013 I am not sure I can answer that question?","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Well that was my only question. I appreciate it, thank you.","Christa Davies","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Kai Pan \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Good morning. Thank you for taking my call. Just pulling off the tax, you said the \u2013 in 2013 the effective tax rates 200 to 300 basis points higher if you exclude the unfavorable discrete items, so to that point the underlying tax rate about 22% and in the first half with all these discrete items your tax rate is 18%, I just wonder if you look back and see the downside to the UK, your tax rate at that time is it like 28%, you said you could improve more than 500 basis points, by now, are you already exceeding that target, just wonder going forward, will that 18% tax discrete item be a run rate or it could have been to improve further?","Christa Davies","Yeah, so what we said at the time we moved to the UK in 2012 was originally more than 500 basis points, so, if you took a $0.29 is attractive 500 basis points you get $0.24, then you do more than 23, more than 22, which as you pointed out is roughly the underlying rate for 2013. And really what we said for 2014 is that 18.3% which is the first half tax raise, it\u2019s more than likely that we\u2019ll expect unfavorable discrete tax adjustments in the second half that could cause the rate to be half of full","year 2014.","And while we are not giving guidance for \u201814 the full year 2013 rate did have 200 to 300 basis points of unfavorable impacts from discrete items. In terms of future year guidance which unfortunately, at the time we are not giving out future year guidance.","Kai Pan \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thanks for that. And then on the acquisition it looks like it\u2019s picking up a little bit, so I think that 2010 can, I just wonder have that changed your capital margin priority between buybacks and acquisitions?","Christa Davies","Absolutely not, as we said earlier, we evaluate all forms of capital usage based on return on capital, share repurchase remains the highest return on capital usage for the company which is why you saw us do $650 million in Q2 and $1.25 billion of share repurchases in the first half of the year. It\u2019s some of the highest about the share repurchase we\u2019ve done in the company\u2019s history.","As Greg said, we\u2019ve actually returned $1.4 billion on capital through share repurchase and dividends in the first half of the year. And really what you see us doing is for us to actually allocate capital M&A, it has to have a higher ROI seasoned share repurchase.","And we have done some fantastic concurrent capabilities to deliver to clients, NFS \u2013 employee benefits certain terrific concurrent capabilities out there, that have substantial return on capital associated with them, but under no circumstances has our capital allocation process changed.","Greg Case","In this respect Kai what you really see is within the context of the exactly the priorities as Christa described our ability to actually return capital and actually strength of our business it\u2019s pretty strong. And highlight the sudden acquisitions really across the board in the UK, New Zealand really in the U.S. surely really across the board.","So our ability to strengthen the business and return substantial capital to share holders given our view on where we are on valuation and opportunity, we think is actually quite high.","Kai Pan \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thank you last question. I just wondered if you could offer your opinion on the recent loadings on the ACA subsidiaries and what potential impact on the prior year\u2019s tend to site?","Greg Case","Yeah from our standpoint as we said before, our focus really is on serving clients day in, day out and doing it sort of on the private side. We think the demand for that is actually quite high and will continue to be. And by the way demand is function of clients just want to do the right thing on behalf of their employees and doing in a way, that they, they create greater transparency, greater choice. And really changes in behavior that actually hopefully improved health of their employees and in doing so actually strengthen the capability of companies to sort of fund that in a regional and productive way.","So that\u2019s our focus that\u2019s the area that Aon Hewitt spends all their waking hours thinking about as they think about exchanges as we said before. Lot of other things we do across business and I am not going to comment sort of on the public sector input on that because in our view the private sector demand is going to be quite high and that\u2019s our focus.","Kai Pan \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thank you so much.","Christa Davies","Thank you Kai.","Operator","Thank you. And at this time I\u2019m showing no further questions. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you our next question comes from [indiscernible] from Columbia Management. Your line is open","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you very much for fitting me in I appreciate that so just a follow up on Kai\u2019s question. So the normal and I know we can\u2019t really be precise about this but the normalized tax rate was something like 22% or 22.5% last year I think if I have right that the first half discreet items in the tax rate. It sound like the normalized first half tax rate is something in the order of 21%. My first question is that right and then secondly we are still seeing tax rate decreases when you measure your tax plans and guided to 500 basis points or more. I guess there were certain activities you had in mind, certain strategies you had in mind. Have you essentially completed those activities or are there more things you can do?","Operator","One moment please. Sir please standby. I think we lost connection with speaker. Please standby. Thank you for standing by we are instructed by the speakers that today\u2019s call has ended. If you have any further questions do please contact them.","Again, I do apologize today\u2019s conference call has ended for today. You may disconnect at this time."],"1821":["Aon (NYSE:AON) Q1 2012 Earnings Call May  4, 2012  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Gregory C.

Welcome to Aon plc's First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]","I would also like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded and that it's important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our first quarter results, as well as having been posted on our website. ","Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, President and CEO of Aon plc. Sir, you may begin.","Gregory C. Case","Thanks very much, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter conference call. Joining me here today is our CFO, Christa Davies. Consistent with previous quarters, I'd like to cover 3 areas before turning the call over to Christa for further financial review and would note that there are slides available on our website for you to follow along with our commentary today. ","First is our performance against key metrics we communicate to shareholders. Second is overall organic growth performance. And third is continued areas of investment across Aon. On the first topic, our performance versus key metrics. Each quarter, we measure our performance against the 3 metrics we focus on achieving over the course of the year: grow organically, expand margins and increase earnings per share. ","Turning to Slide 3, in the first quarter, organic revenue was 4% overall, reflecting the strongest rate of organic revenue growth since the second quarter of 2007 and the strength of our industry-leading platform. Operating margin decreased 80 basis points, driven primarily by significant investments we're making across our businesses to increase long-term growth. Finally, EPS was $0.98, including $0.06 of unfavorable impact from foreign currency. ","Overall, our first quarter performance reflects improved organic revenue growth across our businesses as foreign currency movement and significant investments to drive greater long-term growth had an unfavorable impact on bottom line results. While we're not satisfied with margin improvement and working capital management in the near term, we fully anticipate improved performance in the second half of the year, are on track with our long-term targets and have completed significant steps to position the firm for long-term growth, strong free cash flow generation and increased financial flexibility, as highlighted by the completed redomestication to London in early April. ","Turning to Slide 4, on the second topic of growth, I want to spend the next few minutes discussing the quarter for both our segments. In Risk Solutions, overall organic revenue growth was 4% with growth across every major business. As market-related conditions continue to stabilize, we're driving a set of initiatives that are strengthening underlying performance and positioning our Risk Solutions segment for long-term growth and leverage to an improving economy. With management of our renewal book through Client Promise and retention rates of 90% or better on average, highlighting strong client satisfaction. ","New business generation of over $220 million across our Retail Business, with strong growth across many markets including China, Latin America, Italy and New Zealand, just to name a few, highlighting the strength of our global client-serving capability. Investments in new product and service capabilities with the rollout of GRIP and Aon Broking globally and in our core treaty reinsurance business, net new business trends have now been positive for 4 consecutive quarters. ","Reflecting on the individual businesses. In the Americas, organic revenue growth improved to 4% as the impact from pricing and exposures are relatively flat, reflecting a continued modest pace of improvement from a year ago. We saw strong management of the renewal book portfolio across all regions, strengthened by the continued rollout of Client Promise. We saw solid new business growth in Latin America. Results reflect strong performance, overcoming continued market weakness in the commercial construction sector. ","In international. Organic revenue growth improved to 4% against pricing, which was flat to modestly down on average overall, including firmer pricing in catastrophe-exposed regions. We saw strong growth in New Zealand, across many regions in Asia and in emerging markets, including double-digit growth in many areas such as China, Taiwan and Italy. In the U.K. and Continental Europe, market conditions remained soft and macroeconomic conditions remained fragile across many core markets. With leadership positions across the U.K. and Europe, we saw strong retention rates and the management of the renewal book portfolio led to modest growth across almost every region, a solid performance given industry and economic headwinds. ","In reinsurance, organic revenue growth improved to 5%, a level of organic revenue performance not achieved since Q3 2006. Results primarily reflect strong new business growth in global treaty placements. The impact of the market from pricing internationally was modestly favorable, partially offset by higher cedent retentions as clients retain more risk. The underlying strength of the book continues to improve as net new business won was positive for the fourth consecutive quarter. This level of performance and the strength of new business generation continues to reflect the Aon Benfield's value proposition for clients of strengthening operational performance and reducing volatility through unmatched data, analytics and advisory capability. ","Turning to HR Solutions. Overall organic revenue growth improved to 3% compared to minus 1% in the prior year quarter. We saw a growth across both businesses despite weak discretionary spend globally and continued economic pressure in Continental Europe. Performance primarily reflects strong growth in areas where we're making significant investments in the business. In areas such as HR BPO, investment consulting, pension risk management consulting and health care exchanges. These investments reflect Aon Hewitt's deep understanding of market trends and the long-term issues that face our clients, such as health care costs and associated financial risks that will continue to rise unchecked at a time when overall health and wellness is not improving. ","The clients are increasingly looking for a global benefit solution that support global organizations at a local level, managing and transferring risk against pension schemes that are increasingly frozen and largely underfunded. And last, after working through the worst economic recession in the last 70 years, clients are beginning to renew their focus on talent, retention, development and engagement, to prepare themselves for renewed long-term growth. ","Turning to the individual HR Solutions businesses. In Outsourcing, organic revenue growth improved to 3% compared to minus 3% in the prior quarter. We saw a growth from both new client wins in HR BPO, Absence Management and from the investments in our health care exchange business. Results were partially offset by a modest decline in Benefits Administration as client wins were offset by anticipated price compression and client losses within expectations. ","In Consulting Services, organic revenue growth is 1% compared to 2% in the prior-year quarter. We saw strong growth across our businesses in Asia. Increased demand for surveys and services in our Compensation Consulting Group and strong demand for delegated pension risk management and investment consulting services. Results were partially offset by a decline in discretionary demand for actuarial services in our core Retirement Consulting business. ","Overall, in HR Solutions, we're pleased with our organic revenue performance in the first quarter and are on track with previous expectations for delivering improved growth in both businesses in 2012. And while encouraged that we're beginning to deliver results from the investments we are making in new growth opportunities, our priorities for 2012 remained focused on delivering improved profitability from these investments and improving the growth profile in our core business administration and Retirement Consulting businesses. ","Slide 5 highlights the third topic, further areas of investment. We believe Aon is in a unique position. Solid long-term operating performance combined with expense discipline and strong cash flow continues to enable substantial investment in colleagues and capability around the globe. A few examples include, in Risk Solutions, we're investing in client leadership to drive greater productivity and efficiency with the rollout of the revenue engine internationally, as well as the rollout of Client Promise, which is driving greater retention and rollover rates across our client base. ","We continue to invest in innovative technology such as GRIP, which is the world's leading global repository of risk and insurance placement information. We now have 1.4 million trades, more than $75 billion of down premium and a growing client list of 25 insurance carriers utilizing the platform's analytics and services capabilities. ","We're driving our Aon Broking initiative to better match client needs with insurer appetite for risk as highlighted by our ability to package similar risks and place substantial programs and the facilities into the market on behalf of clients. Effective January 1, we aligned our global Health and Benefits platform to broaden our global distribution channel and strengthen these deep brokerage capabilities. ","And finally, we're expanding our footprint through tuck-in acquisitions that either increase scale in emerging markets or expand capability to better serve clients, as well as adding key talent across Asia and Latin America in specialty sectors and in our GRIP Services business. ","In summary, as we have noted previously, we have proved the concept of these major investments in 2011. As we move across 2012 and 2013, we will drive greater scale and increase operating leverage. ","In HR Solutions, we're making significant investments to strengthen our leading position in health care exchanges, enabling clients to begin the shift of their participants to a market-based defined contribution model for health care. Later this year, we plan to launch our first multi-carrier health exchange for active employees. ","We're expanding our outsourcing offerings in high-growth areas, such as dependent eligibility audits and absence management. We continue to expand our industry-leading Benefits Administration platform from large market to middle market. We're developing new delegated solutions in investment consulting and pension risk management that leverage our total capabilities across advisory and delivery services. And finally, we're increasing our international footprint to support a global workforce, with investments in key talent and capabilities across Asia and emerging markets. ","In summary, we delivered improved organic growth across both Risk and HR Solutions, made significant investments that will drive greater long-term growth and took important steps to strengthen our global firm. With that said, I'm pleased now to turn the call over to Christa for further financial review. Christa?","Christa Davies","Thanks very much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg noted, our first quarter results reflect improved organic revenue growth across both segments, resulting in the highest level of organic growth in the last 15 quarters. While we are not satisfied with margin performance and working capital management, we continue to drive a set of initiatives to improve operating performance, deliver savings from our formal restructuring programs, generate strong cash flow and effectively allocate capital as highlighted by the repurchase of $100 million of common stock in the first quarter. ","Now let me turn to the financial results as highlighted on Page 6 of the presentation. Our core EPS performance, excluding certain items, was $0.98 per share for the first quarter compared to $0.99 in the prior year quarter. Strong organic growth and effective capital management in the quarter was offset by unfavorable foreign currency movement and investments to deliver increased long-term growth. Certain items that were adjusted for in the core EPS performance and highlighted in the schedules on Page 12 of the press release, include noncash intangible asset amortization, restructuring charges related to the formal restructuring programs and $3 million of headquarter relocation costs. ","In addition, there were 2 unfavorable foreign currency impacts not adjusted for, but it's helpful in understanding the core results. First, the company recognized an $18 million pretax or $0.04 per share loss due to the unfavorable impact of exchange rates on remeasurement of assets and liabilities in nonfunctional reporting currencies. Secondly, foreign currency translation had an unfavorable impact of $0.02 per share. If currency were to remain stable at today's rates, we would expect a modest unfavorable translation impact to EPS in the second quarter of 2012. ","Now let me talk about each of the segments on the next slide. In our Risk Solutions segment, organic revenue growth was 4%. Operating income increased 2% and operating margin decreased 20 basis points to 21.4%. Excluding the $8 million impact of FX in the quarter, operating income increased 4% and operating margin was essentially unchanged from the prior year quarter. Solid organic revenue growth, restructuring savings and lower lease termination costs contributed to operating income growth, but operating margin improvement was offset by significant investments in key talent across Asia and in our GRIP platform, as well as $11 million of costs or a 60 basis point unfavorable impact related to both the integration of Glenrand and to certain project-related work in Australia. We would expect these costs and investments to have a modest impact in Q2 and Q3. ","Let me spend a moment on the formal restructuring programs, key initiatives that have enabled concurrent funding of investments and long-term structural margin expansion. With respect to the Aon Benfield restructuring program, we incurred $8 million of charges in the first quarter. The company has closed and completed all restructuring activities and incurred 100% of the total charges necessary to deliver the remaining savings. Restructuring savings in the first quarter are estimated at $34 million compared to $29 million in the prior year quarter. The Aon Benfield restructuring program is expected to deliver cumulative expense savings of $146 million in 2012, compared to cumulative savings of $122 million in 2011. ","Further, associated with the transfer of the Health and Benefits business at January 1, 2012, an estimated $46 million of restructuring savings under the Aon Hewitt restructuring program will be achieved in Risk Solutions. Approximately $18 million of the $46 million in cumulative savings have been achieved under the program, including an estimated $18 million of savings in the first quarter. A breakout of restructuring charges incurred in Risk Solutions associated with the Aon Hewitt restructuring program is detailed in the schedule on Page 13 of the press release. ","As Greg noted in his commentary, we are not satisfied with flat margin performance in the first quarter. As we think about the remainder of the year, we would expect a similar performance in Q2 and Q3. Through return on our investments, remaining restructuring savings and lower integration costs, we would expect a strong Q4 resulting in Risk Solutions margin improvement for the full year 2012, and continued margin improvement towards our long-term target of 26%. ","Turning to the HR Solutions segment, organic revenue growth was 3%, operating income decreased 7% and operating margin decreased 180 basis points to 16.5% compared to the prior-year quarter. Included was a $1 million or 10 basis point unfavorable impact from FX. Organic revenue growth of 3% and $26 million of incremental restructuring and synergy savings were more than offset by $20 million or a minus 210 basis point impact from significant investments in long-term growth initiatives, an unfavorable revenue mix shift as core Benefits Administration and Retirement Consulting declined modestly and a $13 million impact from deferred costs in Outsourcing related to the timing of large client implementations. ","With respect to the Aon Hewitt restructuring program, we incurred $9 million of charges in the quarter. Cumulative savings related to the restructuring program in the first quarter are estimated at $40 million compared to $24 million in the prior-year quarter, with additional synergy savings of approximately $29 million achieved outside of the formal restructuring program compared to $19 million in the prior-year quarter. ","As we noted in the fourth quarter, we provided specific comments regarding the outlook for the HR business in 2012. Number one, we expect improved organic growth in both businesses for 2012. Number two, we would invest approximately $35 million in new growth opportunities, primarily our health care exchanges, HR BPO, investment Consulting and pension risk management. Number three, approximately 75% of the restructuring savings will be realized in adjusted operating income. ","Number four, expected performance will improve in the second half of the year as investment spend decreases in the second half from the first half. And lastly, for the full year, with the transfer of an additional $26 million of savings to the Risk segment related to Health and Benefits, and a more conservative view on discretionary spend for project-related revenue, we would now expect operating income to be down modestly year-over-year, with Q2 and Q3 down from the prior-year quarter and flat in Q4 before growing in 2013. ","While we are not satisfied with our results in the first quarter, we are focused on delivering against our objectives we laid out for the full year. And we'll continue to push against each of these objectives every quarter as we strengthen our industry-leading HR Solutions business for long-term operational excellence going forward. ","Turning to the next slide on our long-term operating margin targets. We continue to drive a set of initiatives to improve operating performance on an annual basis. While we've improved operating margins 500 basis points over the last 6 years, our long-term operating margin target of 26% for Risk Solutions reflects significant opportunity for further margin improvement in the following 5 ways: Number one, deliver $47 million of remaining restructuring savings and deliver other operational improvements. Number two, continued rollout of the revenue engine globally. ","Number three, Aon Broking and GRIP-related initiatives. These 3 are fully within our control. In addition, there are 2 additional macro drivers that provide significant leverage based on improvements in external market. Number four, increase in short-term interest rates. Number five, industry improvements driving high-insured values or insurance pricing. ","Similarly, for HR Solutions, while we've improved operating margins 1,200 basis points over the last 6 years, our long-term operating margin target of 22% reflects significant opportunity for further margin improvement in the following 3 ways: Number one, deliver $91 million of remaining restructuring savings after the transfer of savings to Health and Benefits. Number two, growth in core business and return on incremental investments. Number three, improvement in HR BPO. ","Now let me discuss a few of the line items outside of the operating segments on the next slide. Unallocated expenses increased $2 million to $34 million, excluding headquarter relocation costs. Interest income decreased $3 million due to lower average interest rates and lower average cash balances. Interest expense decreased $4 million to $59 million due primarily to a decline in the average rate on total debt outstanding. Other income included an $18 million loss due to an unfavorable impact of exchange rates on remeasurement of assets and liabilities in nonfunctional currencies, offset by a gain on certain company-owned life insurance plans and distributions from certain private equity securities. ","Going forward, we continue to expect a run rate of approximately $3 million to $5 million per quarter of interest income, $35 million of unallocated expense and $60 million of interest expense per quarter. ","Turning to taxes, the effective tax rate on net income from continuing operations declined to 28% in the first quarter compared to 29% due primarily to changes in the geographic distribution of income and certain deferred tax adjustments. We would anticipate an effective tax rate on net income from continuing operations of 28% for 2012. ","Lastly, average diluted shares outstanding decreased to 336.6 million in the first quarter compared to 345.4 million in the prior-year quarter due primarily to the company's share repurchase program. The company repurchased 2.1 million shares of common stock for approximately $100 million in the first quarter. Actual common shares outstanding on March 31 were 326.4 million and there are approximately 11 million diluted stock equivalents. ","Subsequent to the close of the first quarter, in connection with the completed change in corporate domicile, the Aon plc Board of Directors announced the authorization of a $5 billion share repurchase program, which replaced and canceled the previously authorized program by the board of Aon Corporation. ","Now let me turn to the next slide to highlight our strong balance sheet and cash flow. At March 31, cash and short-term investments were $833 million and total debt outstanding was $4.5 billion. Overall debt-to-capital was 34.8% at March 31, compared to 35.7% at December 31. Cash flow from operations for the first quarter was a use of $15 million, compared to a source of $155 million in the prior-year quarter. While the first quarter is historically our seasonally weakest quarter from a cash flow perspective, due primarily to incentive compensation, there are several key impacts I'd like to highlight. First, included is a use of $118 million as Hewitt colleagues were transitioned from a September fiscal year end to Aon's calendar year-end incentive compensation cycle. Effectively creating a 15-month payout for 2011 in 2012. ","Second, cash pension contributions, net of expense, increased $31 million compared to the prior year. And lastly, we continue to operate with elevated levels of invoicing and cash collections, approximately $400 million, related to a temporary delay in invoicing in Aon Hewitt, which began in the second half of 2011 with the conversion of certain audited cash systems. We are making progress and expect this temporary increase to return to normalized levels by the end of 2012. ","Free cash flow as defined by cash flow from operations less CapEx, was negative $86 million, down from $99 million in the prior year due primarily to lower cash from operations and a $15 million increase in CapEx year-over-year. ","Turning to the next slide to discuss our long-term financial flexibility. Regarding our underfunded pension plans, we've taken significant steps to reduce volatility and liability as we've closed plans to new entrants, frozen plans from accruing additional benefits and derisked certain client assets. ","In 2011, we contributed approximately $477 million to our plans and would expect to contribute approximately $541 million in 2012 before any discretionary contributions. Higher contributions primarily reflect the decline in discount rates. We would expect contributions to decline annually beginning in 2013, resulting in fully funded plans on a GAAP basis in 2016. ","Regarding our restructuring plans, cash payments were $178 million in 2011. Our restructuring plans continue to wind down. We would expect cash payments to decline $31 million to approximately $147 million in 2012 before declining further in 2013. ","As we continue to grow, improving operating performance and our required uses of cash decline over the next several years, we expect our strong free cash flow growth to be a significant source of value creation for shareholders. As an important step in unlocking that value for shareholders, on April 2, the company completed its change in jurisdiction of incorporation from Delaware to the U.K. We believe the transaction will help drive shareholder value through, number one, providing greater global access to expected increases in future free cash flow; number two, enable us to access approximately $300 million of excess capital held internationally on our balance sheet; and number three, increase future cash flows through a significant reduction in our global tax rate over the long term. ","In summary, we are positioned for stronger growth in 2012. We have significant leverage through an improving global economy. While we are investing to further strengthen our industry-leading portfolio, we have significant opportunities to continued long-term margin improvement. Our balance sheet and strong cash flow will continue to provide significant financial flexibility. And lastly, we've positioned the firm to effectively manage capital through the announced $5 billion share repurchase program and the recent increase in our annual dividend, highlighting our firm belief in the underlying value of Aon. ","With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator and we'd be delighted to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from Dan Farrell, Sterne Agee.","Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Can you talk a little bit more about the margin? I think, obviously, coming in a bit lower than I would've thought. And there's quite a bit of reinvestment going on in the business. And while it's a constant practice to reinvest, it seems that it's running at a higher turn. I guess, talk about how much longer you think that goes on. And then maybe expand a bit more on the revenue opportunities and put maybe some numbers around where you think that starts to ramp and give you benefits.","Gregory C. Case","Well, I appreciate the question. I think the area of investment is obviously an important one for the quarter and really for the next few quarters. As Christa described, it's important you really do understand what we're ramping up in 2012. And if you step back and think about what we are accomplishing with our investments, what we've done with the Aon Broking investment around GRIP and the overall GRIP platform, we believe is actually quite unique. I do want to emphasize, as Christa described, our view is, the Risk Solutions margin will be positive in 2012. So in the end, when we think about these investments in the trade-offs, as we look at margin overall, we look at it on a year-to-year basis. And this is going to get reflected in this year. But step back and think about what we try to accomplish, we want to grow organically, increase margins, increase earnings per share. And we're not just focused on individual quarters. We're going to focus on the year overall, and we are going to take steps to improve the foundation of Aon to the extent we think it can improve operating leverage. These are the kinds of investments we have been making. There have been a number that have been on the traditional side that largely the entire industry has been doing around adding talent. We continue to do that, too. That's affected the quarter. Those will pay off over time. But what's different about this quarter is a specific decision we made for 2012 to ramp up Aon Broking and to ramp up what we're doing with overall GRIP. And this is a very important question. When you think about what we've done, we talked about GRIP, really, for the last couple of years. And what we needed to do, first of all, is understand our flow. So $60 billion plus of flow around the world. We needed to do the analytics behind it, drove that -- by the way, that investment got no monetization, so we didn't get a lot of benefit out of that. Then we had to actually introduce that to our clients around the world and our markets to really prove the concept. And on this call and some individual conversations, we talked about proving concept of GRIP and Aon Broking in 2011. And we believe we've absolutely done that. We've got 25-plus carriers who have actually come online and actually are making use of the data. We've been able to actually launch a D&O program last summer that proves what we can do on behalf of clients. So Dan, we've made specific steps to truly prove the concept around what we've done with Aon Broking. And now, what we're doing is we've decided we're going scale it. And scale up means we're going to make additional investments in technology. By the way, we're going to add the entire Health and Benefits flow, which is another $24 billion of flow. We're adding some geographies. We're making it more automated and we're putting people around it. So we've actually got dedicated teams who are representing the carriers as they come online. So each of the 25 carriers, we've got various versions of dedicated teams that help them do what they need to do, to actually better match their capital with our clients. And the reason I'm taking a bit of time to make the point is, this is a fundamental difference in the type of investment that I think has been made across the industry. We believe is very substantial for Aon and that it improves our operating leverage, but it also strengthens our client-serving capability. In many respects, if you think about what we were able to accomplish in 2011, we got quite excited about what we were able to pull together and realize that in our order to actually roll that out, we needed to ramp up. And that's, if fact, what we've done. It's important again -- a lot of times when people actually bring people online or brokers online, they're talking about a multiyear payback. We know what this payback looks like. We know what the pipeline is, we know the revenue potential, we know the cost to ramp up and support. By the way, we know there's going to be headwind as we ramp up, but we also know in the context of that there will be positive margin for the year. And what we're going to have in the end, is we're going to have positive margin, but we're also going to have a platform in place that is best-in-class around data and analytics with now over $80 billion of flow. We've got revenues from carriers, who get great value to serve our clients. And we're going to get higher yield per dollar premium play. So for us, this is an opportunity to ramp up something that we've actually been working on for quite some time, and you'll see benefit in year. We could basically absorb the kind of proof phase of this, if you will, for the last couple of years, but we're not going to be able to absorb the ramp-up piece. But we're quite confident about what the overall benefit's going to look like for us and what it's going to mean for you. So that's the difference.","Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Just one quick follow-up on the Consulting side and the amount of investment going in there. Can you put a number around the revenue opportunity from the health care exchanges that you're making investment in because, obviously, there's probably not much, if any, revenue yet?","Gregory C. Case","Well, I'd say and I would contrast, by the way, you asked the question quite appropriately on investments. What we just described on GRIP is different than what we're doing from the health care exchange stand point. That's actually got a bit more of a lead time. We're putting in place a whole series of things that actually will launch these exchanges, both looking at the corporate side and on the retirement side. And so it's going to take a bit more time, but we see this as a fundamental opportunity. This, again, if you think about what's different around Aon Hewitt from when we actually brought the firms together, one of them is a very explicit decision to invest the better part of $75 million over the course of the couple of years in these exchange arenas, which we think are going to be quite beneficial for our clients and quite beneficial for our shareholders over time. But the lead time is going to be longer.","Christa Davies","And in terms of the revenue, Dan, I mean we will see revenue in this year on the retiree exchange and the corporate exchange will sort of ramp up. But we see the return on this investment being one of the highest across the business, which is why we've made such a large investment.","Operator","Next question, Ray Iardella, Macquarie.","Raymond Iardella - Macquarie Research","A couple of questions here. I guess first, maybe you can talk about a little bit about investments in people. I think you guys have called out key investments in talent in the past couple of releases. And certainly, you know with some of the initiatives like GRIP, you certainly need additional talent. And I know you pointed to Asia on the Brokerage side. But when does that translate, I guess, the talent translate into more revenue growth?","Gregory C. Case","Well, so a couple of aspects on that. As you think about -- we've been investing in talent, and we'll continue to do so, over time, particularly as described in Asia and Latin America and the high-growth areas around the world. And we see opportunity with the talent investments on this coming end of 2012 and in 2013. But I want to contrast that with the people investment we're making in GRIP. Those investments we're making as we ramp up, we see benefit in 2012, with very clear line of sight of where that's going to come from. And again, I contrast that. And the reason I'm spending a bit of time on this, it's important you understand the nature of that investment around building the technology platform, putting it in place, bringing it in front of carrier, potential carriers, having them actually buy into it and come online, gives us very clear confidence in sort of what it means to ramp that up and get benefit out of that. And we see that from a people investment in '12. And then the others are the more traditional. So it's essentially adding 300, 400, 500 people across Latin America and Asia because we see big opportunities and that's going to take a bit more of time to play out.","Christa Davies","And we certainly see the revenue from these coming in Q4 and we see the investments ramping down in Q3.","Raymond Iardella - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then maybe on the HR Solutions side, similar commentary. I mean, is it back half of 2012?","Christa Davies","Yes. Well, what we would say is, and I did say, that we expect that operating income is going to be down modestly year-over-year in Q2 and Q3 and flat in Q4 before growing in 2013. And really, the investments we said were going to be $40 million in 2011 and an additional $35 million in 2012. And that $35 million is really front-half weighted because we do see revenues coming in the exchange business in Q4 because it ties with the annual enrollment cycle, which is at that time period of the year.","Gregory C. Case","It's almost as if you think about, literally, the series of investment ARS, Aon Benfield are ahead of where Aon Hewitt is. Aon Hewitt has come online, we've actually now -- we've got a clear sight of what we think we want the portfolio to look like, where we see the investment opportunities to be. Those play out a bit longer term, as Christa just described. And the others are going to yield benefits much sooner because, frankly, they're in a -- we've actually had a bit more time to work with them over the last few years.","Raymond Iardella - Macquarie Research","Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe going back to GRIP a little bit, I guess one of the things that I struggle with, I certainly understand the benefits of the GRIP platform, but towards, I guess, larger insurance carriers. But maybe can you talk about the value proposition that you offer towards smaller insurance carriers because I think that really makes up the majority, I guess, of the carriers around the world?","Gregory C. Case","Well, this is, again, the opportunity really is, it's carriers around the world, it really is about how we align their capital and where they want to place it with our flow around the world. So again, obviously, nothing's ever guaranteed. But to be able to match their interest with our flow is an incredibly powerful thing. So if you're a carrier virtually of any size around the world and you have a view on where you want to invest and how you want to invest, what GRIP does is enable you to actually get access, get exposure, get true connection to our flow in a way that you can actually apply your capital and win business. And we've actually, as we talked about proving the concept, we've actually worked with large carriers and medium-sized carriers both. And just for reference, proving the concept, 25 carriers is what we talked about. We work with over 2,000 carriers around the globe, so this a very large percentage. We absolutely don't believe that all of them are going to engage in this, nor do we want them to, nor do they need to. But we believe the opportunity is substantial, really, if you're a large carrier, a medium-sized carrier or small carrier.","Operator","Next question comes from Adam Klauber, William Blair.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","On the Consulting business, for margins to turn around 2013, do you need more than flat to 2% revenue growth?","Christa Davies","No, Adam. What we're really looking at occurring 2012 to 2013 is the ramp-down of the investments and the ramp-up of the savings. And those 2 things will put us to operating income growth in 2013.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then as far as GRIP, I mean, from what I've been hearing it's actually been very successful. Revenues, which you haven't disclosed, but from what I've heard they're at least north of $100 million and maybe materially more than that. I'm not asking you to validate that, but why isn't that more margin accretive if the revenues are becoming substantial? And then number two, because it has been very successful, at some point, will you give us an idea what the revenues are?","Gregory C. Case","Yes. I think as we said back, again, we wanted to be -- we want to first be very careful in terms of how we put items in place that will actually improve our ability to serve our clients, which GRIP does. Support our markets and our carriers, which GRIP does. And as we said before kind of proving the concept and making sure that we could provide value to both those constituents with very sophisticated large carriers, medium-sized carriers and carriers around the world, is exactly what we wanted to do. Obviously, for competitive reasons, I know this is going to be pretty sensitive in terms of sort of how we think about this. But over time, we, as we said before, are doing this because we think it gives us a fundamentally better platform. These analytics help our clients very substantially and the markets very substantially, and it improves our operating leverage. So in essence, if you think about sort of our ability to improve margin, as Christa described before, on lower levels of growth, we believe, quite strongly, that GRIP will help us do that. And so why isn't it showing up in 2012, if that's the case? And this is really the ramp-up. So this is a fundamental decision taken by Aon and its leadership team over the last couple of years to invest behind what we believe is a unique data set in the world today to operationalize it and actually get it in front of clients in a way that we can actually monetize it. It's taken us a period of time to do that. By the way, I wish we would have -- I wish we could have done it faster and we could have done it in months instead of a couple of years, but it's taken that time to actually pull all this together. And what you see now is the ramp up and that's really the first 3 quarters. But we also want to highlight, maybe, slightly different in most \"investments\" that are made sort of in the brokerage world in which you bring in a broker and talk about an 18- to 24-month payback. We know what this looks like and we said we're going to have positive brokerage margin in 2012, which highlights sort of how this could be accretive.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And one follow-up question. As far as organic growth in the Risk Solutions business, Americas was up. Is part of that driven by the U.S. doing better with better rate and exposure? And given that rate and exposure seems to build, would you continue -- would you expect that to continue to do better throughout the rest of the year?","Gregory C. Case","Yes. I would say, first of all, Americas is up 4%, international is up 4% and we feel good about -- we always want to grow more, but we feel good about this from the standpoint. When you think about our European book, which is very, very substantial for us, disproportionately substantial -- and by the way, the renewal for that is about 50% in the first quarter. So that had a bit of a drag, when you think about all the things that are going on in Europe. Although our European colleagues did a remarkable job. Then the Americas, as you said, up 4%. U.S. was not really impacted by the market. We had minimal price impact in the U.S. It was really management of the renewable book and what we've done with Client Promise and a number of other things that's really helped us. We looked at something called rollover, which is you keep the client, literally, what happens to the revenue in the context of that. And that improved -- that's really what helped us. New business was roughly flat across the board. Retention was strong, rollover was up and it was really driven by management actions here more than it was the overall market. We think we've got a lot of leverage still out there to GDP pricing improvement, if it shows up over time, but we didn't see it as much in Q1.","Operator","Next question, Jay Cohen, BofA Merrill Lynch.","Jay A. Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a couple of questions. I guess on the HR Solutions business, so the guidance seems to have, I guess, come down a little bit for this year relative to what you've talked about last quarter. And I'm wondering what changed in the last 3 months to cause that?","Christa Davies","Yes. Jay, there are really 2 things that changed. We transferred $26 million of savings to the Risk Solutions segment related to Health and Benefits and we have a slightly more conservative view on discretionary spend for project-related revenue. And so we'd now expect operating income to be down modestly year-over-year, whereas -- I did say in Q4 that we thought it will be up modestly year-over-year. And we certainly believe that it will grow in 2013 as the investments ramp down and the savings ramp up. And we improved the core business performance.","Jay A. Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","But the transfer of the savings, you kind of knew about before?","Christa Davies","Yes. I mean, I think as we sort of -- as we transfer that business and allocated the savings, I think it's really sort of $26 million of the savings were delivered in Q1 and I think we've got an incremental $26 million of savings that are going to come through. And so I think having seen the savings come through in Q1, I think it's just giving us a better clarity to the amount of savings that are going to happen related to the Health and Benefits business.","Gregory C. Case","I would highlight, Jay, as Christa said, the savings came over, so I think they're going to show up throughout the year. But this has not been a trivial exercise. It's $720-plus million of revenue that moved over. We weren't sure exactly sort of what specific pieces. We now have much more clarity on exactly what it means to the penny that sort of bring this business over. So that's really what we actually -- we upped. I would reflect, as you step back, really I think to the core of your question is, how are we feeling about the business long term? And I would say, that remains unchanged. We've got sort of timing and movement in the middle. There have been some deal model changes around H and B, in which we made a decision, as Christa described, core business we've talked about. But long term, we feel very positive about where we are with Aon Hewitt and how's it evolving over time. And again, this is -- you can look at the movie, go back and look at what's happened in Aon Benfield, go back and look what's happened -- and see what we're doing with GRIP now and what we're doing with Aon Risk Solutions. Aon Hewitt's sort of the next in the line and we see that progressing. There'll be puts and takes, but we see it progressing very well.","Jay A. Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. And then the other topic is, on the Risk side. I guess, what's a little frustrating is that you guys did a really great job of improving margins over many years in what was a horrendous environment. And the environment certainly feels a lot better. So of course, the expectation has been you would see much more significant margin improvement when this environment has finally arrived. But you've been investing all along. Is [ph] the investment incrementally higher, could you say you were under investing for a couple of years in retrospect? I guess, can you address that frustration that people have?","Gregory C. Case","So I first of all, Jay, fully understand the frustration and sort of, particularly, quarter-to-quarter movement and margin improvement. And I would ask you to do the following. Step back, think about sort of how this has worked over time, sort of on the Risk Solutions side, 320 basis point improvement from 2007, a 500 basis point improvement in 2005 against the headwinds that you described. In that context, we invested a lot. By the way, we also had a lot of restructuring savings that we could absolutely absorbed. As those wound down, we still have some left. We took full advantage of that, in our view, invest more heavily in the business than we think probably anyone in the industry. And in fact, it didn't show up in quarter-to-quarter, it shows up over time. The biggest investment we've made sort of outside of the traditional adding talent is the investment in growth. And what you're really starting to see is the confidence we've got to ramp that up. And what we're essentially saying is, that ramp-up happens in '12 and yet you're still going to see margin improvement in '12, even with that ramp-up and then you're going to see substantial operating leverage in '13. So I understand your frustration quarter-to-quarter, but I'd ask you to step back and say, in the end, when you get done with 2012, we're going to have GRIP basically ramped up; Aon Broking fully online, a platform which is, we believe, fundamentally higher leverage platform from an operation standpoint than anything we've ever had before; client-serving capability that we think is going to be stronger; and our ability to connect with markets and generate revenue streams to support markets, which is also stronger and unique. And while we'd always love to produce quarter-to-quarter, we will take that trade to get to that position for 2012 and establish 2013 to '14. It's just something that we're going to do to build our firm long term.","Christa Davies","And Jay, I'd say as we allocate capital, we think about return on capital as the right metric. And as the growth prospects improve in our business, the return on capital of these investments also improves. And therefore, we're actually investing more. And so I think that's what you're really seeing in this calendar year.","Operator","Next question comes from Brian Meredith of UBS.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Two quick questions here for you. First one, Greg, I was hoping -- or Christa you could talk a little bit about the impact of the price competition in the Benefits Administration business on your organic revenue growth. Kind of what you expect it's going to be going forward, as well as on margins? Kind of what's the headwind from that?","Christa Davies","Yes. Brian, we continue to see pricing competition in the Benefits Administration business. It's exactly in line with what we originally modeled when we did the deal, and it's been fairly consistent over the last 3 years. It hasn't got materially better, but it hasn't got materially worse. And so what I would say is, that is absolutely impacting core business performance, and we continue to talk about that. The other thing I would say though is, project revenue, which is high-margin revenue, is not offsetting this. And that was one of the things we had originally anticipated to offset this pricing competition. And so I think that's really sort of the impact in this calendar year that's different from what we had originally modeled.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","When do you anticipate project revenue to start picking up again?","Christa Davies","I think we would expect that it correlates with the economic growth, it correlates with M&A and we would expect that to occur Q4 and 2013.","Gregory C. Case","In many respects, Brian, if you think about where we are, this is no different than the question, is there a competition in Aon Benfield for our treaty business? Is there competition in Aon Risk Solutions for large corporate arenas, et cetera? These are the things we do every day. There is definitely price competition, it will always be there. We're going to always come back and go to the market around Aon offering that we believe is highly value-oriented and highly value-based. Our objective is to deliver more value per dollar than anyone else. That means we should have a price premium. We have to support that price premium with real value. And that's really what we're working through with our team and they're doing a great job at sort of reacting to the market and coming back with different ideas and perspectives. The good news about this sector, just like it is on the Risk side, is you step back and say, fundamentally, is there real client demand. Our client -- do clients need to actually do something about health and benefits growth, cost growth that shows up in their P&L every year, and the answer is yes. Do they need to do something about pension, and pension challenges? Yes. Can you do something about the talent side and the rewards side? Yes. So we see client demand high, competition similar as we see across our businesses and it's our job to react to it and deal with it.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And then second question, Christa, can you talk about when should we start seeing the benefits in your tax rate from the redomestication? And maybe give us some numbers around, potentially, how much?","Christa Davies","Yes. So Brian, we've said we expect significant reduction in the global effective tax rate over the long term, and we've said that is similar to what we've achieved over the last 5 years, which is really a sort of a 500 basis point reduction and in line with certain global competitors. And we do expect the global effective tax rate for calendar year 2012 to be 28%.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then -- but the 500 basis points should be coming off of 2011 tax rate, right?","Christa Davies","Correct. And it will happen over the long term, Brian.","Operator","Next question comes from Yaron Kinar, Deutsche Bank.","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Maybe to follow-up on Jay's question earlier on the Risk Solutions side. So granted looking backwards, there's a bit of a frustration, which I'm sure you feel as well. But frustration also sometimes breeds some concern. Looking forward, I understand that the investments in GRIP will slow down, but clearly, you're not going to rest on your laurels, you're going to look for further improvements and further investment in the business. So how should we think about margins as new initiatives come around? Should we still expect kind of the 26% target to be intact? Do you have any ideas as to how much time it would take to get there with continued investments?","Gregory C. Case","Yes. Listen, the 26% next step that we've described -- by the way, in the next step of our evolution on the margin side is in full force and we have absolute focus on achieving it and aim to improve operating margin, risk margin every year until we get to the 26%. Then we'll come back and talk to you about sort of where we are from there. But we, Yaron, see, really, the investments we're making this year and what we're able to do in GRIP, actually, in our view, increases the probability substantially. I think we're marching our way toward 26%. And we've essentially said irrespective of market conditions, irrespective of investments over time. Repeat that, market conditions and investments over time, we're going to get to a 26% margin. If you go back and look at our history, what we've been able to achieve, we'll see how 2012 plays out and where we are in 2013. But I want to emphasize 26% is the next step in the journey. And we think -- what we were able to achieve in 2011, we're actually quite excited about in terms of the opportunity, and excited about how it's going to play out in '12 and set the stage for '13 and '14.","Christa Davies","And we would say, Yaron, that on the journey's 26%, the single biggest contributor to it is the Aon Broking initiative and the investments we're making in GRIP. And so that's why we feel so confident about getting to the 26% margin.","Gregory C. Case","I mean one of the things I would say is, if we were -- one, we're backing off. You'd say we made these investments, let's see what happens. We essentially say we're ramping up these investments and we're going to get margin improvement in 2012. The and there is quite important.","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then on the Consulting side, clearly, you're making a lot of investments in the health care exchanges as well. What happens if in June, the Supreme Court ends up repealing or deciding that the mandate is not constitutional or anything of that nature? Does that affect the timing of revenue ramp-up? Does it affect the magnitude of revenues that you expect coming in?","Gregory C. Case","Yes. I think, in the end -- you never know exactly how this is going to play out and what decisions are going to get made. We come back to the fundamentals. And the fundamentals here are, literally, is there going to be health care out there? Yes. Is there going to be a need for companies to play a role in that in helping their employees? Yes. And will there be a big need for advice to increase that we'll have to ramp up as employers are trying to navigate in the new world? And we think in almost every case, the answer to that is yes. That's going to be very, very positive from that standpoint. And we don't believe the Supreme Court ruling is going to have a material impact on the business overall. It could affect the timing, plus or minus. But overall, we think the majority of what we do for clients continues to stand, irrespective of the outcome of the overall decision.","Operator","Next question comes from Matthew Heimermann, JPMorgan Chase.","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I guess, a couple of clarification questions. One, just on the -- thinking about buybacks for the year, you gave guidance in 4Q, when you reported 4Q in early February. Previously, you'd made a comment that once the deal closed, you get access to $300 million of international cash and that could be used for buybacks. I just wanted to make sure that, in fact, the plan still was to use that $300 million and just -- is it fair to think about kind of a 12-month time horizon in terms of potentially, incrementally laying that into your buyback expectation?","Christa Davies","Yes. So for 2012, we had said that we do approximately $100 million in Q1 and $150 million per quarter from Q2 to Q4, with potential for the $300 million of additional purchase using the excess capital in the balance sheet. And there is no change to that guidance. I don't think it's in our best interest to provide specific guidance on the timing. But it is worthwhile saying that any incremental use of cash flow or excess capacity, including the $300 million of cash held internationally, will be evaluated and allocated on the highest return on invested capital. And we continue to believe that share buyback is the highest return on capital across the firm because we look at the long-term growth prospects for Aon and we have an internal valuation, which is substantially higher than where we're trading at today, and we will be opportunistic about taking advantage of that.","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Well, just, I guess, without telling, I'm not looking for quarter per se, but if the stock trades here, let's say, over the next 12 months, is 12 months a reasonable time frame if that's your highest return on capital option?","Christa Davies","Yes. I mean, again, we're not going to provide specific timing and guidance. But of course, if it's our highest return on capital, then we will take advantage of any opportunities. And history's a very good guide of future behavior.","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Well, it just kind of sound -- it sounded when you talked about it before like it was a no-brainer, it would happen. The way talked about it now makes it sound like it's a little bit more. . .","Christa Davies","I would go back to what I said before, which is there is no change in guidance.","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Other question I had was just in the reinsurance business. Could you maybe give us a sense of what's happening in the treaty growth side property versus casualty? And I guess the reason I'm asking is, you made a comment about retention cutbacks being a headwind, and I'm just -- my suspicion would be that, that might continue to be more of a casualty issue than a property issue, but just any color there would be great. And also just whether or not capital markets was incremental to the quarter or not?","Gregory C. Case","Yes. So Aon Benfield as we described drove 5% organic for the quarter, which is the best we've done in quite some time. The real -- when you think about that overall impact, market impact was a piece of it, but it was relatively smaller, very low single digits. By the way, it was a bit pricing but also by retention as we described before. By far, the biggest impact on the quarter was the treaty book. So it wasn't fact [ph], and it wasn't capital markets, it was the treaty book. And it was really new business over lost business from that period of time. And that's really what drove the growth of the quarter. If you think about the property book for us about 70% of the book overall and the new business is really all from properties. We've thought about sort of what we've done and the team's just done a great job. Really, as we brought the firms together and described, before -- essentially, the first year was sort of clients really couldn't react because we were so close to the renewal deadlines in 2009. 2010, they kind of did their adjustments. 2011, we really saw the beginning of the ramp up. Where we were winning more and more new business. And what you saw this quarter was not really market, as much as it was new business generation.","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then any -- on the loss side, how are retention trends year-on-year?","Gregory C. Case","Yes. Retention trends have been very, very good year-on-year, in fact, increasing and really has been one of the issues we've had to deal with. So as these prices gone up and retention has sort of burned back about half of that when you think about sort of what we're looking at for the quarter overall.","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And just can I get the ending common share count?","Gregory C. Case","Say again?","Christa Davies","Yes. Share count, hang on just a minute. So share count as at March 31 was 326.4 million.","Operator","Next question Meyer Shields, Stifel, Nicolaus.","Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I think the specificity that you're giving in terms of the expense is helpful in alleviating the frustration everyone's been talking about, so I'm going to push for little bit more. I guess over the past few years, you've had the investment expenses associated with building GRIP. In addition to the ramp up now, should we expect that former category to ease up in 2013?","Gregory C. Case","Yes. In fact, great question. Literally, this has come online. If you think about what you have to do, you step back and basically realize you're running on top of the better part of $60 billion of flow, didn't really know exactly how it'd come together and how it would fit and how you could actually bring it to the marketplace. So there's a set of analytics that, again, you don't really get a chance to monetize, as you pull that together, you just absorb that. That's substantial, but not as substantial as the ramp up. And then you actually take it to market. You prove the concept for 25 markets and you prove the concept and being able to actually offer different panels and offerings in the market place, which we did last summer. And then you basically say then we need to ramp it up, which is the final set of technology investments to broaden it. By the way, one of the reasons we brought the Health and Benefits business over is we literally give a chance to bring now the $24 billion of Health and Benefits flow into this fold, which is fantastic. And we're now working on doing that, expanding it more globally and then adding the people around it. But to your specific point, once that's done, we've got the platform in place. And the costs associated is much more variable with the additional revenue that comes with that. So again, it's back to the opportunity here to both strengthen our client-serving capability, strengthen how we link to the markets and, very important and, improve operating leverage in the business. Obviously, we don't give guidance here in terms of what this is going to be, but we see real opportunity in terms of sort of what it's going to create for us overall.","Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. Any chance I could ask for -- not so much guidance, but what the annual investment expense run rate has been?","Gregory C. Case","Well, we said before, we really -- it's really part of the overall program. We don't give it out and break it out specifically. What we would come back and say is, the way you hold our feet to the fire is you look at brokerage margin year-over-year and that's we've got to include in our increase. And margins have been up substantial. If you think about sort of what we've been able to do over the last few years, and we have very high expectations on what we're going to be able to do over the next few years with this one opportunity.","Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And if I can drill down into one comment in the press release, where you talked about reduced retirement discretionary spend in the quarter. I guess, that surprised me because I didn't know that pension deficits were getting better. So if you could talk about what, maybe, macro factors are impacting the retirement revenues.","Christa Davies","Yes. So as we think about our retirement consulting business and the transition from DB to DC, then there really is a decline in that sort of actuarial business, which is being offset by the investments we're making in investment consulting. And that is why we're making the investments in investment consulting because it's a very high area of growth to help clients navigate, managing pension risk and thinking through their portfolio and their unfunded liabilities and managing that volatility correctly.","Operator","Our last question comes from Larry Greenberg, Langen McAlenney.","Larry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney","Just to beat the GRIP questions into the ground. Just curious, is it a fair conclusion that you're saying your -- I know you're not giving any specific numbers, but your 2013 risk margin will be higher than it otherwise would have been without this ramp up in investments? And then secondly, does this accelerate the time at which you're going to reach your 26% target?","Gregory C. Case","Larry, by the way, happy to beat this one into the ground as long as you'd like to do because this is certainly something we focus a lot on and it's very important, we think, to the continued progression at Aon. First of all, it does accelerate the movement. This is a step we wanted to take. Again, that improves our client-serving capability, our market-facing capability and increases leverage in the business. And as we said, if you think about it, we're not only going to make investments in '12, we're going to get the ramp-up investments, we're going to get yield in '12. So operating margin, we said, our Risk Solutions margin will increase in '12. And then in '13, obviously, it'll have a positive impact, perhaps, even a more positive impact in '13 than in '12 because you won't have the continued ramp-up costs. Those will have stabilized and you'll have the benefit.","Larry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney","So yes to both of those, I guess?","Gregory C. Case","Yes.","Operator","I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg Case for closing remarks.","Gregory C. Case","I just want to thank everybody for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in Aon and look forward to our next discussion.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect at this time."],"1820":["Aon (NYSE:AON) Q4 2011 Earnings Call February  3, 2012  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Gregory C.

Welcome to Aon Corporation's Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would also like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded and that it is important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our fourth quarter results, as well as having been posted on our website. Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, President and CEO of Aon Corporation. Thank you, sir. You may begin.","Gregory C. Case","Thank you, Leslie, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. Joining me here today is our CFO, Christa Davies. To begin, we finished the year with a quarter that was both challenging and exciting for our firm, challenging in a sense that the macroeconomic and industry pressure continues to be felt in many markets around the globe, albeit at a lesser pace, exciting in a sense that we took significant steps to substantially strengthen our global firm for long-term growth and value creation, including the proposed relocation of our corporate headquarters to London. ","Consistent with previous quarters, I'd like to cover 3 areas before turning the call over to Christa for further financial review. And we'd note that there are slides available on our website for you to follow along with our commentary today. First is our performance against key metrics we communicate to shareholders; second is overall organic growth performance; and third is continued areas of investment across Aon. ","On the first topic, our performance versus key metrics. Each quarter, we measure our performance against the 3 metrics we focus on achieving over the course of the year: grow organically, expand margins and increase earnings per share. ","Turning to Slide 4. In the fourth quarter, organic revenue was 3% overall, with growth across Risk and HR Solutions highlighted by 4% growth in both Reinsurance and Outsourcing. Adjusted operating margin decreased 70 basis points, driven by an increase in intangible amortization expense over the prior year. And finally, EPS increased 15%, driven by strong underlying performance and effective capital management. For the full year, organic revenue growth was 2% overall, an improvement from flat in 2010 and minus 1% in 2009. Adjusted operating margin decreased 180 basis points, which includes 140 basis points of intangible amortization impact and the inclusion of Hewitt results. Finally, EPS increased 5%, driven by strong underlying performance and effective capital management. ","Overall, we finished the year with improved organic revenue across our business, delivered cost savings, took significant steps to strengthen our firm and are effectively allocating capital, giving us both excitement and confidence in our ability to drive improved performance across our key metrics in 2012. ","Turning to Slide 5, on the second topic of growth. I'm going to spend the next few minutes discussing the quarter for both of our segments. In Risk Solutions, overall organic revenue growth was 3%, with growth across all major businesses. As market-related conditions continue to stabilize, we're driving a set of initiatives that are strengthening underlying performance and positioning our Risk Solutions segment for long-term growth and leverage to an improving economy, with management of our renewal books through Client Promise and retention rates of 90% or better on average, highlighting strong client satisfaction; new business generation of nearly $280 million across our Retail business, with solid growth across many markets, including China, Latin America, New Zealand and The Netherlands, just to name a few, highlighting the strength of our global client serving capability; investments in new products and service capabilities with the rollout of GRIP, Aon Broking and Client Promise globally; and in our core treaty reinsurance business, net new business trends have now been positive for 3 consecutive quarters. ","Reflecting on individual businesses, in the Americas, organic revenue growth was 3% as pricing and exposures are relatively flat. We saw solid new business growth in both Canada and Latin America and strong management of the renewal book portfolio, utilizing Client Promise in Latin America and the U.S. Results reflect strong performance, overcoming continued market weakness in the commercial construction sector. On the international side, organic revenue growth was 1% as pricing was flat to modestly down on average, with firmer pricing in catastrophe-exposed regions, really a strong performance given the plus 6% in the prior-year quarter. We saw strong growth in emerging markets and across Asia-Pacific, including double-digit growth in areas such as Thailand, China, Japan and Malaysia. U.K. and Continental Europe continue to be pressured as economic conditions remain fragile across many core markets in the region. ","In Reinsurance, organic revenue growth was 4%, an improvement from minus 1% in the prior quarter and a level of organic revenue performance not achieved since Q2 2009. The results reflect strong growth in our capital markets and advisory business and modest growth in our global facultative placements. In our core book of treaty reinsurance, the impact of the market from pricing and cedent retentions were stable, and the underlying strength of the book continues to improve as net new business won was positive for the third consecutive quarter. This trend in new business generation reflects Aon Benfield's strong value proposition for clients while strengthening operational performance, reducing volatility through unmatched data analytics and advisory capability, a central thesis in the Benfield acquisition we announced roughly 3 years ago. Overall, annual organic revenue was minus 3% in 2010, now flat in 2011, and we're firmly on track for growth in 2012. ","Reflecting on HR Solutions, overall, organic revenue growth was 3%, with growth in both businesses, a solid improvement from minus 2% in the prior quarter. Performance primarily reflects strong growth in areas where we're making significant investments in the business, in areas such as investment consulting, healthcare exchanges and HR BPO. ","Turning to the individual businesses. In Outsourcing, organic revenue growth was 4% compared to minus 2% in the prior quarter. We saw growth from both new client wins in HR BPO and from our healthcare exchanges. Results were partially offset by a modest decline in Benefits Administration due to price compression within expectations in client losses. ","On the Consulting side, organic revenue growth was 2%, with improved growth across most major practices from the prior quarter, overall, a solid improvement from minus 2% in Q3. We saw growth globally in Health and Benefits and in investment consulting, and results were partially offset by a decline in demand for retirement consulting. ","Overall, in HR Solutions, we're pleased with our growth performance in the fourth quarter and would expect modest growth in 2012 across both businesses. And while encouraged that we're beginning to deliver growth from our investments, our priorities for 2012 focus on driving improved profitability for our investments and improving the growth profile in our core Benefits Administration and retirement consulting businesses. ","Slide 6 highlights the third topic, further areas of investment. We believe Aon is in a unique position. Solid, long-term operating performance, combined with expense discipline and strong cash flow continues to enable substantial investments in colleagues and capabilities around the globe. A few examples include: In Risk Solutions, we're investing in client leadership to drive greater productivity and efficiency with the rollout of the Revenue Engine in EMEA and Asia-Pacific, as well as the rollout of Client Promise, which is driving greater retention and rollover rates across our client base. We continue to invest in innovative technology such as our Global Risk Insight Platform, which is the world's leading global repository of risk and insurance placement information. We now have 1.3 million trades, more than 65 billion of bound premium and a growing list of 25 insurance carriers utilizing the platform's analytics and service capabilities. ","We're driving our Aon Broking initiatives to better match client needs with insurer appetite for risk, resulting in better economics for all participants, as highlighted by our ability to package similar risks and place substantial programs and facilities into the market on behalf of clients. ","And finally, effective January 1, 2012, we're aligning our global Health and Benefits platform under Risk Solutions to better leverage a broader global distribution channel and to strengthen the deep brokerage capability in data and analytics with clients and insurance carriers. As we discussed previously, we have proved the concept of these investments in 2011, and as we move into 2012 and 2013, we're going to continue to drive greater scale and increasing operating leverage as a result of these investments in our Risk Solutions business. ","In HR Solutions, we're expanding our international footprint as the workforce is increasingly becoming more global with investments in key talent and capabilities across emerging markets. We're continuing to invest in expanding our core HR BPO offerings through point solutions opportunities such as dependent eligibility audits and absence management diagnostics. And we're expanding our industry-leading benefits services platform from large market to middle market. ","Finally, we continue to strengthen our industry-leading position in healthcare exchanges, enabling clients to prepare for ultimate changes in healthcare legislation with design, purchasing administration capability. ","In summary of our fourth quarter and full year results, we delivered organic revenue growth across both Risk and HR Solutions, made significant investments in long-term growth opportunities and took important steps to strengthen our global firm. Our fundamental client serving capability continues to strengthen substantially around the globe, and the firm is positioned for increased growth in 2012. ","With that said, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Christa for further financial review.","Christa Davies","Thanks very much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg noted, our fourth quarter and full year results reflect continued progress to strengthen our industry-leading platform, and the firm is positioned to increase growth in 2012. We are managing expenses through savings from our restructuring programs, generating strong cash flow and effectively allocating capital as highlighted by the repurchase of $828 million of common stock in 2011. ","Now let me turn to the financial results as highlighted on Page 7 of the presentation. Our core EPS performance, excluding certain items, was $0.97 per share for the fourth quarter, up 15% from $0.84 in the prior-year quarter. Strong underlying performance and effective capital management more than offset a $21 million increase in intangible amortization in the quarter. Certain items that were adjusted for in core EPS performance are highlighted in the schedules of Page 14 on the press release. ","In addition, foreign currency translations had a favorably impact of $0.01. If currency were to remain stable at today's rates, we would expect a modest unfavorable translation impact to EPS in the first quarter of 2012. Starting in the first quarter of 2012 and going forward, the company will provide adjusted results that exclude the impact of noncash intangible amortization and certain onetime items. We believe the exclusion of noncash intangible amortization will more closely align external audiences and the company around cash flow generation. We drive capital management and shareholder value creation through cash-on-cash returns. ","The schedule on Page 15 of the press release reflects this disclosure. I would note that EPS in the fourth quarter, excluding certain items and intangible amortization, was $1.16, up 20% from $0.97 in the prior-year quarter. ","Now let me talk about each of the segments on the next slide. In our Risk Solutions segment, organic revenue growth was 3%, and we delivered an operating margin of 21.8% on an adjusted basis, essentially flat with the prior-year quarter, including a 20 basis point unfavorable impact for costs related to the integration of the Glenrand acquisition. On an adjusted basis, operating income increased 3% or $10 million to $397 million. The year-over-year improvement was primarily driven by an increase in organic revenue and modest benefits related to the restructuring programs. ","Let me spend a moment on each of the restructuring programs, key initiatives that have enabled concurrent funding of investments and long-term structural margin expansion. With respect to the 2007 restructuring program, we have incurred 100% of the charges necessary to deliver savings. Restructuring savings in the fourth quarter are estimated $134 million compared to $128 million in the prior-year quarter. Approximately $113 million of savings were related to the Risk Solutions segment. The program is now complete, having delivered an estimated $536 million of cumulative savings in 2011. ","With respect to the Aon Benfield restructuring program, we incurred $21 million of charges in the fourth quarter and have now completed 96% of the charges necessary to deliver the remaining savings. The remaining charges of $7 million will be incurred in the first quarter, which will complete the charges under this program. Restructuring savings in the fourth quarter are estimated at $33 million compared to $27 million in the prior-year quarter.  The Aon Benfield restructuring program delivered $122 million of cumulative expense savings in 2011 and is expected to deliver cumulative expense savings of $144 million in 2012. ","Turning to the HR Solutions segment, organic revenue growth was 3%. We delivered an adjusted operating margin of 12.4%, down 120 basis points compared to the prior-year quarter, including 190 basis point unfavorable impact related to intangible amortization. On an adjusted basis, operating income decreased 6% or $10 million to $147 million. The year-over-year performance was primarily driven by $22 million increase in intangible amortization; significant investment in long-term growth opportunities, including our healthcare exchange business; and an unfavorable revenue mix shift due to an organic revenue decline in Benefits Administration and retirement consulting. Excluding the impact of noncash intangible amortization, operating income increased 6% to $209 million in the quarter, reflecting savings from the restructuring program. ","With respect to the Aon Hewitt restructuring program, we incurred $25 million of charges in the quarter primarily related to workforce reduction. Cumulative savings related to restructuring program in the fourth quarter are estimated at $43 million compared to $4 million in the prior-year quarter, with additional synergy savings of approximately $27 million achieved outside of the formal restructuring program. For 2011, we achieved an estimated $233 million of cumulative restructuring and synergy savings compared to $4 million of savings in the prior year. Of the achieved savings in 2011, we estimate approximately 75% were realized in operating income before intangible amortization. Realized savings were less than 100% due to approximately $40 million of investment in long-term growth opportunities and weaker performance in certain core businesses. We are not satisfied with this performance, and as Greg noted, our priorities for 2012 are centered on driving improved profitability for our investments and certain of our core businesses. ","As we think about 2012, we would expect to deliver improved performance as we progress throughout the year. Before any adjustments related to the transfer of the Health and Benefits business, we'd expect to realize approximately 75% of incremental restructuring and synergy savings, expect to invest an additional $35 million in long-term growth opportunities across HR BPO, healthcare exchanges and additional talent to expand our distribution and would expect intangible amortization to increase approximately $63 million. In short, including intangible amortization, we would expect operating income to be down modestly through 2011. Excluding intangible amortization, we would expect operating income to be up modestly. ","Turning to the next slide, on our long-term operating margin targets. Effective January 1, 2012, the company moved the global Aon Hewitt Health and Benefits business from the HR Solutions segment into the Risk Solutions segment. This move will allow the business to benefit from broader global distribution channel and to promote the company's deep Health and Benefits capabilities with clients and insurance carriers. Additionally, as we noted last quarter and mentioned earlier, the company will begin reporting adjusted results for Q1 that exclude the impact of intangible amortization and certain onetime benefits. Historical selected financial information for the years 2009, 2010 and 2011 that reflect financial reporting changes for both the Health and Benefits transfer and for intangible amortization are provided in the press release this morning. This financial information will provide comparability to results reported in the first quarter of 2012. ","We recognize there are significant changes this quarter but believe these reflect greater transparency and focus our results on cash flow growth, which is how we run the company. Adjusting for these reporting changes, our new long-term operating margin target of 26% for Risk Solutions reflects significant opportunity for margin expansion in the following 5 ways: first, remaining restructuring savings and other operational improvements; second, continued rollout of the Revenue Engine internationally; third, Aon Broking and GRIP-related initiatives. These 3 are fully within our control. In addition, there are 2 additional macro drivers that provide significant operating leverage based on improvements in the external market. Fourth, increases in short-term interest rates; and fifth, industry improvements driving higher insured values or insurance pricing. ","Similarly, for HR Solutions, adjusting for these reporting changes, our new long-term operating margin target of 22% reflects significant opportunity for margin improvement in the following 3 ways: first, deliver $335 million of synergy savings in 2013; second, growth in the core business and return on incremental investments; third, improvement in HR BPO. ","Now let me discuss a few of the line items outside of the operating segments on the next slide. Unallocated expenses increased $5 million to $43 million, including costs for project-related work. Interest income decreased $2 million to $4 million due to lower average interest rates. Interest expense decreased $6 million to $59 million due primarily to a decline in the average rate on total debt outstanding. Other income of $4 million in the fourth quarter includes gains on certain company-owned life insurance plans, partially offset by losses on the company's ownership and certain private equity securities and other long-term investments. Going forward, we continue to expect a run rate of approximately $5 million per quarter of interest income, $35 million to $40 million of unallocated expense and $60 million of interest expense per quarter. Minority interest was $3 million compared to $10 million in the prior year due to lower performance of certain joint ventures and partnerships. We would expect minority interest to be approximately $8 million to $10 million per quarter going forward. ","Turning to taxes. The effective tax rate on net income from continuing operations declined to 27% in the quarter compared to 32.8% in the prior-year quarter. The prior-year quarter was impacted by certain deferred tax adjustments, and the improvement in the current quarter was primarily due to certain discrete items. The company anticipates an effective tax rate on net income from continuing operations of 29% to 2012. ","Lastly, average diluted shares outstanding decreased to 337.9 million in the fourth quarter compared to 346.7 million in the prior-year quarter due primarily to the company's share repurchase program throughout 2011. The company was not able to repurchase shares in the fourth quarter due to the subsequent announcement of the headquarters relocation. Actual common shares outstanding on December 31 were 324.4 million, and there are approximately 14 million diluted stock equivalents. The company has approximately $1.2 billion remaining under the share repurchase program previously authorized in 2010.","Now let me turn to the next slide to highlight our strong balance sheet and cash flow. At December 31, cash and short-term investments were $1.1 billion and total debt outstanding was $4.5 billion. Overall debt to capital was 35.7% at December 31, 2011, compared to 35.3% at December 31, 2010. Cash flow from operations for 2011 was $1 billion, up 30% from $783 million in the prior year due primarily to an increase in net income resulting from the inclusion of Hewitt and improved operational performance, partially offset by pension contributions and restructuring payments. ","Free cash flow, as defined by cash flow from operations less capital expenditure, was $777 million, up 29% from $603 million in the prior year. Strength of the firm's free cash flow generation enabled more than $1 billion of capital to be returned to shareholders in 2011 through $828 million of share repurchase and $200 million of dividends. ","Turning to the next slide to discuss our long-term financial flexibility. Regarding our underfunded pension plans, we are taking significant steps to reduce volatility and liability as we've closed plans to new entrants, frozen plans from accruing additional benefits and de-risk certain plan assets. In 2011, we contributed approximately $477 million to our plans and would expect to contribute approximately $541 million in 2012 before any discretionary contributions. Higher contributions primarily reflect a decline in discount rates. We would expect the contributions to decline annually beginning in 2013, resulting in fully funded plans on a GAAP basis in 2016. ","Regarding noncash pension expense, we incurred $87 million of expense in 2011 and would expect a modest decline in 2012. Regarding our restructuring plans, cash payments were $178 million in 2011. As our restructuring plans continue to wind down, we would expect cash payments to decline $23 million to approximately $155 million in 2012 before declining further in 2013. As our required uses of cash decline over the next several years and free cash flow increases, we expect it to be a significant source of value creation for shareholders. As an important step in unlocking that value for shareholders, the company announced it will change its jurisdiction of incorporation from Delaware to the U.K. and move its corporate headquarters to London. The transaction requires a shareholder vote to approve and is on track to close in the second quarter of 2012. We believe the relocation will help drive shareholder value through providing greater global access to expected increases in future cash flow, enabling us to access approximately $300 million of excess capital held internationally on our balance sheet upon confirmation of the transaction and increased future cash flows through a significant reduction in our global tax rate over the long term. ","In summary, we delivered improved organic revenue in 2011, placing us firmly on track to increased growth in 2012. We have significant leverage to an improving global economy. We are managing expenses and fully on track to achieve our long-term operating margin targets. Our balance sheet and strong cash flow continue to provide significant financial flexibility as we return more than $1 billion of capital to shareholders and took significant steps to increase long-term shareholder value in 2011, highlighting our belief in the underlying strength of the firm. ","With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'd be delighted to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from Ray Iardella of Macquarie.","Raymond Iardella - Macquarie Research","Just a quick question. I think first, surrounding Europe. I know, Greg, you had mentioned in your commentary there was some weakness in the international Brokerage segment from that. But I'm just curious, was there any headwind on the Consulting or the HR Solutions side?","Gregory C. Case","Ray, as we look at Europe overall, again, the natural expected sort of headwinds are there as you think about sort of how the economy's evolving. But we've been able to actually fight through those reasonably well, really, across the board, when you think of sort of where we are. We've seen on the HR Solutions side, consulting growth in multiple places across the region, especially when you compare to the previous quarter. So we feel pretty good about that. The headwinds are real from an economic standpoint, where we're fighting through those. Same on the HR -- or the Risk side as well. And when we reported 1%, we think about sort of where we were in the same quarter of last year, it was really an incredible, almost unprecedented quarter in terms of sort of overall organic growth. So net-net, we're cautious about what's going on in the economy. We feel good about our ability to kind of fight against that and serve our clients.","Raymond Iardella - Macquarie Research","Great. And then quickly, on the reinsurance brokerage, I mean, I guess part of the growth there has been driven by the capital markets business. And I know 4Q '10 was a pretty tough comp, and certainly, delivering 4% growth there was quite impressive. But could you give a little bit more color on maybe -- was it cat bonds? I mean, what else might be driving that growth there?","Gregory C. Case","Yes, look, I think as you reflect back on Aon Benfield overall, we feel good about where we are. The quarter, specifically, we highlighted was capital advisory and some facultative side, but -- which, by the way, drove a good portion of the growth. But if you reflect on kind of the evolution of Aon Benfield and reflect kind of back, when we actually brought together Aon Benfield then in the fourth quarter of 2008, we essentially said, \"Look, this business is going to -- because so much of the renewal was January 1, there wasn't going to be a lot of movement in 2009.\" And in fact, overall growth was about 0. For 2009, we're roughly flat. We're down roughly 3% in 2010, when a lot of the adjustments occurred, at some of the rebalancing happened. And then now in 2011 for the year, we're 0% overall and 4% as you reflect in the fourth quarter 2011. As interesting to us is literally, over the last 3 quarters, when we looked at business won, net new business versus business lost, we've been strongly positive for the last 3 quarters. And what this just highlights for us is exactly the thesis we had going into this transaction and this combination was that the client serving capability of Aon Benfield was just incredibly substantial to help clients improve operating performance, strengthen balance sheets, decrease volatility. And we simply just have --  we have a greater array of analytic capability than anyone in the world out there at this point, and that served us very well. And after the adjustments that I've just described, the platform is actually fully in place and established for long-term growth.","Operator","Next question, Keith Walsh of Citi.","Keith F. Walsh - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","First question for Greg is just around Brokerage margins, just maybe a broader question. Since you arrived in '05, you've grown margins every year, except 2011. So I guess when we think about the things you can control, such as GRIP, Aon Broking, why aren't they moving the needle now that the cost saves are winding down? We're a couple of years into those. And then I've got a follow-up.","Gregory C. Case","Sure, Keith. Listen, from our standpoint, we step back. We feel very good about the program and the progress to sort of drive into what is a 25% margin, as we described before, increasing now that we're going to -- from a cash perspective of 26% margin. And sort of the -- and as Christa described, the specific investments we have in place have, we believe described, are really getting -- have been proven in 2011, are really able to be scaled up in 2012, 2013, and that's working exceptionally -- that's working very well for us. We'd highlight -- by the way, as you described, while we were able to improve margins over the last 5 years, we did it against significant headwinds, and we made significant investments in the business. By the way, we're doing the same thing on the HR Solutions side when we saw opportunities. So things like GRIP and others sort of were drags from a margin standpoint, but were very positive from kind of -- at a capability-building standpoint. So we are confident as we proceed in '12 and '13, '14 in our ability to actually drive improved margin going forward. I think there are some specific things for the quarter. Maybe Christa, you could comment on some of those that actually highlight some differences there as well.","Christa Davies","Yes, so if we look at 2011, Keith, in terms of Risk Solutions margin, there are obviously 2 big impacts. One was leases, which is a 50 basis point impact, and the other was the integration cost from Glenrand, which, we believe, is a fantastic investment for us in emerging markets and is going to generate a great return, and that was a 20 basis point impact. As we look forward to 2012, we do believe we'll expand Risk Solutions margin and the growth in Aon Benfield, that we believe we'll deliver, will certainly contribute to that. So we feel very good about the progress for 2012.","Keith F. Walsh - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then just a follow-up to Christa on the HR business. I guess going back to the July 2010 presentation, you guys expected adjusted GAAP accretion of 1%-plus in '11 and 5.4% in 2012. And now you're telling us GAAP earnings are going to be down in 2012. I guess relative to the original targets, what specifically is causing this deal to underperform the original metrics?","Christa Davies","Yes, what we would say, Keith, actually, is that we feel better about the long-term outlook for our HR Solutions business than we did when we originally did the transaction. And evidence of that is the fact that we are investing significantly more than we had originally anticipated. We did mention that we've done $40 million of investments in the business in 2011, and we will increase that by a further $35 million in 2012. And those investments span healthcare exchanges, and we believe the opportunity for growth in healthcare is just enormous; our HR BPO business, which we are extremely pleased about; and areas like investment consulting. So we feel very good about that. And as we look at the performance in 2011, as we said, there is some underperformance in certain core businesses, which we aren't happy with. And we would say there's economic pressure -- there's some economic pressure from Europe. And then we have some work to do to continue to improve our performance.","Operator","Next question, Brian Meredith of UBS.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","A couple of questions here. First one, on the HR Solutions business, you did mention that one of the reasons for the weaker growth had to do with some client losses. What's that impact you think going to be for 2012? Was it significant, or was it something that shouldn't cause all that much of an issue in '12?","Gregory C. Case","Brian, this is really the natural progression of the business. We feel good about the overall growth prospects for the business, really, across the board. We're cautious about the economics and the economic environment, I should say, that Christa described. We feel good about the fundamental client serving capability. On the Consulting side and on the Outsourcing side as well, really, when you step back and think about Consulting, in particular, in this quarter, we really had growth across the board on almost every category: Health and Benefits, global comp, investment consulting, talent rewards. The pressure a little bit was on the retirement side, as expected, but really across the board. The net new news here is what Christa just described. The net new news is really the investments we're making against the opportunities we see. We just simply see greater opportunities than we anticipated on the healthcare exchange side, the HR BPO side, the investment consulting side, and we'll make those investments as a way to build long-term value for the business. And that's what we're going to look at and then work against the natural sort of characteristics and price compression characteristics on the Ben Admin side, which we fully expected as well.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And then next question, given the pricing dynamics going on right now in the commercial insurance pricing environment, do you expect that to potentially be a tailwind for you all from an organic revenue growth perspective going in 2012?","Gregory C. Case","Well, listen, we've seen, as we described, and we've been very careful on this, and we look at it, Brian, as you know, quite analytically here. As we look at GRIP, and literally, this is sort of the kind of numeric reflection of exactly what's going on in the context of the overall marketplace, and I'll just go back to -- maybe I'll give you 5 numbers here. In Q4 2010, the overall market, this is across Aon's placements across the globe, minus 5.3%; Q1, it was minus 3.5%; Q2, it was minus 2.5%; Q3, minus 1.9%; and now flat in Q4. So we're seeing progression, and that's against -- across the overall system. Some ups, as you would expect in cat-exposed areas, some downs in areas like D&O, et cetera. But that's literally what's happening across the system. And when we think about Aon overall, again, we've made significant investments to build the platform for growth long term. If you think about where we were in '09, '10 and '11, we're at minus 1%, 0, now plus 2%, and we feel good about sort of continuing that trend moving into 2012.","Operator","Next question, Michael Nannizzi, Goldman Sachs.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, so just if you could talk a little bit about the move of the Benefits segment over to the Brokerage side. I'm just trying to understand from a distribution perspective. How does that work? Or do some of the same brokers distribute both insurance product as well as Health and Benefits? And just a follow-up.","Gregory C. Case","Yes, this is really for us. We're quite excited about this. It's an opportunity with great capability we have on the Health and Benefits side. It really was proven both Aon Hewitt and Aon Risk Solutions to bring those together. And really, it is about much stronger, greater access to clients around the world, in essence, the Health and Benefits capability now being brought to many Aon Risk Solutions clients. And in some respects, particularly in the middle market, they are the same buyer, so that's very much a CEO, CFO, and so it's a great opportunity there. In addition to that, it gives us the opportunity. They continue to work. As you think about sort of what we've done with GRIP on the Risk side, now we're adding Health and Benefits into that context. We've talked about a $60 billion overall flow across the Aon system. Now it's closer to $78 billion, almost $80 billion. So the opportunity to take very prudent approaches on the Aon Broking market side now get amplified doing this, and the access to clients gets amplified, particularly in the middle market and smaller commercial. We are, by the way, going to continue to keep investing behind the large corporate arena. We're very strongly positioned there, and we'll keep doing that. But we see this as really an opportunity to serve clients more effectively and are excited about it.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","But from a just kind of feet-on-the-ground perspective, does that mean that you'll have a broker kind of going into his client, as well as someone who will be representing Health and Benefits, sitting down sort of 3 people instead of 2 people? I'm just wondering, just kind of how does it work just from a feet-on-the-ground perspective?","Gregory C. Case","Yes, the mechanics really don't quite work that way, although I could see where you're coming from. Literally, the mechanics are -- at the end of the day, this has to actually ultimately get designed and then placed, broked and then placed. And so a lot of our ARS colleagues sort of reach out for that capability. Now they've got greater access to fully branded Aon Hewitt capability, but they would have had access before, and we just got a much, much more introduction. So literally, it's like this. We're in the middle market, where we've got the strongest position in the world. The largest portion of our book is middle market, small commercial. Our brokers are sitting across the table saying, \"Wow. I'm doing everything for you on the risk side. I know we've got people challenges and Health and Benefits challenges. I see that, that causes going up on your P&L,\" which, by the way, is a big deal in the middle market, big deal on large corporate, too. And said, \"Listen. I'd love to introduce you to what we believe is the best client serving capability in the world in health and benefits if it's helpful.\" And that's really how it's taken off. And again, this is something we've seen work quite effectively in multiple regions around the world. It's exactly, by the way, how it works in Latin America and has for many years. It's exactly how it's worked in some of our offices in the U.S. already. And so this is, again, in many respects, taking a proven approach which we've seen work and now scaling it quite substantially around the world. And I would say and observe is we've actually made the transition already where we're beginning reporting in January, as Christa described, but we saw H and Benefit -- H&B growth overall in Q4 even as we are going through the transition, so we feel very good about it.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then just one last one. Just you mentioned Europe before, so, I mean, can you talk a little bit about pipeline? I mean, you said you're kind of fighting through the headwinds there. What is your base case for Europe as you think about your business there, particularly on the Consulting side? And where do you see -- where's your pipeline for business now versus where it was maybe 3 or 6 months ago?","Gregory C. Case","Yes. We're still seeing good, strong, robust demand on the pipeline side. It's just, you can imagine, in Europe, clients are cautious. They're concerned about what's going to happen next. They have -- they might delay some projects that they would otherwise actually have done if they had a little more confidence or a little more certainty about what was going to happen. But in terms of sort of engaging with clients, seeing activity, that's remained quite robust. It really is just how we're actually serving them. Our sense is we're going to grow flat to low single digits in 2012. Sort of in the European theater, we're going to push that across both the Risk side and on the HR Solutions side. You know our commitment is to grow organically. And while there are headwinds out there, whether they're in pricing or economics or anything else, we're going to work hard to push against those and feel like we can do that in 2012.","Operator","Next question, Dan Farrell of Sterne Agee.","Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about the HR BPO business. This is a business that seemed like what it needed to do is get profitability fixed. It was not making much on a margin perspective, and now you're putting more into the business. Clearly, you must think of something that can be corrected very much on the margin but also grow, and I'm just wondering if you could talk about what trends you're seeing there that give you the increased confidence to invest in it and then also sort of what stage are we in the turnaround of that business from a margin perspective.","Christa Davies","Yes, so we would say we are very pleased with the progress in this business. New client wins are up significantly, and the performance in this business is exceeding our expectations. We would say that it is a low but positive margin business today, and it will get to a mid-teens margin by 2015, and we are well on that path. So it's growing organically as we saw in Q4, and we expect that trend to continue into 2012, and it's well on track to get to mid-teens margin by 2015.","Gregory C. Case","I might just also add, as you think about sort of the -- this is -- Christa's describing, literally, the core offering, and that's progressing very, very well, as she described. And we saw that, we anticipated that. We've seen that throughout the year, and the team's done a very good job on that front. But in addition to the core product, you might imagine there are lots of additional ancillary offerings that come with core HR BPO, on the Consulting side, in particular, and we're seeing that benefit as well, which is why we feel good about this business and look forward to continuing to grow it.","Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Just one other quick question. I apologize if you've mentioned this already, Christa, but the pension contributions on a cash basis, are those even throughout next year? Are they more front-end loaded?","Christa Davies","They're fairly evenly throughout the year.","Operator","Next question, Adam Klauber of William Blair.","Adam Klauber - Macquarie Research","Could you talk about uses of cash next year? Are share repurchases still the priority? And as cash increases, do acquisitions, significant acquisitions become a possibility again?","Christa Davies","Yes, so the first thing I would say just to answer your M&A question is we do not believe there's a significant acquisition on the horizon. We believe M&A is going to be in the $200 million to $250 million a year range. It's traditionally smaller -- it's smaller acquisitions. So that would be sort of the M&A. But as we think about uses of capital and you refer to Slide 12 of the slide deck we posted, you can see that there are really sort of 6 main uses of capital: pension contributions, which is going to be $541 million in 2012 before any discretionary contributions; the second one is restructuring cash, which is $155 million in 2012; the third is CapEx, which is $270 million; and then we have sort of M&A, which I talked about, sort of $200 million to $250 million; which then leaves sort of return to shareholders of dividends and share repurchases. And obviously, we did over $1 billion this year. And as we think about uses of capital, return on capital on a cash-on-cash basis is the metric we use to allocate capital, and we think that share buyback is the highest return on capital across the firm. And frankly, if we look at our long-term growth of the business and hitting our revenue growth and long-term margin targets and uses of capital decreasing over time substantially, over the next 5 years, we actually see that the cash characteristics of the firm are going to grow substantially, and therefore, share buyback is even more attractive. As we think about sort of the right level of share buyback in 2012, it is going to remain our primary use of capital. $150 million a quarter is probably the right number to think about, with a lower number in Q1 because it's our lowest cash outflow quarter.","Operator","Next question, Jay Gelb of Barclays Capital.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","On the Retail Risk Solutions business, as we get into a pricing environment here that moves into positive territory, how will clients react to that? Will they buy less coverage? And within the Retail business, how much of your revenue stream is commission-based rather than fee-based?","Gregory C. Case","So, what we've seen, Jay, is -- and again, we step back. We solve the risk issues, challenges of our clients, really, very holistically. So we actually help them balance both the cost of that, including the core pricing as well coverage, all the different pieces that go with that. And you'll see some adjustment. Certainly, it's a mitigating factor. As prices increase, clients think about it, but so is the range of coverage that they're having to think about now when you sort of think about all the traditional risks that our clients have to deal with now, adding to that kind of nontraditional risk and the impact of cyber risk and sustainability and all the different pieces that go with that. So for us, it's a pretty kind of holistic picture. On the margins, as prices change, it does impact kind of what happens with our book of business and mitigated by things, as you described, like client retentions. About 70% of our book is commission-based, and about 30% is fee overall. So if you think about that, so it's -- the changes in price will have an impact. But again, we look at it from purely a client perspective on how we can serve them best.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And then on the reinsurance organic growth in the fourth quarter, how much of that should we consider recurring? I mean, it seems like a lot of these capital markets transactions are sort of onetime in nature.","Gregory C. Case","Well, as we described before, listen, the capital markets advisory businesses are lumpy. They go up and down. By the way, help us in some quarters, don't in other quarters. We just have an exceptionally strong capability here. When you think about what we're doing on the cat bond side and the capital advisory side, it's exceptional. We're the #1 player in the world leading the market. We're very much at the forefront there. Same on the advisory side, so that helps us. Facultative can be a bit lumpy, too, up and down. What I do want to emphasize is we feel good about our growth prospects, positive organic growth in 2012. And most important, as you reflect over the last few years in sort of the natural adjustment that occurs when you bring these 2 businesses together given our size, 2011, we believe, has set the stage very well in treaty, in capital advisory and, in fact, for growth.","Operator","Next question, Yaron Kinar, Deutsche Bank.","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Can we talk a little bit about GRIP, Aon Broking, Client Promise? How should we think about quantification of those both in terms of top line and maybe the margin impact?","Gregory C. Case","Well, if you step back and think a little bit, Yaron, about how we've talked about this overall, when you think about sort of driving performance in the Risk Solutions arena, the number of clients, how we're doing on new business, our wins, losses, et cetera, so we've got a great deal of focus around that, a lot of efforts around the Revenue Engine. We think about share of wallet, literally, what's the cross-sell, how many products are we selling, how are we doing it in a way that, again, back to Jay's question, is holistic and really represents the best interest of our clients. And then we look at yield per dollar of premium paid. Really, that's really the other piece that's absolutely critical in the context of this. And so all the initiatives you're describing kind of fit into that framework. And this is really back to kind of Christa's point on getting to the 26% now margin and how that's fixed your play out over time. And in our view, the investments we've made, which have been true investments, they have been drags on margin, are really starting to show what we thought they would and seeing progress on yield per dollar of premium placed on Aon Broking and on GRIP, as well as kind of client wins and losses sort of on the Revenue Engine. In Client Promise, by the way, it's been fantastic. We've been very pleased with sort of the results. When we do Client Promise surveys and really understand holistically how we performed, our retention goes up substantially and our new business goes up substantially. And again, we're just systematically listening to clients and responding with the full capabilities of Aon. And on the Aon Broking side and on GRIP side, as I described before on the yield per dollar of premium paid, we believe there's substantial potential here as we kind of organize our firm to deliver for clients. One great example is over the past few months, we've actually pulled out a kind of a the tranche of risk, call it middle market D&O, for private companies and been able to bring that to market in a way that we've got clients a much better outcome in terms of additions, et cetera, and in the context of that, also done well for Aon. So we have a high expectation for where we think this is going to go and continue to improve Aon's performance. All these things are in Christa's controllable categories, the first 3 she talked about. Those, by themselves, we believe, can get us to our target margin over time. And if we get helped by some tailwinds, either on the investment return side or on the pricing or insured value side, that actually accelerates it.","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just so I understand, looking into 2012, would those be -- those initiatives, would those be a drag or a boost to margins?","Gregory C. Case","Yes, they're going to begin to drive up. So as we said before, through 2011, on the investments we've really made in kind of end of '09, '10, into '11, we said we'd really start to offer some potential in 2012, and we fully expect that to happen.","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then on the Benefits Administration business, clearly, you're still seeing some ongoing price compression and pressures there. Is that kind of the new normal for that business, or do you expect something to change there? And if so, what do you see the catalyst has been?","Gregory C. Case","Well, this has been as expected. This is a business, particularly on the large corporate side, that continues to experience compression, in line with what we thought as we came into the combination with Hewitt. But important, we take note of it. We really spend time with our clients to make sure we're helping them understand the value we can bring to the table, and we're getting paid for that, and we're delivering value. But we're looking for things evolving that capability into the middle market. Imagine middle market companies now that actually have much more compliance-related activities, they've got to come up to speed on, et cetera. We can actually help in the middle market. So the compression is real and meaningful, as we said before, offset by growth in new areas that we're trying to bring to bear to kind of offset that. But that really is what we're addressing as we go into 2012 and think about how we drive the business. So it's project revenue, what we're trying to do in the middle market, thinking about how we actually can continue improve productivity, things we call point solutions, which are specific targeted areas where we can help clients get better, Absence Management as an example of that. And so things -- those are the things we're trying to do, as we would always do, to improve the performance of the business through helping clients succeed.","Operator","Next question, Meyer Shields of Stifel, Nicolaus.","Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I was hoping you could take a couple of minutes and talk about year-over-year benefit or year-over-year changes in Aon Benfield's 1\/1 renewals performance? I'm just thinking that that's particularly important over the course of the year. Just hoping to get some color on that.","Gregory C. Case","Yes. I would say, Meyer, we would describe it as -- we feel good about the program, the progress for our clients on the 1\/1 side. You would, I'd expect, would have seen some movements, particularly in the cat-exposed areas of the world around the globe in which we have significant shares. What we're not doing now at this point is -- on the Aon Benfield side, we believe that the capability we've got puts us in a pretty unique position to serve clients. So we're actually not sharing detailed forecast in sort of what's happened in 2012. Again, cat-exposed zones are up around the world, but the policy we adopted was really not giving our pricing forecast. And the reason for this is our ability to deliver better prices per unit of cover is, we believe, unique in the industry. And so we don't want to -- we're not sharing that with anybody except our clients, and by the way, we're sharing it with them in some detail. But again, you can imagine the overall trajectories, particularly in the cat-exposed areas around the world.","Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","No, I understand that. I guess what I'm pushing for and may not get is performance for shareholders, in other words, how Aon Benfield felt it.","Gregory C. Case","Aon Benfield itself, I think the best way to grab that is looking at literally the win\/loss. So you think about sort of net new clients won versus clients lost, and we're very pleased -- and as we expected, we believe once the overall set of adjustments were made as people readjust their books, which, by the way, in the insurance world, would take 18 months in the context of that because it takes 12 months to flow through. By the way, we actually do the recording of this. But our win\/loss over the last 3 quarters has been up on a dollar basis and up on a client basis for 3 consecutive quarters as we're into 2011. We feel very good about that for 2012.","Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And one other question. I know with the restriction of the outside wholesale brokers, is there economic benefit that you expect in 2012 from that, or is that already in the books?","Gregory C. Case","Well, listen, the U.S. wholesale piece was really around serving clients more effectively, focusing around some preferred wholesalers who are bringing value to our clients in a very specific way, and we've got 2 who are in that category doing very, very well from our standpoint. And so it really is about how we serve clients more effectively and less about sort of the basic economics.","Operator","Our last question comes from Michael Zaremski of Credit Suisse.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","In terms of the share buyback authorization, will you be waiting until the second half of the year, when the headquarters change is completed, to resume repurchases? And related, the tax guidance of 29% doesn't appear to show a tax benefit. Then I have a follow-up.","Christa Davies","Right. So on share buyback, I could say that I think $150 million a quarter is probably the right level, with a lower level in Q1 because it's a higher cash outflow quarter. That does not assume the relocation of headquarters, which would give us access to an additional $300 million sitting internationally on the balance sheet. In terms of -- so to answer you question, share buyback will continue throughout the calendar year, with Q1 being lower because it's our seasonally highest cash outflow quarter. Next, on the tax rate, we are giving guidance for 2012 of 29%. As we mentioned, the 27% we reported for 2011 had some onetime returns that will not continue.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, if I look at Slide 9, the Long-Term Operating Margin Targets, and tell me if I'm thinking about this the wrong way, if I strip out -- looking at the change in intangibles. So I look at the Risk Solutions operating margin target of 26% and I take out the intangibles, so it's still going to be 25%.  And if I look at HR Solutions, it looks like it's 22%, but if I take out intangibles, it's 18%. So I'm just kind of curious, do the margin targets, x intangibles, go down incrementally all-in?","Christa Davies","No. This is literally a math equation just to back out intangibles and to account for the transfer of Health and Benefits. There's no change in our long-term margin targets.","Operator","I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg Case for closing remarks.","Gregory C.

Sir, you may begin.","Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc","Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2016 conference call. Joining me today is our CFO, Christa Davies. I would note that there are slides available on our website for you to follow along with our commentary today.","And consistent with previous quarters, I'd like to cover two areas before turning the call over to Christa for further financial review. First is our performance against key metrics we communicate to shareholders. And second is overall organic growth performance, including continued areas of strategic investment across Aon.","On the first topic, our performance versus key metrics; each quarter, we measure our performance against the key metrics we focus on achieving over the course of the year; grow organically, expand margins, increase earnings per share, and deliver free cash flow growth.","Turning to slide three. In the third quarter organic revenue growth was 4%, including growth across every major business, highlighted by 5% growth in both the Americas Retail Brokerage and Outsourcing businesses. Operating margin increased 10 basis points, reflecting modest improvement in Risk Solutions. EPS increased 4% to $1.29, primarily reflecting effective capital management and underlying operational improvements. And finally, free cash flow for the nine months is up 24%, reflecting strong cash flow from operations and a decline in capital expenditures.","Overall, we continued to strengthen the firm with positive performance across each of our key metrics for both the third quarter and the first nine months of 2016, highlighted by solid organic revenue growth across both Risk Solutions and HR Solutions and strong double-digit growth in free cash flow.","Turning to slide four. On the second topic of growth and investment, I want to spend the next few minutes discussing the quarter for both of our segments.","In Risk Solutions, organic revenue growth was 3% compared to 1% in the prior-year quarter, driven by improved growth across all major businesses. As we've discussed previously, we're driving a set of initiatives to maximize return on invested capital and making strategic investments that are strengthening underlying performance and positioning our Risk Solutions segment for long-term growth and improved operating leverage with management of our renewal book portfolio through a proactive client partnership we call Aon Client Promise, which is driving retention rates of more than 90% on average across Retail Brokerage, including record retention rates of 94% in the U.S. and EMEA.","New business generation of roughly $265 million in the third quarter across Retail Brokerage, including double-digit growth in Latin America, Affinity and EMEA and another consecutive quarter of record new business in U.S. Retail, 22 consecutive quarters of positive net new business in core treaty reinsurance, increased operating leverage from our significant investments in innovative technology and data and analytics, including Aon Inpoint, a growing business where we help carriers to become more competitive, effective and operationally efficient by integrating our market-leading data and analytics with strategic consulting and access to Aon's unmatched expertise. This includes the Risk Insight Platform, which now captures 3.3 million trades and nearly $165 billion of bound premium, as well as our reinsurer dashboard, ReView. Another example is our Aon broking initiative to better match client need with insurer appetite for risk.","And finally, we're expanding our content and global footprint through tuck-in acquisitions that increase scale in emerging markets and expand capability. For example, we recently announced the addition of Stroz Friedberg, a global leader in cyber security, bringing together two of the world's most highly skilled teams focused on cyber risk mitigation.","This investment extends Aon's leading position in cyber risk brokerage and creates a comprehensive cyber advisory group, allowing Aon's clients to have access to the most advanced thinking and solutions in the industry.","Reflecting on our individual businesses within Risk Solutions, in the Americas, organic revenue growth was 5% compared to 4% in the prior-year quarter. Exposures continue to be positive across the region, while the impact from pricing was negative, resulting in relatively stable market impact overall. We saw solid growth across all regions, U.S. Retail, Latin America and Canada, including growth across all businesses, Property-Casualty, Health and Benefits and Affinity. Results were highlighted by double-digit growth in Affinity's Consumer Solutions Group and strong growth in U.S. Retail, driven by record new business generation and retention.","In international, organic revenue growth was 2% compared to 1% in the prior-year quarter. The impact from pricing remains modestly negative on average driven by fragile market conditions in various countries across Europe and Asia and continued pricing pressure in the Pacific region, while exposures are modestly improving.","Similar to the Americas, we saw growth across every major region, including EMEA, Asia and the Pacific. Results were highlighted by continued strength in New Zealand, record retention in EMEA and solid growth in Asia. In Continental Europe, we continue to see signs of improving growth, reflecting Aon's strength in client leadership across the region despite a macroeconomic environment that remains challenged in various countries.","In Reinsurance, organic revenue growth was 1% compared to minus 4% in the prior-year quarter. This marks the fourth consecutive quarter of positive growth in Reinsurance, further validating our previous guidance of an expected return to modest growth in 2016. Results in the quarter were primarily driven by continued net new business generation in treaty and growth in facultative placements. Results were partially offset by an unfavorable market impact globally.","As highlighted in our prior discussions, pricing continues to moderate, ceding (7:03) demand continues to increase and capital is being deployed to new markets, including U.S. mortgage credit risk, life and annuity risk, and other emerging risks such as cyber liability. We believe new opportunities for growth, combined with Aon's industry-leading data and analytics and integrated capital solutions, have positioned our Reinsurance business for long-term growth.","Turning to HR Solutions, organic revenue growth was 4% overall with solid growth across high demand areas where we continue to invest in innovative solutions and client serving capabilities. These investments reflect Aon Hewitt's leadership and in-depth understanding of market trends, including solutions to help plan sponsors both manage pension risk and drive better retirement outcomes for their employees.","A strong area of growth has been delegated investment consulting, where assets under management have grown from $10 billion to almost $90 billion in five years. We expect continued global growth in this area as sponsors are faced with regulatory changes and increasingly complex global markets.","Continuing investments to strengthen our industry-leading portfolio of health solutions, covering the full range of benefit strategies, client size, and funding choices, including our suite of private healthcare exchanges. We view health as a substantial long-term opportunity. We are the industry leader in managing unique company or employee population needs today and our superior advisory capabilities allow us to help clients evolve when their needs change and priorities shift and as the healthcare landscape continues to evolve.","We also continue to invest in software-as-a-service models in our HR BPO business, where growth in new clients and conversion of existing clients is driving strong demands, as well as the expansion of our capabilities to include financial implementations. And finally, we're investing in data analytics in our health, retirement investment and talent rewards businesses to provide superior advice to drive better outcomes for our clients and our clients' employees.","Turning to the individual businesses within HR Solutions. In Consulting Services, organic revenue growth was 3%, similar to the prior-year quarter. Results primarily reflect continued growth in retirement consulting, driven by demand for delegated investment consulting services, as an increasing amount of clients find significant value in Aon's ability to provide advice and manage their retirement assets.","We saw growth in communications consulting, where clients are proactively preparing their employees in advance of annual enrollment season as well certain project-related work. Results in the quarter also include solid growth in our compensation consulting practice.","In Outsourcing, organic revenue growth was 5%, similar to the prior-year quarter. Results reflect strong growth in HR BPO, driven by new client wins in cloud-based solutions. And we saw strong growth in our health exchange business for off-cycle enrollments and certain project-related work. Results in the quarter were partially offset by an anticipated modest decline in benefits administration.","Overall, in HR Solutions, we are firmly on track for improved organic revenue growth in both businesses for the second half of the year, driven by continued growth in high demand areas where we've been investing, combined with seasonal strength in the fourth quarter.","In summary, our performance marks another quarter of progress, reflecting strong organic revenue growth across both segments, effective capital management and substantial free cash flow generation towards our near-term goal of $2.4 billion for the full year 2017.","Looking forward, we expect a strong finish to the year, as we head into our seasonally strongest quarter with continued long-term growth driven by our unmatched level of investment in advisory and analytic capabilities across our portfolio.","With that said, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Christa for further financial review. Christa?","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","Thank you so much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg noted, our results reflect solid organic revenue growth across both segments, substantial free cash flow generation and effective capital management, highlighted by $300 million of share repurchase in the quarter and more than $1 billion of share repurchase year-to-date.","Now, let me turn to the financial results for the quarter on page six of the presentation. Our core EPS performance excluding certain items increased 4% to $1.29 per share for the third quarter compared to $1.24 in the prior-year quarter.","Certain items that were adjusted for in the core EPS performance and highlighted in the schedules on page 12 of the press release include non-cash intangible asset amortization. Also included in the results was a $0.01 per share favorable impact related to foreign currency translation due primarily to the U.S. dollar strength against the pound. If currency to remain stable at today's rates, we would expect foreign currency translation to have a modest positive impact in the fourth quarter.","Now let me talk about each of the segments on the next slide. In our Risk Solutions segment, organic growth was 3%, operating margin increased 10 basis points to 20.9% and operating income increased 2% compared to the prior-year quarter. Reported results are in line with our previous guidance of modest operating income growth in the third quarter.","Operating margin improvement of 10 basis points reflects solid organic revenue growth and an 80 basis points favorable impact from foreign currency translation, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from the timing of certain compensation expenses and a minus 50 basis point unfavorable impact from higher E&O expense in the quarter.","For the first nine months, operating margin improved 60 basis points and operating income increased 3%. Anticipating a strong performance in the fourth quarter, we are fully on track to deliver improved operating income growth and further margin expansion for the full year, reflecting continued progress towards our long-term target of 26%.","Turning to the HR Solutions segment, organic revenue growth was 4%, operating margin decreased 30 basis points to 17.1%, and operating income decreased 4% compared to the prior-year quarter. Operating income results include a $7 million or minus 70 basis points of legacy IT contract costs incurred in the quarter. This impact as well as an anticipated minus 70 basis point unfavorable impact related to previous portfolio repositioning activities and a minus 20 basis point unfavorable impact from foreign currency more than offset solid organic growth in the quarter.","For the first nine months, operating margin decreased 70 basis points and operating income decreased 8%. As discussed previously, we continue to take steps to reduce certain costs that remained after the disposition of two businesses in the last 12 months as well as optimize our global cost structure in areas such as IT, real estate, and global procurement. Combined with an expected strong performance in the fourth quarter, we are fully on track for continued margin expansion towards our long-term operating margin target of 22%.","Now let me discuss a few of the line items outside of the operating segments on slide 9. Unallocated expenses were $42 million compared to $45 million in the prior-year quarter. Interest income was $1 million compared to $3 million in the prior-year quarter. Interest expense decreased $2 million to $70 million due to a decline in costs related to certain derivative hedging programs which have now expired.","Other income in both the current and prior-year quarters included gains on certain long-term investments. Going forward, we expect a run rate of approximately $45 million per quarter of unallocated expense, $3 million per quarter of interest income and $70 million per quarter of interest expense.","Turning to taxes. The adjusted effective tax rate on net income from continuing operations excluding the applicable tax impact associated with non-cash pension settlements in the first half of the year increased to 18.2% compared to 16% in the prior-year quarter. Changes in the geographic distribution of income and certain favorable discrete tax adjustments impacted the adjusted effective tax rate in the current quarter. The prior-year quarter adjusted effective tax rate excluded the applicable tax impact associated with expenses related to legacy litigation.","Lastly, average diluted shares outstanding decreased 5% to 269.6 million in the third quarter compared to 283.8 million in the prior-year quarter as we effectively allocate capital. The company repurchased 2.7 million Class A ordinary shares for approximately $300 million in the third quarter. The company has $3 billion of remaining authorization under its share repurchase program. Actual shares outstanding on September 30 were 263.5 million and there are approximately 6 million additional dilutive equivalents. Estimated Q4 2016 beginning dilutive share count is approximately 269 million, subject to share price movements, share issuance and share repurchase.","Now let me turn to the next slide to highlight our solid balance sheet and strong cash flow growth on slide 10. At September 30, 2016 cash and short-term investments increased to $946 million. Total debt outstanding was approximately $6.2 billion and total debt to EBITDA on a GAAP basis was 2.4 times, similar to the prior quarter.","Cash flow from operations for the first nine months increased 14% or $180 million to $1.5 billion, driven by lower pension contributions and increase in net income, working capital improvements and lower cash taxes. Free cash flow, as defined by cash flow from operations less CapEx, increased 24% or $252 million to $1.3 billion, reflecting strong growth in cash flow from operations and a $72 million decrease in CapEx. Looking forward, we expect to deliver strong double-digit free cash flow growth for the full-year 2016. Reflecting further progress towards our near-term goal of $2.4 billion of free cash flow for the full-year 2017.","Turning to the next slide to discuss our significant increases in free cash flow. We value the firm based on free cash flow and allocate capital to maximize free cash flow returns. Free cash flow of $2.4 billion for the full-year 2017 is not our end goal, as we expect to deliver sustainable strong free cash flow growth on an annual basis beyond 2017.","There are four primary areas that we expect to contribute to our near-term goal of delivering $2.4 billion for the full-year 2017. The first is continued operational performance, driven by organic revenue growth and margin expansion.","The second is working capital improvements, as we focus on closing the gap between receivables and payables. We've made substantial progress in this area over the last five years with further opportunity to increase free cash flow by over $500 million.","Third is declining uses of cash, of pension contributions, CapEx and restructuring, which we expect to free up more than $105 million of annual free cash flow between the end of 2015 and 2017. And fourth, lower cash tax payments, reflecting a lower effective tax rate.","Turning to our pension plans. We've taken significant steps to reduce the volatility and liability of our plans. In the first half of 2016, we completed two transactions to materially de-risk our pension liabilities in the U.K. And we'll continue to actively manage de-risking opportunities as they make financial sense.","Further, we currently expect pension contributions to decline by approximately $44 million to $150 million in 2016 and expect non-cash pension income on an underlying basis to be a modest benefit in 2016 versus 2015.","In summary, we delivered solid organic revenue growth, overall operating margin improvement, despite certain anticipated headwinds in the quarter and continued to deliver double-digit free cash flow growth.","For the first nine months, results reflect positive performance across each of our key metrics heading into our seasonally strongest quarter. With a strong finish to the year, we are well on track in 2016 to deliver meaningful progress towards our near-term goal of $2.4 billion in free cash flow for the full year 2017.","With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question is from Mr. Dave Styblo from Jefferies. Your line is open.","David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC","Hey there. Good morning, guys.","Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc","Hey, Dave.","David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC","Thanks for taking the questions. I just want to talk about just the rest of the year here, as we go in I know you're feeling good about the momentum, and fourth quarter is typically your seasonally strongest, I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about the visibility or maybe a percent of the pipeline that you already know for revenue that you have in hand versus maybe what's left to do and then I don't think I heard you guys talk much about the exchange outlook for next year. I know you've got Starbucks under your belt, what are the other moving parts, any customer losses or other wins to flag there for growth in 2017?","Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc","David, let me start, overall, as you know, we've been \u2013 I described Aon Client Promise in my commentary and part of that is literally how we support clients every day and the direct result of that measurable is retention and something we also call rollovers, not only keeping the client but also doing more and serving them more effectively. And if you look at where we are, we're a 90% plus retention business, 94% in the U.S. and the fourth quarter is our strongest quarter by far. But you can imagine we've got pretty good visibility into momentum and direction for that and feel good about our ability to close the year.","And in terms of on the healthcare exchange piece, happy to talk more about it if you like. We feel very, very good about our progress. We have great momentum on the exchange side, but I want to emphasize for us this is part of a much, much bigger platform, much bigger perspective around the health platform overall, in which we're bringing a very broad set of solutions to the table: big companies, medium-size companies, small companies and a complete suite of efforts to the table. And for us on the health side, we're very excited about it. This is a double-digit growth opportunity for us. We're already achieving but we see more potential going forward, with substantial margin improvement potential as well. So we feel good about the momentum for the fourth quarter and into 2017.","David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Can you talk \u2013 maybe just put some numbers around the exchange growth enrollment for this year going into 2017?","Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc","So here is what I would say, as we think about the exchange piece and we step back. For us \u2013 and I'll just be very direct \u2013 this is an incredibly positive outcome for us with great momentum, but we continue to be confused\/interested in all the confusion in the market. The numbers are really not apples-to-apples in any way, shape or form. So for us the enrollment numbers really aren't as relevant at this point anymore. We've got so many off-cycle enrollments now on the horizon of project related revenue, which is much more substantial than ever before, and this really ends up being a platform for us. We're seeing things like elective benefits, whether it's life, home, long-term disability, short-term disability, it's a very, very positive set of developments for us.","And if you looked at it as a business, again, less about enrollment, about the business overall, this is double-digit revenue growth on exchanges for us. We moved to profitability last year. It's going to obviously be stronger this year. But I'd say from a macro standpoint, I mean, look at where we are in the exchanges. This is strong and steady growth. We've done the largest active, the largest retiree. You mentioned Starbucks, we don't mention our clients, but we were very privileged. Starbucks has a well-earned reputation for defining excellence in employee value proposition and we help them deliver on that through our exchange. So we're very excited about what that means overall. So, for us, this is just an exceptionally strong platform for us and I would say our pipeline is as strong as it's ever been. So there's no waning, there's no backing up, there's no deferring, it's as strong as it's ever been.","Having said that, Dave, I still want to emphasize, and we've been saying this from the beginning, this is not a change in direction. The exchanges are an exceptionally strong solution for a subset of our clients, but it's really part of the overall health platform, which we feel very, very strong about.","David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC","Sure. I get that. That's great. The free cash flow, I want to come back to that. I know you guys are trending really well this year. Is there anything to look for in the fourth quarter? It seems like you're going to be pretty darn close to the $2.4 billion goal this year, and want to know if you could help us \u2013 help remind us if there were any unusual puts or takes throughout the year-to-date numbers as we bridge into next year?","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","Dave, there's nothing particularly unusual this year. I would note last year we had an extraordinary legal legacy litigation settlement of about $140 million. But we feel really good about the free cash flow growth for the full year 2016. We're on track for double-digit growth in free cash flow this year. And we're well on track to the $2.4 billion in free cash flow in 2017. So we feel really good about the growth in cash flow.","And we feel equally good about the way in which we're deploying that cash on a really disciplined return on capital basis. And so, we continue to see share repurchase as the highest return on capital opportunity across Aon, it really sets the bar, but we're equally \u2013 we've actually done over $0.5 billion of M&A year-to-date and we feel really good about the opportunities, like cyber, like elective benefits, which are huge growth opportunities for us. And so, we're very excited about the deployment of the cash, as much as we are about the growth in free cash flow itself.","David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC","Okay, great. And just my last one real quick is on the HR Solutions. I think you guys had previously in the last quarter talked about income growth being flat year-over-year for this quarter. Obviously, it was down about 4%. I'm wondering, what changed there that caused the deviation from what you guys thought it would be. Is it perhaps the \u2013 I think you guys had flagged the legacy IT contract cost coming...?","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","Yeah. I think that was simply it, Dave, there was $7 million of IT contracts that were legacy and that was really it. And then, look, FX was a slight negative too, but I mean, I think we were largely in line. And it was really just that IT item.","David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And is that totally put to bed at this point or can that continue to dribble on?","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","It actually creates slight upside going forward.","David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC","All right. Thanks for the questions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Sarah DeWitt from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. In Risk Solutions organic growth, I was surprised it didn't slow this quarter, given you had said there would be some revenue shifting from the third quarter into the fourth quarter. Can you just quantify that and should we expect some tailwind in the fourth quarter from timing?","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","Yes. So, Sarah, we absolutely said that. And we do believe that Q4 will be \u2013 it is always our seasonally strongest quarter, and it will remain so. So we absolutely expect that revenue \u2013 and there was a small movement of clients from Q3 to Q4, really lining up buying patterns, Sarah, with the annual calendar year. And so we expect that trend to continue. What I think you saw in the third quarter was continued strong retention and continued strong new business. And so we feel really good about Q3 and we feel exceptionally good about Q4.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. And then how do you think about the buyback in the fourth quarter in light of the acquisition that you just made?","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","Yeah. So as I said, we've got extremely strong free cash flow for the full year, Sarah, double-digit free cash flow on track for the $2.4 billion next year. As we think about deployment of that cash, share repurchase is the highest return on capital item. And so we continue to deploy cash on a return on capital basis.","And for us to invest in M&A, the return on capital of that M&A has to be better than buyback. And we've seen some opportunities this year, which are in extraordinarily attractive areas, such as cyber and elective benefits. And we fully expect to continue buyback in Q4.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. But could you quantify the Stroz acquisition, and would that slow the buyback at all?","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","Sarah, we don't \u2013 we're not revealing the purchase price on Stroz and we don't give guidance on share repurchase.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks for the answers.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Adam Klauber from William Blair. Your line is open.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning.","Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc","Hey, Adam.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC","Some questions around the Stroz deal. You already had a cyber consulting operation. So could you talk about what the differences are between your existing operation and Stroz? And then when you put them together, what can you do different or better with these organizations together?","Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc","Yeah. We really are excited about the addition of Stroz Friedberg in addition to some exceptional talent we brought in on the topic of cyber. And let me describe kind of the rationale behind it. First of all, our clients tell us every day cyber is becoming an increasingly important concern for them, important risk for them.","And if you think about what insurance has been able to do in the context of that risk, we've roughly placed together, the entire industry about, call it $2 billion, a little over $2 billion in premium and, Adam, that's good, that's terrific but think about the $2 billion in premium in the context of $400 billion in client reported losses. And so for us, we've only tapped the surface and started really delivering on the needs of our clients. And if you ask yourself \u2013 and by the way in the context of that, as you described \u2013 appreciate you describing it, we have an awesome capability, the best in the industry, leading position, exceptional capability in the context of what insurance does.","What we've essentially said is we've got to do more for our clients. We've got to take the capability we've got and build on it, and the way you build on it, is not to bring more insurance expertise in, but bring more cyber expertise in and really help insurers and capital understand how to quantify and deal with cyber risk in a way in which you would actually open up more capital. So instead of $2 million in premium against $400 billion in reported losses. We could do much, much better than that. And Stroz Friedberg is simply the preeminent platform in the world in our view around how to do that. So this is a firm that's publicly reported, has covered and helped remediate, understand, identify and deal with some of the most sophisticated complex cyber challenges in the world today.","Imagine combining that capability with what we have from a capital and insurance side. That's going to open up just tremendous opportunities we believe to bring better solutions to our clients in a much more comprehensive way, which is why we're very excited to bring these assets together and I can tell you, we've had incredible client reaction. They see this logic immediately. They see the opportunity to take what is a very distributed risk in cyber because it attacks you from everywhere. They know it requires an integrated solution and this is now the first time they're going to get a chance to put some of those pieces together and this is really a role the risk manager can play to take a broader view across the organization to help their CIOs and CSOs do this in a more effective way. So, for us, this is terrific and for Stroz Friedberg, who are excited to be able to actually take the capability they deliver to clients every day and back that up with capital. So if you think about it, it really is a net-net new creation of opportunity for our clients and in doing so a net new for Aon.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thanks. And will that be reported in the Risk Solutions business?","Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc","Yes, it will.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. And then one more question on the HR BPO, how is the pipeline \u2013 I mean that business has been doing very well, grown nicely, how is the pipeline going into 2017 and are you doing any work on the financial side of the house?","Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc","First of all, it's going exceptionally well. Again, the business colleagues have done a terrific job in really building out and driving it, I think we're describing it as (31:22) the work we do on the HR, implementations in the cloud and we are the leader in that, biggest in Workday in the US, biggest in the UK, reinforced by capability we brought into the firm. And then as you described, even a bigger opportunity is what's going on in the finance side. And Aon in particular is leading the pack on that as well, not just in implementation, but we're doing it for us as well. So just like everything else we've done on behalf of our clients is something Aon participates in. So we're very excited about the possibilities for our clients in this category and the pipeline is exceptionally strong.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC","And just on that, is there any seasonality to that when the revenue hits from that business?","Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc","Not really. It comes in over time. Again, it's driven by client need.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Quentin McMillan from KBW. Your line is open.","Quentin McMillan - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Good morning. Thanks very much, guys. Christa, I wanted to touch on a free cash flow comment that you made in your prepared remarks. You said you have a further opportunity to increase free cash flow by over $500 million from working capital from procurement and from accounts payable.","So you guys increased by about $100 million on both receivables and accounts payable in this quarter, which is obviously pretty strong numbers. Just wondering, that $500 million, maybe what's the runway, how long will that take? And in addition you also talked about lower cash tax payments, do you believe that there is opportunity to go below the 19% and maybe where can that go over time?","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","Sure. So, Quentin, I think, on the first question on working capital, what we would say is, we really think about it as days sales outstanding, so the days it takes to collect cash from clients and days payables, which is the days that it takes \u2013 we collect cash or we pay suppliers.","And right now we are \u2013 we run negative working capital and we believe for a professional services firm that being working capital neutral is the right goal. And in fact, in some of our leading countries we're actually working capital positive. So we certainly see it's more than achievable. And so, to get from where we are today to working capital neutral is a little over $500 million in free cash flow. So we feel really good about the ability to collect a further $500 million of working capital.","It will take multiple years. It will take eight years to 10 years to get there because it's not some Big Bang effort. It's continued improvements in process, it's continued improvements in contract terms, a number of our contract terms are annual or multi-year agreements and so it will absolutely take a long period of time to get there. So I don't want to overplay the amount you're going to get in any one year.","So that's on the working capital. And then the other thing I think I would note is, as you look at our working capital you can see the improvements in receivables. If you divide receivables by revenue, trailing 12 months, from Q3 last 12 months, you can see we actually improved DSO on an externally reported basis by two days. And so we continue to make progress. And I'll tell you that on BPO, we improved by four days. You can't see that externally, but we are continuing to make improvements on both fronts.","And then in terms of the opportunity on the tax side, what I would say is we really feel good about the sustainability of our 19% effective tax rate. We do run a global capital pool. We do see statutory rates around the world declining, particularly in the U.K. And we have a growing business in emerging markets, which happen to have lower tax rates. And so we feel really good, therefore, about the sustainability of the 19% and, therefore, opportunity to have improvements in cash taxes, as cash taxes catch up to the lower effective tax rate.","Quentin McMillan - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Great. Thank you so much. And then just one follow-up question. Moving back to HR BPO, can you help us just understand what the size of that business is, where the margins are currently and what the kind of cloud-based solutions implementation could do for margins over whether it be 2017 or even over the next few years?","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","Sure. So it's about a $500 million business today, and we feel really good about the progress in cloud. If you rewound five years, we had 30-plus clients who had on-premises BPO. And today it's in the mid-teens with every one of those clients moving from on premises to cloud with us.","And so it is a fantastic value proposition for clients to do this. On average, clients are saving 30% of costs in moving to the cloud. And they get a much more effective solution, and so we do see the majority of our clients moving that way. And we expect that to continue.","In terms of the margin profile of the business, today, it is a low-single-digit margin business. And it's moving to a mid-teens margin business over time. And so we do see that opportunity, primarily driven by that cloud growth, which is enormous. And as Greg described, I really just described the cloud opportunity in HR. And there is a cloud opportunity, which we're increasingly seeing as very happy HR customers actually want to move to cloud financials as well, to actually bring together and get the same value proposition they got in HR in financials.","Quentin McMillan - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Great. Thanks very much, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you and good morning. Christa, I just want to clarify one number. You mentioned like you did $500 million of merger amortization year-to-date. But in the cash flow for the first nine months is about $200 million. I just wonder if that number or figure is correct or is that including the fourth quarter's acquisitions as well?","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","It's including Stroz Friedberg.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And how material is Stroz to \u2013 in terms of revenue as well as margin for 2017?","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","Yeah, we haven't given that number. What I can say is that we will report about $6 million of deal cost related to that cyber acquisition in Q4.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you. Okay great. And then stepping back, if you look at margin, relatively stable year-over-year, but the revenue growth is pretty strong. I just wonder, is that you investing more in the business, that could held back a little bit about the margin expansion, or do you think it's just one quarter thing and you will continue to see meaningful margin expansion if the growth rate remains strong?","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","Yeah. So, I would say, Q3 was exactly in line with our expectations. We did guide essentially to flat and if you look at year-to-date, we've got margin expansion and we're heading into our strongest quarter of the year, Q4, which we feel really good about, therefore, we're on track for substantial margin expansion in the full year.","Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc","I would encourage you, as you think about Q3, it was always our weakest quarter. We think about this from an annual standpoint; I think Christa captures it very well. We're on track in 2016, exactly where we had hoped to be.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. That's great. Lastly, on Brexit and what's the impact you have seen when talking with your clients in both the London market as well as your consulting side. Is there any sign of slowing down or temporary slowing down of management consulting projects?","Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc","I would say, Kai, in many respects the uncertainty around Brexit for us as an advisor to clients on risk, retirement and health, has actually increased in terms of helping them understand that, deal with that set of uncertainties and we think that's going to persist for a period of time. So, for us, we're helping clients actually sort through a very complicated situation and that will continue for the foreseeable future.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","What about London market?","Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc","Same in the London market. I'm really describing the global mindset. What I just described could be doubled or tripled in the London market because that's actually where the intensity is greatest. Clients are thinking for example, if I've got retirement plans that cut across the Continent, how do I deal with those? If I've got health plans that cut across, how do you deal with those? And then on the risk side, how do you manage complexity across markets that are going to change and emerge a bit. So, for us, it's an opportunity to advise clients and advise markets on how to think about this overall. So net-net, when we think about the impact to places like Lloyd's, a very important market in the world, we continue to see them be very strong. We continue to see them work to adapt to what the new world will be, and there is lots of levers they can pull to adapt and do that.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you so much for all the answers.","Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Charles Sebaski from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yeah, good afternoon. Thank you. Just a follow-up on the M&A that you guys have done so far. I guess I'm just trying to rectify the transactions with the, I guess, dispositions being greater than, just the negative revenue reported in the acquisition\/disposition. Would we expect that to go positive relative to these deals next year or why these \u2013 are there more dispositions to come that offset the acquisitions...?","Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc","Just to set the framework, Charles, so to think back to commentary we've had on these calls for literally going back almost 10 years. Everything we do is built off a foundation that Christa has set up and applied across the firm around return on invested capital. And what are the ways we can actually apply capital in a way to serve our clients most effectively. And you've seen us do that over the years.","And if you step back over the last 10 years, we've deployed probably, call it, $15 billion in capital of which, call it, roughly half, a little more than that, buyback, roughly half is on some acquisitions. So net-net, this is obviously a very positive story and will continue to be a very positive story for us.","Within that context you'll see us continuously try to look for ways to optimize return on invested capital on behalf of clients, strengthen the firm, double down in areas that we can grow and build capability in the areas of risk, retirement, health, talent, et cetera, communications.","So you see us doing that. That will drive everything we do, it's also why in that context you hear Christa describe and I describe, the team describe, buyback sets the benchmark for that. And then against that, we make acquisitions that are accretive against that benchmark. And that really has been the formulation and foundation of exactly everything we've done and we'll continue do that. And we're less worried about kind of, a quarter plus or minus or a year plus or minus, we're worried about and focused on, in fact, maniacally focused on how we build this for Aon over time.","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","And the other thing I'd say, Charles, is the disposition costs do go away in Q1, 2017 because you've then lapped the significant dispositions. Obviously, you've got lost operating income, you've got stranded costs like half floor of real estate or half a server leftover.","And I think just to dimensionalize the impact of disposition year-to-date, we've lost $141 million of revenue, we've lost $10 million of PTI (42:16), so that gives you a sense of year-to-date impact. But we will lap that in Q1 next year. And then, obviously, as Greg described, we are actually acquiring great talent and capability on the M&A side. And you'll see that continue to grow.","Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. On the margin side for Risk, you talked about in the quarter that there was an 80 bp benefit from foreign currency translation. I'm curious if you could let us know what is that on a nine month basis. The 23.4% adjusted margin for Risk, what's the embedded FX benefit in that number?","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","Hang on. Just trying to find that number for you.","Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","And I guess...","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","20 basis points \u2013 50 basis points, sorry.","Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc","But for the year overall, when you think about FX and the impact on our business, as we think about FX overall \u2013 again, we reflect back in terms of less about the quarter and less about the nine months \u2013 I think, it's got a marginal impact on margins overall for the year in terms of where we are across the board. We use that number.","Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. And I guess this is just a general thought on 2017, I guess, my question is, a good problem to have \u2013 and not maybe a problem \u2013 but at record retention and record new business in Risk, does that set up a comparable challenge in 2017 for organic growth? Knowing that if you're at 94% retentions and your ceiling is at 100%, does it just create \u2013 an excellent result, makes a tough year-over-year comp going into next year or you just don't \u2013 the things that are transpiring don't set up like that?","Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc","We don't see it that way, Charles, as you might expect. In fact, in many respects, what we've done is invest very, very heavily to increase operating leverage in the business, make the acquisitions Christa described to strengthen our position.","It frankly gives us the ability to create net new demand on behalf of clients and substantially increase growth trajectory. You've actually seen it, if you think about our performance in the third quarter. What this is a reflection of is certainly not the insurance environment. It's really a reflection of our ability to create net new demand and help clients succeed.","So if you think about it, our view is \u2013 think about some the three or four areas that we look to, to grow, obviously, there is all the traditional areas around property, casualty, D&O. And we've made this multi-year investment to increase operating leverage in something called Aon Client Promise.","This is not just talk. This is very real mechanics on how we interact and support clients every day. That's what's resulted in record new retention. That's resulted in record new business. So I emphasize record new business. And yet we're still relatively small when you think about the opportunity to build market share globally.","So we've got a capability to build market share and compete globally in a way that we think is actually quite extraordinary, and that's called a tradition. In addition to that, we have capabilities into areas outside the core that we're investing heavily in. Call it, a couple of examples, in Affinity and Health and Benefits, these are two areas reported up through our Risk business that are $1 billion-plus businesses growing well above mid-single-digit with opportunities for margin expansion. So this is now a second full category completely outside anything that we've just described.","And then, finally, very exciting for us is we've made substantial investments in data and analytics. We believe more than anyone else and you see that coming out \u2013 a manifestation of real things about clients, I mean, Aon Client Treaty is simply the single biggest transaction in the history Lloyd's. We've got thousands of clients now taking advantage of that. It's incredibly impactful for them. Aon Inpoint, 45 plus carriers onboard work with that. Aon Review, what we did in U.S. mortgage, we literally are creating a $10 billion business out of \u2013 just net new. So in many respects, Charles, we would describe what we have come to as a set of opportunities to accelerate our ability to grow in the current environment, irrespective of what happens over in the insurance environment. So, for us, we're excited about the progress and we have real confidence that 2017, 2018 will bring more opportunity.","And the final thing I would say about it is this idea of operating leverage. We're not just putting on net new revenue. This is revenue that we believe has operational leverage, different than the revenue we put on three years or four years ago. And how we've actually brought it on board, which means we've got margin opportunities which are substantial.","Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you very much for all the color.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question is from Mr. Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes, thank you very much for fitting me in. I just wanted to go through the 270 basis point items in the HR Solutions I guess, one is, you're closing some offices and you're shutting down a server. Is that a reserve set up for the full cost or did you spend all that in the third quarter and, two, can we expect there are other items like this as you, for the long-term plan for higher margins, are there more of these restructuring type items to come?","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","Yes, so, on the IT cost, this was related to a legacy IT contact. It was a one-time expense and it will not be repeated. And then the other $7 million item is really related to dispositions and it's really the stranded costs that remain in that business. As I described, half a floor or half sever and we're continuing to reduce those costs over time.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And that's the point, are there other initiatives that might come up that are similar to this over the foreseeable future that have a long-term margin expanding goal but short-term might be a headwind?","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","Yes, I mean, I guess I would say absolutely, Josh, because as we think about return on capital for the firm, are we going to make investments that we think drive higher return longer-term, you bet, we are. I mean, you saw that in M&A, in the cyber example Greg described. You see it organically in the kinds of things we're investing in in Health and Benefits and Affinity. And so you will continue to see that occur where we see the return on capital being substantially attractive for Aon.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And then on Chuck's question, obviously the fourth quarter is the strongest quarter. He was talking about the favorable tailwind from currency translation. Given the higher revenue base for the quarter, is that going to be \u2013 should we think about, 80 basis points is a significant amount. You amortize that over a larger revenue base. It's a big, big benefit to the quarter, or is 80 basis points really just a unique thing for 3Q?","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","Yeah. I wouldn't over rotate on the 80 basis points. I would say, most of the countries in which we operate we have local revenue and local expense and you're translating back to U.S. dollars. And the U.S. dollar has been strong. And so I think what you saw in Q3 was an unusual situation with the pound. And so I just \u2013 I would not over rotate on the 80 basis point number.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much.","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over back to Greg Case for closing remarks.","Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc","Thanks very much. And appreciate everybody being on the call today. Thanks very much.","Operator","That concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."],"1822":["Aon (NYSE:AON) Q2 2012 Earnings Call July 27, 2012  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Gregory C.

Welcome to Aon plc's Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would also like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded, and that it is important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our second quarter results, as well as having been posted on our website.","Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. Greg Case, President and CEO of Aon plc. Thank you, sir. You may begin.","Gregory C. Case","Thank you, Emily, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter conference call. Joining me here today is our CFO, Christa Davies.","Consistent with previous quarters, I'd like to cover 3 areas before turning the call over to Christa for further financial review. I would note that there are slides available on our website for you to follow along with our commentary today.","First, our performance against key metrics we communicated to shareholders; second, I'll cover overall organic growth performance; and third is continued areas of investment across Aon.","On the first topic, our performance versus key metrics. Each quarter, we measure our performance against the 3 metrics we focus on achieving over the course of the year: grow organically, expand margins and increase earnings per share.","Turning to Slide 3. In the second quarter, organic revenue growth was 4% overall with solid growth across all major businesses in both Risk and HR Solutions. Operating margin decreased 100 basis points, driven primarily by significant investments we are making in new growth opportunities and in key talent across our businesses. Finally, EPS was $1.02 as growth and effective capital management primarily offset incremental investment spend.","Overall, our second quarter results reflect improved organic revenue growth across all of our major businesses as we make significant investments to further strengthen our client-serving capabilities. Our results were also very consistent with the plants we laid out in Q1 for the full year 2012, recognizing that Risk Solutions was a bit better than anticipated and HR Solutions was a bit lighter than anticipated due to higher investment spend and the timing of certain deferred costs.","While Christa will provide additional financial commentary in a few minutes, we continue to anticipate improved performance in the second half of the year are on track with our long-term targets and have continued to take significant steps to further position the firm for long-term growth, strong free cash flow generation and increased financial flexibility.","Turning to Slide 4, on the second topic of growth. I want to spend the next few minutes discussing the quarter for both of our segments. In Risk Solutions, overall organic revenue growth was 4% with growth across every major business. As market-related conditions continue to stabilize, we're driving a set of initiatives that are strengthening underlying performance and positioning our Risk Solutions segments for long-term growth and leverage to an improving economy with management of our renewal book through Client Promise and retention rates of 90% or better on average, highlighting strong client satisfaction.","New business generation of approximately $250 million across our Retail business with strong growth across many markets, including China, New Zealand, Benelux, France, U.S. Retail, Latin America and Affinity, just to name a few, highlighting the strength of our global client-serving capability; investments in new products and service capabilities with the rollout of GRIP and Aon Broking globally; and in our core treaty reinsurance business, net new business trends have now been positive for 5 consecutive quarters.","Reflecting on the individual businesses. In the Americas, organic revenue growth improved to 4% compared to 2% in the prior year quarter. Exposures were relatively stable and the impact from pricing was modestly positive, reflecting a continued modest pace of improvement from a year ago. We saw solid management of the renewal book portfolio in U.S. Retail and Affinity, strengthened by the continued rollout of Client Promise. We also saw solid new business growth in Latin America.","Overall, results reflect strong performance, overcoming continued market weakness in certain areas such as the commercial construction sector.","In International, organic revenue growth was 3% against pricing which was flat on average overall with firmer pricing in cat-exposed regions. We saw strong growth in New Zealand, across many regions in Asia and the emerging markets including double-digit growth in many areas such as China, Thailand, Hong Kong and New Zealand. In the U.K. and Continental Europe, macroeconomic conditions remain fragile across many core markets. However, with leadership positions across the U.K. and Europe, we saw strong retention rates and management of our renewal book portfolio would deliver modest growth overall, a solid performance given economic headwinds.","In Reinsurance, organic revenue growth improved to 7% compared to a decline of 2% in the prior year quarter, a level of organic revenue performance not achieved since Q3 2006. Results primarily reflect strong new business growth in global treaty placements, a modest portion of which is nonrecurring revenue. The impact to the market from pricing was favorable in the near term, primarily due to property cat-exposed regions. The underlying strength of the book continues to improve as net new business won was positive for the fifth consecutive quarter. This level of performance and strength in new business generation continues to reflect Aon Benfield's value proposition for clients of strengthening their operational performance and reducing volatility through unmatched data, analytics and advisory capability.","Turning to HR Solutions. Overall organic revenue growth improved to 4% compared to flat in the prior year quarter. We saw the rate of organic growth improve across both businesses despite weak discretionary spend globally and continued economic pressure in Continental Europe. Performance also reflects growth in areas where we're making significant investments in the business in areas such as HR BPO, investment consulting and pension risk management consulting. These investments reflect Aon Hewitt's understanding of market trends and the long-term issues that face our clients as health care reform, health care costs and the associated financial risks continue to rise unchecked at a time when overall health and wellness is not improving. Multinational clients are increasingly looking for global benefit solutions that support their global organizations delivered at a local level, managing and transferring risk against pension plans that are increasingly frozen and largely underfunded. And finally, after working through the worst economic recession in the last 7 years, clients are just beginning to renew their focus on talent, retention, development and engagement to prepare themselves for renewed long-term growth.","Turning to the individual businesses. In Outsourcing, organic revenue growth improved to 6% compared to flat in the prior year quarter. We saw a strong growth in HR BPO from both new client wins and in discretionary products and services such as dependent eligibility audits. Results were partially offset by a decline in benefits administration as anticipated price compression and lower project-related revenue were greater than net client wins.","In Consulting Services, organic revenue growth was 3% compared to 1% in the prior year quarter. Results reflect increased demand for surveys and services in our Compensation Consulting Group; strong growth across our business in Asia, primarily for talent rewards; and strong demand for delegated pension risk management and investment consulting services. Results were partially offset by a decline in discretionary demand for actuarial services in core Retirement Consulting in Europe.","Overall, in HR Solutions, we delivered solid organic revenue performance in the second quarter and are fully on track with previous expectations of delivering improved growth in both businesses in 2012.","Our priorities for 2012 remains focused on driving growth, delivering improved profitability from our strategic investments and improving the growth profile in our core benefits administration and Retirement Consulting businesses.","Slide 5 highlights the third topic, further areas of investment. We believe Aon is in a unique position. Solid long-term operating performance, combined with expense discipline and strong free cash flow, continues to enable substantial investment in colleagues and capabilities around the globe.","A few examples include, in Risk Solutions: We're investing in client leadership to drive greater productivity and efficiency with the rollout of the Revenue Engine internationally, as well as the rollout of Client Promise, which is driving greater client retention and rollover rates across our client base.","We continue to invest in innovative technology such as GRIP, which is the world's leading global repository of risk and insurance placement information. We now have 1.5 million trades, more than $76 billion of bound premium and a growing client list of 25 insurance carriers utilizing the platform's analytics and service capabilities.","We're driving our Aon Broking initiative to better match client needs with insurer appetite for risk, as highlighted by our ability to package similar risks and place substantial programs and facilities into the market on behalf of clients.","Effective January 1, we aligned our global health and benefits platform to better capitalize on our global distribution channel and deep Brokerage capabilities.","Finally, we're expanding our footprint through tuck-in acquisitions that either increase scale in emerging markets or expand capability to better serve clients, as well as adding key talent across Asia in specialty sectors and in our GRIP services business.","In summary, as we've previously noted, we have proved the concept of these major investments in 2011. And as we move across 2012 and 2013, we're fully on track to drive greater scale and increase operating leverage.","In HR Solutions, we're making significant investments to strengthen our industry-leading position in health care exchanges. Health care exchanges enable clients to begin the shift of their participants to a market-based defined contribution model for health care while addressing unsustainable health care cost increases and decreasing population health. As early as the fourth quarter, we plan to launch our first multi-carrier health exchange for active employees.","We're expanding our Outsourcing offerings in high-growth areas such as dependent eligibility audits. We continue to expand our industry-leading benefits administration solutions and technology from large market to middle market.","And we're developing new delegated solutions in investment consulting and pension risk management that leverage our total capabilities across advisory and delivery services.","And finally, we're strengthening our international footprint to support a more global workforce with investments in key talent and capabilities across Asia and emerging markets.","In summary, we delivered improved organic revenue growth across all of our major businesses in both Risk and HR Solutions, made significant strategic investments that will drive greater long-term growth and took important steps to strengthen our global firm.","With that context, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Christa for further financial review.","Christa Davies","Thanks very much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg noted, our second quarter results reflect solid organic revenue growth and significant steps to strengthen our global firm. Our results, overall, are also in line with previous expectations provided in the first quarter.","As our progress have measured over the course of the year, we continue to drive a set of initiatives to improve operating performance, deliver savings from our formal restructuring programs, generate strong free cash flow and effectively allocate capital as highlighted by the repurchase of 250 million of ordinary shares in the second quarter.","Now let me turn to the financial results as highlighted on Page 6 of the presentation. Our core EPS performance, excluding certain items, was $1.02 per share for the second quarter compared to $1.03 in the prior year quarter. Solid organic growth and effective capital management in the quarter was offset primarily by strategic investments to deliver increased long-term growth.","Certain items that were adjusted for in the core EPS performance and highlighted in the schedules on Page 12 of the press release include noncash intangible asset amortization, restructuring charges and $14 million of re-domicile costs, primarily for legal and advisory fees with a completed re-domicile on April 2.","In addition, foreign currency translation had an unfavorable impact of $0.03 per share. If currency were to remain stable at today's rates, we would expect a modest unfavorable translation impact to EPS in both the third and fourth quarter of 2012.","Now let me talk about each of the segments on the next slide. In our Risk Solutions segment, organic revenue growth was 4%, operating margin increased 80 basis points to 21.9% and operating income increased 3% versus the prior year quarter. Included in operating income was a $17 million impact related to both unfavorable foreign currency translation and a decline in investment income from lower short-term interest rates globally.","Solid organic revenue growth, restructuring savings and lower lease termination costs contributed to operating margin and operating income growth in the quarter, absorbing the significant investments we're making in our GRIP platform and in key talent across Asia and Latin America.","Let me spend a moment on the formal restructuring programs, key initiatives that have enabled concurrent funding investments and long-term structural margin expansion.","With respect to the Aon Benfield program, savings in the second quarter are estimated at $36 million compared to $30 million in the prior year quarter. The Aon Benfield program is expected to deliver cumulative expense savings of $146 million in 2012 compared to cumulative savings of $122 million in 2011.","Further, associated with the transfer of the Health and Benefits business at January 1, an estimated $46 million of restructuring savings under the Aon Hewitt program will be achieved in Risk Solutions. Approximately $26 million of the $46 million in cumulative savings have been achieved under the program, including an estimated $8 million of incremental savings in the second quarter. A breakout of restructuring charges incurred in Risk Solutions associated with the Aon Hewitt program is detailed in the schedule on Page 13 of the press release.","For the second half of 2012, operating margin is -- sorry, for the first half of 2012, operating margin is up 30 basis points and operating income is up 2%. For the second half of the year, operating income and margin are expected to be up. This is driven by operating income and margin down for the third quarter, driven by lower investment income, continued investment spend and normal seasonal weakness while the fourth quarter is expected to be up significantly, driven by less investment spend and normal seasonal strength. Therefore, Risk Solutions operating income and margin will be up for the first half, up for the second half and up for the full year as we discussed in the first quarter.","Turning to the HR Solutions segment. Organic revenue growth was 4%. Operating margin decreased 440 basis points to 15.4%. And operating income decreased 20% compared to the prior year quarter. Included was a $2 million or 20 basis point unfavorable impact from FX. Organic revenue growth of 4% and $15 million of incremental restructuring savings were more than offset by a $23 million or minus 250 basis point impact from significant investments in long-term growth initiatives, an unfavorable revenue mix as benefits administration and Retirement Consulting declined modestly, and a $9 million impact from deferred costs in Outsourcing related to the timing of large client implementations.","With respect to the Aon Hewitt restructuring program, we incurred $11 million of charges in the quarter. Cumulative savings related to the formal restructuring program in the second quarter are estimated at $57 million compared to $34 million in the prior year quarter, of which approximately $8 million of the incremental savings were achieved in the Risk segment.","As we discussed in the first quarter, we provided specific comments regarding the outlook for HR Solutions in 2012: number one, we expect improved organic growth in both businesses for 2012; number two, we would invest approximately $35 million in new growth opportunities, primarily in our health care exchanges, HR BPO, investment consulting and pension risk management; number three, approximately 75% of the restructuring savings would be realized in adjusted operating income; number four, expected performance would improve in the second half of the year as investment spend decreases in the second half from the first half.","As we think about operating margin and income for the second half of the year, we now expect the third quarter to be relatively flat year-over-year compared to our previous expectation of down. And we expect the fourth quarter to be modestly up year-over-year compared to the previous expectations of flat in the fourth quarter.","Our improved outlook for the second half reflects continued growth, low investment spend, less deferred project costs and additional synergy savings as we strengthen our industry-leading HR Solutions business for long-term operational excellence in 2013 and beyond.","Turning to the next slide on our long-term operating margin targets. We continue to drive a set of initiatives to improve operating performance on an annual basis. While we've improved operating margins 500 basis points over the last 6 years, our long-term operating margin target of 26% for Risk Solutions reflects significant opportunity for further margin improvement in the following 5 ways: Number one, deliver $33 million of remaining restructuring savings and other operational improvements. Number two, continued rollout of the revenue engine internationally. Number three, Aon Broking and GRIP-related initiatives. These 3 are fully within our control. In addition, there are 2 additional macro drivers that provide significant operating leverage based on improvements in the external market. Number four, increases in short-term interest rates. Number five, industry improvements, driving higher insured values or insurance pricing.","Similarly, for HR Solutions, while we've improved operating margins nearly 1,200 basis points over the last 6 years, our long-term operating margin target of 22% reflects significant opportunity for further margin improvement in the following 3 ways: number one, deliver $76 million of remaining restructuring savings after the transfer of savings to health and benefits; number two, growth in the core business and return on incremental investments; number three, improvement in the HR BPO business.","Now let me discuss a few of the line items outside of the operating segments on the next slide. Unallocated expenses increased $1 million to $34 million, excluding re-domicile costs. Interest income decreased $2 million due to lower average interest rates and lower average cash balances. Interest expense decreased $6 million due primarily to a decline in the average rate on total debt outstanding. Other income of $12 million included a gain due to the favorable impact of exchange rates on remeasurement of assets and liabilities in nonfunctional currencies, partially offset by losses on certain company-owned life insurance plans and long-term investments. Going forward, we expect a run rate of approximately $1 million to $3 million per quarter of interest income, $35 million of unallocated expense and $60 million of interest expense per quarter.","Turning to taxes. The effective tax rate on net income from continuing operations increased to 27.5% in the second quarter compared to 24.7% in the prior year quarter. The effective tax rate in the second quarter of 2011 was favorably impacted by the resolution of an income tax audit and certain deferred tax adjustments. The company continues to anticipate an effective tax rate on net income from continuing operations of approximately 28% in 2012.","Lastly, average diluted shares outstanding decreased to 335.6 million in the second quarter compared to 342.7 million in the prior year quarter, due primarily to the company share repurchase program. The company repurchased 5.3 million ordinary shares for approximately $250 million in the second quarter. Actual shares outstanding on June 30 were 322.4 million, and there are approximately 11 million dilutive equivalents.","As part of a change in corporate domicile, Aon plc's Board of Directors authorized a $5 billion share repurchase program on April 19, 2012, that replaced the previously authorized share repurchase program by Aon Corporation's Board of Directors in January 2010. The company has approximately $4.75 billion of remaining authorization.","Now let me turn to the next slide to highlight our strong balance sheet and cash flow. At June 30, cash and short-term investments were $802 million. And total debt outstanding was $4.5 billion. Overall debt-to-capital was 35.5% at June 30 compared to 35.7% at December 31. Cash flow from operations increased 8% to $284 million compared to $264 million in the prior year quarter.","Despite a high organic growth rate, low working capital requirements more than offset an increase in cash taxes and cash contributions to the major pension plans in the quarter. Furthermore, we continue to operate with elevated levels of invoicing and cash collections, approximately $375 million related to a temporary delay in invoicing at Aon Hewitt, which began in the second half of 2011 with the conversion of certain orders to cash systems. We continue to make progress and expect this temporary increase to return to normalized levels by the end of 2012.","Free cash flow, as defined by cash flow from operations less CapEx, increased 2% to $226 million compared to $221 million in the prior year quarter. The increase in free cash flow reflects an 8% increase in cash from operations, partially offset by a $15 million increase in CapEx.","Turning to the next slide to discuss our long-term financial flexibility. Regarding our underfunded pension plans, we've taken significant steps to reduce volatility and liability as we've closed plans new entrants, frozen plans from accruing additional benefits and continue to de-risk certain client assets.","In 2011, we contributed approximately $477 million to our plans and would expect to contribute approximately $541 million in 2012 before any discretionary contributions. Higher contributions primarily reflect a decline in discount rates. We would expect contributions to decline annually beginning in 2013 despite a decline in discount rates year-to-date, resulting in fully funded plans on a GAAP basis in 2016.","Regarding our restructuring plans. Cash payments were $178 million in 2011. As our restructuring plans continue to wind down, we would expect cash payments to decline $32 million to approximately $146 million in 2012 before declining further in 2013.","As we continue to grow, improve operating performance and our required uses of cash decline over the next several years, we expect our strong free cash flow to be a significant source of value creation to shareholders. As an important step in unlocking that value for shareholders, on April 2, the company completed its change in jurisdiction of incorporation from Delaware to the U.K. We believe the transaction will help drive shareholder value through: number one, providing greater global access to expected increases in future free cash flow number two, enable us to access roughly $300 million of excess capital held internationally on our balance sheet; and number three, increase future cash flows through a significant reduction in our global tax rate over the long term, similar to what we've done over the last 5 years which was approximately 500 basis points.","In summary, we are positioned for stronger growth in 2012, and we have significant leverage through an improving global economy. While we're investing to further strengthen our industry-leading portfolio, we are focused on 3 primary areas that will each contribute to substantially stronger free cash flow over the next several years: first is continuing growth and operating margin improvement towards our long-term targets; second, declining uses of cash for pensions and restructuring; third, greater capital flexibility and increased cash flow from a lower effective tax rate resulting from our re-domicile to the U.K. Combined with a strong balance sheet and greater financial flexibility, we have positioned the firm to effectively manage capital through the announced $5 billion share repurchase program and the recent increase in our annual dividend, highlighting our firm belief in the underlying value of Aon.","With that, I'd like to hand the call back to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Dan Farrell from Sterne Agee.","Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Just on the guidance on the Consulting margin. I mean you've laid out the case for how it improves through this year and next, but the guidance on the margin is clearly better than it was previously. Can you give a little more detail on what changed in the outlook if it's revenue driven or if there's less investment than you previously thought you had and maybe put more in this quarter? And then I just have a follow-up.","Christa Davies","Yes, and that's absolutely right, Dan. The guidance for HR Solutions margin in the second half of 2012 is improved from our previous guidance. So previously, we said we were down in Q3 and now we think we'll be flat year-over-year in Q3. And previously, we said we'd be flat in Q4, now we think we'd be up modestly in Q4. The 2 things really driving -- there are 3 things really driving that difference: one is less investment spend; two is less deferred costs; and three is improved restructuring savings. So they're sort of the 3 things that are just leading to that improvement from previous guidance.","Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Can you talk a little bit more about the level of ramp in revenue that we could see from these investments? Because obviously that's a key driver to getting these businesses ultimately to a normalized margin. And then, can you talk a little bit about how long you think it takes to get to that level where these are operating at a normal margin?","Christa Davies","Yes, so one of the things we would point out is that as we look at organic revenue growth in the HR Solutions segment in the first half of the year, it's the highest it's been in several years. So we are starting to see growth from these investments already. What I would observe as you look at the margin impact is, as these investments sort of ramp, you're getting revenue growth, which is slightly lower margin until the investments truly scale. And so as the revenue growth continues to come through and the investments scale, you'll see that become higher-margin revenue growth, if that makes sense.","Gregory C. Case","And I would just say, Dan, to add to that, is the one investment we have called out over the last couple of quarters is that on the health care exchanges, which we're very positive about. We feel like we've made a great progress in the context of that. As that comes online, it's going to take the next 2 to 3 years before you really start to see the full impact of what that can bring to us both on the retirement side and on the employee side. We're hopeful, by the way, in the fourth quarter we're going to be able to launch the first employee exchange to go with what we do on the retirement side. But it's going to take 2 to 3 years to really get those fully ramped up.","Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","In this quarter, how much of the $23 million is the health care exchanges? And correct me if I'm wrong, but there's 0 revenue right now on those investments, correct?","Christa Davies","It's limited. So the majority of the investments is health care exchange.","Gregory C. Case","But we are generating revenue on the retirement exchange. It's modest, but it is -- we do have clients. It's up and running. It's working very well and progressing just as we had hoped it would.","Operator","Our next question comes from Keith Walsh from Citi.","Keith F. Walsh - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","First question, just on the Brokerage margins. If we adjust for the lease termination costs in 2Q '11, it seems margins were flattish, that we had 4% revenue growth. Can you just talk to -- is there an implied 4% expense run rate in the business going forward? And I've got a couple of follow-ups.","Christa Davies","Yes. So Keith, I think one of the things we really highlighted on Risk Solutions margin for the first half of the year, and we expect that to sort of to continue slightly into Q3, is we really are investing significantly in the GRIP platform and in talent in Latin America and Asia. And so what we're really seeing is that organic revenue growth is offsetting substantial investment spend. And what we did say in Risk Solutions is that margin's going to be up significantly in Q4 and therefore up for the full year. And so we're going to see a return on that significant investment in that GRIP platform and that talent within the year.","Gregory C. Case","So we talked about this quite substantially in the last call, Keith. From the standpoint of -- the investment, particularly on the GRIP rollout, is significant but it's also an investment unlike investment in -- classic investments in talent, which take a year or 2 to really come online. We see how the GRIP investment is going to actually pay back and that's why we have talked about improved margin in the year even with the investment we're making.","Keith F. Walsh - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, very helpful. And then a question on HR, a couple. Just want to clarify something on the guidance, I guess, for 2012. It seems like -- has anything changed for your view of 2012? It just seems like maybe the investment's been front loaded a little bit. But overall, do you view 2012 differently than you did what you told us last quarter?","Christa Davies","I think that's fair, Keith. I think that's exactly right.","Gregory C. Case","And we're just seeing positive momentum, it continues to develop and we're just trying to reflect that.","Keith F. Walsh - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. So no change there. And then just if you can just talk a little bit to the unfavor -- you mentioned, Christa, in your comments unfavorable revenue mix. Can you just help me understand that a little bit better. Is that more seasonality issue or is it a -- maybe some of the more profitable businesses of Hewitt declining since the deal has been done. Can you just talk to that a little bit?","Christa Davies","Yes, so what we would say is there is some unfavorable revenue mix in both benefits administration and in core Retirement Consulting as those high-margin businesses declined slightly. It's a very minor decline in revenue and we love the business and are continuing to invest in it long term.","Gregory C. Case","And we're just seeing really growth in some of the areas in HR BPO, in particular, in the exchanges which is just ramping up very, very well. And that really is the mix issue. We love this portfolio overall. We see lots of promise in terms of sort of where's it's going to go, in fact, more I would say even then when we actually brought on -- when we brought the 2 firms together, Keith. That's why we made -- we've made the investments and we're just seeing ramped -- we're seeing a greater ramp-up in some of the areas that are improving in margin a la our HR BPO and the exchanges, which are driving the revenue mix issues that Christa talked about.","Operator","Our next question comes from Adam Klauber from William Blair.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Growth in Risk Solutions Americas obviously picked up nicely. If you have to the rank order between price and new business and exposure, how would you rank the drivers of that growth?","Gregory C. Case","Really, I would say, it's really across the board. We actually saw -- we saw movement on the pricing side and it's -- it was modest. It was not substantial. But we saw new business growth that was good; I think $250 million, overall, in new business as Christa highlighted. What we really also saw is continued management on the existing book and retention increases, particularly around some of the rollout of Client Promise and as we rolled it out across Europe and the rest of the world, we think we're going to see like increases when we actually get Client Promise and place it to really drive movement and retention. And we saw stability in insured values. So there wasn't a significant increase there, but it wasn't a decrease or a headwind as we've seen before.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And the same topic, on Europe, it sounds like you're still holding in okay. Are you worried that, that still can get worse from where it is right now?","Gregory C. Case","Well, listen, I think our colleagues really across the world just done a terrific job sort of on the client leadership front and certainly across Europe. Everyone is struggling, everyone is sort of fighting these set of headwinds, but I would reflect we grew. We had positive organic growth. It was modest, but we had positive organic growth. And we're continuing to put in place, as we've done in the U.S., some proven approaches that we think will really continue to help drive retention of that book. But we've got some just very privileged positions and platforms across the European theater and that's actually served us quite well. And so we're certainly concerned as we reflect on the impact of our clients. But so far, we've held our own. We just want to highlight, obviously there's a lot of potential headwind there and we're fighting through it. But we grew in the quarter and we've grown in the first half, and we're going to work hard on that for the second half.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Great. And one final question, also on organic. Both Reinsurance and Outsourcing blipped up. How much of that for this quarter is sort of more transactional in each segment? And again, is that potential -- again a little variation because of transactional business in each of those segments?","Gregory C. Case","Yes, I would separate the 2. They're very -- they're quite different. When you think about our Reinsurance business, it's 85% treaty is our overall business. And that's really the -- fundamentally, it was really new business generation that drove the bulk of that revenue growth. Two to 3 points was probably kind of onetime sorts of things, some price impact and some of the things that sort of drove that. But even if you took the 2 to 3 points out, it's actually a very substantial increase and really just a reflection of the great work that's being done on the Reinsurance side, really reflecting tremendous progress, new business wins that have really driven that business. So just really another quarter of progression for our reinsurance colleagues. Then on the Outsourcing side, really is -- remember, these are long-term contracts, multiyear contracts, and it just reflects wins on those contracts as those come online in the building of that business. And as Christa described before, the context of that, these are margin business, our businesses we're building margin on over time. And so that's why we had the revenue mix that Christa described, but just really -- they're just classic wins here. There's also about 10% of that, which is project revenue, which we've talked about before, we've been under pressure on and continue to face some headwinds on.","Operator","Our next question comes from Meyer Shields from Stifel, Nicolaus.","Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I guess one big picture question and then a small one. Christa, you talked about being -- or really positioning the company to be more leveraged to an economic recovery. Would you have done anything differently over the past couple of years if you expected, let's say, 2 or 3 years of global economic weakness?","Christa Davies","Would I expect anything different? I mean, I think the big areas of upside, Meyer, really, are global interest rates. So 100 basis point increase in global interest rates has a sort of $35 million to $40 million impact on top line and bottom line. And I would observe on that dimension that interest rates did decline during Q2 and so we're seeing sort of weakness there. As we look at other areas of the global economy, as Greg said, exposures globally are roughly stable as we think about the underlying drivers of that, which are really corporate revenues, employment levels and asset values that's essentially stable. But look, the other key driver is inflation and we would say that if interest rates, underlying drivers of GDP or inflation were to improve, then we have a substantial leverage to all 3 of those.","Gregory C. Case","Yes, and there's -- Meyer, one of the -- I think you asked if we had done anything differently, as well if we'd anticipated it. And for us, remember, we build our game plan not anticipating substantial rate movement. We built our game plan not anticipating economic return. And we built our game plan to grow our business and to drive cash flow, which is really sort of the engine, which sort of -- which really what we believe is just continuing to build and well over time. And so for us, that game plan has been put together not anticipating a change in some of the headwinds. And so in many respects, the plan we've had in place will be the game plan we're going to go forward with. If we happen to get some benefits, as Christa described, that would be fantastic. But it doesn't change anything structurally that we put in place.","Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's very helpful. Small question in HR Solutions. There's a $9 million increase in deferred costs. I was hoping you could explain what that is and how that plays out over the next few quarters?","Christa Davies","Yes, so it's really -- it's related to the timing of implementations on large outsourcing contracts and it has been a headwind in Q1 and Q2. We would expect that to reverse slightly in Q3 and Q4, hence, the improved guidance year-over-year in Q3 and Q4. It's literally just as we implement contracts and you have them go live, then you'd defer less of this expense.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Annizzi (sic) [Nannizzi] from Goldman Sachs.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes. So my question, I guess, is on Europe. I mean what are you assuming as a baseline for Europe in your revenue and margin guidance in just both segments, but in particular in the HR Solutions segment and just one follow-up.","Gregory C. Case","Well, as a baseline, we're assuming that's going to -- at this point, it's going to be flat overall in terms of sort of what's happened in the overall economy. It's obviously struggling and fragile. We're fighting against it. We've grown the business and we anticipate we're going to continue to do that, but it's going to be marginally positive going forward.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. So your baseline kind of the revenue guidance and margin guidance in HR Solutions is that you'll continue to grow not just outside of Europe, outside of the U.S. but also in Europe as well?","Gregory C. Case","Yes, that's what we've talked about, which is literally -- as we've said before, we got a set of game plans to add plans and add business to grow the business. We anticipate we're going to continue to do that. But we've highlighted that it's a struggle and it's a struggle for our clients, first and foremost, and a headwind for us. But we've been able to actually succeed against that and we anticipate doing it. But it's not going to be substantial at this point until things change.","Christa Davies","And the only other point I'd make is as you look at the seasonality of our business, Q1 is our strongest European quarter. And so while the second half of the year is certainly important, it's really Q1 next year that we'll be sort of focused on.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it, got you, great. And then one question on kind of capital generation, capital deployment. So you've deployed $250 million through the buyback this quarter. I mean, if you were -- is your expectation to deploy kind of what you're generating after the dividend, or should we think about deployment including more than that, given the additional cash that you have for the re-domicile or -- how should we think about where you plan to deploy from here?","Christa Davies","Yes, so the way we think about it, it's really as we generate free cash flow, we look at return on capital on a cash-on-cash basis to allocate any form of free cash flow. And we've said that we had approximately $100 million in Q1, $250 million in Q2 and we had really previously given guidance of $150 million per quarter with the potential of $300 million of additional purchases using excess capital from the balance sheet. Beyond that, it's not really in our best interest to provide specific guidance. And any uses of cash flow or excess capacity, including the $300 million of cash held internationally, will be evaluated and allocated based on the highest return on capital.","Operator","Our next question comes from Greg Locraft from Morgan Stanley.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just wanted to follow up on Europe. Could you just give us the percentage of total revs it is for each of the divisions? And then I guess you'd mentioned Q1 is the biggest for the HR business. So could you talk us through how big it is from a seasonality perspective? And really what I'm trying to get at, as others are as well, is sensitivity if things come in worse to the overall projections that you guys hope to achieve in the quarters and months and years ahead?","Christa Davies","Yes, so as we think about the business overall, about 15% of our overall revenue was Continental Europe. Risk is a little bit more; HR is a little bit less. As you think about patterning throughout the year, Q1's the biggest quarter. I mean I do sort of -- look, we're very sensitive to Europe, too. I would note and reinforce, as Greg described, we've grown in Europe in the first half of the year. We grew in Q2. We're very conservative in our future forecast, but it's not really the panic that everyone's currently worried about. We're certainly tracking it extremely carefully and we're managing what we observe is a fragile economy. But as Greg said, we have industry-leading positions in most large European countries and we're very proud of the performance that we're delivering.","Gregory C. Case","And remember, it's difficult to grow on these context, but clients need risk understanding. They need risk leadership. That absolutely can't go away. And in some respects, by the way, some of the issues in Europe actually magnify those issues and potentially create opportunities. And on the HR Solutions side, same token, everyone's got employees, everybody's got to work and support those employees and in times of need, sometimes those issues become even more acute. So we're by no means trying to say this is a positive. This a big headwind and a serious headwind for our clients. But we've got a lot of tools and a lot of approaches that we think serve us well in this context and we're going to keep applying those.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And just one follow-up on that. If we sort of go back to the financial crisis, '08 was a reasonable organic -- the world -- the financial markets came unglued in '08, but it wasn't really until '09 that you felt that in your organics in the HR business. How is this any different? Why is next year going to be a good year for Europe for HR Solutions given what we know today?","Gregory C. Case","Well, again, we've been careful to say -- we haven't said it's going to be a good year. We have essentially said we're going to continue to improve and build on our business. But I think you've highlighted something pretty profound. If you go back and look at 2008, as an example, and look at our business overall, as an example, and sort of our growth rates, even in the context of a very challenging 2008 and what's happened over time, the worst we did was negative 1% sort of across the board if you think about sort of our -- the robustness of our business in 2009. So against that backdrop, we held [ph] serve on growth. Our aspirations is to grow over time and we will do that. But just for background, that was the -- as you described, sort of, Greg, the worst of the worst. And from our standpoint, we think this is different in some ways and offer some opportunities that are a bit unique. I think I don't [ph] overstate it. This is going to be a challenge, continues to be a challenge. But as Christa described, we don't see this -- this is something we've, again, seen before and we're going to deal with and support our clients on it. We think AON will benefit from that.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Excellent. And one last one, just M&A. Just want to take your temperature on how you're feeling on that front. You were very explicit in cash plans, but I just wanted to ask what you're thinking now.","Gregory C. Case","Yes, if you just -- if you take Christa's foundation on the cash side, well, I think the clearest execution plan you can imagine, sort of M&As, from what Christa described, from our standpoint, we love the structure we've got. We've got -- the portfolio we have on HR Solutions and Risk Solutions that we like a lot. We'll always add to that from a standpoint of smaller tuck-in acquisitions and have historically spent $200 million to $300 million a year sort of in that context on things that truly add content and capability or geographic reach. That really is the extent of our M&A aspirations at this point. We love the platform we've got.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Meredith from UBS.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","A couple of quick questions here for you. The first one, on the Outsourcing business, I wonder if you could talk about -- is the growth you're seeing there from just underlying employee growth or is it some of the special projects that you had stopped seeing back in 2011 that all of a sudden starting to come through?","Gregory C. Case","Really, Brian, this is really new client wins and as we bring on those new client wins, particularly around HR BPO and on some of the comp consulting side, it really is -- that's really where you're seeing a reflection of. Just fundamental strength in the core part of the business. And we have not seen the discretionary spend pick up. So that 10% of the project spend, that's been a pressure -- we continue to see as a pressure where you're really seeing all this rollout of new clients.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, great. And then next question, on the health exchanges. Do you have any new clients and how many clients have you kind of signed on so far? And kind of what are the enrollments looking like?","Gregory C. Case","Well, again, remember there are 2 types of exchanges here. One is on the retirement side and we have an active exchange up and running, multiple clients in the context of that and many lies in the context sort of what we're doing in that. We're going to go through another roller period coming up, so that's an active exchange, which we're investing behind, which we're building on. And then we're very hopeful to actually launch what would be the first active employee exchange coming up in the fourth quarter of this year. And in many respects, we've got clients who are excited about that, markets who are excited about that and look forward to doing that, which means we would have 2 exchanges in place, a retirement exchange and an employee -- active employee exchange, both of which would be, as Christa described before, growth engines for us and opportunities to really build our business. So we're excited about both of them.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And then when should we potentially see that in the revenue numbers?","Gregory C. Case","Well, you're going to start to see -- you'll begin to see it meaningfully in the revenue numbers, as I said before, really into '13, but really in the '13 and '14. You'll start to see it really in the profit numbers a bit after that, I'd said 2 to 3 years, thus far. But that's kind of the overall profile.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then just overall on the pricing environment for property\/casualty insurance, your thoughts there, and what impact is that having on your revenue growth, organic revenue growth?","Gregory C. Case","Well, sort of back overall on pricing again. On the retail side, we draw [ph] directly and specifically from the Global Risk Insight Platform. As we said before, we see continued improvement just for numbers if it's helpful. Q2 -- go back to last year, Q2 '11, we were minus 3%. Q3, we were minus 2%. Q4, we were roughly flat. And in the first quarter, we're kind of plus 1%. That's roughly where we are now, give or take. So on the Retail side -- so it's positive. It's trended positive. You can start -- it seems like that's beginning to flatten out a bit in terms of where we are. And really, you're going to have to split that between new and renewal. We're looking at both overall here as that's where we capture [ph] GRIP. And then on the Reinsurance side, we also saw a positive -- marginal positive movement sort of in that and that's reflected in the numbers, as I've said before, kind of a couple of points as it related to our book. But if you look at the global reinsurance capital, it's a story you know well, Brian. We ended 2011 about $455 billion in capital, which was down 3% from 2010 from $470 billion. By the way, that absorbed over $100 billion worth of insured losses. But if you look at the first quarter of 2012, we're back up to $470 billion. So in terms of some overall pressure, there are still kind of back to almost unprecedented levels of capital in the overall business at this point in time. So for us, it's been positive. It's had an impact. But when you think about kind of where we are, you start to see that flatten out a little bit. So marginally positive to flattening out.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jay Gelb from Barclays.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I want to touch base on a couple of items: first, on the Reinsurance organic revenue growth. Do you expect that trend of improving organic revenue growth to continue in 3Q?","Gregory C. Case","Yes. When we said, Jay, overall -- first of all, we're just pleased with the progress overall, the fundamentals of the business around sort of wins, new wins, net new wins, and that's now been positive for 5 consecutive quarters, just as we expected it would be once sort of the overall set of adjustments are made when we brought the 2 firms together. The 7%, I said before, kind of had 200 to 300 basis points of pricing, which is leveling out some kind of onetime discretionary spends, which we think will probably go away. But so you back that out, you're kind of still at the 4% to 5% range and we see that kind of progress over the course of the year.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. On the -- Christa, can you update us on the progress in improving the effective tax rate with the corporate move?","Christa Davies","So Jay, we did say that the tax rate for the full year is going to remain 28%. We did observe that the tax rate in the quarter, 27.5%, and so we continue to see the tax rate being 28%. I would observe that's down 100 basis points from the 29% we had at the beginning of the year. And as we think about the move to the U.K., we have said that we expect a substantial reduction of global effective tax rate, approximately 500 basis points over the long term.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Right, okay. And then on the Risk Solutions where you just talked about the improving margins, I just wanted to confirm that, that also means improving adjusted operating profit?","Christa Davies","Yes, that's right.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. So can you help us -- so I guess that would mean improving revenue year-over-year as well?","Christa Davies","We definitely think organic revenue growth is going to be positive.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew Heimermann from JPMorgan.","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So a couple -- first, numbers questions. Just the $23 million of incremental investment spend you highlighted in the Consulting segment, can you break that up between comp and benefits and other expenses?","Christa Davies","No, we can't. But what we can say is that the majority of it is related to health care exchanges.","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Any just qualitative comment on how to allocate it?","Christa Davies","Yes, as we think about what it is, it is people and it's technology. And the technology spend is both an ongoing expense and it's capital expenditure. So as you think about scaling up a health care exchange, a lot of it's about hiring people to process the placement and some of them are very experienced people, like brokers. Some of them are administrative people to place the business and then as a substantial investment in the technology platform to scale the business to the large clients that we're going to be scaling over the next couple of years.","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","But as we think about that ongoing administrative or people expenses aren't likely to be called out as investments, so is it fair to think about that as either CapEx or any consulting on the -- any internal consultants or what-have-you on the implementation side?","Christa Davies","That is right. So we would say from 2013 onwards, we will absorb that in the business.","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got it. Then just curious, one of the things you talked about when you originally acquired Hewitt was some of the cross-selling opportunities between Risk Solutions and HR Solutions. And it feels like now that the office managers, regional managers kind of have their marching orders and that's a priority. Any early returns on that front?","Gregory C. Case","Let's start with one of the things that we saw enough promise and we actually -- we talked about some of the alignment around health and benefits. We've actually moved the entire Health and Benefits business, so $721 million for the revenue or thereabouts, from Aon Hewitt over to Aon Risk Solutions sort of in the context of that and saw a very strong growth sort of in the quarter as a result of that. So if one wanted kind of a very explicit underpinning sort of talk's cheap or what action are you taking, there is very specific action that we took based on early returns that we saw that we think are really beginning to have impact on the business but will have much, much more impact over time as we sort of take the capability we've got sort of in the context of where we are and deliver some of the Hewitt capability into the Risk client base and also in the middle market, so we're seeing that quite substantially and that's one example. What I'd also say on the health care exchanges, one of the investments if you think about it, we're involved in the design of those but also there's this [indiscernible] Brokerage involved in that and administration. So very directly, we're kind of connecting in terms of overall capabilities to serve our clients. So we would say, Matthew, there's a lot of connection and it is, at least, are more than we anticipated coming into the overall merger and early returns are very good in terms of sort what we're doing, but they're early. We've got a long way to go and we're continuing to build, but feel good about the progress.","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","How, from an external perspective over the next couple of years, you think we should -- how should we think about where we're going to see those benefits show up? I think you highlighted the easiest ones to get your arm around on the business that was transferred in the Brokerage, but how should we monitor that?","Gregory C. Case","Well, think you're going to look at -- you're going to see growth across the board. In many respects, you're going to hopefully see growth sort of in the Aon Hewitt side x Health and Benefits. Literally, what we're doing -- you just think about the capability we've got on the Outsourcing side, the delivery capability we've got. If you imagine that in the middle market, I mean think about it, Hewitt before was much more a U.S.- and U.K.-focused company, had certainly operations around the world. But Aon exceptionally strong around the world, incredibly strong little markets, so great capability in the context of that. And it also, as you sort of move up market, the Hewitt capability sort of in the large corporate arena was just extraordinary. So bringing risk capability to there we think could be very positive. The exchanges we've talked about before. So from our standpoint, we actually see connectivity across the business. We think you're going to see results sort of in multiple places.","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And that's something that the mid-market, the large global yang, yang, yang depending on the segment we're talking about, that's something you all -- we can expect you to call out?","Gregory C. Case","Yes, I think -- call out -- I don't know if we're going to sort of explicitly say this exactly was driven by client enrollment.","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes, I just meant qualitatively in the press release, that kind of thing.","Gregory C. Case","Yes, sure.","Operator","And our last question comes from Alex Lopez from Portales Partners.","Alex lopez - Portales Partners, LLC","Greg, I just want to -- I actually have a couple of follow-up questions on pricing and then I have a quick question on capital management. Greg, I just want to confirm, did you mention that about 2 to 3 points of the 7% Aon Benfield organic growth that [ph] contributed to pricing, is that right?","Gregory C. Case","Yes. What I said there are couple of things there. One was pricing, which was marginally positive. And then there are a couple of kind of one-off sort of additions, just really adjustments we made on behalf of clients that have impacted the quarter. So I really said there was 2 to 3 points overall that included pricing as part of it.","Alex lopez - Portales Partners, LLC","Okay. So there's a one-off. That's the nonrecurring or favorable pricing impact, right?","Gregory C. Case","Correct.","Alex lopez - Portales Partners, LLC","Also, can you provide some color on the pricing environment in Aon Hewitt. We have some idea of the demand, but the pricing. I was wondering if you can talk about that?","Christa Davies","So the pricing environment, we would say, particularly on the Outsourcing side, remains very competitive. And it is absolutely a headwind we faced, it's negative. It has remained at a consistent negative level since we merged with Hewitt in 2010. And we would say it's exactly in line with our expectations that we modeled when we acquired the company. So it remains very consistent.","Gregory C. Case","I think from a competitive standpoint, all of our businesses are competitive. All of them are -- sort of have prices sort of as one aspect of it. We continue to compete on value, which is helping our clients understand what we can do to help improve their operating performance or reduce their volatility or strengthen the balance sheets or really just help them improve performance. And that's actually served us well on the Reinsurance side, on the Retail side and in Aon Hewitt.","Alex lopez - Portales Partners, LLC","So it's competitive in Outsourcing and somewhat negative on the Consulting practices within Aon Hewitt, is that positive, competitive or...","Christa Davies","Yes.","Gregory C. Case","I still think it's like the business has been over time, there's lots of competition, lots of competitors out there sort of talking to clients. What we believe we've got is, Alex, a very unique way to sort of talk about the value we can bring to the market and whether it's on the advice side, on the consulting side or it's on the delivery side. And what we do on the outsourcing side, we think we've got a very unique platform in which we can actually offer our client not only the diagnosis and sort of help understand what to do but also and how to do it and actually do it for them on the outsourcing side. So we think the platform called Aon Hewitt is actually quite unique in the context of the HR Solutions world, just like we believe the risk solutions platform we have with Aon Risk Solutions and Aon Benfield is very unique.","Alex lopez - Portales Partners, LLC","Okay, great. Christa, quick question on capital management. Can you remind us how much senior debt is maturing in Q4? I think you had a little bit. And any thoughts on managing that or what were you going to do with it?","Christa Davies","Yes. So we have, in December 2012, about $225 million of debt that comes up for renewal. You should expect us to renew that as we normally do it.","Operator","I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg Case for closing remarks.","Gregory C. Case","I just want to say thanks to everybody for joining the call this quarter. We appreciate it and look forward to discussion next quarter. Thanks very much.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference. Thank you for joining.

At this time all parties will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer portion of today's call. If anyone has an objection, you may disconnect your line at this time.","I would also like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded.

Such statements are subject to certain risk and uncertainty that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our first quarter 2017 results as well as having been posted in our website.","Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, President and CEO of Aon Plc.","Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc","Thanks very much and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2017 conference call. Joining me here today is our CFO, Christa Davies. I would note that there are slides available on our website for you to follow along with our commentary today.","Before I begin the discussion on our finance results, I would like to spend a few minutes talking about Aon overall and our efforts to continuously strengthen the firm, consistent with our record of value creation. Let me start by saying, it's an exciting time for Aon, as we're reinforcing and building upon a proven decade long strategy to be the leading global professional services firm, providing a broad range of risk, retirement, and health solutions using proprietary data and analytics.","We're privileged to take these new initiatives I will describe on the heels of a decade of improvement and innovation for our clients and shareholders. For our clients, NPS scores are at their highest levels since we began tracking them with strong client satisfaction and retention.","For our shareholders, 10 plus years averaging 16% annual shareholder returns. And we finished 2016 with accelerating organic growth, record operating margin, and record free cash flow exceeding $2.1 billion. We feel very fortunate to have real momentum.","But we also share our conviction today on that, momentum never sleeps. We must continuously innovate faster than our clients in our areas of expertise to add value.","The Outsourcing platform divestiture provides a catalyst for our actions. As it is consistent with our focus in strategy to deliver advice and solutions and further aligns Aon's portfolio around our clients' highest priorities. It strengthens our ability to make new investments in high growth, high margin areas across our portfolio. It reinforces our return on invested capital, ROIC, decision making process and emphasis on free cash flow. And it provides approximately $3 billion of capital to accelerate investment in emerging client needs.","We're excited because the actions we are undertaking, we believe, will further strengthen our firm, including operating as one global P&L to strengthen our client serving capability by helping us achieve our commitment to deliver all of Aon's global capabilities locally.","Providing greater transparency into our highest growth platforms through five revenue lines, more fully reflecting how our team thinks about our business. Investing $900 million back into our business to unify and improve our business services operating model, including technology, real estate, and our colleague experience. The outcome of this work is designed to result in a substantially stronger firm with higher growth in top line, bottom line, and free cash flow.","In short, Aon ends up stronger than ever before with over $2 billion of incremental dollars to invest back into Aon. Continuing to reinforce and strengthen our free cash flow operating model, which has been very effective in strengthening the cash flow margins of our firm, thereby enabling more investment back into Aon.","These actions reinforced our industry leading platform, highlighted by leadership positions in each of our five revenue lines, Commercial Risk Solutions, Reinsurance Solutions, Retirement Solutions, Health Solutions, and Data & Analytic Services. And more than $120 billion of premium placed annually, an unprecedented level of data from which to drive insight on behalf of clients through our InPoint, ReView, and Affinity technology platforms. $4 trillion of assets under advisory, providing the basis for strong growth in our delegated investment consulting platform. And finally, the reflection of our client value, strong retention rates greater than 90%.","Overall, the momentum we already enjoy, amplified by the new initiatives currently underway is expected to substantially strengthen Aon for our clients, colleagues, and shareholders. And we believe represents the next wave of shareholder value creation.","Now turning to the quarter on page 6. Consistent with previous quarters, I'd like to cover two areas before turning the call over to Christa for further financial review. First is our performance against key metrics we communicate to shareholders. Second is overall organic growth performance including continued areas of strategic investment across Aon's industry leading portfolio of capabilities.","On the first topic, our performance versus key metrics. Each quarter we measure our performance against the key metrics we focus on achieving over the course of the year, grow organically, expand margins, increase our earnings per share, and deliver free cash flow growth.","In the first quarter organic revenue growth was 4% overall, the strongest rate of organic revenue growth to start the year since 2012, reflecting growth across the entire portfolio, including double digit growth in Health Solutions.","Operating margin increased 220 basis points, primarily reflecting strong organic revenue growth and return on investments across our portfolio, as well as expense savings from restructuring activities and other operational initiatives.","EPS increased 20% to $1.45, primarily reflecting strong operating performance, a lower effective tax rate, and effective capital management. And free cash flow increased $41 million or 38%, primarily reflecting strong operational improvement, partially offset by investments in our operating model.","Overall, our first quarter results reflect a strong start to the year with positive performance across each of our key metrics.","Turning to slide 8. On the second topic of organic growth and strategic investments. Organic revenue growth was 4% overall, an acceleration from 2% in the prior year quarter, reflecting strong growth across all five revenue lines, with particular strength in Health Solutions and Data & Analytics Services.","Reflecting on each of our core growth platforms. In Commercial Risk Solutions, organic revenue growth was 2% compared to 3% in the prior year quarter. On average globally, exposures were modestly positive and the impact from pricing was modestly negative, resulted in a relatively flat market impact overall. Results reflect solid growth internationally across EMEA, Asia, and the Pacific regions. And U.S. Retail, new businesses increased over 10% in the quarter. And strong management of the renewable portfolio drove retention rates of 93% on average. Results were partially offset by a decline in Latin America, primarily related to unfavorable timing impact in the quarter.","In Reinsurance Solutions, organic revenue growth was 2%, an acceleration from flat in the prior year quarter. Results reflect growth across every product line, including particular strength in capital markets transactions and advisory, continued net new business generation in treaty, and growth in facultative placements also contributed to growth in the quarter. Results were partially offset by a modest unfavorable market impact globally. Similar to prior discussions, overall market conditions are improving, as price declines continue to moderate year over year and cedent demands continue to increase against record levels of capital.","In Retirement Solutions, organic revenue growth was 3%, an acceleration from 2% in the prior year quarter. Results reflect growth across every major practice. We saw continued growth in investment consulting, specifically for delegated investment management services, reflecting an increase in client demand for Aon's tailored solution and independent advice, as well as improved market performance. The team surpassed the $100 billion mark of pension assets under delegated management, a real milestone. We also saw growth across our talent practice, primarily for compensation surveys and engagement services.","In Health Solutions, organic revenue growth was 14%, an acceleration from 1% in the prior year quarter. Results reflect solid growth globally in health and benefits brokerage, including double digit growth across the Asia and EMEA regions. Latin America also delivered solid growth in the quarter, following the recent acquisition of Admix in Brazil. New business for global health and benefits brokerage increased 6% in the quarter. And strong management of the renewal book portfolio drove retention rates greater than 94% on average. Results also reflect double digit growth in healthcare exchanges, primarily driven by follow-on enrollments on the active exchange and certain project related work.","In Data & Analytic Services, organic revenue growth was 5%, similar to the prior year quarter. Results primarily reflect strong growth across our global Affinity business, highlighted by double digit growth in the U.S. We saw growth across all product lines in U.S. Affinity, with particular strength in areas across consumer solutions like travel and financial solutions. Overall, we delivered solid growth to start the year, driven by high demand areas where we continue to invest in innovative solutions and client serving capabilities.","Turning to slide 9. Clients are navigating in an increasingly volatile world, where economic, demographic, and geopolitical landscapes, combined with the exponential pace of technology change, are all converging to create a challenging new reality for businesses.","Aon has a strong track record of developing innovative, first-to-market solutions to help solve problems and create differentiated value in response to specific client needs. We're investing organically and through M&A across our portfolio in areas such as Data & Analytics, our InPoint and ReView businesses; cyber risk advisory, the recent acquisition of Stroz Friedberg; Affinity; health and elective benefits brokerage, Admix in Latin America and Univers; health exchanges, where we offer the broadest set of solutions in health; and delegated investment management.","Overall, our strategic investments in high growth areas and in Data & Analytics continue to drive new business generation, strong retention rates, and increased operating leverage across the portfolio, positioning the firm for continued long term growth.","In summary of our performance, our first quarter results reflect a strong start to the year, driven by investments in our client serving capabilities and operating model.","We're accelerating a proven strategy, which has been delivering exceptional results for clients and shareholders for over a decade. With significant financial flexibility to invest across our industry leading portfolio, our operating model, and to return capital to shareholders, we believe we're at the beginning of the next substantial wave of value creation for shareholders.","I'm now pleased to turn the call over Christa for further financial review. Christa?","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","Thanks very much, Greg. And good morning, everyone. As Greg noted, we just completed a meaningful next step in the firm's decade long strategy. We are operating from a position of strength to unlock the next wave of shareholder value creation. Our first quarter performance reflects accelerated organic revenue growth, substantial operating improvement, and 38% growth in free cash flow over Q1 2016. An exceptional start to the year, given the incredible effort by colleagues across the firm to complete the divestiture.","Now let me turn to the financial results for the quarter on slide 11 of the presentation. Our core EPS performance from continuing operations excluding certain items increased 20% to $1.45 per share for the first quarter, compared to $1.21 in the prior year quarter. Certain items that were adjusted for in the core EPS performance and highlighted in the schedules on page 10 of the press release include non-cash intangible asset amortization and restructuring charges.","Included in the results was a $0.01 per share unfavorable impact related to FX translation, due primarily to U.S. dollar strength against the euro. In addition, we incurred a $0.03 per share unfavorable impact recognized through other expenses from losses on the remeasurement of assets and liabilities in non-functional currencies. If currency were to remain stable at today's rates, we would expect an immaterial impact for the rest of the year.","Further, discontinued operations represent an additional $0.18 of total earnings per share attributable to Aon shareholders in both Q1 2016 and Q1 2017. Total EPS attributable to Aon shareholders including both continuing and discontinued operations increased 17% from $1.39 to $1.63 in the first quarter of 2017.","Turning to the next slide to discuss our strong operational performance. Operating income increased 16% and operating margin increased 220 basis points to 22.3% compared to the prior year quarter. Operating margin improvement reflects organic revenue growth across the portfolio, including strong growth in high demand areas of continued investment, as well as $12 million or 50 basis points of favorable impact from reduced expenses related to certain hedging programs, as a result of actions undertaken due to reduced ongoing transactional exposure to the Indian rupee post the sale of the Outsourcing businesses; $11 million or 40 basis points of savings related to restructuring and other expense discipline initiatives; and a 30 basis points favorable impact from foreign currency translation.","Turning to page 13. I'd like to spend a few moments discussing the investments we're making to create a next-generation global business services model that allows for better scalability, flexibility, and enhanced colleague and client experience. These investments are intended to create one operating model with increased operating leverage. Our primary investment areas are across IT, real estate, and people.","In IT, we expect to create greater insight from data center optimization, application management, and strategic vendor consolidation. In real estate, we expect it to drive greater collaboration and engagement through real estate portfolio optimization. And in people, we expect to create efficient scalability of operations and activity, including the use of centers of excellence and third party providers.","As part of these operating model investments, we plan to invest an estimated $900 million in total cash out of the $3 billion total Outsource divestiture proceeds. These investments include $700 million of cash charges \u2013 expected to be incurred $350 million in 2017, $250 million in 2018, and $100 million in 2019 \u2013 and $200 million of incremental CapEx investment \u2013 expected to be incurred $30 million in 2017, $100 million in 2018, and $70 million in 2019. There is an additional $50 million of non-cash charges included as part of asset impairments and lease consolidations.","Overall, we expect these investments to deliver $400 million of estimated annual savings in 2019, including an estimated $150 million in 2017 and $300 million in 2018.","Following this $900 million investment in our operating model, we have approximately $2.1 billion of incremental capital left from the Outsourcing divestiture proceeds to invest in high growth, high margins areas across our portfolio and to return to shareholders.","Turning to the next page. In our first quarter, we incurred $144 million of restructuring related charges, primarily related to workforce reduction, representing 19% of the total program estimates. The cash impact in the first quarter was an outflow of $31 million. We recognized $11 million of savings in the quarter, representing 7% of the expected savings within the year and 3% of the total savings estimate.","Now let me discuss a few of the line items outside of operations on slide 15. Interest income was $2 million. Interest expense increased $1 million to $70 million due to a modest increase in total debt outstanding. Other expense of $10 million or $0.03 per share primarily includes losses due to the unfavorable impact of exchange rates on the remeasurement of assets and liabilities in non-functional currencies. Separately, unallocated expenses are now included in overall operating income as we manage one P&L across the firm going forward.","Turning to taxes. The adjusted effective tax rate on net income from continuing operations, excluding the applicable tax impact associated with amortization, restructuring charges, and anticipated non-cash pension settlements in the fourth quarter decreased to 11.1%, compared to 15.7% in the prior year quarter. Our rate of 11.1% in the first quarter primarily reflects a $29 million benefit from the required change in accounting for share based compensation. The new accounting guidance requires excess tax benefits and tax efficiencies to be recognized as income tax expense and treated as discrete items against the underlying operating rate in the period in which the granted shares vest. Excluding the impact from this accounting change, the rate in Q1 would has been 17.5%.","Lastly, average diluted shares outstanding decreased to 2% to 267 million in the first quarter compared to 273.7 million in the prior year quarter, as we effectively allocate capital. The company repurchased 1.1 million Class A ordinary shares for approximately $125 million in the quarter.","The company has $7.7 billion of remaining authorization under its share repurchase program. Actual shares outstanding on March 31 were 262.8 million. And there are approximately 5 million additional dilutive equivalents. Estimated Q2 2017 beginning dilutive share count is approximately 268 million, subject to share price movement, share issuance, and share repurchase.","Now let me turn to the next slide to highlight our solid balance sheet and strong cash flow growth. At March 31, 2017, cash and short term investments decreased to $633 million. Total debt outstanding was approximately $6.3 billion. Total debt to EBITDA on a GAAP basis for the consolidated AON including continuing and discontinued operations was 2.7 times. As discussed previously, while debt to EBITDA will be initially elevated as a result of the sale of the Outsourcing business, we expect it to return back to the 2 times to 2.5 times range by the end of 2018, driven by operational improvements.","Cash flow from operations for the first three months increased 26% or $38 million to $182 million, primarily driven by strong operational improvement in continuing operations, partially offset by $31 million of cash restructuring charges.","Free cash flow, as defined by cash flow from operations less CapEx, increased 38% or $41 million to a $148 million, driven by strong growth in cash flow from operations and a $3 million decrease in CapEx. I would note, this is an exceptional start to the year in our historically seasonally weakest quarter, reflecting continued momentum in cash flow as we focus on converting each dollar of revenue into the highest free cash flow yield.","Turning to the next slide to discuss our free cash flow growth over the long term. We value the firm based on free cash flow and allocate capital to maximize free cash flow returns. We've made substantial progress since introducing free cash flow as a key financial metric in 2012, reaching record free cash flow of $2.1 billion in 2016. Our disciplined capital management approach is focused on maximizing return on invested capital, which we've consistently improved each year since 2010, increasing 540 basis points to 17.1% in 2016. The recent sale of our Outsourcing businesses is expected to improve this even further.","We've taken significant steps to maximize the translation of each dollar of revenue into the highest amount of free cash flow, including working capital initiatives and actions to manage our cash pension contributions. Since 2010, we've increased our free cash flow margin by nearly 1,000 basis points to 18.1% in 2016.","Looking forward, there are three primary areas that we expect to continue to contribute to incremental free cash flow generation. The first is continued operational improvement, driven by accelerated organic revenue growth and margin expansion. The second is working capital improvements, as we focus on closing the gap between receivables and payables. We expect working capital to contribute to free cash flow by over $500 million over the long term. And third is the lower cash tax payments, reflecting a lower effective tax rate over time. Combined with our increasing free cash flow margin, we believe we are positioned to continued double digit free cash flow growth over the long term.","In summary, we delivered positive performance across each of our four key metrics for a strong start to the year. We saw accelerated organic revenue growth, driven by our investments in high growth areas and improved operational performance as we increase operating leverage across one operating model.","Operational performance combined with significant financial flexibility from transaction proceeds and underlying free cash flow generation position the firm to deliver on our near term goal of exceeding $7.97 adjusted earnings per share in 2018.","Most importantly, this reinforces our ability to deliver double digit free cash flow growth over the long term. We believe we are creating the next significant value creation opportunity for shareholders.","With that I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question is coming from Dave Styblo of Jefferies. Sir, your line is open.","David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC","Sure. Good morning. Thanks for the questions.","Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc","Hey, Dave.","David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC","First is just a quick easy one, I just want to confirm that the $400 million of savings includes the $91 million of stranded costs you guys have talked about before?","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","Yes, it does.","David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And then just can you talk a little bit more about the key buckets of that $400 million that your scoring, what those fall into? If it's people, real estate, IT? I'm assuming maybe it's along those lines. But can you talk about how you score those, your confidence? And then on one hand, it's call it maybe 20% or 25% of your SG&A excluding comp and benefit. And then on the other hand \u2013 which seems sort of high. And then on the other hand, you guys have a knack for doing better than your SG&A targets that you've put out there in the past on different programs. So I was just trying to reconcile how confident and how far you scored each one of the key buckets?","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","Sure. So, Dave, as we think about this program, it's really about bringing together Aon under one operating model. So as we think about the big buckets, they're exactly as you said. It's IT, it's real estate, and it's people.","And if you look at the total $400 million in expense takeout, it's 5% of total expenses. So it really isn't a significant sort of transformational activity. It's really increasing operating leverage across the platform. We have enormous confidence in our ability to hit the $400 million. As you accurately pointed out, historically our performance, we've overachieved on these programs. So we feel very good about the $400 million in savings.","David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC","Okay, that's helpful. And then obviously the new segmentation you've got, you've got five businesses, a couple are more granular than we've seen before. Can you guys give us maybe just a high level view of how you think about sustainable organic growth across each one of those?","Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc","So, Dave, from our standpoint we'd like you to think about these as five really revenue lines in terms of where we are. We really have one segment, that's really what we're trying to do. One overall P&L. And the opportunity here is it really reinforces what we know we're best at. When we bring global capability, all of Aon to our clients in a local way, we do exceptionally well.","And in essence we're reinforcing that. So not only are we taking actions to improve the operating model of the firm, as Christa described, but we're also taking actions that continue to align the firm. So that's what we're trying to do with the revenue lines.","And what you see is a reflection of exactly how we think about the business. So you're seeing opportunities \u2013 think about commercial risk, reinsurance, retirement, all the efforts around that. What we do in health. And then now Data & Analytic services, which really represents what we do in Data & Analytic services, in which we sell directly to a client \u2013 or actually provide directly to a client, not embedded in the work we do. So for us this is the exact reflection of how we think about growing and building the business. Which is why we're excited to actually take this forward on your behalf, because this again is how we think about it internally.","David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And then a final one, just on that point with it being sort of one global P&L, how do you balance that versus pushing down accountability for the business heads to, not just drive top line, but also hold them accountable for achieving certain margins. Do they still have their own P&Ls that they're accountable for that report up? Or what does that look like in the new structure now?","Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc","Yeah, this is \u2013 from the standpoint of accountability there's sustained or even more intensified accountability in terms of sort of what has to happen at the grassroots level to build bottom up, to deliver on behalf of the firm. What you see now though is it comes all together in one P&L, to think about kind of integrated Aon. So this is how I think about the business when we think about \u2013 and how Christa thinks about the business, when we think about where and how to place capital.","So the accountabilities at the front line remain the same and again are intensified. And the opportunity for us is really to take some very substantial steps forward on where we're going to invest and shape the portfolio. And that's what you're looking at here. You're getting a chance to sort of see the five platforms that are really growth platforms.","And again if you step back and think about it from a growth standpoint, we started the year, first quarter 4% growth, strongest we've had since 2012. And we've been thinking about it this way for the last 24 months to 36 months. And now you're just seeing a reflection of that. So this is not any type of a change in sort of the detailed front line. It really is how I think and Christa thinks about allocating capital and growing the business overall.","David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thanks. I'll step back for others.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is coming from Sarah DeWitt of JPMorgan. Ma'am, your line is open.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, good morning and congrats on a good quarter.","Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc","Thanks, Sarah.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","My first question is just on the expense savings again. Could you just explain to us in layman's terms with maybe some examples of why the sale of the benefits administration business leads to savings for the remaining business? I'm just trying to understand it a little better.","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","Yeah. So I think the simple way to think about this, Sarah, is we used to have two different sets of infrastructure in IT or the operating support areas for Risk Solutions and HR Solutions. And we're really bringing those support areas together in one Aon business. And so it allows us to make substantial changes in IT around data centers. The outsourcing business had a number of clients who were in the defense area as an example. And really it didn't allow us to utilize public cloud infrastructure as much as we can today.","In the real estate area for example, we now \u2013 we've moved from 72,000 colleagues to 50,000 colleagues. And our 50,000 colleagues are primarily client facing colleagues, who are actually not sitting in the office 9 to 5 in a call center for example, in the Outsourcing business, but actually need to collaborate a lot more to get their work done. And so it allows us to actually optimize the real estate portfolio in a way that we weren't able to previously.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And that IT and infrastructure that was for the ben and admin business, that doesn't go with Blackstone?","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","It does, Sarah. But what it allows us to do is actually pull together the infrastructure that supported HR Solutions with the infrastructure that supported Risk Solutions into one Aon model, which allows us to actually design it for Aon today, which is actually much more like a professional services firm and much less diversified. Because we have the primarily colleagues who are client facing and earning revenue through percent commission on premium placed or fees. And so you've got a much more homogenous environment to design a consistent operating model, if that makes sense.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Yeah. That does. Thank you. And then just on the proceeds from the sale. Could you give us any more thoughts in terms of how you're thinking about deploying that $2 billion for buyback versus reinvestments? And just to clarify, the incremental buybacks from using the proceeds, is that on top of your normal pace of buybacks, which has historically run around $1.5 billion per year?","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","So first of all I would say, we do have substantial amounts of cash over the coming years. You look at the $3 billion of after-tax proceeds from the sale, you look at $2 billion approximately per year in free cash flow. So you've got approximately $9 billion to invest back into reinvesting in Aon or returning to shareholders.","As we think about the balance of that, Sarah, it's really on the same basis we've done it historically, which is return on capital. And we would note that the highest return on capital across Aon remains share repurchase, which is why we increased the share repurchase authorization by $5 billion last quarter.","And the other thing I would say though is, we have a robust M&A pipeline with some really attractive opportunities. And so we are fortunate to have great options to both reinvest back into Aon and to return the money to shareholders.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thank you for the answers.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Kai Pan of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you and good morning. Following on the restructuring cost, the $900 million cash is higher than your typical \u2013 like your past restructuring program, about 1.25 times of the expected savings. And what's the reason for that? And how much of $400 million will be flow through to the bottom line? And will this restructuring program impact your organic growth in the near term?","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","Okay. So I'll do the first couple of questions. Then I think Greg will handle the growth question. So on the first question, the 2.25 times. So we're spending $900 million. We're getting $400 million of savings every year.","We do think about this, Kai, on a return on capital basis, unsurprisingly, cash on cash returns. And we feel really good about the returns on this business. As we look at the returns, they \u2013 we are actually \u2013 it's 2.25 times, as you said versus the 1.25 times we've done historically. It's really because we are making structural changes to Aon around IT, around real estate, around some pretty significant investments to actually generate one operating model across Aon. It's going to result in a much more efficient operating model for Aon with much greater operating leverage. And enable much greater growth through greater insights for clients. And so we feel really good about the return on this investment.","Your second question about sort of how much of the savings drop to the bottom line, obviously there is a potential for us to reinvest some of it. And we'll think about that on a return on capital basis. And we're not sure at this point whether we will or won't reinvest, but there's obviously the potential for that.","And then in terms of the growth and will restructure and savings impact growth, Greg?","Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc","So, Kai, did we answer your first set of questions around sort of the reinvestment piece before we get to growth?","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Sure.","Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc","Okay. Excellent. Listen, on the growth side this is really important just from an overall perspective. Because hopefully you can tell from our tone this morning, we're very enthusiastic about this next set of steps for Aon. This is something we thought about for quite some time. And now we're able to put it into place.","Kai, if you think about it the \u2013 and this is about accelerating growth. Everything around this is accelerating growth and more impact for clients. The actions we're taking really reflect from our standpoint a real conviction around this opportunity we see before us. And as Christa described, a lot of confidence in our ability to capture it. And remember we \u2013 same strategy. Same strategy for the last decade, preeminent professional services firm, focus on risk, retirement, health, underpinned by Data & Analytics.","That strategy has served us exceptionally well. As I described in some of my comments and Christa did as well, great NPS, value creation 16%, total return to shareholders for 10 years, great 2016 momentum as we jump into 2017.","But we would say, and this what's so important. As we think about the potential of our firm, we're still, Kai, at kind of a four out of 10 in terms of capturing the full opportunity. This is very much kind of the glass half full in terms sort of where we can go. And what we're excited about is we know how to get there. We know this is around meeting client needs more effectively and they're evolving. And then improving Aon. And this is what the restructuring is all about from an Aon standpoint.","To get from a 4% to a 7% to an 8% in terms of on a scale of zero to 10, this really involves investing and growing in areas of greatest client need. And you're going to see us do that more and more and more, increase risk of innovation.","And then on the Aon piece, it's really aligning Aon more effectively to consistently deliver on this idea of global capability delivered locally. And this is \u2013 we call it Aon United. But this is really around becoming a better and better and better professional services firm. And to do that there is a whole series of things around technology, colleague experience, fundamental operations of the firm, as Christa described, we've got to improve on. But we also know the economics and the impact of this as we get this right over the coming 24 months, 36 months has a disproportionate and very strong impact on clients and our colleagues and for our shareholders.","And then you get to the Outsourcing piece, why is this a catalyst? As we nurtured this and developed this and created the opportunity, the Outsourcing sale is such a great catalyst, because when you think about what happens when we're done with the moves on the restructuring, we end up with a stronger financial platform in terms of being enable to generate operating income. Because the $900 million investment via the charge and resulting efficiency gain, so it more than just replaces lost income. It really creates operational leverage for us in a very positive way.","So you now end up with a platform that has a stronger financial engine. And by definition when you look at the math, is growing faster top line, higher margin, 100 basis points, free cash flow, faster growth, better operating leverage as we add and subtract businesses from the portfolio over time. And then, oh yeah, one other real positive, we generate $3 billion of net proceeds. We invest $900 million back in the business. We've gotten more than $2 billion again to accelerate and invest back into Aon.","So for us, Kai, I just \u2013 it's important you understand sort of the psychology that went into this. This is something that's been sort of in the works for a long, long time that we're now able to launch with a lot of velocity. And we feel really good about it, which is why Christa described it as kind of in our view the next wave. The next wave for our clients, but equally the next wave for our shareholders. So I know it was a bit long winded, but it hopefully gives you a sense on \u2013 so what we're trying to do.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Will that in the near term \u2013 much appreciate the answers. Will that impact the near term organic growth, given there's restriction programs going on?","Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc","Well, if you see again \u2013 if you look at the first quarter and some were already underway, we had record first quarter growth, the highest growth we've had at the company overall since 2012. So our view is this is an accelerant. And that's what it's designed to be. It's really \u2013 this is a set of very kind of offensive steps to sort of strengthen our client serving capability and accelerate growth.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That's great. Just quick number question on free cash flow and \u2013 because that's been a focus for shareholders as well as you guys. Just what's your baseline for 2017? My maths run like if your regional guidance, $2.4 billion, if you take out $500 million from this sales divesture and you take out the $400 million recharging cost, but adding back $150 million of the savings. You get close to $1.7 billion. Is that right way to think about it?","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","Here's what I'd say, Kai. We're obviously not going to give guidance for the free cash flow of 2017. What we can say is that the right starting point for 2016 is to start with the $2.1 billion we actually delivered in 2016 and take out $400 million for the lost operating income from Tempo and other cash charges.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Well, thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi, guys. Thank you. Good morning. My first question. The tax rate was 17.5% ex the stock comp benefit in the quarter. Is \u2013 was there anything that impacted that? Just because I know you put the Outsourcing earnings in discontinued ops, but the sale did close after the end of the quarter. Or is that how we should think about the tax rate going forward? I guess when you think about this deal being accretive to 2018, the prior consensus number, did that assume a tax rate around 17.5%?","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","So what I would say is that the adjusted effective tax rate for continuing operations, not including the disposition, was 11.1% for Q1. And our rate of 11.1% in the first quarter primarily reflects the $29 million benefit from a required change in accounting for share based compensation. Excluding that change in accounting, the rate for continuing operations would have been 17.5%. And we are not giving guidance going forward.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then in terms of you guys used to have with the prior two segments, there were margins goals associated with both those segments. Are you going away from having a consolidated margin target?","And then following up on Kai's question from earlier in terms of how much of these \u2013 the savings plan outlined today will fall to the bottom line. As you think about reaching the 2018 earnings target. Is there some type of assumption that you guys assume in terms of savings that will fall to the bottom line? And is there a way \u2013 I mean with your prior programs, can you give us historically how much of the savings on some of those past plans have actually fallen to the bottom line?","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","So as we think about the business, we make decisions based on return on capital and free cash flow margin. We continue to focus on our four key metrics that we report every year and commit to grow every year, organic revenue growth, operating income, EPS, and free cash flow. And we have two targets going forward, double digit free cash flow growth over the long term and then given all the complexity going on, we have an EPS target of greater than $7.97 in 2018.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And so no more margin target?","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","No.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then one other question. Is there a way \u2013 it seems to me when I look at the new five lines that your retail brokerage business went into Commercial Risk, into Data & Analytics, and Health Solutions. I just want to understand if that's correct?","And then second, Greg, in your prepared remarks you mentioned some timing in terms of the Commercial Risk business I think negatively impacting the Q1 organic. How do you think about organic? Is that something that's shifting over into the second quarter when we think about the organic outlook for that business from here?","Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc","Yeah. All of us really trying to \u2013 I'll just say it in sort of in that. There is always timing around the quarters, Elyse, and there was in this quarter as well.","But coming back to the revenue lines, really important. Again this is how we think about sort of the platforms or investment of the platforms for growth overall.","If you think about growth, we've encouraged you to look at Aon. And so that's what we're going to look at. Again back to Christa's four metrics, I would note as well, margin is included in that too. And we have a commitment to continue to improve that. So while no target, we have a commitment to improve on all four of the metrics over the course of the year.","And in the case of the revenue lines, we've got five revenue lines that for us represent in many respects how we think about growing the business.","On the Commercial Risk side, listen, we feel this has gotten off to a very solid start, very much in line with our expectations. Again we're never caught up in kind of the quarter versus the year. But the underlying activity was exceptionally good. New business, $270 million, up 17%. Retention and rollover were up \u2013 both up marginally above 94%, very, very good. Marketing impact was flat. And strong performance internationally with some timing in LatAm. So for us we feel very good about the quarter.","You're absolutely right in terms of sort of comparing it to previous quarters, our Data & Analytic Services piece would have been in Risk Solutions. And parts of our Health piece would have been in Risk Solutions too.","So for us, we feel very good about the growth for the quarter. Again it's record growth for Aon, back to 2012. So feel very good about that and certainly feel good about where we are on the Commercial Risk side.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And one last question. You mentioned a strong pipeline in terms of potential M&A deals. Is that \u2013 would you say that's in relation to deals both in the U.S. and internationally?","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","Yes.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Newsome of Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.","Jon Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Hi. Good morning. With the change in segmentation and the view of the company as sort of one P&L, how does that change the incentives? Not necessarily at the very senior level, but the next tier down, the folks that run those segments. How are their targets thought of if you don't really have a segment level P&L?","Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc","So again, Paul, we would encourage you not to think about these as five segments. They're not in fact five segments. These are five revenue lines, where Christa and I and the most senior team think about capital allocation and disproportionate investments to change and modify the structure of the firm. Sort of our front line continues as it always has continued, thinking about sort of how we serve clients day to day, supporting each other around where we are.","So that \u2013 don't look for a lot of change there. This is not in any way, shape, or form a restructuring. This is really how we think about the business overall. And we're trying to give you a much clearer window into how we think about capital allocation. We will continue to align the most senior team around a set of incentives. And we've done that for our executive committee, where literally everything is aligned around \u2013 together around shareholder value creation.","And then we've also got our top 150, top 175 colleagues, who also are now more aligned around this single P&L, which is a very substantial change for us at the most senior level. As well as individual results that they have responsibility for.","So for us, we're creating alignment around the one P&L at the top. But at the front line it is exactly as we've been doing. So this isn't a lot of disruption at the front line. This is really meant to create disproportionate investment around growth and to drive growth and to strengthen the firm.","Jon Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Thank you. Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Next we have Jay Cohen of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jay A. Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes, thank you. One request and then a couple questions. On the request side, in the future if you're doing a change in reporting format, we'd love a couple weeks of a heads up to get the models going. Not a big deal, but one request.","Two questions, I think relatively short. First, the modest benefit you got from the hedging \u2013 actually the $12 million I think it was, was there an offset somewhere else in the P&L?","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","No. There was no offset. And, Jay, just to your request, we do recognize that there are a lot of moving parts at the moment. And you can imagine with us having to close the transaction, there was an enormous amount of work going on here too.","And we've tried really hard to provide a lot of transparency to the numbers. And I think page 17 of the press release really goes through our financials over the last couple of years on an Aon go-forward basis to help set up your model. And the Excel is actually on our website. So hopefully that will help. And we're here to answer any questions for you.","Jay A. Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That was helpful. And I'm sure I have no appreciation for all that went into it, so thank you.","The other question was on the Health side, you talked about some off-cycle I guess renewals on the healthcare exchange business. As we think about the quarter's growth, as we look at next year's first quarter, is that going to represent a tough comp? Is there something a little bit extra that we shouldn't expect to continue in that revenue line?","Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc","Well, Jay, consistent with what we just said before, sort of the quarters do what they do. We obviously love this segment, love this business, and have continued to invest in it, continue to see it grow. You're right. There's no doubt it's a hard comp if you want to go quarter to quarter for next year. No doubt about that. But feel very, very good about the overall trajectory.","And the off-cycle is literally \u2013 on the exchange side as you add companies, make their decisions to add companies, subtract companies, it really changes sort of the off-cycle a bit, another positive thing about this business. And that's what you see reflected here.","Jay A. Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Thanks, Greg.","Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. Next we have Brian Meredith of UBS. Your line is open.","Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Yes. Thanks. Two quick ones here. First one, just curious to follow up on Jay's question. Did the healthcare exchange numbers, the seasonality we've historically seen in that, is that no longer going forward? Or are we still going to see a better revenue growth typically in the fourth quarter?","Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc","Yeah, you're still going to see it more, Brian \u2013 Q4 is skewed just as how companies make decisions. As we described before, we've really worked with clients to think about health really over the course of the year, which they do anyway, but in terms of the mechanics or the decision making process, so you're seeing that spread out a bit. But it's still disproportionately skewed to Q4.","Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","But not so from a margin perspective? Because obviously you don't have the big expense outlay, right, in the first, second, and third quarter?","Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc","Correct.","Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Got you. Terrific. And then second question, Greg, I'm just curious, with the new structure you've got in place, do you expect this to drive more cross sell between the health benefits consulting businesses and the commercial insurance brokerage business?","Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc","Brian, I love that question. Here's \u2013 we don't think about it as cross sell. I'll tell you what we think about it as, delivering the firm.","So this isn't about sort of a micro, I brought a new product, can you buy this or buy that? This is around an ethic. And we take this deadly seriously. This is an ethic around delivering the global capability of Aon, sitting at the table with clients, thinking about their needs, and having enough understanding as an individual and credibility to introduce parts of Aon to help a client succeed.","Sometimes, Brian, that'll result in a sale. Sometimes it's not. What it always does \u2013 and we know this. What it always does is it strengthens the reputation of Aon in the eyes of a client. That creates greater degrees of freedom or opportunities for us to actually help that client succeed. And also it gives us more information on where and how to invest in areas that are important to clients.","So for us, this is why we're so excited about this opportunity. This is \u2013 as we take Aon United and we continue to evolve it and we go from a 4 to a 5 to a 6 to a 7 on that scale of 10 I described before, we know that's going to produce great results for clients and tremendous results for Aon. And in doing so obviously great results for shareholders.","So for us it's not cross sell. It's really around Aon United and delivering the firm. And with real credibility in a way we've done many times before, Brian, but we've never done fully consistently. That's why again this isn't about a new concept. This is taking a concept we know works and then scaling it, which is why the investment back into the firm is so important.","Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Is it trading? Or are you changing the organizational structure within the company as well? More integration of somebody basically looking at one client and looking at everything and then looking down below? How is that working?","Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc","The really \u2013 Brian, there's \u2013 this is the beauty of this is, this isn't about restructuring or reorganization. There's not reorganization in this. This is literally stepping back and saying, what do we need to do to serve clients more effectively? And how do we work together to do that?","In the one P&L, the five revenue lines, the alignment at the senior team, the restructuring that Christa described, all these things are around literally the mindset focus on clients overall. So the beauty of this is, there's not a lot of organizational complexity embedded in this at all. This is really how we come together to support our clients.","And again it's not something that's conceptual. We've been thinking about this now for the better part of 24 months. We know this has tremendous potential. It was just how we were going to scale it. So for us this is not about sort of front line organizational change. It's really about how we think about clients.","Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next we have Ryan Tunis of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey. Thanks. Good morning. I just had a couple I guess more technical ones that should be pretty quick. But the other associated cost bucket in terms of the saves, I think it was close to $200 million. Just a little more detail on what's in that please? Thanks.","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","Sure. So in there are things like corporate costs, data centers, marketing, there's professional services, there's an array of things in there.","Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. And I guess along those lines, the $200 million of the CapEx that didn't have \u2013 I guess in the disclosures wasn't really bucketed. Should we think about that as being allocated pretty similarly as to the reduction in expenses?","Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc","Well, the CapEx overall, Ryan, as you know, what we showed before, the $200 million has actually come down over time as we exited our \u2013 exited the Tempo businesses. As you recall that was 36% of that CapEx, so that's come down over time.","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","Yeah. And so, Ryan, if you think about CapEx, we had $222 million of CapEx last year. We lost $80 million of CapEx with the divestiture of the \u2013 our Outsourcing business. So that gets you to $122 million as the right starting point. And then \u2013 sorry, $142 million as the right starting point. And then you add on the CapEx of $30 million from the restructuring program, so you get to $172 million. And CapEx is mostly for Aon, IT, and real estate.","Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Got you. Okay. And then just the follow-up was on the change in the hedge program. I just \u2013 I was just curious if that has a predictable impact on the P&L over the rest of the year relative to 2016? Or was that just random? Or was that just related to 1Q? Thanks.","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","So, Ryan, the Indian hedging program has now ceased, because it was really primarily put in place, because we had a significant asset in India related to our Outsourcing business. And so now that we've dispositioned that Outsourcing business, you will not see this again. Ryan, any other questions?","Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","No, I didn't have any. Thanks.","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. I would now like to turn it back over to Greg Case for closing remarks.","Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc","Well, thanks very much for joining us. We look forward to the next call. And everybody, have a great day. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. That concludes today's conference.

Our performance versus key metrics. Each quarter, we measure our performance against the 3 metrics we focus on achieving over the course of the year: Grow organically, expand margins and increase earnings per share.","Turning to Slide 3. In the third quarter, organic revenue growth was 4% overall driven by improved rate of organic growth in both Risk and HR Solutions. Operating margin increased 30 basis points, and savings related to our restructuring programs and operational discipline absorbed continued investments we are making in new growth opportunities and in key talents across our businesses.  Finally, EPS increased 8% to $0.95, reflecting solid operating performance and effective capital management.","Overall, the focus remains on annual performance and achieving these metrics over the course of the year. However, I would note that our third quarter reflects improvement in each of our 3 metrics for the first time since the beginning of 2009 that we delivered this result in a single quarter.","Christa will provide further and additional financial commentary in a few minutes, reinforcing that we're on track with our long-term targets and has continued to take significant steps to further position the firm for long-term growth, strong free cash flow generation and increased financial flexibility.","Turning to Slide 4, on the second topic of growth. I want to spend the next few minutes discussing the quarter for both of our segments. In Risk Solutions, overall organic revenue growth was 3% compared to 2% in the prior-year quarter, with growth across every major business. As we've discussed previously, we're driving a set of initiatives that are strengthening underlying performance and positioning our Risk Solutions segment for long-term growth and improved operating leverage with management of our renewal book through Client Promise and retention rates of 90% or better on average, highlighting strong client satisfaction. New business generation of more than $230 million across our Retail business, with double-digit new business growth in many markets globally across Asia and Pacific regions. Investments in new product and service capabilities with the rollout of GRIP and Aon Broking globally. And in our core treaty reinsurance business, net new business trends have now been positive for 6 consecutive quarters.","Reflecting on the individual businesses. In the Americas, organic revenue growth was 2%, similar to the prior-year quarter. The exposures are relatively stable and the impact on pricing was modestly positive on average, reflecting the steady pace of improvement over the last 12 months. We saw strong growth in the renewal book portfolio in Latin America and in our Affinity business. U.S. Retail was stable as growth in Health and Benefits and property\/casualty markets were offset by continued weakness in the commercial construction market.","In international, organic revenue growth was 3%, also similar to the prior-year quarter. Exposures are relatively stable and the impact from pricing was flat on average with firmer pricing in cat-exposed regions. We saw a strong growth in emerging markets, New Zealand and in many regions across Asia, including double-digit growth in areas such as India and Taiwan. In the U.K. and Continental Europe, macroeconomic conditions remained fragile across many core markets. However, our leadership positions across this region where we saw strong retention rates and management of our renewal book portfolio, delivered modest growth. Overall, solid performance given the economic headwinds.","In reinsurance, organic revenue growth improved to 7% compared to a decline of 1% in the prior-year quarter. The results reflect solid growth across each business. In treaty, as mentioned before, net new business won was positive for the sixth quarter in a row, including unfavorable impact from market pricing in the near-term primarily due to losses incurred in the prior year from property cat-exposed regions.","Additionally, we saw solid growth from facultative placements and capital markets transactions and advisory services, which tend be lumpy quarter-to-quarter. Overall, this level of performance and strength in new business generation reflects Aon Benfield's compelling value proposition for clients of strengthening operational performance and reducing volatility through unmatched data, analytics and advisory capability.","I would note that our fourth quarter of 2011 in reinsurance benefited from significant level of capital markets transactions that we do not expect to repeat in Q4 this year, as well as caution that excess capital continues to build in the industry and cedents continue to retain more risk.  Absent any events in the industry, macro factors may return as a headwind that we're going to have to overcome as we move into 2013.","Turning to HR Solutions. Overall organic growth improved to 4% compared to a decline of 1% in the prior-year quarter. We saw the rate of organic growth improve across both consulting and outsourcing despite weak discretionary spend globally and continued economic pressure in Continental Europe. Performance also reflects growth rates in areas where we're making significant investments in the business, in areas such as investment consulting, pension risk management consulting and HR BPO. These investments reflect Aon Hewitt's understanding of market trends and the long-term issues that face our clients as health care reform, health care costs and the associated financial risk continue to rise unchecked at a time when overall health and wellness is not improving.  Multinational clients are increasingly looking for global benefit solutions that support their global organizations that are delivered at a local level.  In addition, managing and transferring risk against pension schemes that are increasingly frozen and largely underfunded. And finally, after continuing to work through the worst economic recession in the last 7 years, clients are just beginning to renew their focus on talent, retention, development and engagement, to prepare themselves for potential renewed growth long-term.","Turning to the individual businesses. In Consulting Services, organic revenue growth was 5% compared to a decline of 1% in the prior-year quarter. The results reflect strong demand for delegated pension risk management and investment consulting services, strong growth in talent rewards and solid growth across our businesses in Asia. The results are partially offset by a decline in discretionary spend for material [ph] services in core retirement consulting internationally.","In outsourcing, organic revenue growth improved to 4% compared to a decline of 2% in the prior-year quarter. We saw strong growth in HR BPO from both new client wins and in discretionary products and services such as dependent eligibility audits. We also saw a modest growth in Benefits Administration driven by net client wins and an increase in project-related revenue, partially offset by anticipated price compression.","Overall, in HR Solutions, we delivered solid organic revenue performance in the third quarter and continue to execute on strategic investments that will drive additional long-term growth across our industry-leading platform.","Slide 5 highlights the third topic. Further areas of investment. We believe Aon is in a unique position. Solid long-term operating performance, combined with expense discipline and strong free cash flow, continues to enable substantial investment in colleagues and capabilities around the globe. A few examples include: In HR Solutions, we're making significant investments to strengthen our industry-leading position in health care exchanges, both in the retiree and active markets. Health care exchanges enable clients to begin the shift of their participants to a more market-based defined contribution model for health care, while addressing unsustainable health care cost increases and decreasing population health.","While already a leader in the retiree market, we recently announced the launch of the industry's first and only fully-insured multicarrier corporate health care exchange, with more than 100,000 participants. Really outstanding progress in this area as we look to scale it in 2013 and 2014.","We're expanding our outsourcing offerings in high-growth areas such as dependent eligibility audits. We continue to expand our industry-leading benefits administration solutions and technology from large market to middle market. And we're developing new delegated solutions in investment consulting and pension risk management that leverage our total capabilities across advisory and delivery services. A great example in this area was our recent advisory work for a large client around pension settlement and derisking activities which led to one of the largest insured annuity settlement transactions in U.S. history.","Finally, we're strengthening our international footprint to support our global workforce, with investments in key talent and capabilities across Asia and emerging markets.","In Risk Solutions, we're investing in client leadership to drive greater productivity and efficiency with the rollout of the revenue engine internationally, as well as the rollout of Client Promise, which is driving greater retention and rollover rates.","We continue to invest in innovative technology such as the Global Risk Insight Platform. GRIP is the world's leading global database of risk and insurance placement information. We now have more than 1.5 million trades, more than $76 billion of bound premium and a growing client list of insurance carriers utilizing the platform for its analytics and servicing capabilities.","In addition, we're driving around broking initiative to better match client needs with insurer appetite for risk as highlighted by our ability to package similar risks and place substantial programs and facilities into the market on behalf of clients.","Effective January 1, we aligned our global Health and Benefits platform to better capitalize on our global distribution channel and deep Brokerage capabilities.","Finally, we're spending our footprint through tuck-in acquisitions that either increase scale in emerging markets or expand capability to better serve clients, as well as adding key talent across Asia in specialty sectors and in our GRIP services business.","Overall, we've proved the concept of these major investments and begun to scale these opportunities in 2012. And as we complete 2012 and move into 2013, we are on plan to deliver greater scale and increased operating leverage.","In summary, we delivered improved organic revenue growth across both Risk and HR Solutions, made significant strategic investments that will deliver greater long-term growth and took important steps to strengthen our global firm, highlighted by the re-domicile from Chicago to London, completed earlier this year. With key numbers of the management team now fully reallocated to London, and as a U.K. headed multinational group, we're seeing increased interaction with international and emerging market clients, strengthening our relationship with the London markets, increasing our international brand awareness and driving financial benefits related to the transaction.","With that said, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Christa for further financial review. Christa?","Christa Davies","Thanks so much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg noted, our performance reflects solid organic revenue growth and significant steps to strengthen our global firm. From a financial perspective, our third quarter results overall exceeded our previous expectations.  We continue to drive a set of initiatives to improve our operating performance, deliver savings from our formal restructuring programs and generate strong free cash flow growth. We are effectively allocating capital, as highlighted by the repurchase of 275 million of ordinary shares in the quarter. I would note, this is more share repurchase than we've done in any quarter in the past year, and is reflection, in our belief, in the strength of the firm.","Now, let me turn to the financial results as highlighted on Page 6 of the presentation. Our core EPS performance, excluding certain items, increased 8% to $0.95 per share for the third quarter compared to $0.88 in the prior-year quarter. Results reflect solid organic growth, restructuring savings, a lower effective tax rate and effective capital management in the quarter.","Certain items that were adjusted for in core EPS performance and highlighted in the schedules on Page 12 of the press release include noncash intangible asset amortization, restructuring charges and $4 million of re-domicile costs, primarily for legal and advisory fees with the completed re-domicile on April 2.","Foreign currency translation did not have a material impact on earnings per share in the quarter. If currency would have remained stable at today's rates, we would expect a very modest unfavorable translation impact to EPS in the fourth quarter of 2012.","Now, let me talk about each of the segments on the next slide.","In our Risk Solutions segment, organic revenue growth was 3%, operating margin decreased 20 basis points to 20%, and operating income decreased 1% versus the prior-year quarter. Included in operating income was a $10 million impact related to both unfavorable foreign currency translation and a decline in investment income from lower short-term interest rates globally.","Organic revenue growth and restructuring savings primarily absorbed the significant investments we are making in our GRIP platform and in key talent across Asia and Latin America.","Let me spend a moment on the formal restructuring programs, key initiatives that have enabled concurrent funding investments and long-term structural margin expansion.","With respect to the Aon Benfield program, savings in the third quarter are estimated at $36 million compared to $30 million in the prior-year quarter. The Aon Benfield program is expected to deliver cumulative expense savings of $146 million in 2012 compared to the cumulative savings of $122 million in 2011.  Further, associated with the transfer of the Health and Benefits business at January 1, 2012, an estimated $46 million of restructuring savings under the Aon Hewitt program will be achieved in Risks Solutions. Approximately $33 million of the $46 million in cumulative savings have been achieved under the program, including an estimated $7 million of incremental savings in the third quarter. A breakout of restructuring charges is incurred in Risk Solutions, associated with the Aon Hewitt program, is detailed in the schedules on Page 13 of the press release.","For the first 9 months of 2012, Risk Solutions margin is up 10 basis points, and Risk Solutions operating income is up 2%, absorbing significant investments in the business, lower investment income and unfavorable foreign currency translation. We continue to expect strong operating performance in the fourth quarter driven by seasonal strength, less investment spend and increased return on investments as we begin to scale long-term initiatives, resulting in margin expansion for the full year and placing up on track to deliver our long-term target of 26%.","Turning to the HR Solutions segment. Organic revenue growth was 4%. Operating margin increased 150 basis points to 17.5%, and operating income increased 11% compared to the prior-year quarter. Included was a $5 million favorable impact from FX. Organic revenue growth of 4%, $20 million of incremental restructuring savings and an increase in cost that were deferred related to the timing of large client implementations, more than offset our significant investments in long-term growth initiatives and an unfavorable revenue mix shift.","With respect to the Aon Hewitt restructuring program, we incurred $16 million of charges in the quarter. Cumulative savings related to the formal restructuring program in the third quarter are estimated at $64 million compared to $37 million in the prior-year quarter, of which approximately $7 million of the incremental savings were achieved in the Risk segment.","At the beginning of the year, we provided specific comments regarding the outlook for HR Solutions in 2012: Number one, we expect improved organic growth in both businesses in 2012; number two, we would invest approximately $35 million in new growth opportunities, primarily our health care exchanges, HR BPO, investment consulting and pension risk management; number three, approximately 75% of the restructuring savings would be realized in adjusted operating income; number four, expected performance would improve in the second half of the year, primarily as investment spend decreases in the second half from the first half.","Overall, our results reflect a solid performance in the third quarter, and we are on track with the plans that we had laid out at the beginning of the year. We are always cautious not to overplay the results of one quarter.","With the fourth quarter, we expect continued organic growth to deliver on restructuring savings and make further progress against key investments, resulting in operating income and margin up modestly, similar to our previous guidance, placing us on track for improved performance in 2013.","Turning to the next slide, on our long-term operating margin targets. We continue to drive a set of initiatives to improve operating performance on an annual basis. While we've improved operating margins 500 basis points over the last 6 years, our long-term operating margin target of 26% for Risk Solutions reflects significant opportunity for further margin improvement in the following 5 ways: Number one, deliver $20 million of remaining restructuring savings and deliver other operational improvements; number two, continued rollout of the revenue engine internationally; number three, Aon Broking and GRIP-related initiatives. These 3 are fully within our control. In addition, there were 2 additional macro drivers that provide significant operating leverage based on improvements in the external markets; number four, increases in short-term interest rates; and number five, industry improvements, driving higher insured values or insurance pricing.","Similarly, for HR Solutions, while we've improved operating margins nearly 1,200 basis points over the last 6 years, our long-term operating margin target of 22% reflects significant opportunity for further margin improvement in the following 3 ways: number one, deliver $56 million of remaining restructuring savings after the transfer of savings for Health and Benefits; number two, growth in the core business and return on incremental investments, including health care exchanges; number three, improvements in HR BPO.","Now, let me discuss a few of the line items outside of the operating segments on the next slide. Unallocated expenses were $46 million, including nonrecurring costs for certain employee benefit plans and increased operating expenses related to the re-domicile. Interest income decreased $3 million due to lower average interest rates and average cash balances. Interest expense decreased $3 million due primarily to a decline in the average rate on total debt outstanding. Other expense had an unfavorable impact of $7 million, including a $16 million loss on the unfavorable impact of exchange rates on remeasurement of assets and liabilities in nonfunctional currencies, partially offset by gains on certain company-owned life insurance plans and other long-term investments.","Going forward, we expect a run rate of approximately $1 million per quarter of interest income, $40 million of unallocated expense and $60 million of interest expense per quarter.","Turning to taxes. The effective tax rate on net income from continuing operations decreased to 23.2% in the third quarter compared to 28.9% in the prior-year quarter. The effective tax rate in the third quarter of 2012 was favorably impacted by certain discrete tax adjustments. We currently anticipate an effective tax rate of approximately 26% in the fourth quarter of 2012 and going forward, excluding any discrete tax adjustments.","Lastly, average diluted shares outstanding decreased to 331 million in the third quarter compared to 336.9 million in the prior-year quarter, due primarily to our share repurchase program. The company repurchased 5.4 million Class A ordinary shares for approximately $275 million in the third quarter and has approximately 4.5 billion of remaining authorization actual shares outstanding on September 30 were 318.7 million, and there are approximately 10.4 million dilutive equivalents.","Now, let me turn to the next slide to highlight our strong balance sheet and cash flow. At September 30, cash and short-term investments were $1 billion, and total debt outstanding was $4.4 billion. Overall debt to capital was 34.6% at September 30 compared to 35.7% at December 31. Cash flow from operations increased 63% to $598 million compared to $368 million in the prior-year quarter.","Despite a higher organic growth rate, low working capital requirements more than offset an increase in cash taxes and cash contributions to the major pension plans in the quarter. Furthermore, we continue to operate with elevated levels of invoicing and cash collections, approximately $375 million related to a delay in invoicing in Aon Hewitt which began in the second half of 2011 with the conversion of certain order to cash systems.","Free cash flow, as defined by cash flow from operations less CapEx, increased 66% to $526 million compared to $316 million in the prior-year quarter. The increase in free cash flow reflects a 63% increase in cash flow from operations, partially offset by a $20 million increase in CapEx.","Turning to the next slide to discuss our long-term financial flexibility. Regarding our underfunded pension plans, we've taken significant steps to reduce volatility and liability as we've closed plans new entrants, frozen plans from accruing additional benefits and continued to de-risk certain plan assets.","In 2011, we contributed approximately $477 million to our plans. In prior quarters, we had noted that 2012 contributions were expected to be $541 million before any discretionary contributions, primarily reflecting a decline in discount rates from 2011.","On September 30, we completed a merger of 5 of the 7 legacy Aon and Hewitt U.K. pension schemes into a single plan. In addition to decreased management time and improved governance, additional benefits are expected to be derived through improved operating efficiencies, reduced adviser and asset management costs and a high level of control over investments.  In conjunction with this transaction, we made a discretionary contribution of approximately $80 million.  As a result, we now expect pension contributions to be $641 million in 2012 and would expect contributions to decline annually beginning in 2013, despite a decline in discount rates year-to-date, resulting in fully funded plans on a GAAP basis in 2016.","Regarding our restructuring plans, cash payments were $178 million in 2011. As our restructuring plans continue to wind down, we would expect cash payments to decline $29 million to approximately $149 million in 2012 before declining further in 2013.","As we continue to grow, improve operating performance and our required uses of cash decline over the next several years, we expect our strong free cash flow to be a significant source of value creation for shareholders. As an important step in unlocking that value for shareholders, on April 2, the company completed its change in jurisdiction of incorporation from Delaware to the U.K  We believe the transaction will help drive shareholder value through: Number one, providing greater global access to expected increases in future free cash flow; number two, enable us to access roughly $300 million of excess capital held internationally on our balance sheet; number three, increase future cash flows through a significant reduction in our global tax rate over the long term, more than we've done over the last 5 years, which is approximately 500 basis points.","In summary, we are on track for stronger growth in 2012, and we have significant leverage through an improving global economy. While we're investing to further strengthen our industry-leading portfolio, we are focused on 3 primary areas that will each contribute to substantially stronger free cash flow over the next several years: First is continued growth and operating margin improvement towards our long-term targets; second, declining uses of cash to pension and restructuring; third, greater capital flexibility and increased cash flow from a lower effective tax rate resulting from our re-domicile to the U.K. Combined with a strong balance sheet and greater financial flexibility, we've positioned the firm to significant shareholder value creation.","With that, I'd like to call -- turn the call back over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Adam Klauber of William Blair.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Could you tell us how much, to date, have you invested in the health care exchanges? And how much, I guess, total do you expect invest? And could you talk about -- I realize it's a very long-term process, but what's the potential of ramp-up in clients in the different exchanges?","Gregory C. Case","Well, as of -- on the health care exchange front, as we've made a number of investments that we talked about and very excited about the overall platform. To date, we targeted, as we said before, about $75 million in the investment, about $40 million, which was last year and $35 million in this year in 2012. And pleased to say, we were able to launch our first-ever, as I described before, corporate exchange, which is coming live in the fourth quarter. It's the first time this ever occurred, 100,000 lives. Very excited about that. And as you know, we've got a very, very strong retiree exchange as well and our Navigators exchange. Just for context, if you think about it, there are 48 million eligible retirees out there. And an additional context on the corporate side, 122 million active employees today. And all of those are in an environment in which sort of increasing health care costs are clearer everywhere, employers are looking for ways to actually sort through that complexity. Not only are costs going up but health is actually deteriorating. So we see a substantial amount of opportunity in this is over the long term. And that's why we made the investments and are very excited about these platforms and what they can mean for us. As we said at the first quarter, we see the real impact happening more in '14, '15, et cetera. We're going to see impact in '13, but it's really going to happen in '14 and '15, so these are investments for the long term. But I would say, much like the overall story for Aon Hewitt, we feel very good about these, these are stable on track and actually progressing just as we thought they would and are excited about the overall investment.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And just one follow-up. HR margins were clearly good. Were there any sort of onetime or favorable items that helped the margins this quarter?","Christa Davies","What I would say is it was a little better than our expectations. A lot of things moved in the right direction, and we do believe that we're on track with previous guidance with operating income up modestly in Q4 and continued progress in 2013.","Operator","The next question is coming from Jay Cohen, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","A couple of questions. I guess, sticking with HR and the margins, you did refer to some, I guess, deferred expenses, which sounded like it helped the earnings. Can you explain what that is? And if they're deferred, does that mean higher expenses in later periods?","Christa Davies","Right. Great question, Jay. So the third costs are really related to the timing of large client implementations and so when clients go live, we defer those costs from the P&L on to the balance sheet. So that's essentially the way mechanics work. And it's really just related to the timing of when clients go live. And so, that was a significant impact on the quarter and continues to be a part of the way we operate the economics of the business.","Gregory C. Case","But I think about, Jay, [ph] overall, about just how margin's going to progress, Jay, as we described before. We intend to make progress year to year. Third quarter is an indication that we step forward, as we reflect on 2012. When we finish Q4, we believe we'll have made a modest progress as Christa described. And we believe we're well-positioned to make modest progress in '13 and continue on the march for the 22% target.","Christa Davies","Just one other note, Jay. We are deferring revenue that's matching those deferred expenses, so we're matching revenue and expense. So you're not going to get some incremental expense going forward without the incremental revenue.","Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it, now that make sense. And then separately, if you can give us an update on GRIP. I don't know if you can talk about how many insurance companies you've got signed up to the platform and what your goals are for that product?","Gregory C. Case","Well, as we've described before, and if you think about GRIP in the context of what we're trying to accomplish on the overall Risk Solutions platform, what we said before, when you think about how we grow the business, we can increase the number of clients, increase the wallet share we've got with them or increase the yield per dollar of premium placed. And that's exactly squarely where the GRIP world fits, increasing yield per dollar premium placed. And it really is -- it's -- for us, it's about how we put the platform in place and how we build it over time. And as you described, Jay, we made very good progress with it. We've got, as I described before, almost $80 billion of premium sort of in the GRIP system. We've talked before about multiple carriers who've signed on to this, substantially proven the concept, as we described before. And what we see in '12 is we're really rolling that out. And it's really having substantial impact not only with our carriers but with our clients, this having a substantial impact in helping us really match capital with client need in a very substantial way, and it's increased our level of service. So we're very positive on the GRIP platform, and it really is the reason. As we said in Q1, we've seen so much progress with it, we proved the concept and now, we're scaling up the concept as we roll out the platform.","Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","But no disclosure on how many insurance companies are on the platform at this point?","Gregory C. Case","Yes, it's really not about the number. It's really about what we're trying to do and how we're actually increasing the yield per dollar of premium placed. So you're going to see the impact of GRIP show up in that yield, show up in margin over time. And it's much more -- it's much deeper than just literally market by market. We're actually seeing benefits beyond just signing off insurance markets.","Operator","The next question is coming from Brian Meredith of UBS.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes. Just a couple of quick ones here. First, Christa, is it possible to give us what the capital markets benefit was for the reinsurance organic revenue growth rate this quarter?","Christa Davies","Hang on. Just looking for that. I think it was like 100 basis points, roughly.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. Excellent. And then Christa, another quick question here. On the tax rate guidance, the 26% for the remainder of the year, is that -- when I think about your 500 basis points that you're going to get over -- or more than 500 basis points from the redomestication, is that kind of the baseline I should be thinking about?","Christa Davies","So we did start -- before the transaction, our effective tax rate was 29%. And so you can see we're making progress on the benefits of the move to the U.K. already with the tax rate decline from 29% to 26% this quarter. And so, and we did say this quarter, the tax rate benefits from the transaction would be more than 500 basis points. So what I would say in regards to that is we had an overall plan in place and as we continue to execute on that plan, and we get more certainty on it, we'll continue to update you.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got you. And then -- and just lastly, I just want to follow-up on Jay's question. Is there any way that you could actually qualify where the deferral in revenues and expenses were in the quarter with respect to the HR Solutions business? Just so we can kind of look at the different ratios and how they're really kind of working?","Christa Davies","Yes, we did say it was significant. We haven't revealed that number. And look, we would say it's related to the timing of large client implementations in both our BPO and benefits administration station business. And it will be lumpy by quarter as client implementations phase in.","Operator","The next question is coming from Ray Iardella of Macquarie.","Raymond Iardella - Macquarie Research","Just, I guess, 2 questions for me. First, maybe talk a little bit about the construction business. You mentioned some weakness there, I think, in the U.S. Just curious, one of your competitors suggested it might be getting a little bit better. Just curious what you guys are seeing?","Gregory C. Case","Yes, it's -- as you know, we've got a very, very strong construction business, not only across the U.S., but really globally. The most significant in the industry. It is a sector which we like a lot for the long term. In fact, irrespective -- you kind of look at the analysis a lot of different ways, but you're in the trillions when you think about sort of the infrastructure build that's going to be required around the globe, we've estimates 10 trillion to 15 trillion over the course of the next couple of decades. So we love the sector. We love the space. And we've simply made the most significant set of investments in this space. But in that regard, this has been a headwind for us for the last number of quarters. With the headwind for us this quarter, we definitely see some potential positive signs. But for us, this is a very, very substantial bet, bigger than anyone else's. And as we start to see benefits, we think they will be substantial, but for now, we see progress, then we see good pipeline, but we haven't seen it in the quarter yet.","Christa Davies","And I just wanted to follow-up with Brian's question earlier on reinsurance revenues. The capital markets impact in the quarter was closer to 200 basis points of organic revenue growth. And I would want to note that Q4 2011 was a significant capital markets quarter. And so, as we think about Q4 2012, that will be a difficult comparable.","Raymond Iardella - Macquarie Research","And one other follow-up, if I could. In terms of M&A, just curious, I mean, do you guys kind of see going out, the pipeline still looking pretty good? And is that, I believe you talked about in the past, $200 million to $300 million of cash kind of allocated towards M&A?","Gregory C. Case","That's exactly where we continue to be. For us, really, is take a step back, Ray. This is -- we like the platform and the portfolio we've put in place. It's taken us 6 to 7 years to get here. As you think about sort of the addition of Benfield, the addition of Hewitt to the mix and a number of acquisitions that have been really tucked in to build content and capability for us, for us, the M&A strategy is not about size, it's about adding true content, capability that will support our clients. And in that regard, we really continue to see the $200 million to $300 million investments in these smaller tuck-in acquisitions around the world to really being part of the formal part of the strategy.","Operator","Your next question is coming from Michael Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just quickly, Christa, on the reinsurance piece. I imagine the guidance that you've kind of put out there contemplates the reinsurance trend that you're talking about, is that right?  For 4Q?","Christa Davies","Yes, it does.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then one question was on the buybacks. How much of the buyback in the third quarter was funded from the additional funds made available via redomestication? And kind of how much is left, I guess?","Christa Davies","Yes. Look, as we think about buybacks for calendar year 2012, we are on track to buy back more in 2012 than 2011. And obviously, we gave guidance at the beginning of the year, that was close to $150 million a quarter, plus use of the international cash on the balance sheet. And we just think about it as an overall pool, including the cash flow of the company and the cash that's shored up in some [ph] investments on the balance sheet.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it, okay. And then can you elaborate a bit on your comments? I mean, Greg, the -- in the press release about the Europe impact on discretionary consulting? And maybe also, on a related note, the increase in discretionary demand for BPO. Just want to understand that of how that's fits with the macro in Europe.","Gregory C. Case","Yes. Really, the overall macro point, which is really the key one here you're raising, Michael, is really we see certainly, pressure around the world, as you read about everyday and we see it, really, from every corner of the world. But it's different. And right now, as we look at the sort of the global landscape, there's certainly pressure in the European quadrant. It happens to be a place where we have substantial, very strong and solid basis. And it's just part of how Aon was built over time. And in that context, what we're seeing is essentially, if you're client, in that context, if you've got something you can defer, you can push back, from a discretionary standpoint, you're going to do that. So that, really, is the comment on discretionary spend and sort of the pressure we're seeing in the context of that. But having said that, the platform we've got is exceptionally strong. And this is not B2C business, this is really B2B. And at the end of the day, at the heart of it, clients have risk issues and people issues. And that's why even in the context in the sort of the -- if you think about what's happened over the last number of years, Aon has grown the business every year, I mean, except for one, and that was we were, I think, down 1%. So we've essentially been able to, in the face of very strong economic headwinds, continue to grow the business and build the business, that's really one of the hallmarks of the overall platform of Aon, and it's one of the things we build upon. So there's a lot of pressure and it's had impact on the quarter, but there's a lot number of things we can do sort of against that. And then from a BPO standpoint, this is really about the HR topic more broadly and just overall, when you think about the things we are looking and taking the clients to sort of combat this sort of issue of discretionary spend, are things that can really have impact for them in the near-term. Things like dependent eligibility audits, leave of absence reviews, things like that. Project revenues that we can really help them improve the operating performance of their business in the near term. But these are the things we're actually bringing to them now that are  different. So the mix has changed a bit, the pressure is real, but Aon's got a very strong platform to deal with it.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And then lastly, the retail U.S. in Risk, what happened there? I mean, you mentioned a little bit about exposures and we've heard a lot about pressure on exposures in U.S. risk. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing there and maybe the balance of that versus the other aspects of North America?","Gregory C. Case","Yes. Let's step back. As we talked about on the retail side, 2% growth sort of in the Americas in the quarter, and that really comes across all the Americas. But we would reflect overall, Michael, 3% year-to-date. So that's the number I'd sort of have you think about. That's roughly where we expect sort  of the year to play out. We obviously aspire for more across-the-board, and we're making substantial investments to achieve that. And those are starting to really make a difference a la the GRIP question from before. But that's roughly how we're looking at it. Remember, we've got a few sectors on the -- and we talked about construction before and a few others that we've made particular investments in that we like a lot but have particular headwinds for us sort of in the near term, and that really is what constrains us a bit. But we feel like the growth profile that we've achieved year-to-date is meaningful, and will continue going forward.","Operator","The next question is coming from Matthew Heimermann of JPMorgan Chase.","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","A couple of questions. First, just on the BPO business, when you guys acquired Hewitt, that was a business that basically had no margin whatsoever. And I think one of the goals was to, one, reprice that business. And as you put new business on, that old business rolled off, you get margin gains. So I guess, my question is at this point in the game, have we seen any material margin contribution from that? Or is that to come when we think about some of the implementation revenues that you were talking about earlier?","Christa Davies","Yes. Look, we are very pleased with the improvement in that business. It now does have positive margins, so we continue to sort of improve margins over time. We're working very hard to get them to a 15% margin by 2015, as we originally outlined as part of the transaction.","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. So still more to go when we think 2013 versus '12, and '14 versus '13, '15 versus '14, et cetera?","Christa Davies","Absolutely, yes. It's continued improvement year-over-year.","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then, just with respect to the timing issue on margins, right, so there's some expenses that don't show up but there's also revenue that doesn't show up. So when we think about the margins you reported in the quarter, I mean, you implied that was a positive. If you had, had both the expenses in the revenue show up, should we have thought about margins differently than what we saw this quarter?","Christa Davies","Yes. Look, I think I wouldn't over induct too much from one quarter. I'd look more at the year because things do move sort of -- and there were a few things that moves in our direction in Q3. And so, as you look at the overall year, that's a good indication. Deferred expenses and deferred revenue both happen and match, you're right. But deferred cost did have a positive impact on the quarterly results. But again, look at the overall year, and we really think that our operating income and operating margins will continue to improve in 2013.","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. It just -- it seemed like when you first answered, I just was following-up from the standpoint that when you first answered the question, it sounded more negative, then on the follow-up, it sounded neutral, and then it sounded a little negative again. So the real takeaway is there's always noise quarter-to-quarter, and so it might've been a little bit positive-negative, but we shouldn't play that forward in any way, shape or form.","Christa Davies","That's exactly right, Matthew. Yes, that's right.","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then the last question just on exchanges. I mean, the right way to track your progress in this business over the next couple of years, I'm assuming is going to be more about the lives you have in the exchanges than the client wins? But obviously, they are linked. So I wanted to just, one, make sure that, that was correct. And two, when we think about the -- obviously, we need client wins to drive lives. But give us a sense of how, from the outside perspective, what some of the data points on the client side we should kind of think about over the next couple of years to kind of measure progress here?","Gregory C. Case","So, Matthew, you're exactly right. Again, what we're doing here is we've launched 2 exchanges. We have 2 businesses that one's been in place, the Navigators on the retiree side, against a pool of 48 million eligible retirees over time. That's been in place for a number of years, is tracking well, and we are adding clients to that. And then we've launched the corporate exchange. As I described before, this is different set against the set of 122 million active employees. And you're exactly right. What we want to able to do is these need to be up and running, which they are. Running well, which they are. Adding new clients, which we are. And you're tracking that over time and tracking the number of lives that we're actually able serve. We're excited about, as we said before, with 100,000 lives in the corporate exchange, we're truly proving a concept. It's something that's never been done before that gives CFOs and heads of HR and business leaders, the opportunity to really deal with the increasing health care costs, but do it in a way that they can serve their employee base as well. And we're quite excited about that. So in many respects, we've got 2 highly viable new businesses up and running that really are changing the shape and the foundation of how businesses think about health care coverage over time. And so for us, it is making sure we've solidly proven those concepts and then growing those overtime. And you're exactly right, for 2013, it's about how we add companies and clients to that list, and then how we add lives to that list. And that's exactly what we are on track to do.","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then just -- yes, I'm sorry.","Christa Davies","And as we think about the economic model of health care exchanges for us, we're earning a commission on the premium placed which is a very attractive economic model. And as we scale participants overtime, that becomes more economic. And that's really how the return comes in sort of 2014 onwards.","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Well, I'm assuming you also get some economics from the administration piece of it, correct, which was -- which is kind of an HR benefits administration-like service, correct?","Christa Davies","A little bit, yes.","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then I just wanted to clarify one other issue. I mean, a lot of the conversations around us now with -- who knows what's going to happen with the election, but obviously, people are talking about possibilities that they didn't -- weren't talking about maybe a month ago. But can you talk -- I mean, I think there's a perception out there that this is -- your investment is basically a binary outcome on Obamacare. Can you tell us why that's not the case? I have my own view, but I'd like to hear yours.","Gregory C. Case","Well, I really appreciate you raising that because we don't see -- the election, obviously, of interest to everyone, but doesn't really have a particular impact directly on the investments we're making here. And again, if you step back, just think about the corporate exchange for a minute. 122 million active employees today, when you think about the companies, in their opinions. We've actually surveyed -- if you remember, we actually have access and connections to, literally, in top thousand companies around the world, all their heads of HR and all their CFOs. 94% have committed to health care coverage. So overwhelmingly saying, we're going to provide some way. We're going to make sure there's coverage available so no one's going to walk away here. And only 1\/3 really have a strategy to do that. So there's a great opportunity for us to help them bring clarity to what that space looks like. And we actually surveyed them, and even without an exchange in place, a full 43% of them have said, they're willing to try an exchange. So just think about that in the context sort of the overall corporate environment. A tremendous opportunity of companies saying, \"My gosh, we have a problem. \" And remember, Obamacare, or whatever you want to describe it, health care coverage as it currently exists, doesn't fundamentally address the issue of expense here at all, nor does it address the issue of wellness. So expense is going up, and wellness is going down. That is a fundamental reality and that's where we're really helping companies think through. So it's really independent of political parties, it's independent of policy, it's a fundamental business set of reasons, which are driving our investment in health care exchanges, and that's why we're so excited about them. Fundamentally, we win when our clients win. And in this case, there is a massive, massive issue for them that they've got to address, and this is a very viable platform for them to address that issue.","Operator","The next question is coming from Greg Locraft of Morgan Stanley.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","All right. I wanted to just clarify 2 things. One, for Christa. You called out that the capital markets or the reinsurance comparables are a difficult one for the fourth quarter. You also quantified the impact for this quarter. Can you do the same for the fourth, just give us the exact numbers?","Christa Davies","For the fourth quarter...","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","In terms of what it was last year so we can model accordingly.","Christa Davies","Almost all of it what was capital markets in Q4 2011 is a good way to think about it. It keeps...","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Almost all the growth?","Christa Davies","[indiscernible] smallest quarter for reinsurance.","Gregory C. Case","Yes. It's both a combination, really. Q4 is the smallest quarter for us and we just had a very, very -- it was a great client-to-client example for us, but a very substantial win in Q4 last year. And that's not going to be here this year. So in that context, that's really the market comparable. And this is really just the fundamental issue around the lumpiness of our fact business and our capital markets business. Be clear, we expect to grow this business over time. We expect modes growth in this business over time. The Aon Benfield platform is just done wonderfully well. As both Christa and I described, 6 consecutive quarters of treaty net wins. By the way, we see treaty growth positive in the fourth quarter, although as Christa described, our smallest quarter, but it's just going to be offset by a substantial, substantial transaction that happened in Q4 2011.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, great. And then again, another clarifying question. On Risk Solutions, Greg, you mentioned I guess macro headwinds, macro concerns. Is this -- was your commentary directed towards just be HR business? Just towards Risk Solutions, or the entire corporation? Can you just expand a little as we think about the organic going forward, especially for Risk Solutions? That's where I'm most focused.","Gregory C. Case","Well, let's say on Risk solutions. I mean, there is, on Risk Solutions front, we've seen positive pricing trends for the last number of quarters as we saw -- as we described sort of from the GRIP analytics that have -- a healthy overall industry. Against that context, you have an economy that creates the headwinds that come against that around discretionary spend and then all the pieces in the context of that. We're not going to change our view. It's basically -- it remains fragile. We're going to work through it, we're going to grow organically in the context of it. But those are some the macro headwinds I was trying to describe. And then underlying that is just the capital buildup that continues to happen in the overall insurance industry, and we're always mindful of that. But as we said before, we have a name. We're going to grow organically. We're going to improve margins. We're going to increase earnings per share. And we're going to do it irrespective of the environment, and we expect to do that in Risk Solutions in 2013.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just one follow-up there, and I know you've talked about this in the past, but just can you remind us, in Risk Solutions, what's sort of your minimum organic that you need to grow the operating margins? Sounds like almost in any world, you think you can do it. But sort of how do we think about that sensitivity of whatever organic we come up with relative to your ability to drive the margins?","Christa Davies","Yes. I would give you 2 ways to think about this, Greg. The first is, in the depth of the economic recession where insurance rates were 5% to 10% down real, and we had declines in insured values which were a much bigger impact on the firm, the worst we saw in 2009 was minus 1% organic revenue growth. So the investments we're making allow us to sort of outgrow that. The other way, I guess, I would say is we have a natural, if you think about sort of the margin expansion, we have a natural inflationary portion in the expense base. So let's call that sort of 2%, that we need to sort of grow over to expand margins.","Operator","The next question is coming from Mike Zaremski of Credit Suisse.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Quick follow-up on the exchange. So one of your competitors recently acquired an active exchange. So if we -- will the economics of your corporate exchange be similar to that one if we study the one that one that Towers Watson owns?","Gregory C. Case","Well, remember the Extend Health that, I believe you're talking about with Towers Watson, is a retiree exchange. So this is really analogous to our Aon Hewitt Navigators business. So we have had that in place for a number of years. And I said before, love the platform, love the progress that the teams made with it, and that continues to build and grow. And that would be more of a direct competitor from that standpoint. We then would separate an additional platform we have that doesn't exist anywhere else, and that's the corporate exchange. So this is 2 separate businesses, 2 separate initiatives we're taking sort of in the context of this, and building both of those businesses. And the corporate exchange, as I described before, is really the first of its kind. And it really is the first of its kind that addresses the great -- the pool I described, the 122 million-plus of active employee. So it's really 2 separate businesses.","Christa Davies","And in terms of the economics, I would say, obviously the Extend Health is a good proxy for our retirement exchange business. As we think about our corporate exchange business, it's leveraging the platform we already have in benefits administration, and we're selling to the same client base, and so we already have a scaled platform to operate that business.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. Okay, I know you guys are doing, I think, a mini-teach-in on this in a month. So I will learn more there. Okay. Next on the pension. I was just curious. So given the drop in interest rates in both the U.S. and Europe this year, could your 2013 pension contribution cash flow projections change? And related, I know there's been a couple large corporate pension plans solution transactions announced recently. I think you guys were actually involved in the one with Verizon and Prudential. Is Aon exploring a solution as well for its pension deficit?","Christa Davies","So what I would say is we've taken steps already, over the last couple of years, to mitigate volatility in the size and risk of our pension plans. We've closed plans new entrants, we've frozen the benefits and we've derisked the impulsion of the plans. And I did note in my earlier comments that, on September 30, we made a move to aggregate 5 of the 7 Aon and legacy Hewitt plans into one plan in the U.K. And as a result of that, we've substantially decreased the costs of running those plans. And we made an additional contribution of $80 million that was discretionary. And so, our contributions in 2012 will be $641 million. And they will decline in 2013 despite the decline in discount rates in 2012. And the other thing I would note is that pension expense will also decline in 2013 as a result of the move we've made. Our pension plans are much less volatile, they're derisks. And if rates go lower potentially, there's also upside if they go higher.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. That make sense. In regards to a solution, is that something you guys always are thinking about? Kind of a...","Christa Davies","You should think we think of everything, and we look at everything.","Operator","The next question is coming from Paul Newsome, Sandler O'Neill.","Paul Newsome","The -- I missed what the description of the discrete benefits for the -- on the tax. Could you give us a little color on that? As well as could you talk about, prospectively, is the decline in the effective tax rate that we are looking at principally do the elimination of extraterritorial taxation or is there other stuff going on there as well?","Christa Davies","So as we think about the overall sort of effective tax rate and the decline from 29% at the beginning of calendar year 2012 to the 26% we've announced to Q4 2012 and going forward, we are making progress on the benefits of the move to the U.K. with that effective tax rate decline. We have an overall plan in place, and as we continue to execute on that plan and get more certainty on it, we'll continue to update you. With respect to the quarter and the tax rate from continuing operations, it's -- it declined to 23.2%, and that was a result of certain discrete tax adjustments, principally from our tax return in 2011. As you think about your model going forward, 26% is the right go forward rate.","Paul Newsome","Okay. And separately, I just -- more out of curiosity than anything, the cash restructuring payments that you talked about go out in as far as of 2015. What are the characteristics of those kind of cash restructuring charges that you'd see that far out from when you [indiscernible]","Christa Davies","Yes, it's mostly lease payment. As you think about restructuring leases and closing down activities, if you refer to sort of Page 11, it gives you those restructuring cash payments out over time. And it is mainly related to leases because the people costs happen fairly quickly.","Paul Newsome","And then finally, the $300 million in cash that was going to be freed up from the change in domicile, has that been moved up to the parent or we -- is that something, possibly in the future, we'll see...","Christa Davies","Yes, as -- we think about, as I said earlier, as one cash pool. And we access that, and we think about returning the returns on the cash pool maximized through return on capital, measured on a cash-on-cash basis. And we are disproportionately allocating it towards share buyback given we believe we're substantially undervalued, hence the 275 million of share buyback you saw in Q3, which is the most significant we've done in the quarter over the last 12 months.","Operator","No further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back to Mr. Greg Case for closing remarks.","Gregory C. Case","Well, thanks, Catherine. And I just want to say to everybody, thank you very much for your interest in Aon, and we look forward to the next quarterly call. Thanks very much.","Operator","This will conclude today's conference.

If anyone has an objection, you may disconnect your line at this time.","I would also like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded and that it is important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our second quarter 2015 press release, as well as having been posted on our website.","Now, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, President and CEO of Aon Plc.","Gregory C. Case - President, CEO & Executive Director","Thanks very much and good morning, everyone. And welcome to our second quarter 2015 conference call. Joining me here today is our CFO, Christa Davies. And I would note that there are slides available on our website for you to follow along with our commentary today. Consistent with previous quarters, I'd like to cover two areas before turning the call over to Christa for further financial review. First, is our performance against key metrics we communicate to shareholders, and second is overall organic growth performance including continued areas of strategic investment across Aon.","On the first topic, our performance versus key metrics. Each quarter, we measure our performance against the key metrics we focus on achieving over the course of the year: grow organically, expand margins, increase earnings per share and deliver free cash flow growth.","Turning to slide three, in the second quarter, organic revenue growth was 2% overall, with growth across both segments, highlighted by 4% growth in the Americas' retail brokerage business. Operating margin increased 80 basis points reflecting strong operating performance in Risk Solutions. EPS increased 5% to $1.31, including $0.08 unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation, reflecting growth, operating improvement and effective capital management. And finally, free cash flow increased 2% to $223 million year-to-date driven by a 10% increase in cash flow from operations, partially offset by higher capital expenditures.","Turning to slide four, on the second topic of growth and investment. I want to spend the next few minutes discussing the quarter for both of our segments. In Risk Solutions, organic revenue growth was 2% overall, compared to 1% in the prior year quarter, reflecting solid growth across retail brokerage partially offset by a modest decline in Reinsurance. As we discussed previously, we're driving a set of initiatives and making strategic investments that are strengthening underlying performance and position our Risk Solutions segment for long-term growth and improved operating leverage, with management of our renewal book through Aon Client Promise and retention rates of more than 90% on average across retail brokerage.","New business generation of more than $216 million across our retail business, 17 consecutive quarters of net new business trends in core treaty reinsurance, an increased operating leverage from our investments in innovative technology and data and analytics including the Global Risk Insight Platform which now captures over 2.8 million trades and $135 billion of bound premium with more than 40 carriers utilizing the platform today.","Review, our reinsurer dashboard, combined with strategic consulting, tells reinsurers to be more effective markets for ceding company clients. And our Aon Broking initiative to better match client need with insurer appetite for risk and to indemnify structured portfolio solutions. And finally, we're expanding our content and global footprint through tuck-in acquisitions that increase scale in emerging markets or expand capability.","Reflecting on the individual businesses within risk solutions. In the Americas, organic revenue growth was 4% compared to 2% in the prior year quarter. Exposures continue to be positive across the region, while the impact on pricing was modestly negative, resulting in continued stable market impact.","We saw strong growth across Latin America, reflecting both double-digit new business generation and strong management of the renewal book portfolio. We also generated strong growth across our Affinity business. And in U.S. Retail, we saw solid new business generation with record retention of greater than 93% for the second consecutive quarter.","In International, organic revenue growth was 2%. Exposures continue to be stable, and the impact from pricing was modestly negative on average, driven by fragile market conditions in many countries across Europe and pressure in the Pacific region. We saw strong growth across Asia, with double-digit growth in many countries including Hong Kong, China, Japan and Singapore. Results also reflect solid growth in New Zealand, driven by both new business generation and strong management of the renewal book portfolio.","In Continental Europe, new business generation continued to be positive. And with strong leadership across the region, we're well positioned to benefit from potential improvements in the macroeconomic environment.","In Reinsurance, organic revenue declined 1% compared to a decline of 4% in the prior year quarter. Results reflect a significant unfavorable market impact in the quarter as excess capital in the space continues to pressure global treaty pricing. We saw continued new business generation in treaty placements as clients take advantage of lower pricing by purchasing more coverage and strong growth in facultative placements, partially offset by a decline in capital markets transactions. And while the rate of price decline is decelerated compared to the previous year, a record amount of capital continues to place pressure on the market.","And finally, new opportunities for growth combined with industry-leading data and analytics is positioning the business for a return to growth over the next 12 months. Overall, across Risk Solutions, we are on track for low- to mid-single digit organic growth for the full-year 2015 as we continue to drive new business generation, strong retention and take a unified approach to serving clients across the portfolio with industry-leading data and analytics.","Turning to HR Solutions. Organic revenue growth was 2%, similar to the prior-year quarter, with growth across both major businesses and in high demand areas where we have invested in innovative solutions and client-serving capability.","These investments reflect Aon Hewitt's client leadership and in-depth understanding and influence of market trends, including continued investment to strengthen our comprehensive portfolio of health solutions, covering the full spectrum of benefit strategies and funding choices from self-insured to fully insured. This includes our industry-leading position in healthcare exchanges for active employees and retirees and we look forward to updating you on our continued progress later this year.","Solutions to de-risk pension plans and support for delegated investment solutions as clients manage risks against pension schemes that are frozen, largely underfunded and facing regulatory changes. Investment in Software-as-a-Service models in our HR BPO business. And finally, we're expanding our international footprint to support a global workforce at the local level, with investments in key talent and capabilities across emerging markets.","Turning to individual businesses within HR Solutions. In Consulting Services, organic revenue growth was 3% compared to 1% in the prior-year quarter. We saw continued growth in retirement consulting driven by demand for delegated investment consulting services. Results also reflect solid growth and compensation consulting and modest growth in communications consulting.","In Outsourcing, organic revenue growth was 3%, similar to the prior year quarter. We saw growth in HR BPO driven by new client wins in cloud-based solutions. Results also reflect growth in benefits administration driven by demand for discretionary services.","Overall, for HR Solutions, we are on track for mid-single digit organic growth for the full year 2015 driven by growth in high demand areas where we made investments as well as leadership across our core businesses.","In summary, our industry-leading platform of client-serving capabilities across Risk and HR Solutions combined with investments in data and analytics continues to position the firm for long-term organic growth and improved operating leverage.","With that said, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Christa for further financial review. Christa.","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks so much, Greg, and good morning everyone. As Greg noted, our second quarter results reflect double-digit adjusted EPS growth when excluding the impact of FX, driven by organic growth in both Risk and HR Solutions, strong operating margin improvement and effective capital management, including the repurchase of approximately 300 million of ordinary shares in the quarter.","Now, let me turn to financial results for the quarter on page six of the presentation. Our core EPS performance excluding certain items increased 5% to $1.31 per share for the second quarter compared to $1.25 in the prior-year quarter. Certain items that were adjusted for in core EPS performance and highlighted in the schedules on page 12 of the press release include non-cash intangible asset amortization and legacy litigation expenses relating to events that primarily occurred 10 or more years ago.","Further, included in the results was an $0.08 per share unfavorable impact related to foreign currency translation due to the U.S. dollar strengthening against most major currencies. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, our core earnings per share in the second quarter would have been $1.39, up 11% from the prior-year quarter. Going forward, if currency were to remain stable at today's rates, we would expect a similar impact in Q3 and a lesser impact in Q4 as we continue to work through unfavorable year-over-year headwinds.","Now let me talk about each of the segments on the next slide. In our Risk Solutions segment, organic revenue growth was 2%. Operating margin increased 150 basis points to 24.2%, and operating income was roughly flat to the prior-year quarter. Operating income included a $26 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding this impact, operating income increased 6% compared to the prior-year quarter.","Strong operating margin improvement of 150 basis points reflects solid organic revenue growth, return on our investments in data and analytics across the portfolio, and a 60 basis point favorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign currency translation, underlying operating margin improved 90 basis points in the quarter.","Overall in Q2, we delivered strong underlying operating performance in Risk Solutions despite continued headwinds from an unfavorable market impact in Reinsurance, fragile market conditions in Europe and historically low interest rates. If interest rates were to rise, we believe we have significant leverage through improving interest rate environment, as every 100 basis point rise in global interest rates should result in approximately $45 million of investment income.","For the first six months, operating margin improved 50 basis points with no material impact from foreign currency translation. This places us firmly on track for further margin expansion in 2015 towards our long-term target of 26%, driven by growth, return on investments, and expense discipline as we optimize our global cost structure in areas such as IT, real estate and procurement.","Turning to the HR Solutions segment, organic revenue growth was 2%, operating margin was flat at 13.2% and operating income was also roughly flat to the prior-year quarter. Solid organic revenue growth, expense discipline and a 10 basis point favorable impact from foreign currency translation were offset by continued investments to support future growth. For the first six months, results reflect modestly better than expected performance. Combined with our outlook for seasonal strength in the second half of the year, we are well on track for improved operating income performance for the full year and further margin expansion towards our long-term target of 22%.","Now, let me discuss a few of the line items outside of the operating segments on slide nine. Unallocated expenses were flat at $41 million; interest income increased $2 million to $4 million; interest expense increased $3 million to $68 million due to an increase in total debt outstanding. Other income of $1 million primarily includes net gains from certain long-term investments and the sale of certain businesses.","Going forward, we expect a run rate of approximately $45 million per quarter of unallocated expense, $2 million per quarter of interest income. Interest expense in the third quarter is expected to be approximately $72 million or modestly higher than our run rate due to the overlap of the $600 million of notes placed in May to replace the notes due in September. We would expect interest expense to decline to $68 million per quarter thereafter.","Turning to taxes, the adjusted effective tax rate on net income from continuing operations, excluding the applicable tax impact associated with expenses related to legacy litigation, increased to 18% compared to the prior year quarter at 17.5%. The prior-year quarter was favorably impacted by certain discrete tax adjustments.","Lastly, average diluted shares outstanding decreased to 286.7 million in the second quarter, compared to 301.6 million in the prior year quarter. The company repurchased 3 million Class A ordinary shares for approximately $300 million in the second quarter. The company has $5.1 billion of remaining authorization under its share repurchase program.","Actual shares outstanding on June 30 were 279.8 million, and there are approximately 7 million additional dilutive equivalents. Estimated Q3 2015 beginning dilutive share count is approximately 287 million, subject to share price movement, share issuance and share repurchase.","Now let me turn to the next slide to highlight our solid balance sheet and strong cash flow growth on slide 10. At June 30, 2015, cash and short-term investments were $851 million. Total debt outstanding increased to approximately $6.1 billion, and total debt-to-EBITDA on a GAAP basis increased to 2.5 times compared to 2.1 times at March 31, 2015.","Cash flow from operations increased 10%, or $32 million, to $365 million driven by decline in pension contributions, restructuring and cash paid for taxes, partially offset by a significant increase in cash paid to settle legacy litigation.","Free cash flow, as defined by cash flow from operations less CapEx, increased 2% or $5 million to $223 million, reflecting higher cash flow from operations, partially offset by a $27 million increase in CapEx. The anticipated increase in capital expenditure is associated with investment in certain real estate projects as we continue to optimize our real estate portfolio globally.","Looking forward, we expect significant free cash flow growth in the second half of the year, leading to double digit growth in free cash flow for the full year 2015 including the legacy litigation impact.","The increase in cash paid to settle legacy litigation in the quarter will provide a tailwind to free cash flow growth in 2016.","Turning to the next slide to discuss our significant financial flexibility and the opportunity to further increase cash flow generation. We value the firm based on free cash flow and allocate capital to maximize free cash flow returns. There are four primary areas that are expected to contribute to our goal of delivering $2.3 billion or more for the full the year 2017.","From the graph in the presentation, based on current assumptions, we expect annual free cash flow to increase by approximate $230 million from year-end 2014 to year-end 2017, based only on a reduction in cash used for pensions, restructuring and capital expenditure. Combined with operating improvements in the business, lower cash tax payments and working capital improvements, we have line of sight to achieve our expectations for substantial cash flow generation.","Regarding our pension plans, we've taken significant steps to reduce volatility and liability as we've closed plans to new entrants and frozen plans from accruing additional benefits, and continue to de-risk certain plan assets. We currently expect contributions to decline by roughly $96 million to $220 million in 2015 and continue to decline thereafter. These expectations assume no change in current interest rates. A rise in global interest rates could potentially decrease contributions further.","Regarding our restructuring program, cash payments were $82 million in 2014. As all charges related to the restructuring program have now been incurred, we expect cash payments to decline by $49 million to approximately $33 million in 2015 and continue to decline each year thereafter.","In summary, we delivered positive performance across each of our key metrics, overcoming a significant headwind from foreign currency translation. We delivered strong underlying earnings growth as we continue to manage expense and create greater operating leverage from our investment in data and analytics.","Combined with strong free cash flow growth in the second half and for the full year, we are firmly on track towards our goal of generating more than $2.3 billion of free cash flow for the full year 2017. With a strong balance sheet and significant financial flexibility, we have positioned the firm for significant shareholder creation in 2015 and beyond.","With that, I would like to turn the call back over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. One moment please for our first question. Our first question came from the line of Adam Klauber of William Blair. Your line is now open.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Gregory C. Case - President, CEO & Executive Director","Hi, Adam.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC","On HR Solutions, Christa, you mentioned that you expect solid margin expansion and growth in income. Can we expect just \u2013 not exactly \u2013 but the range of incremental change we saw in 2014 to be roughly around the same in 2015 for both the margin and income?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We haven't given specific guidance on operating income growth for 2015. What we can say, Adam, is we believe we will deliver mid-single digit revenue growth, operating income growth and margin expansion for the full year, and you've seen us do that in both 2013 and 2014 in HR Solutions and we're well on track to deliver that for 2015.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Okay. And then as far as health exchanges, selling season isn't done yet, but can you comment on, I guess, activity in selling season in 2015 versus 2014? Is activity around the same, better or worse, just as far as the flow of opportunities? And also, how big of a deal is the Cadillac tax in conversations this year?","Gregory C. Case - President, CEO & Executive Director","Well, Adam, let's start really with the overall topic here, is really around health solutions when you think about what's out there, and we continue to see strong interest across-the-board, whether they're exchange solutions or bundled solutions for that matter. And this is really across all client segments, needs, et cetera. And so from our standpoint, there's been a lot of interest, continues to be a lot of interest in the pipeline around these sets of discussions.","And it really gets to your second part of your question around what's driving it. It's really demand. Overall, health continues to deteriorate a bit and per unit cost healthcare continues to go up. And against that, our clients are struggling to try to deliver for their employees in the best way they possibly can, but also try to bend the cost curve a bit.","Cadillac tax is out there on the horizon. One doesn't know exactly how it's going to get resolved, but it certainly represents another piece of potential risk and challenge for them. So all these things are a bit of a catalyst to have clients really try to address these issues and try to understand how they can bring best solutions for it.","And from our standpoint, we administer health benefits for 10 million covered lives, 1.2 million of which are on the exchange. By the way, that's self-insured and fully insured. And we see a lot of positive activity against that, and expect that'll continue into 2016, 2017 and 2018 as well","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. And then finally, I think you mentioned that you expect strong free cash in the back half. Is that, potentially we'll see corresponding pick-up in share repurchase in the back half also?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Gregory C. Case - President, CEO & Executive Director","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Next question came from the line of Dave Styblo of Jefferies. Your line is now open.","David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions.","Gregory C. Case - President, CEO & Executive Director","Sure.","David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC","I want to start out just, again, kind of focusing a little bit more on the second half. I know we just talked about HR Solutions and organic growth mid-single digits that implies an acceleration. Can you just parse back some of the driver there? Is that some exchange-related activity or other things that you're seeing in the pipeline since the comps are pretty tough year-over-year on that.","And then, also, on the other side of the business in Risk Solutions, can you maybe just give us a little bit more of a range of how you're thinking about the organic growth and especially how Reinsurance fits into that? I think I heard you say that you expect growth to improve, but I wasn't really clear if that was more imminent or something a little bit longer term.","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. So Dave, I'll start on HR Solutions. Our HR Solutions business, the seasonality of that business is always second half weighted and will remain that way for the foreseeable future for us, in both the consulting and the outsourcing businesses. So, in the consulting business, you did see a change in patterning last year, particularly around compensation consulting. And so, you'll see that happen predominantly in the second half of the year. And then obviously, on the outsourcing side, our healthcare exchange business is a much more Q4-weighted activity.","And so the patterning you saw in 2014 and 2013 will repeat in 2015, meaning the revenue growth is much more second half weighted. So, that definitely is why we feel very good about the growth in the second half of the year, and we can see that in our pipeline today.","On the Risk side, I would say similarly, we feel really good about the Risk growth. And we're on track for low- to mid-single digits in Risk Solutions overall. And as Greg said, Risk growth in the first half of 2015 was better than Risk growth in the first half of 2014. And so, we're well on track to deliver great growth across Risk Solutions.","Gregory C. Case - President, CEO & Executive Director","I wouldn't add much to that, David. If you think about the quarter, Christa was describing, we essentially \u2013 it's another of quarter progress. Our view is we're going to deliver exactly \u2013 nothing has happened in the first half of the year that changes our view for the full year, so this is a low- to mid-single-digit range.","I would say from an Aon Benfield standpoint, you'll note my comments, I said this is a sector that obviously has been under some pressure given, frankly, our tremendous position in it and the price pressure that's been on it. But we've talked about this segment returning to growth in 2016, and we anticipate it's going to do that, and also see a number of the investments we've made in the business to create operating leverage, in fact, doing exactly that. So, I'd point to the 4% organic in the Americas, and in particular, the U.S. number, around 93% retention for the second consecutive quarter. This is actually tremendous progress and we think that's going to continue.","All these things are to just underscore and increase our confidence, and our ability to deliver the growth targets we talked about at the beginning of the year.","David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC","Excellent. That's helpful. And then maybe just piggybacking off the Risk conversation there, maybe it's attributable to the higher retention as well of some of the programs that have been going on and investing in, but the margins were up very nice year-over-year, I think, 150 basis points to 90, excluding FX. Can you spike out anything unusual one-timers either last year to remind us or this year besides the core improvement that you're doing? And on the core side, is that more of a function of the Aon Broking initiative or the revenue engine to get a higher share of wallet? Or are there other contributors that are helping just strictly on the operating expense side?","Gregory C. Case - President, CEO & Executive Director","Yeah. The key message, I think, you started with is foremost here, which is we will continue to invest in the business, improve operating leverage, and increase margins as a result of that. And we're able to do that if \u2013 at each incremental level of growth \u2013 and you're seeing us actually play that out. We'd highlight, by the way, this is about a year for us. It's not about a single quarter. On a single quarter, 150 basis points is correct, but by the way, we'd back out all the FX pieces against it and say it's closer to 90 basis points for the quarter, but really 50 basis points for the first half.","So, our view is we're making good, solid progress on margin improvement. We are going to continue to do that through the course of 2015. And what this quarter did was, it didn't change our expectation, just reinforced our ability to do that on our march toward 26%.","David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And then lastly, just on the free cash flow. You're obviously reaffirming that for 2017, and that's in light of the FX headwinds and the challenging macro backdrop when you initially set the guidance. I'm wondering relative to your initial expectations, have you had material upside to what you were originally thinking? And I'm also wondering how bad conditions might need to get for you to fall short of that free cash flow goal. In other words, maybe you can give us a little more color about the assumptions for organic growth, FX and margin expansion within that, for 2017.","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Certainly. And so we feel really confident about our ability to deliver on the $2.3 billion-plus of free cash flow in calendar year 2017. And there are really four big drivers of that: continued organic growth and margin expansion of the business; declining cash contributions to pension; restructuring and tax; and then improvements in working capital. And we feel really good about the improvements we're making in the first half of 2015 with 2% growth in free cash flow. And we're on track to do double-digit free cash flow growth in 2015 including the litigation settlements, and we'll have extremely strong cash flow growth in 2016 and 2017. So we feel really good about the path there.","Gregory C. Case - President, CEO & Executive Director","And in respect \u2013 if you think about the quarter \u2013 the new news for the quarter is this continued positive sort of progress on the cash-generating capability, as Christa's describing. So, overall, top-line revenue, exactly where we thought it would be, same with margin but the cash flow generating engine against all the headwinds you've highlighted, candidly, continues to strengthen, and we see that continuing through 2015 and in 2016 and 2017.","David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question came from the line of Sarah Dewitt of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Gregory C. Case - President, CEO & Executive Director","Hi, Sarah.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","On the share buybacks, how should we think about the pace of that for the rest of the year, and should the full year 2015 be lower than the full year 2014 given where we're running year-to-date?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. So, full year 2015 share repurchase should be lower than 2014 because if you recall, Sarah, there were two unusual sort of sources of cash, which contributed to higher than normal share repurchase than 2014. The first was we had $300 million of excess cash on the balance sheet at year-end 2013, which we used in share repurchase in the first quarter of 2014. And the second was we increased leverage during the year by $1.1 billion. And so, share repurchase for the full year 2015 will be lower, but as I described earlier, I think our cash flow is seasonally higher in the second half of any calendar year, and therefore we expect stronger share repurchase in the second half of the year.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. And then on the private health exchanges, could you just talk a little bit qualitatively how the selling season is going? It sounds like we're hearing from others that maybe some large employers might be deferring, or you might be seeing more adoption on self-insured exchanges versus fully insured. So if you could talk about any of those trends, that'd be helpful.","Gregory C. Case - President, CEO & Executive Director","Yeah, we would say overall, Sarah, as I mentioned before, really for us this is about a comprehensive set of health solutions \u2013 and those conversations be they fully insured exchanges, self-insured exchanges, traditional self-insured bundles, the intensity of those discussions has remained very, very strong and continue into 2015 and we anticipate into 2016 and 2017. And the pipeline continues to be also quite strong across the board. But again, we're building a long-term platform here and for us it's not \u2013 it's even not as much about the selling season as it was before because we're seeing more clients talk about off-cycle adoption and the different solutions.","What the clients are looking for is a way, a solution to try to manage against what is an increasing level of costs and a set of promises they made to employees that they really want to keep, and we're trying to help them do that. So the intensity of those conversations and the opportunity, candidly, for us to help them solve and address those issues continues to be very strong.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question came from the line Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. My first question, I guess, going back to the HR Solutions segment. Through the first half of the year, the earnings in that segment seems to be trending better than you planned. Was there anything kind of seasonal or one-off in the Q2? And then, does that kind of change your outlook for where you were thinking about that business at the start of the year, maybe expecting stronger growth in the second half?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Great question, Elyse. I think we had originally guided to down in operating income in the first half of the year and up in the second half of the year, so strong operating income growth for the full year 2015. And I think the first half of the year was slightly better than our expectations. And I think we are still on track for exactly what we guided for the full year, so I wouldn't change our full-year guidance at all. I think it was just slightly better and I wouldn't point to any significant items. There was a range of smaller things that were slightly better than we expected.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then on the tax rate, the adjusted rate was about 18% in the quarter, and when we think of \u2013 actually, it was down from that 19% that you guys had kind of pointed to. In terms of modeling for the tax rate going forward, would you change from the 19% or is there anything that kind of lowered that slightly in the quarter?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Great question, Elyse. Ongoing operational rate remains at 19%, subject to discrete tax adjustments. We did have some positive discrete tax adjustments in Q2, which made the rate lower than that 19% guidance, but that is exactly where we remain.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then back on Risk Solutions, in terms of you guys kind of pointed to what seems like a little bit of improvement in organic revenue growth in the back half of the year since you did say Reinsurance has most likely declined until we hit 2016, what type of improvement are you expecting in the retail, I guess, from the about 2% growth we've seen in the first half of the year?","Gregory C. Case - President, CEO & Executive Director","Yeah. Elyse, we're still similar \u2013 this is similar to the HR Solutions story. We're exactly in the same place around \u2013 an expectation for the year around low- to mid-single digit organic growth on the Risk side. And again, what we said is what this quarter did was just reinforce our confidence in the ability to achieve that. And then I pointed the longer term trends on the Reinsurance side, where we really see this business returning to growth in 2016. But our 2015 expectations remain exactly the same. Again, with the new news of the quarter being just a reinforcement of the cash generating engine of Aon and how it's evolving.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then lastly, on the private health care exchanges, we've seen an acquisition announced recently between Willis and Towers Watson. Do you expect there to be, I guess, any impact on what you're doing on the private health care exchange front from those two companies getting together?","Gregory C. Case - President, CEO & Executive Director","I would say from our stand and point of view, if you think about the overall events, recent events really across the board not just in our space but in the markets as well, again, we see them as reinforcing and in many respects making more relevant the strategy we put in place and we've been pursuing, really, for the last 10 years. If you think about industry consolidation, M&A, the risk markets, the health markets, consolidation and intermediaries, as well as the challenges, frankly, our clients are facing in things like cyber globalization, all these things have puts and takes. No doubt about it. But when you put them together, the overall sum, in our view, they reinforce our strategy to be the preeminent firm focused on risk and people.","On the consolidating intermediaries from our standpoint, highlights the recognition by other players in our space, they're seen exactly today what we saw 10 years ago. And we've been investing behind it for the last decade and we believe the trends are real and make great opportunities for all of us. And on the consolidating market side, that's out there both on the health and the risk side, we see this as a great opportunity to bring better and more relevant solutions to our clients. So, in many respects, we see change as opportunity, and we're very well positioned to take advantage of it.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Next question came from the line of Brian Meredith of UBS. Your line is now open.","Brian Robert Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. A couple of quick questions here for you all. The first one, Christa, the cash impact of the litigation charge in the quarter was the same as the earnings impact?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Not exactly. There's some timing elements of that. So, I think the cash impact, I'd think about over the course of the full year. You've got, obviously, tax affects the expenses that we've got there.","Brian Robert Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Any guidance just so I know what the impact on free cash flow was in the quarter, just for modeling purposes?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I mean, the way I'd think about it is, for the full year, just use the after-tax impact of the costs.","Brian Robert Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","For the full year. Okay. Great. And then the second question, on the exchanges, just what does the consolidation we're seeing in the healthcare insurance industry mean for your exchange? I know \u2013 because a big part of it is the competition and them lowering the prices.","Gregory C. Case - President, CEO & Executive Director","Well, Brian, from our standpoint, as I said \u2013 just alluded to \u2013 for us, capability on the market side, the carrier side, creates greater opportunity that we can bring on behalf of our clients. What I'll highlight on the active side, we've got 30 national regional carriers sort of in the mix on the exchange side, and 90-plus carriers in the mix under retiree side. So, for us it's not about that individual level of competition, we're creating that. That's going to be there. It's really more around fundamental capability and what these institutions bring to the table, and we anticipate it's going to be stronger.","And to the extent there are three on the health side that's greater than $100-billion-plus \u2013 I'm assuming all those go through in the way planned \u2013 I'm sure they're going to be competing very, very strongly with greater capability. And we think that's going to bode well for our clients and again, change and movement in the market actually benefits us tremendously if we're capable of bringing good solutions to our clients.","Brian Robert Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then Greg the last question, I'm just curious. There's always obviously competition for good talent within the insurance brokerage industry. Are you seeing any pickup of late? I mean, we've seen some fairly significant movements in the reinsurance brokerage area and some other companies talking about trying to invest in the business. Is there any pickup right now do you think in the competition for talent?","Gregory C. Case - President, CEO & Executive Director","Brian, I really don't see it. This is \u2013 we always want to be the best place possible \u2013 where someone can come and develop as a professional, support (36:32) and serve clients. And we've been talking about this for a long, long time. It's been part of our strategy for the last 10 years, and we've seen opportunity over that entire period of time. And sometimes it intensifies, sometimes it wanes a bit, but it's really been a constant. And the M&A activity obviously creates different opportunities, but I wouldn't overplay it. For us we're going to go after the best talent in the world to support our clients and that's not going to change for Aon.","Brian Robert Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks for the answers.","Operator","Thank you. Next question came from the line of Meyer Shields of KBW. Your line is now open.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Pardon me. Thanks. Good morning. Greg, you talked about tuck-in acquisitions being done. Can you give us an update in terms of whether the pricing for the acquisitions that you're looking at, whether that pricing is changing at all?","Gregory C. Case - President, CEO & Executive Director","I would say, Meyer, for us, the overall marketplace continues to be very, very competitive. There's a lot of capital out there looking at different opportunities. For us, as Christa well described, we remain constant here, too. Our view is around return on invested capital. We're maniacally focused on bringing capability in Aon in a way that improves and then strengthens our return on invested capital.","Christa talked about what we're doing with buyback. That's always a benchmark for us. We've got to be able to beat that from a return on invested capital standpoint and that's how we think about our acquisitions. And we see a very competitive market, but we also see opportunity, lots of different firms want to be part of a firm that can actually, truly change the course of a client's performance and do this on a global basis. And this is, in many respects, again, back to the destination of choice for talent, it's back to Brian's question a little bit. We can be a very attractive place for those types of colleagues and for those types of firms. And we're seeing that as well.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. And then real quickly in the slides, the uses of cash slide no longer refers to 2018. And I was hoping you could take us through why \u2013 how that decision was made?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think it's really just focused on 2017 because we've set a very specific goal of $2.3 billion of free cash flow. So, I think it was just more around reinforcing that, Meyer.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. So, no change to the expectation beyond?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No.","Gregory C. Case - President, CEO & Executive Director","No.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Next question came from the line of Kai Pan of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning. Thank you. So, first question to follow up on the merger acquisition. You have been, say, five years since your large acquisition of Hewitt back in 2010. I just wonder, are you interested or open to any big or transformative transactions that could enhance your franchise?","Gregory C. Case - President, CEO & Executive Director","So Kai, for us, again, we \u2013 it's been the same strategy and approach \u2013 preeminent firm in the world focused on risk and people. And we talked about categories around risk, retirement, health, talent, capital, et cetera. It's been a strategy we've worked on very, very hard. And we continue to add content capability around it both in organic investment, which you see us make quite substantially, exchanges, risk insight platform, review, et cetera. And then, we add content, capability in the form of M&A when they can actually help us strengthen that platform. By the way, back to the question before around, it's got to be \u2013 got to meet our return on invested capital requirements.","And so, you'll see us kind of in the $200 million to $400 million, $500 million a year, bringing in capability like that around the world, but we really like the platform we've got at this point, and that's what we're focused on.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. That's great. And then in the past, I remember you talked about your private exchange platform that' basically, you had said, multi-carrier and fully insured. But in the commentary, it looks like you also mentioned about health insurer. Are you sort of like open \u2013 basically, is there \u2013 change your like platform philosophy with regarding like either like self-insured or fully insured.","Gregory C. Case - President, CEO & Executive Director","Yeah. Really \u2013 Kai, there's really no change at all here. Again, step back, this has really always been about the category of health for us. And in that category, we administer benefits for 10 million covered lives, so virtually more than anybody else in the world. It was within that context that we brought about a fully-insured, multi-carrier exchange. But we also have a full range and complement of self-insured exchanges, and a full range and complement of bundled solutions for large market, middle market, small commercial companies. So for us, it's about a range of health solutions, fully insured being one innovation in the context of that. And that's really what's been the focal point from the beginning.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. And last question is, could you talk a bit more about your investments in the so-called cloud-based solutions in Outsourcing business and what's the potential growth or maturity there?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. And you saw that, obviously, Kai, during the quarter, we saw great growth in our cloud-based solutions and HR Solutions. As you know, we invested in two of the largest Workday implementation firms in the world \u2013 OmniPoint in 2012 in the U.S. and then the largest EMEA implementation firm called Cloud in Q1 this year \u2013 and that's enabling us to fast-forward that (41:21) growth. It's really addressing the client need around getting better data on their people and driving analytics to help them manage their \u2013 one of their most important assets \u2013 their people much more efficiently and much more effectively. And we're seeing clients increasingly choose cloud-based solutions which is driving substantial growth for us.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Are those better margin business than traditional base, say, software-on-premise business?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I mean, one of the efficiencies of that business model is it is much better margin for the clients and it's better margin for us, too.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Well, thank you so much for all the answers.","Gregory C. Case - President, CEO & Executive Director","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Next question came from the line of Michael Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs. You may proceed, sir.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. Greg, just one, just clarification. You mentioned in Reinsurance that data and analytics would help reignite growth next year. Can you just talk a little bit about kind of what you mean underneath that and kind of what opportunities you see for you to be able to leverage your analytics in order to kind of reassert growth despite sort of market conditions?","Gregory C. Case - President, CEO & Executive Director","Yeah. So, a couple of things going on, Mike, just to be aware of. Again, if you think about where we are in Aon Benfield, first, you understand the position of having \u2013 we have a very privileged position that our colleagues have built over time \u2013 number one in treaty, substantially number one in facultative, number one in capital markets and what we do there in alternative capital. And against that, obviously, we've addressed some substantial headwinds in the treaty world, where particularly in cat, it's under pressure. And by the way, that's when the price has been under most pressure.","It's against that, that, before we get to any analytics that the team with what the capability we've got, has been positive for 17 consecutive quarters on net new business. So the underlying health of this business has actually been strengthening over time. And so, start with that. So, as the price declines begin to decelerate, which they have \u2013 still there, still substantial \u2013 that actually bodes very well for what the underlying impact is going to be long-term.","Equally or more exciting is really what we're doing in terms of sort of finding new markets and new ideas to deploy capital, and this is really where some of our analytics comes in. So, for example, we have done some very innovative work in the mortgage arena in which we brought insurance capital, reinsurance capital into the mortgage world. That's never have done before, and created some price transparency and some value from that standpoint that just \u2013 it's really a net new area in many respects, by the way. The demand growth, by the way, is about $6 billion in limit a year, which frankly, we haven't seen anything like in the industry since the 1990s.","So, for us, we're doing things that actually create net new opportunity. And then, much like we did with Risk Insight Platform in the primary space, we've done with something called Review, which actually helps insurers and reinsurers actually operate much better in the marketplace and understand where they can apply their capital and create better returns.","So, for us, it's really threefold. One is just the basic core business and what we're doing to win new clients; and then it's creating new markets, the example I just gave you in mortgage; and then it's actually helping our clients to actually perform better on the Reinsurance side using data analytics like Review. So, a range of things we're doing here that we think bode well for the future.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Appreciate that. That's very helpful answer. Thank you for that. And then, on these exchanges \u2013 and maybe I just don't remember \u2013 but I had thought that most of the employers you guys had added, the large employers you've added, had been on a fully insured basis. I wasn't aware that you had begun offering a self-insured option, and so I'm just curious, have you been adding employers to that platform? And if so, just if we can get some idea of where you are in terms of building out the scale there? Thanks.","Gregory C. Case - President, CEO & Executive Director","Yeah. Yeah. For us, Mike, it's always been about a range of health solutions. The confusion comes about because we believe we brought forward the first ever fully insured multi-carrier exchange for big companies. And so, we are the only ones adding to that because we really \u2013 no one had a solution for a period of time. In fact, many actually were pushing against the whole exchange idea, and then when we start to do that, everyone loves the exchange idea.","So, there's a bit of a semantics back and forth. For us, it's been about a range of solutions both fully insured, which we're adding clients to. Depending on funding mechanism, some like the credit, creates a choice, and to create a different funding mechanism around self-insured, we're happy to do that, too. And then others will say, no, let's stay with the traditional bundled solution. And then I'd remind you again, that's 10 million covered lives for us. So, most of anybody. So that's what we've been doing forever. So, for us, it's about a range of solutions, one piece of which has been an important new innovation called fully insured multi-carrier.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. But so, the most recent update you gave us on the 700,000 or so lives on active exchanges, so that's split up between fully insured and self-insured?","Gregory C. Case - President, CEO & Executive Director","No, in this case, that was largely that we wanted to try to highlight the fully insured piece across the board, and that was, again, 1.2 million lives across the exchanges. On the active side, approaching 1 million lives, 33 clients, et cetera. That was really fully insured multi-carrier, so we could highlight that. In the fullness of time, we're going to talk about a range of solutions beyond just fully insured. But, again, that was the innovation in the marketplace that no one else had seen, which is why we wanted to highlight it and -","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it.","Gregory C. Case - President, CEO & Executive Director","\u2013 put a spotlight on it, so you can see what it looked like.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Makes sense. And then just last one if I could for Christa. The cash flow element, I mean, looks like, so \u2013 looks like if you guys hit your margin targets that you've outlined in the slide \u2013 it seems pretty clear that you can get to that sort of cash flow projection that you've talked about in 2017. Is that what we should be thinking about? And if not, could you give us some idea in terms of magnitude, order of magnitude, what's going to drive us getting from cash flow generation at this point to the sort of numbers, the $2.3 billion that you guys are talking about? And thank you for all the answers. Appreciate it.","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, Michael, I think as we think about getting to the $2.3 billion in free cash flow by 2017, we have four big drivers of getting there. The first is the revenue growth and margin expansion. The second is the decreased use of cash on pension and restructuring. The third is decreased use of cash on taxes and the last is improved working capital. And so, I think it's \u2013 there are sort of four big drivers that we've outlined in the presentation that really get us to that $2.3 billion level. And I guess what I would say on margins is that we're going to continue to progress in margin expansion in both segments, as you've seen historically. And so we'll continue to make progress.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And do you expect pensions and taxes to continue to contribute, or should we expect that \u2013 I mean, it looks like a lot of that may be behind us or maybe a little bit still left, but \u2013 so is it margin and then working capital that's going to get us from where we are to there, or is there \u2013 is it fair to think about it that way? Or is there another \u2013 ?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I would say that pension and restructuring, we still have further upside, and you can see that in the slides in the presentation. It was about $230 million, I think, of cash upside between year-end 2014 and year-end 2017 on just pension and restructuring \u2013 pension restructuring and CapEx, actually. And so, there's definitely an upside there. I think as we finish 2015, our cash tax sort of effective rate will have matched our effective tax rate. And so you should really say that we've level set on cash taxes at that point, so that's really sort of where we are on cash taxes.","And then from there on, the primary drivers of free cash flow growth will be revenue growth and margin expansion and working capital improvements.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. Next question came from the line of Paul Newsome of Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.","Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Good morning. I just want a follow-up question on sort of the M&A take that you have. In the reinsurance market, in particular, do you think that there'll be a difference in demand given what's happening from the consolidations","Gregory C. Case - President, CEO & Executive Director","Well, the ebb and flow of it, Paul, in the short term, you can understand sort of how people have different views on demand, but those will be phased in over time. Fundamental though is asking the question, what's the return on invested capital of these institutions and can we bring solutions to them to help improve that? And for us, that's always been the thesis, and that's why we love the space so much.","Our view is there's many, many companies here, and they have tremendous opportunity to improve return on invested capital. And whether we're bringing them solutions that is basically treaty placement, facultative placement, alternative capital or, frankly, more and more back to the question from earlier, data and analytics that help them understand their business so they can make better decisions to improve operating performance, strengthen their balance sheet or reduce their volatility, all these things for us make this highly attractive and an area of high demand. And all the M&A does is create change as we've described before, which will have, as I before, puts and takes, but net-net, we believe bodes very well for someone with real capability and who's made substantial investment over time to try to come up with solutions, a la on Aon Benfield.","Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Fair enough. And then, do you think there'll be any change as well in the relationship between carriers and brokers at the high end that you're at?","Gregory C. Case - President, CEO & Executive Director","Say a little more about that. What are you thinking about?","Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Well, I'm just curious if \u2013 historically, the brokers have had, frankly, the lion's share of the control over the negotiations between carriers and \u2013 over things like relationships, commissions, whatnot. But we're seeing some very large consolidation at the high end, and I'm just curious as you'll think \u2013 if you see the carriers in the future trying to demand more (51:23).","Gregory C. Case - President, CEO & Executive Director","Well, we don't see much change. I mean, carriers, by the way, have always been demanding and we'd expect them to be and we want them to be on behalf of \u2013 they're actually trying to protect and support their shareholders. Our mission and our maniacal focus is on our clients. And so, we're always looking for better solutions on behalf of our clients. That's not going to change in any way, shape or form and we're going to continue to try to strengthen our capabilities to deliver that.","And as I said before, we actually like the idea of some of these larger institutions with greater capability. But I love the idea of sitting across the table from a Fortune 10 Company and talking about bringing greater than $1 billion limits on behalf of cyber. What a great opportunity that would be, or greater limits than that.","So, for us, we see tremendous opportunity here, and think it's going to continue to evolve in this direction. And consolidation will have, as I said before, some puts and takes but net-net, we think very positive.","Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Thank you and congratulations in the quarter.","Gregory C. Case - President, CEO & Executive Director","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Next question came from the line of Jay Cohen of Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Jay Arman Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah. A question on the International side. Overall, International growth was, I guess, okay but not terribly good. You highlighted a couple of areas where you were growing, but there must be some areas that are holding back that growth. What are those areas that are a bit more challenged now, Greg?","Gregory C. Case - President, CEO & Executive Director","Yeah. So, Jay, from our standpoint, as we said before, really if you think about what we've produced and outcomes on the Risk Solutions side overall, have been really in face of some headwinds as we talked about in Aon Benfield and in International. And we've got some great, great spots I've described before really across Asia \u2013 I highlighted them on my comments. I won't repeat them now \u2013 but really a number of different places.","But if you think about Europe, Europe really is \u2013 you've got a lot of challenges in specific countries across Europe. And the good news is we've got incredibly strong privileged positions that go back decades \u2013 more than, literally hundreds of years, quite literally \u2013 and we believe we're very well positioned as that, the economics, the economy changes over time. But in the near term, they represent some challenges and that's really been the headwinds.","Jay Arman Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Makes sense. Thanks, Greg.","Gregory C. Case - President, CEO & Executive Director","Sure.","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Jay.","Operator","Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg Case for closing remarks.","Gregory C.

At this time all parties will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer portion of today's call. If anyone has an objection, you may disconnect your line at this time.","I would also like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded and that it is important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risk and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our second quarter 2017 results as well as having been posted on our website.","Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, President and CEO of Aon Plc.","Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc","Thank you and good morning to everyone. Welcome to our second quarter 2017 conference call. Joining me here today is our CFO, Christa Davies. I would note that there are slides available on our website for you to follow along with our commentary today as usual.","Before I begin the discussion on our finance results, I'd like to spend a few minutes talking about Aon overall, on our work to continuously strengthen our firm, consistent with our record of value creation. This was an exciting quarter for Aon, as we completed significant steps to reinforce and build upon a decade-long strategy to be the leading global professional services firm, providing a broad range of risk, retirement, and health solutions enabled by proprietary data and analytics.","In the second quarter, we completed the divestiture of our outsourcing platform, a natural acceleration of our strategy and a tremendous accomplishment made possible by tireless united efforts of our colleagues around the globe. The divestiture provides a further catalyst for our strategy and actions to deliver shareholder value as it reinforces our focus to provide advice and solutions and further aligns Aon's portfolio around our clients' highest priorities. This move also generates approximately $3 billion of additional capital to accelerate investment in emerging client needs and in our firm. And finally, the divestiture reinforces our return on invested capital decision making priority and emphasis on free cash flow.","Overall, our optimism is built through conviction that the actions we're undertaking will substantially strengthen our firm even further, on the heels of a decade of improvement and innovation for our clients and shareholders. With this momentum, we're already seeing improvement in our growth profile, driven by new investment in high growth, high margin areas across our portfolio. For example, our organic growth has consistently accelerated in the first half of the year from 2% in 2015 to 3% in 2016, to 4% now in 2017. And we're taking further steps to unite Aon with investments to unify and progress toward a single global business services operating model, increasing Aon's efficiency and connectivity. And through one global P&L encompassing all of Aon's industry-leading capabilities, helping us achieve our commitment to deliver all of global Aon to our clients in their local market.","Now, turning to the quarter on page five of the presentation. Consistent with previous quarters, I'd like to cover two areas before turning the call over to Christa for further financial review. First is our performance against key metrics we communicate to shareholders. Second is overall organic growth performance including continued areas of strategic investment across Aon.","On the first topic, our performance versus key metrics, each quarter we measure our performance against the key metrics we focus on achieving over the course of the year: grow organically, expand margins, increase earnings per share and deliver free cash flow growth.","In the second quarter, organic revenue growth was 3% overall, reflecting growth across every major revenue line, highlighted by strong growth in Reinsurance and Health Solutions. Operating margin increased 110 basis points, primarily reflecting savings from investments in our Aon United operating model. EPS increased 13% to $1.45, reflecting both strong operating performance and effective capital management, including share repurchase of approximately $1 billion in the quarter. Finally, free cash flow decreased $135 million, primarily reflecting investments in our operating model and transaction related cost, partially offset by operational improvement.","Overall, we are fortunate to be operating from a position of strength. Our first half results reflect 4% organic revenue growth, 160 basis points of margin improvement and 16% EPS growth. This momentum, amplified by new initiatives currently underway will substantially strengthen Aon for our clients and colleagues, creating we believe the next wave of shareholder value creation.","Turning to slide seven, on the second topic of organic growth and strategic investments. Organic revenue growth was 3% overall in the second quarter. And as I mentioned earlier, on a year-to-date basis, organic revenue growth was 4%, an acceleration from 3% for the first half of 2016, reflecting growth across all five revenue lines with particular strength in Health Solutions and Reinsurance Solutions.","Reflecting on each of our core growth platforms, in Commercial Risk Solutions, organic revenue growth was 2%. On average globally, exposures were modestly positive and the impact from pricing was stable, resulting in a modestly favorable market impact overall. Results reflect strong growth across the Pacific region in both Australia and New Zealand and solid growth in the U.S. and Canada. In U.S. Retail, new business increased over 20% in the quarter and strong management of the renewal book portfolio drove retention of 93% on average. Results were partially offset by a modest decline in Latin America and Asia, as both these regions continue to face challenging macroeconomic conditions.","In Reinsurance Solutions, organic revenue growth was 6%, an acceleration from flat in the prior-year quarter. I would note that this is the highest level of organic revenue growth achieved in our Reinsurance business in nearly five years. Results primarily reflect strength in capital markets transaction and advisory for record cat bonds during the mid-year renewal season.","Continued growth in facultative placements and net new business generation in treaty also contributed to growth in the quarter. Results were partially offset by modest unfavorable market impact, primarily in the Americas. Our Reinsurance business continues to deliver improved growth. And while the first half of the year is expected to be stronger than the second half, we would expect full year organic revenue growth to exceed the level achieved in 2016.","Retirement Solutions, organic revenue growth was 1%. We saw continued strong growth in investment consulting, specifically for delegated investment management services, reflecting an increase in client demand for Aon's tailored solutions and independent advice, as well as improved market performance. Assets under management and delegated investment management reached $109 billion in the quarter, of which roughly half of the increase since last quarter was a result of new client wins.","We also saw growth in our strategic advisory business, where our trusted advisors bring solutions to clients undergoing business change or transition. Results were partially offset by a modest decline in our talent practice driven by unfavorable timing in the quarter and a decline in project related work.","In Health Solutions, organic revenue growth was 5%. Results primarily reflect solid growth in health and benefits brokerage across the U.S. and EMEA, and double-digit growth across Asia. New business in Asia increased over 30% in the quarter, a great reflection of the depth and breadth of our global capability.","In Data & Analytics Services, organic revenue growth was 4%. Results primarily reflect strong growth in our Affinity business, with particular strength in the U.S. Growth in U.S. Affinity was highlighted by exceptionally strong performance in pet, travel and financial solutions.","Now turning to slide eight to discuss areas of strategic investment. Clients are navigating an increasingly volatile world where economic, demographic and geopolitical shifts combined with the exponential pace of technology change are all converging to create a challenging new reality for businesses.","Aon has a strong track record of developing innovative, first-to-market solutions to help solve problems and create differentiated value in response to specific client needs. We're investing organically and through M&A across our portfolio in areas such as Data & Analytics, in our Inpoint and Re\/View businesses; cyber risk advisory through our recent acquisition of Stroz Friedberg; Affinity, in multiple areas; health and elective benefits brokerage through the acquisition of Admix in Latin America and Univers; health exchanges, where we offer the broadest set of solutions in health; and finally, in delegated investment management solutions, where we continue to grow substantially.","Overall, our strategic investments in high growth areas and in Data & Analytics are improving the firm's growth profile driven by new business generation, strong retention rates, and increased operating leverage across the portfolio, and we believe positioning the firm for continued long-term growth.","In summary, we took significant steps to strengthen our industry-leading, global professional services platform and delivered strong operational performance for both the second quarter and the first half of 2017.","I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Christa for further financial review. Christa?","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","Thanks very much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. The actions we currently have underway place us in a position of strength to unlock the next wave of shareholder value creation.","In the second quarter, our colleagues around the world jointly accomplished a significant step of our journey with the completion of the sale of our outsourcing business, a tremendous amount of work and dedication from the global team. Against that backdrop, in Q2, we delivered organic revenue growth across every major revenue line, strong operational improvement and double-digit earnings growth, highlighted by the repurchase of $1 billion of shares in the quarter.","Turning to slide 10 of the presentation. Our core EPS from continuing operations excluding certain items increased 13% to $1.45 per share for the second quarter compared to $1.28 in the prior-year quarter. Certain items that were adjusted for the core EPS performance and highlighted in the schedules on page 11 and 12 of the press release include non-cash intangible asset amortization, which includes an impairment charge on intangible assets related to the sale of our outsourcing business, restructuring charges, charges related to certain regulatory and compliance matters and non-cash expenses related to pension (10:56) settlements in the prior-year quarter.","Included in the results was a $0.02 per share favorable impact related to foreign currency translation due primarily to a stronger U.S. dollar versus the pound and a modestly weaker U.S. dollar overall. Additionally, we incurred $0.02 per share unfavorable impact recognized through other expense from losses on the re-measurement of assets and liabilities in non-functional currencies. If currency to remain stable at today's rates, we would expect no material impact in the second half of the year.","Lastly, EPS from discontinued operations excluding the gain on sale was $0.08 of total earnings per share attributable to Aon's shareholders compared to $0.22 in the prior year quarter. Results in the second quarter reflect one month of results compared to three months in the prior year as our transaction closed on May 1.","Turning to the next slide to discuss our strong operational performance. Operating income increased 9% and operating margin improved 110 basis points to 22.4%, compared to the prior year. Operating margin improvement primarily reflects $44 million or 190 basis points of savings and underlying operational improvements before reinvestments. Initial savings have been driven primarily by workforce reduction, IT rationalization, vendor consolidation and travel optimization globally.","Results in the quarter were partially offset by a minus 40 basis point headwind in errors and omissions expense and a minus 20 basis point headwind resulting from lower non-cash pension income. For the first half of 2017, operating income increased 12% and operating margin improved 160 basis points from the first half of 2016, primarily driven by organic revenue growth, $54 million of savings from restructuring and other operational improvement initiatives before reinvestment; a strong first half of the year operationally as we kick off our multiyear investment in the firm.","Turning to page 12. I'd like to spend a few moments discussing the investments we're making to create the next generation global business services model that allows for better scalability, flexibility and enhanced colleague and client experience. These investments are intended to create one operating model with increased operating leverage. Our primary investment areas are across IT, real estate and people.","In IT, we expect to create greater insight from data center optimization, application management and strategic vendor consolidation. In real estate, we expected to drive greater collaboration and engagement through real estate portfolio optimization. And in people, we expect to create efficient scalability of operations and activity including the use of centers of excellence and third-party providers.","As part of these operating model investments, we plan to invest an estimated $900 million of total cash out of the $3 billion total outsourcing divestiture proceeds. These investments include an estimated $700 million of cash charges expected to be incurred; $350 million in 2017, $250 million in 2018, and $100 million in 2019. And an estimated $200 million of incremental CapEx, expected to be incurred $30 million in 2017, $100 million in 2018, and $70 million in 2019. There is an additional estimated $50 million of non-cash charges included as part of asset impairments and lease consolidations.","Overall, we expect these investments and other expense discipline initiatives to deliver $400 million of estimated annual savings in 2019, before any potential reinvestments. Following this $900 million investment in our operating model, we have approximately $2.1 billion of incremental capital left from the outsourcing divestiture proceeds to invest in high growth, high margin areas across our portfolio and to return to shareholders.","Turning to the next page. In the second quarter, we incurred $155 million of restructuring related charges, primarily related to workforce reduction. Year-to-date, we've incurred $299 million of restructuring related charges representing 40% of the total program estimate. The cash impact year-to-date is an outflow of $94 million. We recognized $44 million of savings in the second quarter, and $54 million of savings year-to-date, representing 36% of the savings for the year and 14% of the expected total savings estimate.","Now let me discuss a few of the line items outside of operations on slide 14. Interest income increased $5 million to $8 million for Q2, reflecting additional income earned on proceeds from the sale of the outsourcing business. Interest expense decreased $2 million to $71 million for Q2, due to a modest decrease in total debt outstanding. Other expense of $5 million, or minus $0.02 per share, primarily includes losses due to the unfavorable impact of exchange rates on the re-measurement of assets and liabilities and non-functional currencies.","Turning to taxes. The adjusted effective tax rate on net income from continuing operations, excluding the applicable tax impact associated with certain non-GAAP adjustments, increased to 15.6% compared to 14.9% in the prior year quarter. The adjusted effective tax rate reflects a net favorable impact from certain discrete items in both periods. Similar to Q1, excluding the impact of discrete items, the underlying non-GAAP rate would have been approximately 17.5%.","Lastly, weighted average diluted shares outstanding decreased 3% to $262.4 million in the second quarter compared to $269.8 million in the prior-year quarter as we effectively allocate capital. The company repurchased $8 million Class A ordinary shares for approximately $1 billion in second quarter.","The company has $6.7 billion of remaining authorization under its share repurchase program. Actual shares outstanding on June 30, with 255.7 million and are approximately 4 million additional dilutive equivalents. Estimated Q3 2017 beginning dilutive share count is approximately 260 million, subject to share price movement, share issuance and share repurchase.","Now let me turn to the next slide to discuss our solid balance sheet and financial flexibility. At June 30, 2017, cash and short-term investments increased to $3.4 billion, primarily reflecting the collection of proceeds from the sale of the outsourcing business.","Total debt outstanding decreased modestly to $5.9 billion and total debt to EBITDA on a GAAP basis for continuing operations decreased to 3.2 times. As discussed previously, while debt to EBITDA will be initially elevated as a result of the sale of the outsourcing business, we expect to return back to the 2 times to 2.5 times range by the end of 2018, driven by operational improvement.","Cash flow from operations for the first six months decreased $121 million to $436 million, primarily driven by $94 million of cash restructuring charges and $44 million of transaction related costs, partially offset by operational improvement.","Free cash flow, as defined by cash flow from operations less CapEx, decreased $135 million to $354 million, driven by a decline in cash flow from operations and a $14 million increase in CapEx, including investments to deliver our Aon United operating model.","Turning to the next slide to discuss our free cash flow growth over the long-term. We value the firm based on free cash flow and allocate capital to maximize free cash flow return. We've made substantial progress since introducing free cash flow as a key financial metric in 2012, reaching record free cash flow of $2.1 billion in 2016. Our disciplined capital management approach is focused on maximizing return on invested capital, which we've consistently improved each year since 2010, increasing 540 basis points to 17.1% in 2016. The recent sale of our outsourcing businesses and investments in our Aon United operating model are expected to improve this even further.","We have also taken significant steps to maximize the translation of each dollar of revenue into the highest amount of free cash flow, including working capital initiatives and actions to manage our cash pension contributions. Since 2010, we've increased our free cash flow margin by nearly 1,000 basis points to 18.1% in 2016.","Looking forward, there are three primary areas that we expect to continue to contribute to incremental free cash flow generation. The first is continued operational improvement, driven by accelerated organic revenue growth and margin expansion. The second is working capital improvements, as we focus on closing the gap between receivables and payables. We expect working capital to contribute to free cash flow by over $500 million over the long-term. And third is expected lower cash tax payments, reflecting a lower effective tax rate over time.","In summary, second quarter results reflect a strong performance, when considering the substantial amount of activity and steps we took to strengthen the firm. Through the first half, we've accelerated organic revenue growth, driven by our investments in high growth areas, and improved operational leverage through investments in our Aon United operating model. Operational performance combined with significant financial flexibility from transaction proceeds and underlying free cash flow generation positions the firm to deliver on our near-term goal of exceeding $7.97 adjusted EPS in 2018.","More importantly, this reinforces our ability to deliver double-digit annual cash flow growth over the long-term, reflecting what we believe is the next significant value creation opportunity for shareholders.","With that I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question comes from the line of Sarah DeWitt from JPMorgan Chase. Your line is now open.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc","Hi Sarah.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","First on the organic growth, given all the investments you're making and that you discussed, how should we think about how much incremental organic growth those investments could drive over the longer-term?","Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc","Sure. From our standpoint, first, if you step back and think about progress, you're already starting to see in our view some leverage coming from the investments we're making, we've made historically in areas like the Exchanges, in areas like cyber, in areas like data and analytics and the work on the Risk Insight Platform. And if you think about it, Christa and I both highlighted this, in the first six months, reflecting back in 2017, 4% growth versus the first six months in 2016, which was 3% versus the first six months in 2015 which was 2%.","So, in essence you're starting to see, as Christa highlighted, a portfolio which has got greater and better growth characteristics than we've had before. So, you're going to continue to see that progression. Obviously we're not going to give guidance on this other than to say we expect to see greater growth potential in Aon going forward from the investments we're making, but also from the portfolio changes we've made with the divestiture of our outsourcing business.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you. And then just on the margin, you had strong year-over-year expansion this quarter. However, if you take out the expense savings and the pension and the E&O impact, it implies that the margins slightly contracted year-over-year. Is that just because of seasonality, where I think in the first three quarters of the year you don't have much margin expansion and then most of the underlying expansion comes in the fourth quarter or is there something else going on?","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","So Sarah, what I would say is, as you look at the first half of 2017, operating income is up $117 million, of which $54 million of that is coming from savings from the restructuring program. So, if you think about it, operating income is up 12% for the first half of the year year-over-year and then excluding savings it's up 6%. So we do see strong growth in operational performance on an underlying basis. So we feel really good with the first half performance on an underlying basis.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Is there any seasonality we should be thinking about in terms of the quarterly growth?","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","Not really. I mean, as you said, Q1 and Q4 are seasonally stronger quarters for us and that continues to be true.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Dave Styblo from Jefferies. Your line is now open.","David Styblo - Jefferies LLC","Hey, good morning. Thanks for the questions. I just want to talk about visibility for the rest of the year. Do you guys have stats or keep stats on how much of your expected revenue you've got locked in on this point, and maybe an update along with retention that would go towards that?","And specifically, I want to ask a little bit more about the Reinsurance business. Obviously you've had some good results on the organic side. And just in canvassing the news, I'm picking up that you guys have won several accounts, especially down in Florida with People's Trust, Capitol and Argo Group outside there. Is there something \u2013 maybe those are isolated wins and it's just part of the portfolio that moves it up and down, but is there any sort of shift that you guys are seeing in terms of new wins or progress either in Florida or more broadly across that book?","Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc","Well, I'd say first of all, David, your first question around visibility into the rest of the year on revenue and organic growth, look, we continue to make investments to strengthen the firm as Sarah highlighted on the last question. Remember, this business, I highlighted in our Commercial Risk business a 93% plus retention business. So from that standpoint, a pretty sticky business. That gives us a lot of visibility into what happens in the second half and what happens throughout the year for that matter. Still, doesn't mean we don't invest heavily to try to drive that up, but we've got a lot of visibility in what that baseline looks like. So happy to come back to that, but a lot of visibility there.","On the Reinsurance side, listen, to us this is just a continuation of what our team has done. We've got an exceptionally strong team on the Reinsurance side. We continue to add talent, but we start from a unique position. We're the number one player in treaty, number one player in fac, number one player in ILS. And we've encountered a number of headwinds over the years as it relates to the pricing, particularly in the U.S., particularly in U.S. property, particularly in U.S. property cat where we're number one in all those and yet our team, against that headwind over the last number of years has done nothing short of just keep investing in innovation. And you've seen us do things in mortgage; you've seen us do things in other areas that no one else has done to actually create new markets and new capacity, new opportunities, and you're seeing us be able to react to client needs around reducing volatility, improve returns and help them grow. That really is just unmatched from that standpoint.","And so for us, that need from a client standpoint is very high. We keep investing to do that and you saw us in the quarter deliver what has been 6%, probably close to the highest we've been in a long, long time. But really, again, consistent with our conversation, we wouldn't look at the quarter. We'd say in the first half, we've delivered 4% in the first half and we look for continued progress on the reinsurance side. It candidly draws from the strength of the team and what we can do on behalf of clients.","David Styblo - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks. And then on capital deployment, you guys obviously stepped up the buybacks in the second quarter there. Is that maybe about as high as you'd like to go in a given quarter for the pace of buybacks and maybe it steps out a little bit in the back half of the year, or what's dictating that versus potential M&A opportunities in the pipeline that you look at? I know you guys have characterized M&A pipeline as something that you'll probably do similar deals to what you've done in the past and be selective with those. But curious how the M&A opportunities might balance what you're doing in terms of share buybacks given all the cash on the books right now.","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","Well Dave, as you know, we do think about allocating cash on a return on capital basis. That is the way we allocate cash between share repurchase, M&A, organic investment or any other use of cash. And as we think about that the highest return on capital across the firm remains share repurchase which is why you've seen us do $1 billion of share repurchase in Q2. As we think about use of cash for the balance of the year, you can see we've got $3.4 billion of cash and short-term investments on the balance sheet. We are generating substantial free cash flow in the second half of the year. It's our seasonally strongest half of the year, and so we have tremendous capital flexibility. And we do see us continuing our share repurchase given the exceptional return on capital that generates. We also have a very attractive pipeline in M&A. It's probably the most significant it's ever been historically and so we expect to continue M&A, and so I think you'll see a mix of uses across the portfolio.","David Styblo - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you, and good morning. My first question is on the restructuring program. You spent almost like 40% of total program cost in the quarter. Can you talk a bit more in detail about the action that have been taken? I'm also wondering has this restructuring has any temporary impact in term of disruption of your business like organic growth?","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","Yeah. So Kai, what we would say is the overall purpose of the program is to create the next generation operating model for AON, bringing together everything into one operating model for AON. We call it AON United. And we're bringing together one operating model across the firm to drive greater operating leverage and to deliver additional insight, connectivity and efficiency, primarily in IT, in real estate and in people. If you think about the 40% of the restructuring charge we've used year-to-date, it's primarily been in workforce reduction and we do think about that as setting up the future operating model of Aon. Longer term, because it takes longer to come through, you'll see more IT and you'll see more real estate.","We don't believe this is having a disruption to the firm. If you look at the first half revenue growth as Greg highlighted, we've accelerated revenue growth 2% in the first half of 2015, 3% in the first half of 2016, and 4% in the first half of 2017. And so we do believe actually bringing together Aon under Aon United will help generate benefits for clients, because we're bringing together a common approach for clients which we think is going to be exceptional.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That's great. My second question is on the regulatory front. Do you have any updates on FCA investigation, the PRA like look into the market in the London market? As well there is a recent report from FCA on investment consultant. I just appreciate your updated view on this.","Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc","Yeah, happy to talk about both of those, Kai. On the first piece, first overall, you know how seriously we take compliance and regulatory matters, and will continue to do so. Certainly focused on the FCA and what they're looking at. We took a $34 million charge in the second quarter for regulatory matters that are part of this, subject to this investigation. We obviously can't comment much further on that, but we're going to continue to work that arena very, very strongly and again, take it very, very seriously.","On the asset management side on the FCA from that standpoint, this is an area they're looking at overall, and really they're evaluating fiduciary standards which we do today. What we would say and this is listen, this is any place we can create more client transparency, opportunity for more client value, we're very much in favor of and you will see us supporting in every way we possibly can.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That's great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Adam Klauber from William Blair. Your line is now open.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC","Good morning. Hi everyone. Two questions. How is the Cyber with Stroz, how is that business doing? Is it growing? And then also how's Inpoint doing?","Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc","I'm sorry. The second question, Adam was?","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","Inpoint.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC","Oh, sure.","Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc","Inpoint. Excellent. Thank you. Got it. So, on Cyber overall and Stroz, again remember you have to take a step back. We had a very strong position in Cyber, exceptionally strong, disproportionate share of the overall placement in the market, and our colleagues said listen, although we've got this position and it's growing nicely, when you think about overall client need, it really is outstripping where the insurance industry is, and by the way, the industry, that's really all of us.","So, we're not pointing fingers. We're really looking at Aon and saying how can we actually change that? And again, if you look at the reported loss in cyber or cyber-related items, it's $450 billion plus in the U.S., and by the way, the European theater is now just opening up as the regulation begins to change. So you're about to see a number which is going to get close to $1 trillion plus in cyber reported loss and yet the insurance world is about $2.5 billion to $3 billion in premium overall.","And so when we looked at that we said, look, why is that? And what we saw was it was difficult and hard for balance sheets or insurance partners to actually apply capital against cyber without a better understanding of the root cause and the drivers of it. And so we went about bringing in capability and talent really to address that on top of what we have today before.","And so from our standpoint, it is really a real opportunity for us to serve clients in a very, very effective way. And we're really doing a set of things in cyber that help redefine the marketplace to create opportunities to bring more capital in. So it's been exceptionally strong and we're looking forward to next steps, really in terms of what we can do on behalf of clients. So Cyber is very, very positive with lots of opportunity and a lot to do.","On the second piece on Inpoint, what I'd really like to talk about is the category, which is really Data & Analytics. What we've got from that standpoint is a broad set of relationships we developed over time, many of them underpinned by true content, true insight on Data & Analytics. And what we see, and Inpoint's part of this, but really the whole category in Data & Analytic Services is really an opportunity for us to actually bring Data & Analytics to the table in a way in which you help clients understand risk differently, mitigate risk differently, understand opportunities, reduce volatility in a unique way and that's why we are so excited about the whole category of Data & Analytic Services, of which Inpoint is part of.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. Just one follow-up, is it possible to see deals in one of those two categories, given such a bright future?","Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc","Yeah. Listen, you're going to see us invest, as Christa said before, in areas where we think we can apply capital to improve return on invested capital and serve clients. So you'll see us think about areas where we can bring in content and capability irrespective of \u2013 the revenue lines we've broken out, we're very excited about each and every one of them, all of them going through transitions and change as we invest in and around it. And you're going to see that in Data & Analytic Services, you're going to see that in Health, you're seeing that in Retirement, seeing that in Reinsurance and you're certainly going to see it on the Commercial Risk side.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC","All right. Great. Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. I first had a question, a follow-up on the margin improvement you guys saw in the quarter. You guys saw underlying revenue growth of 3%. I calculate your underlying adjusted expenses grew about 2% in the quarter. I think what's hard for us to see is how much of the margin improvement is being driven by your revenue growth exceeding your expense growth versus just the savings program falling to the bottom line. Because I know you call out the $44 million of savings in the quarter, but how much of that hit your margins versus how much margin improvement are you seeing from your core business? And I would think, given the pickup in Reinsurance growth in the quarter, that would have been beneficial to your margin, since it's a pretty high margin business. Just a little bit of more color there?","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","So, what I would say, Elyse, is as we think about the quarter, there are lots of things that happen that are lumpy in a quarter, and I would go back to the first half of the year, because it's a much clear trend, and frankly it's much more indicative for full year 2017.","And so as you look at the first half of the year, you do see operating income up $117 million, which included $54 million of savings. And so as you think about operating income growth year-over-year, 12%, excluding savings 6%, so that's giving you your underlying operating income growth. And we are getting underlying margin expansion as well, and so we do feel very good about the operational improvement in the first half of the year, which is on track for full year performance.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then is there any way \u2013 I mean, we have $100 million of expense saves coming in the second half of the year. If you could help us think through, I mean, what percent fell through, fell to the bottom line in the second quarter and how you're thinking about more saves potentially falling in the back half of the year that could lead to stronger margin improvement?","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","Yeah. So, what we have said, Elyse, is that the $44 million of savings we had in Q2 was before reinvestment. We are absolutely going to invest in high growth areas that drive expansion of margin and growth in free cash flow, and you can see those investments that we're making over the last couple of years have contributed to our accelerated organic revenue growth. And so we aren't going to give guidance in the second half of the year. We have said for full year 2017 that our savings for 2017 will be $150 million, but we haven't given guidance on what percentage we will reinvest.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Can you let us know, how much shares have you guys bought back quarter to-date?","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","So, we don't give guidance on shares. What we can say is we bought $1 billion of shares in Q2. And as I mentioned on a previous question, as we think about the balance of the year, we've got $3.4 billion of cash and short-term investments sitting on the balance sheet. We're generating substantial free cash flow in the second half of the year. The second half of the year is our strongest free cash flow half. And as we invest that cash, our highest return on capital opportunity remains share repurchase. And so we expect to continue to repurchase stock in the second half of the year.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith from UBS. Your line is now open.","Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Hi. Yeah. Just a couple quick numbers questions here for you. On the Reinsurance business, the capital market stuff can be really, really lumpy. Is it possible to get what the benefit to organic revenue growth was in the quarter from the cat bond and capital markets?","Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc","Brian, we really, as I said before, really don't look at it that way. And again, we're essentially helping clients to improve return on their own capital, whether it's from cat bonds or treaty or fac and all the different pieces around that. So we really look at them together and it was certainly a strong part of the quarter for us, as I highlighted, given the position we've got. We've got a very strong position in this category. But we've got strong positions in the other categories as well.","Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then, a second question. Christa, I'm just curious, the pension headwind that you had in the quarter, is that going to persist here for the rest of the year?","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","Yes.","Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Last question comes from the line of Jay Cohen from Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Jay A. Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes, thank you. Just a question. On page 12 of the slide deck, you talk about the $900 million of investments you plan on making, but then you also talk about reinvesting potentially some of the savings. What's the difference between the initial investment, $900 million, and then any potential reinvestment?","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","Well, so Jay the $900 million is really a restructuring charge. It's a one-time charge to generate the savings. So if you think about the return on capital, that you're investing $900 million in cash and you're generating $400 million of savings. So that's the way we think about the return on invested capital of that particular exercise.","And there's a separate exercise which is, as we come across terrific growth opportunities, and Greg talked about several of them, whether it's data analytics, whether it's health and elective benefits, whether it's delegated investment management, then we will look at those as separate exercises and we will invest organically to get a return in those businesses. And you've seen them generate an acceleration in our organic revenue growth, they contribute to margin expansion and they particularly contribute to our double-digit free cash flow growth that we expect to do annually going forward.","And so, what I would say is, we don't expect all of the $400 million of savings to fall to the bottom line, but we certainly expect the reinvestment in savings to generate accelerated revenue growth, margin expansion and free cash flow growth going forward.","Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc","One of the things, Jay, as you look at what we have done, put them in the second quarter, it really, for us, is just an example of our reinforcement of the overall game plan and that's reflected in the first half performance. If you think about the Aon of 2016 versus the Aon of the future, we believe as you look at that picture, that from two, it's a pretty compelling picture. The Aon of 2016 delivered 16% TSR for a decade, which is fine, but we expect the Aon of the future, as we go through the restructuring, as we invest, continue to invest in organic opportunities, is going to deliver the near-term EPS expectations you all have, but we're going to end up with a platform that's higher growth, higher margin, higher ROIC, higher free cash flow growth and higher operating leverage that's going to support future improvement and it's going to put us, as Christa described, fully on track to deliver double-digit free cash flow growth over the long-term.","So, that's the program we've undertaken. That's what we're very excited about and we see the first half of the year fully reflecting that progress.","Jay A. Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. That's helpful. Last question. You talk about going forward, one source of additional cash flow is a lower tax rate over time. Your tax rate is so much lower than any competitor. Clearly your structure's a bit different too, but how much lower can the tax rate go from here?","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","Well Jay, what I would point out though is what you saw with our non-GAAP tax rate in Q2 of 15.6% was that was impacted favorably by positive discretes. And so, excluding those positive discretes, the underlying non-GAAP rate would have been approximately 17.5% for Q2 and that is exactly the same as what we said, the underlying rate, underlying non-GAAP rate would have been approximately 17.5% for Q1 this year too. And so, what we do think is there is opportunity over the long-term to reduce that rate, but in addition to that, there's the timing of the cash rate and the effective tax rate over time and the cash rate is slightly above the effective tax rate today and it will come down to equally effective tax rate over time and accelerate free cash flow growth doing that.","Jay A. Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That's good clarification. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg Case for closing remarks.","Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc","Ashley, thanks very much. Just want to say to everyone thanks very much for joining the call and we look forward to our discussion next quarter. Have a great day.","Operator","Thank you. And that concludes today's conference. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect."],"2173":["Aon Plc (NYSE:AON) Q1 2018 Earnings Call May  4, 2018  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Gregory C.

At this time, all parties will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer portion of today's call. If anyone has an objection, you may disconnect your line at this time.","I would also like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded and that it is important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our first quarter 2018 results as well as having been posted on our website.","Now, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, President and CEO of Aon Plc.","Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc","Thanks very much, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2018 conference call. Joining me today is our CFO, Christa Davies. For your reference, I'd note that there are slides available on our website to follow along with our commentary today.","Before we discuss the financial results of the quarter, I'd like to reflect on Aon overall on our decade-long mission to be the leading global professional services firm, delivering a broad range of risk, Retirement and Health Solutions, enabled by proprietary data and analytics. We have taken significant steps to evolve into the firm you see today. As you know, nearly a year ago, we completed the divestiture of our outsourcing platform, a meaningful acceleration of our proven strategy. The divestiture was just one step in our journey, but it was a step that provided a further catalyst for our actions to unlock the next wave of shareholder value, as it reinforces our focus as a professional services firm; further aligns Aon's portfolio around our clients' highest priorities; generates significant capital to accelerate investment in innovation and emerging client needs; provides a catalyst to unite our firm under one operating model, creating greater efficiency and operating leverage; and reinforces our return on invested capital, decision-making priority and emphasis on delivering double-digit free cash flow growth over the long term.","Our optimism is built through our conviction that these actions will substantially strengthen our firm on the heels of a decade of industry-leading improvement and innovation for our clients and shareholders. With this momentum, we're already seeing improvement in our growth profile to provide new investment in high growth, high margin areas across our portfolio. Organic revenue has increased from 3% in both 2014 and 2015 to 4% in 2016 and 2017.","Our journey continues, as we focus on driving greater innovation and more insightful content to deliver improved outcomes on behalf of our clients. Stronger growth, combined with increased operating leverage and free cash flow margin, reinforces our long-term outlook and the significant upside we anticipate in the value of our firm over the coming years.","Now turning to the quarter on page 5 of the presentation. Consistent with previous quarters, I'd like to cover two areas before turning the call over to Christa for further financial review. First, our performance against key metrics we communicate to shareholders. Second, overall organic growth performance, including continued areas of strategic investment. I would also note that the financial results discussed on today's conference call and shown in the presentation slides, are all on a comparable basis year-over-year, adjusting 2017 results retrospectively to pro forma amounts which include the impact of the revenue recognition accounting change that was formally adopted as of the first quarter 2018.","On the first topic, our performance versus key metrics. Each quarter, we measure our performance against the key metrics we focus on achieving over the course of the year: grow organically, expand margins, increase earnings per share, and deliver double-digit free cash flow growth. In the first quarter, organic revenue growth was 3% overall, driven by strong growth in Reinsurance and Commercial Risk Solutions. Also noting double-digit growth overall in total revenue.","Operating margin increased 230 basis points and operating income increased 22%, primarily reflecting savings from investments in our Aon United operating model and core operational improvement. EPS increased 26% to $2.97, reflecting both strong operating performance and effective capital management, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate.","And finally, adjusted free cash flow increased $28 million or 16% when excluding the near-term impacts resulting from the divestiture, primarily reflecting strong operational improvement. Overall, a strong start to the year with positive performance across each of our key metrics in what is now our seasonally largest quarter.","Turning to slide 7, on the second topic of organic growth and strategic investments. Reported revenue growth in the first quarter increased 13% year-over-year or 8% excluding favorable FX translation, which is an acceleration above historical levels of 6%. Organic revenue growth was 3% overall in the first quarter, driven by strong growth in both Reinsurance and Commercial Risk Solutions.","Reflecting on each of our core growth platforms. In Commercial Risk Solutions, organic revenue growth was 4%, an acceleration from 2% in the prior-year quarter. On average globally, exposures were modestly positive and the impact from pricing was modestly negative, resulting in a relatively stable market impact overall.","We saw solid growth globally across most geographies, driven by more than $200 million of total new business generation and strong management of our renewal book portfolio. Results reflect strong growth across the Americas including double digit growth in both Canada and Latin America, as well as particular strength in U.S. retail, driven by a 17% increase in new business generation.","Internationally, growth was driven by strength in the EMEA region, again, highlighted by substantial new business generation, up 26% versus the prior year. Finally, total revenue growth excluding favorable FX increased 14%, driven by the inclusion of our UMG and Henderson acquisitions in EMEA.","In Reinsurance Solutions, organic revenue growth was 6%, an acceleration from 4% in the prior year quarter, a really strong performance on what is now our seasonally largest quarter for Reinsurance. Market impact was modestly positive on results in the quarter reflecting both a continuation of moderating pricing and modest upward pressure in loss-exposed geographies, partially offset by clients adjusting their buying behavior as industry pricing fluctuates.","Results reflect strong growth across every major category, again, this quarter including treaty, facultative, and capital markets transactions. We saw particular strength in treaty placements, driven by another quarter of net new business generation. Looking ahead for Reinsurance, we would remind you of the strong second half comparable for 2018, as 2017 benefited from a higher than normal catastrophe season and capital markets activity albeit what are now our seasonally smallest quarters.","In Retirement Solutions, organic revenue growth was flat compared to 2% in the prior year quarter. Results reflect solid growth in investment consulting, including continued double-digit growth in delegated investment management solutions, reflecting an increasing client demand for Aon's tailored solutions and objective advice.","We also saw a growth in our talent rewards and performance practice for assessment services, an area of recent M&A investment. Results were offset by a modest decline in project-related work and an unfavorable impact from timing of certain revenue into future quarters in the talent practice.","In Health Solutions, organic revenue growth was flat against a strong comparable of 15% in the prior year quarter. We saw solid growth in health and benefits brokerage, highlighted by particular strength internationally across Asia and EMEA regions to provide strong management of the renewal book portfolio.","We also saw solid growth in the U.S., with double-digit growth in voluntary benefits, an area we have seen increasing client demand as employers look to tailor their benefit strategies to offer their employees cost-effective options outside of traditional coverage. Results in the quarter were unfavorably impacted by certain project-related work that benefited the prior year quarter in our health care exchange business.","In Data & Analytic Services, organic revenue growth was 1% compared to 6% in the prior year quarter. We saw continued growth in our core Affinity business with particular strength in the U.S. and EMEA. Results in the quarter were offset by an anticipated unfavorable impact from changes in certain client contracts, most notably the transition of a certain government contract in our flood business.","Overall, a strong start to the year despite some quarterly noise due to timing and tough prior year comparables. Driven by an improved portfolio of mix and significant investment in high growth areas, we continue to position the firm for improved long-term growth.","Turning to slide 8 to discuss areas of strategic investment, clients continue to navigate an increasingly volatile world with natural disasters combined with economic, demographic, geopolitical forces and the exponential pace of technology change, all converging to create a challenging new reality for businesses. Aon has a strong track record of allocating capital to developing innovative first-to-market solutions to help solve problems and create differentiated value in response to specific client needs. These strategic investments in high growth areas, driven by our ROIC decision-making process are improving the firm's long-term growth profile and increasing operating leverage across the portfolio.","We're investing organically and through M&A across the portfolio in areas such as Data & Analytics, deliver better client outcomes through content-driven insight; cyber risk advisory, expanding on the acquisition of Stroz Friedberg; health and elective benefits brokerage, as global employers are increasingly focused on improving their overall benefits packages; healthcare exchanges where we offer the broadest set of solutions and help, geographically, with the recent acquisitions of UMG and Henderson, reinforcing our industry-leading position in EMEA; and, finally, in delegated investment management solutions, a business with rapidly growing client demand with the recent acquisition of the Townsend Group, bringing a greater depth of expertise in real estate assets to our distribution scale, and increasing our ability to provide alternative private market assets.","In summary, results in the first quarter represent a strong start to the year, with significant double-digit growth across revenue, operating income, earnings per share, and adjusted free cash flow. We believe our unmatched level of investment in content, in client-serving capabilities, combined with improved operational performance through our Aon United operating model and effective capital management place us on track to exceed $7.97 of earnings per share in 2018 and, more important, unlock significant shareholder value through double-digit free cash flow growth over the long term.","I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Christa for further financial review. Christa?","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","Thank you so much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg noted, our first quarter results reflect positive performance across each of our key metrics, highlighted by strong organic revenue growth in Commercial Risk and Reinsurance Solutions, substantial operational improvement and double-digit growth in adjusted free cash flow. We are continuing to drive efficiencies in our operating model and allocate capital to the highest return opportunities.","As Greg previously highlighted, the financials discussed on today's conference call and shown in the presentation slides are all on a comparable basis year-over-year, adjusting 2017 results retrospectively to pro forma amounts that include the impact of the revenue recognition accounting change that was formally adopted as of the first quarter 2018. Please refer to pages 11 to 15 of the press release schedules for financials that provide a comparable year-over-year view. And similar to last year, we've provided nine quarters of comparable financials in Excel format on our Investor Relations website.","Turning to slide 10 of the presentation, our core EPS from continuing operations excluding certain items increased 26% to $2.97 per share for the first quarter compared to $2.35 in the prior year quarter. Certain items that were adjusted for in the core EPS performance and highlighted in the schedules on page 11 of the press release include non-cash intangible asset amortization, non-cash restructuring charges and non-cash expenses related to pension settlement. Results included a net $0.12 per share favorable impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and certain hedging programs, including a $0.19 per share favorable impact from FX translation, primarily driven by a weaker U.S. dollar versus the euro, partially offset by a $0.03 per share loss on the remeasurement of assets and liabilities in nonfunctional currencies, recognizing other expense; and lastly, the prior year quarter benefited from a $12 million or $0.04 per share reduction in expenses related to certain hedging programs.","If currency were to (13:50) remain stable at today's rates, we'd expect foreign currency translation to have an immaterial impact in the second quarter and the remainder of 2018. Lastly, included in the results was a $7 million or minus $0.02 unfavorable impact from losses on certain long-term investments recognized through other expense.","Turning to the next slide to discuss our strong operational performance. Operating income increased 22% and operating margin improved 230 basis points to 31.8% compared to the prior-year quarter. Operating margin improvement primarily reflects 160 basis points of savings from restructuring initiatives and other operational improvements before any reinvestment and 90 basis points of core improvement. This was partially offset by a minus 20 basis point net unfavorable impact from FX translation and certain hedging programs.","From a dollar standpoint, operating income increased $174 million, with $52 million driven by incremental savings before reinvestment and $45 million of net favorable impact from FX translation and certain hedging programs. The remaining $77 million or 10% growth year-over-year was driven by solid organic revenue growth and core operational improvement, a strong start to the year operationally as we continue to execute against our multiyear investment in the firm and improve on invested capital across the portfolio.","I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing the investments we're making to create our next-generation global business services model that allows a better scalability, flexibility, and enhanced colleague and client experience. These investments are intended to create one operating model with increased operating leverage.","Our primary investment areas are across IT, real estate, and people. In IT, we expect to create greater insight from data center optimization, application management, and strategic vendor consolidation. In real estate, we expect to drive greater collaboration and engagement through real estate portfolio optimization. And in people, we expect to create scalable and efficient operations using centers of excellence and third-party providers.","As part of these operating model investments, we expect to invest an estimated $1.17 billion in total cash over the three-year program from 2017 through 2019. These investments include an estimated $975 million of cash charges. We incurred $497 million of expense and spent $280 million of cash in 2017. Future cash outlay is expected to increase modestly in 2018 then expected to decline each year thereafter. And an estimated $200 million of incremental capital expenditure investment with $27 million incurred in 2017, approximately $100 million expected in 2018, and $70 million expected in 2019. There is an additional estimated $50 million of noncash charges included as part of asset impairments.","Overall, we expect these investments and other expense discipline initiatives to deliver $450 million of estimated annual savings in 2019 before any potential reinvestment. Further, we have been deploying the balance of the proceeds from the sale of our outsourcing business to the highest return on capital opportunities, including investments in high-growth, high-margin areas across our portfolio and direct return to shareholders through share repurchase.","Turning to the next page. In the first quarter, we incurred $74 million of restructuring related charges compared to $144 million in the prior year quarter, primarily relating to workforce reduction and other general initiatives. Since inception, we've incurred $571 million of restructuring-related charges representing 56% of the updated total program estimates.","The cash impact in the first quarter was an outflow of $98 million, compared to $31 million in the prior-year quarter. We also incurred $15 million of additional capital expenditure compared to $1 million in the prior-year quarter. We recognized $63 million of savings in the first quarter compared to $11 million in the prior-year quarter, and $228 million of savings since inception of the program, representing 51% of the expected $450 million total program savings.","Now, let me discuss a few of the line items outside of operations on slide 14. Interest income increased $2 million to $4 million, reflecting additional income earned on modestly higher cash balances compared to the prior year quarter. Interest expense was similar at $70 million. Pension income increased $1 million to $9 million. As noted at yearend, beginning in Q1 of 2018, we adopted a new accounting standard that shifted the financial components of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit costs from above the line in compensation and benefit expense to below the line as part of other income expense.","Other expense of $17 million primarily includes $10 million or minus $0.03 of losses due to the unfavorable impact of exchange rates on the remeasurement of assets and liabilities in nonfunctional currencies, as well as $7 million or minus $0.02 of losses on certain long-term investments. Based on current assumptions, we believe that approximately $10 million per quarter is the right run rate to model for other income expense in 2018, primarily related to pension income, excluding all other items we do not forecast that could be favorable or unfavorable in any given period.","Turning to taxes, the adjusted effective tax rate on net income from continuing operations, excluding the applicable tax impact associated with certain non-GAAP adjustments, increased to 16.5% compared to 13.3% in the prior year quarter, primarily driven by changes in geographic distribution of income as well as various impacts relating from U.S. tax reform.","The adjusted effective tax rate in both periods included a net favorable impact from certain discrete items, primarily relating to share-based compensation. We continue to believe the best estimate of our full-year non-GAAP effective tax rate is approximately 19% based on current interpretation of changes in U.S. legislation, assumptions of geographic mix of income, and impact of discrete items.","Lastly, weighted average diluted shares outstanding decreased 6% to 250.2 million in the first quarter compared to 267 million in the prior quarter, as we continue to effectively allocate capital including the repurchase of 3.9 million Class A ordinary shares for approximately $550 million in the first quarter. The company has approximately $4.9 billion of remaining authorization under its share purchase program.","Actual shares outstanding on March 31 were 245.2 million and there are approximately 4 million additional dilutive equivalents. Estimated Q2 2018 beginning dilutive share count is approximately 249 million, subject to share price movement, share issuance and share repurchase.","Now, let me turn to the next slide to discuss our solid balance sheet and financial flexibility. At March 31, 2018, cash and short-term investments decreased to $715 million. Total debt outstanding increased modestly to $6.1 billion, and total debt to EBITDA on a GAAP basis for continuing operations decreased to 2.6 times. As discussed previously, while debt to EBITDA will be initially elevated as a result of the sale of our outsourcing business, we expect to return back to the 2 to 2.5 times range by the end of 2018, driven by operational improvement.","Reported cash from operations for the first three months of 2018 decreased $42 million to $140 million, primarily driven by $67 million of incremental cash restructuring charges partially offset by operational improvement. Excluding certain near-term impacts resulting from the divestiture, including restructuring initiatives, adjusted free cash flow increased $28 million or 16%. Adjusted free cash flow growth was primarily driven by strong operational performance in the quarter.","A reconciliation of adjusted free cash flow to reported cash flow from operations is provided in Appendix E of this presentation. As cash outlays from near-term restructuring initiatives wind down in 2019 and beyond, we would expect adjusted free cash flow to converge with reported free cash flow.","The new revenue recognition accounting change did not have an impact on total cash flow or free cash flow. Appendix F of the presentation provides a pro forma comparable view of cash flow from operations for the prior year showing that cash flow is completely unaffected by the revenue recognition accounting change.","Turning to the next slide to discuss our free cash flow growth over the long term, we value the firm based on free cash flow and allocate capital to maximize free cash flow returns. This disciplined capital management approach is focused on a decision-making process that maximizes return on invested capital, which we have consistently improved each year since 2010, increasing 610 basis points to 17.8% in 2017.","We've also taken significant steps to maximize the translation of each dollar of revenue into the highest amount of free cash flow, including working capital initiatives and actions to manage our cash pension contributions. Since 2010, we've increased our free cash flow margin by nearly 1,000 basis points. In 2017, our free cash flow margin on an underlying basis, excluding the impact of the divestiture, was 17.8%.","Looking forward, we expect two main drivers to continue to contribute to incremental free cash flow generation. The first is continued operational improvement, driven by accelerating organic revenue growth and further margin expansion. The second is working capital improvement, as we focus on closing the gap between receivables and payables. We expect working capital to contribute to free cash flow by over $500 million over the long term.","In summary, performance in the first quarter reflects a strong start to the year and continued progress against the actions we're taking to strengthen the firm. We believe that accelerating revenue growth and continued operational improvement, combined with significant financial flexibility and strong adjusted free cash flow generation, position the firm to deliver on our near-term goal of exceeding $7.97 adjusted earnings per share in 2018.","As Greg noted, we're excited about the long-term outlook and our ability to deliver double-digit free cash flow growth, combined with an expected reduction in total shares outstanding, representing substantial upside and what we believe is the next significant value creation opportunity for shareholders.","With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question will come from Dave Styblo of Jefferies. You have an open line.","David Styblo - Jefferies LLC","Hi, there. Good Morning, and happy Friday, guys.","Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc","Same to you. Thanks.","David Styblo - Jefferies LLC","Wanted to just come back to slide 11. I don't think I'm quite triangulating the math quite right on the margin expansion year-over-year. So, it's apples-to-apples, you're up 230 basis points on operating margin; 160 basis points of that is from the restructuring savings. And then, I think the FX, well, it had a drag of 20 basis points. So that would have made it \u2013 that accounts for another 20 basis points. So, is the difference there of your operating margin \u2013 you know what? I think I've actually just solved my own question. Sorry about that. (26:16)","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","So, you've got 90 basis points of margin expansion from the core, Dave.","David Styblo - Jefferies LLC","Yeah, yeah.","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","Does that make sense? Yeah.","David Styblo - Jefferies LLC","Yeah. I missed that last point there. Okay. So that's self-explanatory. As far as, as you go forward for the rest of the year and your outlook on organic growth, I know, you guys don't typically give guidance. You started the year at 3% here and you do have some tough comps in Reinsurance for the back half of the year. Management's goal has been to continue to accelerate organic growth over the next couple years here. Is that going to be hard to do this year, just given the dynamics from 2017, or do you guys already have visibility on some areas of new business wins that give you confidence that you can at least match last year's 4% or possibly even move it higher?","Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc","Yes. David, our message is consistent. But while there's a little bit of noise back and forth on the different revenue lines in the quarter, when we think about the year in 2018 and beyond 2018, we think this quarter \u2013 we view this quarter as just another quarter of on-track progression. So, if you go back and think about sort of our investments in higher margin, higher growth areas, historically, go back a few years ago, we're at kind of 3%, 3%. The last two years, we're at 4%, 4%; again, on track, sort of to continue that progress. And if you think about sort of what happened in the quarter, 13% reported, take out the FX, we're at 8% \u2013 by the way that 8% is higher than our 10-year average reported, which is at 6%. So from our standpoint, this quarter is just another step on a progression for organic growth, margin improvement and, as Christa importantly pointed out, free cash flow growth improvement.","David Styblo - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And then, more broadly, as you look across your portfolio in terms of maybe a matrix of both geographies and product lines or solutions, can you talk a little bit more about market share upside potential and margin expansion headroom? I'm just trying to get a sense if you're maxed out in some countries or solutions. And similarly, what areas of your business are perhaps underperforming, not quite at targets, where you see opportunity, other than the things that you're doing with the BPO cost savings?","Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc","Well, let's come back again, I'll sort of point you back to \u2013 I'll talk about sort of top line, and Christa maybe can comment on the margin piece a little bit as well. Listen, one of the things that we're excited about, we talked a year ago about the divestiture of our outsourcing business, which was yet another catalyst for the next step in the progression of Aon, both to reinforce our work as a professional services firm, it also reinforce strongly our ability to continue to bring together Aon United, how we deliver our global firm to our clients in a local way. And that means we can invest more and more in a single operating platform, a single P&L. All these things are driving greater operating leverage and are fueling the performance improvement, the operating margin improvement you're seeing.","And then what we also did is broke out the five revenue lines. You could really see we're making investments and we like the opportunities across all five of the lines. In particular, areas to create net new demand. So if you think about in Commercial Risk, what we're doing in cyber to change the game in cyber, to create net new demand, real set of opportunities.","In Reinsurance, we see tremendous opportunities to create net new demand with what is a truly industry-leading leadership teams. So think about what we just did or have done historically in the U.S. mortgage world in which we created net new demand in the U.S. mortgage world to the tune of $10 billion in premium. You saw us just place what is a very, very unique cat bond in the marketplace. First of its kind, for the World Bank for four countries who face quake risk they couldn't recover from in prior periods. So, these are real innovations, sort of, in Reinsurance. You're seeing the same on the Retirement side, in what we're doing with delegated, on the Health side, in what we're doing with the exchanges. And then very excited about what we're doing with Data & Analytics to, again, create areas of net new demand.","So, for us, Dave, we really did see the sale of the outsourcing business as a real catalyst. And what you see in the first quarter is just the continued progress against that. But in terms of margin, Christa, anything you'd add to that?","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","Yeah. The thing I'd say, Dave, is we do see margins continuing to accelerate, and there are a number of things driving that. One, obviously, is bringing together the Aon operating model under one operating model. And you can see the progress there in terms of the savings, $165 million of restructuring savings in 2017. We're on track to deliver the $300 million of savings in 2018 and, again, on track to deliver the $450 million of savings next year in 2019. So, that's obviously contributing to margin expansion.","The second thing I'd say is we are continuing to improve on the core margins of our business through great work across the whole of Aon, which is just terrific. And the third I'd say, which is really the area Greg highlighted, which is we continue to invest in higher revenue growth, higher margin, higher return on capital areas, which is building leverage into the business. And I think Data & Analytics is the best example of that. It's a very high margin business, and that is translating through the higher free cash flow growth. So, we're very excited about the future growth in revenue, margins, and free cash flow.","David Styblo - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Sarah DeWitt of JPMorgan. You have an open line.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. The near-term goal of at least $7.97 of adjusted EPS this year, I imagine when you said it, you didn't assume that there would be $0.16 of FX benefit this quarter. So, should we be thinking about that as you can hit $7.97 this year ex-FX?","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","So, Sarah at the time of the transaction in May 2017 we gave guidance of exceeding $7.97 EPS in 2018 as you said. We're not updating guidance on a quarterly basis based on tax headwinds, FX tailwinds or frankly much stronger operating performance. We do believe we're on track to exceed $7.97 and the results in Q1 demonstrate this.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. All right. Thank you. And then just on the share buybacks. How should we think about the pace of that going forward, is a good proxy to think about adjusted income less dividends is being available for buybacks given that's, I think, your preferred way to deploy it, given the returns in the business?","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","Yes. I think that's absolutely right, Sarah. What I would say is if you look at free cash flow, we've got a use of cash on restructuring, we've got a use of cash on dividends and then that is essentially cash available for share repurchase, investment in organic opportunities and investment in M&A. And as you've seen, we continue to invest in share repurchase, because it remains the highest return on capital opportunity across Aon.","And then the other thing I would note, Sarah, is as we grow operating income and free cash flow over the long term, you should expect that we'll grow debt to keep that debt to EBITDA in line with the ratio I outlined.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Arash Soleimani of KBW. You have an open line.","Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thanks. Just quick question in terms of the tax rate, I know before you'd put a 19% expected rate for this year. Just curious if that changes, has changed at all based on increased clarity that you may have received in terms of the tax code?","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","Arash, we do believe that 19% is the correct rate for the full year 2018. And so, what you're really seeing is a lower tax rate in Q1 and then a higher tax rate in Q2, Q3 and Q4 to average to 19% for the year.","Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay, thanks. And I guess my next question is, are you seeing any changes in the demand for cyber especially with some of the European regulation?","Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc","Arash, as we've talked before we actually see tremendous client need sort of in this category. Virtually every client we talk to is addressing this question and it's a question of sort of at the board level, at the CEO level but also down on the operations of all of our clients' businesses. So this is an area of increasing concern for them.","And as you've highlight, the $450 billion of reported loss last year there was against that kind of $3 billion in premium give or take. We are privileged to place a good portion of that. But if you think about $3 billion versus $450 billion, that's an area of substantial need and a great opportunity for us at Aon and as an industry to help our client support that. And that $450 billion, to your point, was largely U.S. based. When you think about the adoption of GDPR and the data requirements in Europe which literally kicked in this month, the reported requirements go up, which means the $450 billion is going to go into something that's closer to $1 trillion.","So you're absolutely correct. This is an area of high, high need for our clients and an area of substantial opportunity for Aon which is one of the reasons we've invested so heavily behind it both in traditional ways, core brokerage and all of the things we do around that. The arrangements we've set up on behalf of clients but also with the investments we made in just content and insight, and Stroz Friedberg as an example, who have an extraordinary insight into sort of specific incidents and how they occurred, and why they occurred. And we're applying that to underwriting characteristics and criteria to create more opportunity for our clients.","Q \u2013 [09QYVY-E Arash Soleimani]>: Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Yaron Kinar of Goldman Sachs. You have an open line.","Yaron Kinar - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good morning, Greg and Christa. Just wanted to circle back to organic growth for a second. So, if I understand your comments correctly, ultimately, we shouldn't read too much into a bit of a slowdown in the first quarter here. And for the full year, you still expect steady, if not accelerating, growth. Is that a fair summation?","Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc","Yeah. And I think you summarized it very well. There might be some noise, sort of back and forth on the different revenue lines. But, again, take a step back. Literally, we feel the trajectory continues very positively on the growth side for us, again, going back over multiple years now. Going back four years, 3% and 3% going then to 4% and 4%, we think we're on a very good progression for the year.","And if you look at reported overall, as a firm, even though there was noise back and forth between the revenue lines, overall the firm were at 3% organic, 8% excluding FX reported, and 13% reported. So, these are very, very strong levels that continue to reinforce the growth trajectory of Aon. And, again, we look at this as kind of a single P&L. This is Aon overall delivering a growth top line, delivering operating improvement free cash flow growth, and that set of characteristics continues to look very positive.","Yaron Kinar - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. And then, maybe if I dig a little deeper into organic growth, you called out a couple things there, specifically weaker project-related revenue in both Retirement and Health and also very strong growth in EMEA in Commercial Risk Solutions. So, I was just hoping that maybe you could give a little more color around the project-related revenue. And then, on EMEA, can you maybe talk about how the UK is shaping up within EMEA? Is it also a contributor, or is it just so \u2013 are you seeing some weakening there that's offset by other growth in the region?","Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc","Well, let me make sure I get (37:29) which I think you're asking about, specifically, and then about EMEA and the UK. On the Health side, again, this represents a category with just tremendous monumental opportunity to assist clients that's currently strong and it's increasing. It's a category you've seen us invest in substantially, both organically and by M&A. Think about what we've done in the exchanges as well as M&A, things like Admix.","We grew at 7% in 2017. And just to your point, we see 2018 as yet another year of similar growth in progress. So, all good things. There was a very strong comparable; 15% in 2017, and that was just some specific one-time initiatives to support clients, which were terrific, but as we think about the year very, very strong in terms of how that's progressing.","And then, on EMEA, we just have an exceptionally strong team in EMEA and the UK. And they've done fantastically well; double-digit new business growth, which has been absolutely spectacular, sort of, across the region and in the U.K. We've also added capability. As I talked before about our two acquisitions, they've also come online and done exceptionally well. So, for us, this is just an area of opportunity and it continues to build, and we expect that progression to continue.","Yaron Kinar - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","And can you talk specifically about the project-related revenues, both in Retirement and Health?","Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc","Well, on the Health side, it was really more around \u2013 again, as we implement major programs for clients, occasionally, there are programs that \u2013 particularly, around some of the exchange work we do that are one-time, and the conversions, and we had a number of those in the first quarter 2017, which was terrific. But again, it drove a 15% organic number in Q1. Again, if you think about we ended up 7% for the year and that's what we see progressing over time.","And on the Retirement side, it was really more around, as we described, it was really more timing than a specific project and the timing was around, again, different initiatives we take on behalf of clients and how were awarded on behalf of clients that are going to roll into the second half of the year \u2013 not the second quarter, but the second half of the year, that will fully balance out. And again, no change to overall projection and views on the year in that category.","Yaron Kinar - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks. I appreciate the color.","Operator","Our next question comes from Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo. You have an open line.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. My first question, just going back to the conversation on margins, you guys saw a 230 basis points of margin improvement this quarter on 3% organic. Do you view that as a sustainable level? And, I guess, what I'm also thinking about is, you guys told us there would be about \u2013 to get to the $300 million, we have about $135 million of saves for the full year. And you guys saw just under 40% of that level in the first quarter. So how do we think about the margin progression for the back three quarters in relation to just a different number of savings coming through, as well as, the 230 basis points of margin improvement you saw in the first quarter?","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","Yes. One of the things we would say, Elyse is, as we look at our revenue growth for the quarter, I know you're focused on organic, we really focus on total because M&A is absolutely contributing to top line and bottom line performance, and we're incredibly excited about the $1 billion of M&A we did in 2016 and the $1 billion that we did in 2017.","And so, as we look at the 13% revenue growth for the quarter, that is absolutely contributing to margin expansion and we do expect margins to continue to expand in the second half of the year \u2013 well, in the balance of the year for full-year margin expansion. And if you think about the progress on margins for the full year, that will continue to occur as the savings ramp in the balance of the year.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And that was actually \u2013 to your point on the acquisitions, that was another question I had. So really two parts, as we think about modeling is \u2013 you guys saw about 5% revenue growth from acquisitions this quarter. Can you help us just think through the amount that could come through in the balance three quarters, kind of what rolls off and when or maybe just high level? And then, in terms of margins, were the acquisitions that came through in revenue this quarter, were they accretive to your margins, meaning are they running at stronger margins than the rest of your business?","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","Yes. So, Elyse, we haven't given revenue or margin guidance from the acquisitions. What I would say on reported revenue is, if you look at the last 10 years, reported revenue has been 6% CAGR. And so, that's a pretty good way to model revenue and, certainly, the way we think about it. Obviously, we're looking at the components of that, that are driven from organic versus M&A versus FX, but 6% reported is not a bad way to think about it because it's happened over a 10-year period of time.","As we think about margins, they're typically lower on a full year basis in the first year because we've got a bunch of integration costs associated with them. And so that's definitely a way to think about acquisitions as they come in. They'll contribute to revenue. They will be a little lower margin in the first year, and then obviously, for us to do M&A, it has to have a return on capital higher than buyback. And so, it's certainly going to contribute in the long term.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you. And then one last question, just going back to free cash flow quickly. Obviously, just some moving parts on each quarter, but the goal for the year, meaning 2018 is it still about double-digit off of the adjusted 2017, about that $1.8 billion number?","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","That is exactly right, Elyse. So, what we would say is our long-term growth of free cash flow is double digits. If you take the $1.8 billion in 2017, we will grow double digits this year. And as you think about uses of free cash flow, 2018 is the peak year for restructuring the use of cash. And so as restructuring tails off in 2019 and every year off that, you'll see free cash flow accelerate.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Greg Case for the closing remarks.","Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc","Thanks very much, everyone. I really appreciate you being part of the call and look forward to our discussion next quarter. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you, speakers. And that concludes today's conference call. Thank you, all, for participating. You may now disconnect."],"2022":["Aon Plc (NYSE:AON) Q4 2016 Earnings Call February 10, 2017  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Gregory C.

At this time, all parties will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer portion of today's call. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect your line at this time.","I would also like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded and that it is important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature, as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our fourth quarter and full-year 2016 results as well as having been posted on our website.","Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, President and CEO of Aon Plc. Sir, you may begin.","Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc","Thanks very much and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter and full-year 2016 conference call. Joining me today is our CFO, Christa Davies. I would note that there are slides available on our website for you to follow along with our commentary today.","And consistent with previous quarters, I'd like to cover two areas before turning the call over to Christa for further financial review. First is our performance against key metrics we communicate to shareholders. Second is overall organic growth performance, including continued areas of strategic investment and this morning's important subsequent announcement of a definitive agreement to sell certain outsourcing assets.","On the first topic, our performance versus key metrics, each quarter we measure our performance against the key metrics we focus on achieving over the course of the year: grow organically; expand margins; increase earnings per share; and deliver free cash flow growth.","Turning to slide 3, in the fourth quarter, organic revenue growth was 3% overall, with growth across both segments, highlighted by strong double-digit growth in our healthcare exchange business. Operating margin increased 210 basis points, reflecting significant operational improvement in both segments. EPS increased 13% to $2.56, primarily reflecting strong operating performance, effective capital management, and a lower effective tax rate.","If we turn to the full year, organic revenue growth was 3% overall, including growth across every major business. Operating margin increased 80 basis points, driven by strong operating performance and record margin results in Risk Solutions and HR Solutions. EPS increased 7% to $6.59. And finally, free cash flow increased 22% to a record $2.1 billion.","Overall, we delivered positive performance across each of our key metrics for both the quarter and the full year. Substantial investments in high-growth areas, improved operational performance, and record free cash flow generation continue to position the firm for increased shareholder value creation over the long term.","Turning to slide 4, on the second topic of growth in investment, I want to spend the next few minutes discussing the quarter for both of our segments. In Risk Solutions, organic revenue growth was 3% overall, driven by growth across all major businesses. As we've discussed previously, we're driving a set of initiatives to maximize return on invested capital and making strategic investments to strengthen underlying performance and position our Risk Solutions segment for long-term growth and improved operating leverage.","We continue to drive improvement in client leadership, with management of our renewal book portfolio through a proactive client partnership we call Aon Client Promise, which is driving retention rates of more than 90% on average across retail brokerage, including: record retention rates in the U.S. and EMEA; new business generation of more than $360 million in the fourth quarter across retail brokerage, including double-digit growth in EMEA and the Pacific regions as well as another consecutive quarter of record new business in U.S. retail; and 23 consecutive quarters of positive net new business in core treaty reinsurance.","In addition, we're increasing operating leverage from our significant investments in innovative technology and data and analytics, including Aon Inpoint, a growing business where we help carriers become more competitive and operationally efficient by integrating our market-leading data and analytics with strategic consulting and access to Aon's unmatched expertise. This includes the Risk Insight Platform, which now captures 3.4 million trades and nearly $170 billion of bound premium, as well as our reinsurer dashboard, ReView. Another example is our Aon broking initiative to better match client need with insurer risk appetite, including our ability to identify structured portfolio solutions. And finally, we're investing significantly in high-growth businesses, including cyber, health and benefits, and in Affinity.","Most recently in the fourth quarter, we announced the acquisition of Admix, a leading health and benefits brokerage and solutions firm in Brazil, enabling Aon to expand its capabilities throughout Latin America. Additionally, we completed the acquisition of Stroz Friedberg, a global leader in cyber security and cyber remediation as well earlier in the year. Finally, another important example is Univers, a leading elective benefits enrollment services firm in our health and benefits brokerage business.","Reflecting on our individual businesses within Risk Solutions, in the Americas, organic revenue growth was 3% against a strong comparable of 6% in the prior-year quarter. Exposures continue to be modestly positive across the region while the impact from pricing was negative, resulting in a modestly negative market impact overall. We saw strong growth in Affinity, with continued strength in the Consumer Solutions group. Results also reflect strong growth in Latin America, driven by effective capital management of the renewal book portfolio as well as continued record new business generation in U.S. retail.","In international, organic revenue growth was 2% against a strong comparable of 6% in the prior-year quarter. The impact from pricing remains modestly negative on average, driven by fragile market conditions in various countries across Asia and Europe, while exposures are modestly improving, resulting in a relatively flat market impact overall.","We saw growth across every major region, including the Pacific, Asia, and EMEA. Results were highlighted by double-digit growth in the health and benefits brokerage business across both Asia and EMEA regions. We also saw overall strength across the Pacific in both New Zealand and Australia, driven by strong new business generation.","In Reinsurance, organic revenue growth was 2%, similar to the prior-year quarter. This marks the fifth consecutive quarter of positive growth in Reinsurance. For the full year, the Reinsurance business delivered organic revenue growth of 1%, reflecting a return to growth in 2016, as anticipated. Results in the quarter were primarily driven by continued net new business generation in treaty and growth in facultative placements as well as growth in new products such as ReView. Results were partially offset by an unfavorable market impact globally and a modest decline in capital markets transactions.","Overall, market conditions remained similar to prior discussions. Price declines continue to moderate and ceding demand continues to increase against record levels of capital. Against that backdrop, Aon's leading data and analytics have been instrumental in driving innovative capital solutions across new markets, including U.S. mortgage credit risk, life and annuity risk, and other emerging risks such as cyber liability.","Overall across Risk Solutions, our strategic investments in high-growth areas and in data and analytics continue to drive new business generation, strong retention rates, and increased returns across the portfolio, positioning the Risk Solutions segment for continued long-term growth.","Before turning to HR Solutions, I'd like to wish my colleague and friend Steve McGill, our former Group President and Chairman of HR Solutions, well in the next chapter of his career. Steve has spent nearly 40 years in the industry and has been a valued leader at Aon. Going forward, our Global Risk Solutions business will be led by two exceptional colleagues, Michael O'Connor as CEO of Aon Risk Solutions and Eric Andersen as the CEO of Aon Benfield.","Now turning to HR Solutions, organic revenue growth was 5% overall, driven by solid growth across high-demand areas where we continue to invest in innovative solutions and client serving capabilities. These investments reflect Aon's leadership and in-depth understanding of market trends, including solutions to help plan sponsors both manage pension risk and drive better retirement outcomes for their employees.","A double-digit area of growth has been delegated investment consulting, where assets under management have grown from $10 billion to $90 billion in five years. We expect continued global growth in this area as sponsors are faced with regulatory changes and increasingly complex global markets; in addition, continued investments to strengthen our industry-leading portfolio of health solutions covering the full range of benefit strategies, client size, and funding choices, including our suite of private healthcare exchanges.","We saw strong double-digit growth across our exchange solutions, including increased enrollments across both our active and retiree platforms and significantly improved profitability for the full year. And finally, we're investing in data analytics across our health and retirement investment practices to provide superior advice and drive better outcomes for our clients and our clients' employees.","Reflecting on the individual businesses within HR Solutions, in Outsourcing, organic revenue growth was 8% compared to 4% in the prior-year quarter. Results reflect strong double-digit growth in our healthcare exchange business, driven by an increase in enrollments across the platform as well as certain project-related work. We also saw continued growth in HR BPO, driven by new client wins in cloud-based solutions.","In Consulting Services, organic revenue growth was flat. We saw continued strong growth in global retirement consulting, specifically for delegated investments in Consulting Services, reflecting an increasing demand for Aon's tailored solutions and independent advice. We also saw growth in Communications Consulting from continued momentum of employers communicating to employees on financial and health wellness. Results in the quarter were offset by a decline in project-related work than the prior-year quarter as well as a modest decline in our talent and compensation consulting business.","In summary of our performance, we end 2016 in a position of strength. We delivered growth across both segments, invested heavily in high-growth areas like cyber risk, advisory, and health and benefits, achieved record operating margins across the firm, and generated a record $2.1 billion of free cash flow for the year.","Now I'd like to turn to slide 6 of the presentation to discuss another exciting step in our journey. This morning we announced a definitive agreement to sell our benefits administration and HR Business Process Outsourcing assets. We believe this transaction reflects a continuation of our proven strategy and creates a catalyst for the next step of significant shareholder value creation.","For over a decade, we've been on a mission to strengthen our firm: a mission of increased focus on providing advice and solutions; a mission enabled by proprietary data and analytics; a mission to be the preeminent professional services firm in the world focused on risk, retirement, and health.","We've taken strategic actions from virtually every angle to achieve this mission, beginning with the dispositions of lower-margin capital-intensive insurance underwriting businesses and risk, reallocating capital from balance sheets to high-value solutions, strengthening our capabilities to serve global clients locally, and investing to build a set of unmatched data and analytics, including $85 billion of annual risk premiums supported by our Inpoint and ReView technology, $30 billion for the annual premium in health with a full set of health solutions, $4 trillion of pension assets under independent advisory with $90 billion under delegation.","We believe in our mission and the progress has been positive, with 6% annual revenue growth and 16% annual growth in total shareholder returns over the last 10 years, but we are not standing still. The decision to sell these outsourcing assets is another exciting step against our mission, creating a win-win situation for our clients and for Aon: for our outsourcing clients, a partner in Blackstone, who will set the global standard for operations excellence and technology innovation in this area, and for Aon, another step to sharpen our focus on advice and solutions.","We're reallocating resources from capital-intensive outsourcing assets to accelerating investment in high-growth high-margin areas across retirement and health, including such areas as delegated investment consulting, health and benefits brokerage, and private healthcare exchanges. Overall, we're excited about the step and what it means for Aon, for our clients, and for our shareholders as the next step of significant shareholder value creation.","I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Christa now for further financial review. Christa?","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","Thank you, Greg, and good morning everyone. As Greg noted, this transaction further strengthens the firm's advisory capability and accelerates innovation through effective allocation of capital to maximize client and shareholder value.","The pending sale of the benefits administration and HR BPO assets is expected to generate gross cash proceeds up to $4.8 billion, including $4.3 billion of cash consideration at closing and an additional consideration up to $500 million based on performance. Total after-tax cash proceeds are expected to be $3 billion. This reflects a multiple of approximately 12.1 times 2016 EBITDA of $396 million, which includes intercompany corporate allocations and other expense adjustments.","We believe this transaction reflects a continuation of a proven strategy and is further evidence of our disciplined capital management approach to drive improved return on capital, which has increased each year since 2010, up 540 basis points to 17.1% in 2016. Driven by effective capital deployment of free cash flow and transaction proceeds, savings from operating model integration, and a lower effective tax rate, we expect the transaction to be accretive to 2018 FactSet consensus analyst estimates of $7.97 per share.","Further, we also announced that part of the proceeds from this transaction will be allocated to an increase in our previously authorized share repurchase program. The repurchase program will increase by $5 billion, bringing the total amount currently authorized for repurchase to approximately $7.7 billion as of February 10, 2017.","Lastly, we expect the transaction to close by the end of the second quarter 2017, with the results of the assets being placed into discontinued operations for the first quarter of 2017. For modeling, the impact of divested operating income and stranded costs going forward, we would eliminate $323 million of adjusted operating income while adding $91 million of corporate allocations and other expense adjustments. These two adjustments we estimate would reduce your future expectations by $414 million on an annual basis before any other adjustments for timing of close and potential actions we may take to improve operational performance.","Now let me turn to the financial results for the quarter and year on page 8 of the presentation. Our results in the quarter reflect growth, operational improvement in both segments, strong double-digit free cash flow growth to a record $2.1 billion for the year, and effective capital management. Further, we deployed roughly $2.5 billion of capital in 2016 through share repurchase, attractive acquisitions in high-growth businesses, and dividends.","Our core EPS performance excluding certain items increased 13% to $2.56 per share for the fourth quarter compared to $2.27 in the prior-year quarter. Certain items that were adjusted for in the core EPS performance and highlighted in the schedules on page 13 in the press release include non-cash intangible asset amortization and non-cash expenses related to certain pension settlements, as well as transaction costs related to the sale of the outsourcing assets.","Also included in the results was a $0.03 per share favorable impact related to foreign currency translation, due primarily to U.S. dollar strength against the pound. For the full year, foreign currency translation had a $0.01 unfavorable impact on EPS. If currency were to remain stable at today's rates, we would expect foreign currency translation to have a modest unfavorable impact in the first quarter of 2017.","Now let me talk about each of the segments on the next slide. In our Risk Solutions segment, organic revenue growth was 3%. Operating income increased 9%, and operating margin increased 190 basis points to 27.6% compared to the prior-year quarter. Operating margin improvement of 190 basis points reflects solid organic revenue growth across every major business and 100 basis points of favorable impact from foreign currency translation, partially offset by $6 million or minus 30 basis points of transaction-related costs for acquisitions previously mentioned.","For the full year, operating income increased 5% and operating margin improved 90 basis points to a record 24.5%, driven by return on our investments across the portfolio and a 60 basis point favorable impact from foreign currency translation.","Turning to the HR Solutions segment, organic revenue growth was 5%. Operating income increased 7%, and operating margin increased 210 basis points to 28.3% compared to the prior-year quarter. Operating performance in the fourth quarter primarily reflects strong growth in our high-demand investment areas and expense discipline as we take steps to reduce certain costs related to previous dispositions. Results were modestly offset by an $8 million or minus 10 basis point unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation.","For the full year, operating income on a reported basis decreased 1% and operating margin increased 30 basis points to a record 18.4%. Driven by specific decisions to dispose of certain businesses at the beginning of 2016, we believe it's helpful to look at the underlying operational improvement of the platform. Adjusting for the impact of approximately $29 million of lost operating income and stranded costs related to previous dispositions and $20 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, underlying operating income would have increased 5%, with operating margins increasing 120 basis points to 19.6% for the full year.","Now let me discuss the few of the line items outside of the operating segments on slide 9. Unallocated expenses decreased $4 million to $57 million. Interest income was $3 million compared to $4 million in the prior-year quarter. Interest expense increased to $2 million to $70 million due to an increase in total debt outstanding. Other income of $9 million primarily includes gains due to the favorable impact of exchange rates on the remeasurements of assets and liabilities in non-functional currencies. The prior-year quarter primarily included a gain on the sale of our Asset Management business and Outsourcing in HR Solutions. Going forward, we expect a run rate of approximately $45 million per quarter of unallocated expense, $3 million per quarter of interest income, and $70 million per quarter of interest expense.","Turning to taxes, the adjusted effective tax rate on net income from continuing operations, excluding the applicable tax impact associated with non-cash pension settlements, decreased to 14.9% compared to 17.9% in the prior-year quarter. Changes in the geographic distribution of income and certain favorable discrete tax adjustments impacted the adjusted effective tax rate in the current quarter and for the full year against our underlying operating tax rate of approximately 19%. The prior-year quarter adjusted effective tax rate excluded the applicable tax impact associated with expenses related to legacy litigation. As discussed on prior calls, discrete tax adjustments can be favorable or unfavorable in any given period.","Lastly, average diluted shares outstanding decreased 4% to 268.3 million in the fourth quarter compared to 279.3 million in the prior-year quarter, as we effectively allocate capital. The company repurchased 1.8 million Class A ordinary shares for approximately $200 million in the fourth quarter. Actual shares outstanding on December 31 were 262 million, and there are approximately 5 million additional dilutive equivalents. Estimated Q1 2017 beginning diluted share count is approximately 267 million, subject to share price movement, share issuance, and share repurchase.","As mentioned previously, the company announced an increase in its previously authorized share repurchase program this morning. The repurchase program will increase by $5 billion, bringing the total amount currently authorized for repurchase to approximately $7.7 billion as of February 10, 2017.","Now let me turn to the next slide to highlight our solid balance sheet and strong cash flow growth. At December 31, 2016, cash and short-term investments decreased to $721 million. Total debt outstanding was approximately $6.2 billion. Total debt to EBITDA on a GAAP basis was 2.5 times. While debt to EBITDA will be initially elevated as a result of this transaction, we expect to return back to the 2.5 area in 2018.","Cash flow from operations for the full year increased 16% or $317 million to a record $2.3 billion, primarily driven by an increase in underlying net income after adjusting for certain non-cash pension expenses, lower cash pension contributions, and lower cash taxes. We also saw underlying working capital improvement, reflected by a 2-day decrease in days sales outstanding over the trailing 12-month period.","Free cash flow, as defined by cash flow from operations less CapEx, increased 22% or $385 million to a record $2.1 billion, driven by strong growth in cash flow from operations and a $68 million decrease in CapEx. In 2016, we delivered strong double-digit free cash flow growth, reflecting momentum as we focus on converting each dollar of revenue into the highest free cash flow yield.","Turning to the next slide to discuss our free cash flow growth over the long term, we value the firm based on free cash flow and allocate capital to maximize free cash flow returns. We've made substantial progress since introducing free cash flow as a key financial metric in 2012 and continued to take significant steps to position the firm for the double-digit free cash flow growth over the long term.","There are three primary areas that we expect to contribute to incremental free cash flow growth going forward. The first is continued operational performance, driven by organic revenue growth and margin expansion. The second is working capital improvements as we focus on closing the gap between receivables and payables. We've made substantial progress in this area over the last five years, and working capital provided a positive inflow as part of our record free cash flow generation in 2016. We expect working capital to contribute to free cash flow by over $500 million over the long term. And third is lower cash tax payments, reflecting a lower effective tax rate rates over time.","In summary, we delivered positive performance across each of our four key metrics for the quarter and full year. We're heading into 2017 in a position of strength, driven by our substantial investments in high-growth areas, our record free cash flow generation, and continued discipline around capital deployment opportunities. We've increased return on invested capital from 11.7% in 2010 to over 17% in 2016. The transaction announced this morning will further enable the firm to improve return on invested capital, accelerate free cash flow growth, and create the next wave of shareholder value creation.","With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We now have questions on queue. The first one is coming from the line of Dave Styblo from Jefferies. Sir, your line is now open.","Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc","I think you might be on mute, Dave.","David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC","Here we go. Can you guys hear me now?","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","Yes.","Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc","We can.","David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC","Okay, great. Thanks for the questions. I think I'll start with a qualitative question just about the transaction here and understanding maybe the history of when you put these assets together. And I think the rationale back then was cost synergies and diversification and so forth. And then over time as we fast-forwarded, can you just explain a little bit more about the rationale now? As you're divesting these assets, is it more so because it's maybe one of your lower margin business lines and you see better opportunities for the ROIC as you look to deploy some of that cash organically or inorganically internally to some of the other areas that you mentioned? Maybe you could flesh out some of those opportunities that you're looking at. And then I've got a second question on just the accretion that I'll hold for you in a second.","Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc","Sure, and that's a great place to start, Dave. For us, we see this as very much a natural progression. And really you go back more than a decade as you think about what we've tried to do, same strategy, same approach, focused on preeminent firm in the world focused on risk, retirement, health, all things around that, talent, capital, the things that come with that, really risk, retirement, and health.","You've seen us make substantial investments all along the way, particularly focused around expertise and excellence in advice and solutions. And where we can underpin it by data and analytics, we've doubled down and invested more and more against that. That has served us exceptionally well. And we love that strategy, we continue to double down and invest in that strategy.","The addition of Hewitt to the Aon family in 2010 was a great, great catalyst for us that reinforced our efforts around retirement and health among other areas, and we've really incorporated those capabilities and continued to strengthen and build Aon. And all you're seeing today is yet another opportunity to step back and say where is the best place for us to put capital, how can we do it most effectively to reinforce the same strategy, preeminent firm in the world focused on risk, retirement, and health, particularly around advice, solutions, underpinned by data and analytics, and that's exactly what we're able to do today as we announced this divestiture.","And what's great about this is we're taking our outsourcing assets, partnering with Blackstone. Our clients are going to be exceptionally well-served with Blackstone and the innovation they can bring to the table. And we are going to then now be able to innovate more and more focused on our core strategy around risk, retirement, and health on the topics of advice, solutions, and data. So for us, this is just a great outcome and represents a continuation of a strategy we've been on for a long time that served us quite well.","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","And, Dave, the other thing I would add just to your question on return on capital is it's absolutely driven by our return on capital strategy. This is a lower revenue growth, lower margin business for us. You can see that in the schedule attached to the transaction release, and it will improve the overall return on capital of Aon. We believe Aon post this transaction will be higher revenue growth, higher margin, and a higher return on capital with higher free cash flow growth.","David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC","And as far as the areas, I know you mentioned a couple, the exchanges and then reallocating assets to retirement and so forth. Can you talk a little bit more about those areas that you're most interested in, whether it's organically or inorganically?","Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc","We're going to continue again to make investments all along the topics of retirement, health, risk, et cetera. If you think about maybe just the last year, the investments we've made in Admix, Univers, Cammack, Mayfair, all these are areas that really are health-related acquisitions and brought great capability, the investments we've made in delegated. We love this space. It's gone from $10 billion, as I said before, to $90 billion in delegated, so I love the spaces around retirement. You see us investing a lot in data and analytics as it relates to risk, retirement, and health.","So for us, Dave, this again is a continuation of the strategy we've been on for a long time, and this gives us the opportunity to allocate even more capital into these areas and really double down on risk, retirement, and health. This is quite consistent if you go back in time and think about what we did when we divested of our insurance underwriting assets and invested it back into the business. Now we've got yet another opportunity. Christa described and I described a real catalyst for us to increase shareholder return as a result of this.","David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC","Okay, that's helpful. And then just on the numbers, maybe you can give us a little bit more of a quantitative bridge for the operating income loss. I think it's 15%-plus of the total, and how you replace that, whether it's \u2013 I think buybacks can only do so much. Maybe you could give us a better idea. Are you thinking about using maybe half of the $3 billion for buybacks or some sort of range there? And then what else is helping to bridge that? I know you've talked about operating expense savings. Is that more so because you're just integrating the businesses a little bit more? And then on the tax savings, is there actual real tax savings, or does the tax rate go lower just because the business mix changes?","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","Thanks, Dave. So I think in terms of how you think about modeling this, if you took the 2016 operating income number on a GAAP basis, you'd eliminate $323 million of adjusted operating income and then you'd add back $91 million of corporate allocations and other expenses. So therefore, you'd adjust your 2016 numbers by $414 million on an annual basis, and that's really the base from which you then start to model going forward. So I think that's what you're taking out.","In terms of guidance going forward, what we have said is we expect to be accretive to 2018 FactSet analyst estimates of $7.97. And the way in which we would get there is continued operating income growth of the business, continued savings as we bring together the operational model of Aon under Aon United, areas like IT and real estate as you think about Aon much more focused on advice and solutions. As outsourcing business being much more capital intensive, it allows us to actually generate savings there on the operating model side.","We will have a lower effective tax rate really as a result of the things we continue to say, lower tax rate, rate reductions in different countries around the world, and overall geographic distribution of income. And in terms of use of proceeds, as we think about the business going forward, we really think about continuing to employ proceeds on a return on capital basis in terms of cash-on-cash returns.","As you look, and we would expect that we would deploy the proceeds and our free cash flow growth in a mix of M&A and share repurchase, if you look at 2016, we did about $1 billion of M&A. As we think about the pipeline of M&A, we have fantastic return on capital opportunities there, we'd expect that trend to continue. And we also, as you saw, authorized an increase in our share repurchase program of $5 billion, and we now have $7.7 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining. And share repurchase remains our highest return on capital opportunity across Aon. But we do see terrific opportunities through improved operating income growth, M&A, share repurchase, reduced operating model savings, and a lower effective tax rate to get back to accretive in 2018.","David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC","Thanks, I'll step back for others.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Klauber from William Blair. Your line is now open.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC","Good morning, thanks.","Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc","Hey, Adam.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC","Also on the transaction, so you're selling the benefits administration platform, the HR BPO, but it sounds like you're still going to be in the benefit brokerage business and the exchange business. Can you tell us how that's going to work?","Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc","Adam, it's very much going to work like it works today. I mean, think about it, we're going to \u2013 just take the exchanges for an example. Just as it is today, we're going to be involved in architecture and design, all the carrier relationships, the plan details that come together, the actuarial work which underpins that, the risk management which is so important and critical for the back-end risk adjustment of that. And our new partner at Blackstone, is going to be helping and supporting around administration and call centers and enrollment flow and all the things that are important to that.","And at the front end, this is a place where as we think about innovation, we're going to continue to invest in data and analytics to really innovate on the front end as we think about the architecture and design. So for us, this is a very, very natural progression. And what we're excited about is we're now going to actually to be bringing to a client innovation on both the front end more intensively through us and on the operations side through Blackstone. So we think this is again, as I described, a real win-win-win and lets us really focus on the areas that we have highest interest in, highest return on invested capital, high margin, high growth, and it gives our clients the opportunity to actually benefit from more innovation across the supply chain.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC","So it sounds like you're still going to sell and distribute the product, but Blackstone will really run the technology and call center. Is that sort of how the arrangement works?","Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc","Yes, it really is. That's a great way to describe it. And again, I'd think about it, for those who are more focused and familiar with the risk side of the business, it's not dissimilar to us structuring an incredibly complex transactions for a client on the risk side. And then we partner with insurers, who obviously do the underwriting and the claims, some of the claims processing and pieces around that. So we think this is a very natural progression, and we're very excited about it.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay, thanks. And then as far as the Workday and some of the other ERP implementation service business, is that a similar arrangement? Are you keeping the distribution, or is that business mainly going to Blackstone?","Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc","No, this all goes to Blackstone. And it really, again, we wanted to make sure that platform was a very standalone clear platform to serve clients effectively. We believe we've got that accomplished, and we're going to focus on the advice, solutions part of the overall supply chain for our clients.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC","So will you still be selling that Workday implementation, but then Blackstone will be doing the work? Is that again how it works?","Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc","No, it's not. Again, Blackstone owns all the pieces that are around the outsourcing parts of this.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay.","Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc","And the execution parts of this. We're going to be relating to clients on the front end on the overall program and how it would work for them.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. And then on the free cash flow, obviously you've done a great job. You had previously talked about a target. Does the target reset lower because you've taken a lot of free cash out of the business? How should we think about that going forward?","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","So obviously, we're very pleased with the $2.1 billion in free cash flow for 2016. It was really driven by operating income growth, improvements in working capital, lower pension cash, and lower cash taxes, so we're very pleased with that outcome. And you can see, we expect free cash flow to continue to grow double digits going forward. And so that will be the expectation, as I said, because Aon exiting this business, Aon post this transaction is really a higher revenue growth, higher margin, higher return on capital business, with higher free cash flow growth.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC","Right. But does the base start from a lower basis because you're losing?","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","Yes, that's right.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay, okay, okay, that makes sense. And then as far as the cost saving element of this, will there be a charge related to it, and will most of those cost savings be attained in 2018, or is this going to be a several-year program?","Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc","Like we've always done, Adam, for us this is about building long-term value, so you will see us invest back into the business in all the ways Christa described, but also around creating efficiencies. And so in the coming months and quarters, you're going to see us take up efforts and initiatives to do that. And again, we have an opportunity now to really streamline the business in ways we haven't done before, very much focused on the areas around advice, solutions, and data and analytics.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Quentin McMillan from KBW. Your line is now open.","Quentin McMillan - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Hi, thanks very much, guys. I just wanted to touch on the tax rate. You obviously said that you're going to be able to achieve a lower tax rate by divesting this business. And I'm assuming that's in relation to the current tax environment that we have today. But could you talk about any thoughts that you might have if the U.S. corporate tax rate was to decline? Would that, thoughts basically still hold true? And then just on the bigger picture questions that are out there, do you have any current thoughts about interest deductibility going away or anything else that may come to pass?","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","Look, Quentin. As we think about the legislative environment we're in, obviously there's a lot of uncertainty right now. We're certainly monitoring it very closely. At this stage, it's too early to tell as there's little guidance and no draft legislation written on how this would impact financial services, insurance, or insurance brokerage. And so we'll let you know as we learn more.","Quentin McMillan - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay, great. Then just in terms of the health and benefits business as it relates to the healthcare exchange, are you going to be folding the healthcare exchange in there as a tool that will be sold in conjunction with that? And then also obviously putting up double-digit growth in health and benefits in Asia and EMEA was very strong in the quarter. But in the Americas, some other peers of yours had talked about a little bit longer decision-making process from some of their clients related to the ACA and other healthcare decisions that could be changing. Did you see any weakness in the America that could show up in the back half of this year or might have changed the selling cycle there at all?","Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc","We really didn't on that point, Quentin. And we'd step back and say listen, for us it isn't about one specific area, so it's not about an exchange or health and benefits piece, it's about health. As we said before, we love the category. We've got a business, it's a $1.5 billion business that has grown double digits over the last three years with a very, very attractive margin. And we're doubling down and investing in that. Whether it's on the exchange, in H&B, in elective, we love the space and we're going to continue to double down and invest in it. We see a lot of momentum there.","Quentin McMillan - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay, great, and just one quick one. In terms of the share repurchases, just a little bit below what I would have expected in the fourth quarter. Can you just comment? Was your share repurchase in the fourth quarter impacted by the fact that you had material non-public information from this deal?","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","Yes, it was.","Quentin McMillan - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sarah DeWitt from JPMorgan. Ma'am, your lie is now open.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, good morning.","Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc","Hi, Sarah.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I'm looking at the Risk Solutions organic growth in the quarter. I thought there was going to be some revenue that was shifting from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, so I thought you would have seen a sequential pickup in organic versus 3Q. Could just talk about what was going on there?","Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc","Really for us, we actually feel good about where we finished in the year overall. Sarah, obviously the 6% comp in the prior-year quarter created a little headwind. We don't ever like to use that as an excuse, but the math is the math. But we really feel good about how we finished the quarter and the year.","If you look at net new business growth, it's again another record across the firm, with real momentum particularly around what we've done on Aon Client Promise and how that's affected retention rates. So we feel good about it. We would reflect \u2013 again, we always want to drive for more growth, and we're working on doing that. But we finished the year at 3% overall and record margin. And so for us, it's pretty good progress.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thanks, and then just a couple numbers questions on deals today. How much of the proceeds will you be using for share buyback? And how much do you expect your overall tax rate to fall, and how much could the return on invested capital improve?","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","Sarah, as we think about the starting point, we do believe that the after-tax cash proceeds are expected to be about $3 billion. And as we think about those cash proceeds plus our free cash flow, we have substantial amounts of cash to invest. And we really believe we're going to invest in a mix of M&A and share repurchase. And we're going to allocate that based on return on capital and cash-on-cash returns. And you can see the chart in the release in terms of return on capital how much we've grown, over 540 basis points over the last five years. And so we are divesting a lower revenue growth, lower margin business, and therefore you can expect return on capital to continue to increase. And we haven't given specific guidance around overall mix of allocating the cash because we continue to optimize it on a return-on-capital basis.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, thanks, and then just the tax rate?","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","So as we think about the tax rate going forward, we are not giving future guidance. As we said, we're monitoring the legislative environment very closely, and we'll continue to update you as we learn more.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I just meant with the deal. Could you even just tell us what the tax rate was on the business sold?","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","It's certainly a higher-tax business because it's mostly a U.S.-based business. And so as you look at the gross proceeds, you can see the tax rate applicable is very high because it's mostly a U.S.-based business.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, all right. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you and good morning. So with the divesture, in the past you talked about HR Solutions operating margin target of 22% over the long run. Could this change the target as well as the trajectory towards there?","Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc","Kai, for us again, we feel very good about where we are and the momentum we have around risk, retirement, and health, and this will continue to reinforce progress there. So you will see momentum and push against that. And again, we had a record margin as you reflect on the year. So we finished the year at 18.4%, which was again the highest it's ever been, and you're going to see continued progress against that.","As Christa described, we literally just divested of a business that was lower growth, lower margin, and lower return on invested capital. So by definition, we're going to get some momentum against that, but that's not as important for us as what we're going to be able to invest now back into the business in the way as Christa described, both in M&A as well as in what we're doing in areas like delegated, like the exchanges, like data and analytics organically, which underpin that. So for us, we believe this is a catalyst for performance, which is what Christa highlighted in her discussion.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. And then you talk now more about potential acquisition opportunities. I just wonder. In the past, you've in recent years been more focused on buybacks and now acquisition pickup. I just wonder. Is buyback still the best return from your perspective, or will we see probably more active in terms of acquisitions?","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","So, Kai, buyback, as I said earlier, is still the highest return on capital opportunity across the company, and that's why you saw the increased $5 billion authorization of buyback this morning. And so we have $7.7 billion of buyback authorization remaining. And what we see in the M&A pipeline is some terrific high return on capital opportunities. And we will be generating tremendous free cash flow growth over the coming years and we've got proceeds from the transaction, so we expect to be investing in both.","Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc","If you look back over time, just filling in on what Christa just described, over the last 10 years we've really deployed $18 billion plus just around decisions roughly, which were obviously in dividends, but also the part left over was roughly half in buyback and roughly half in M&A. So for us, it really has been an investment opportunity over time.","We have been very, as Christa described, very disciplined about how we've done that. I think Christa \u2013 last year we had zero in M&A in 2015, and this year we've got $1 billion in 2016. So if you think about \u2013 and now we're going into 2017, so for us this is not about any criteria. This is about straight-up return on investment capital and making sure we're delivering on behalf of our clients in that regard, but also our shareholders. And that's how you'll see us deploy capital going forward, just as we've done in the past.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, last one. On free cash flow per share, will that also be accretive in 2018 similar to the adjusted EPS?","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","We haven't given guidance on that. What we've said about free cash flow is we expect free cash flow to grow double digits going forward.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, great. Thank you so much.","Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Jay Cohen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Jay Arman Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Just to clarify one thing, I'm assuming that the added potential consideration of $500 million, that will not be included in earnings, correct?","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","It's going to happen over time, Jay, so it would happen in many years from now. And so we really think about that being based on performance. And so we give you guidance over the coming years as the performance gets delivered.","Jay Arman Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","But you will include it then in your adjusted earnings eventually?","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","It's cash. It wouldn't flow through earnings.","Jay Arman Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Right, okay, that's what I thought, just double-checking on that. And then given your goal of reducing the leverage, will you have to take some explicit deleveraging actions to deal with your debt at all?","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","We do not intend to do that. We do believe that the growth in operating income, the additional operating income that we will add from M&A will be terrific. And as I said, our debt to EBITDA on a GAAP basis was 2.5 times at year end 2016. And while we'll be slightly elevated post this transaction, we expect to return to 2.5 levels in 2018.","Jay Arman Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That's really helpful. I'm going to sneak one more quick one in. And as we talk about a lower tax rate helping the accretion by 2018, I'm assuming that's simply because you're getting rid of the business that has a higher tax rate. This sale should not impact your tax rate from your other businesses, correct?","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","It shouldn't, no.","Jay Arman Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome from Sandler O'Neill. Your line is now open.","Jon Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Good morning, maybe some clarifying questions. The $3 billion in cash, does that include the proceeds from the $500 million in the performance bonus related to?","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","No, it does not.","Jon Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","So that's theoretically a positive prospectively?","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","It would theoretically be incremental cash over time. And given it's performance-based, as I mentioned earlier, we would give you an update on the timing and amount of that based on performance in the coming years.","Jon Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Was the outsourcing business that you're selling inherently more volatile business from an earnings perspective than the rest of Aon, or was it pretty similar?","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","It's fairly similar. The way I would describe it is it was a lower revenue growth, lower margin, more capital intensive business, but it was not more volatile.","Jon Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","And then this is a little bit aside. The accounting change that you made related to the revenue rec in the risk business, am I to assume that that seasonality change will persist prospectively?","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","Absolutely right.","Jon Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay, that's it for me. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you very for taking my questions, two easy ones. Does the $3 billion you're citing, does that include or exclude the potential higher price if you were to meet certain performance objectives?","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","It does not include for $500 million earn-out.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Excellent, great. And two, following on Adam's question just a little bit, when I think about healthcare exchanges, I think it's a technology, I think it's a distribution platform. Is Blackstone going to be operating the healthcare exchange and you're going to be doing I guess the healthcare design? How is that relationship going to work on this very growthy business?","Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc","On the exchanges, again, as I described before, we're retaining the exchanges. We're going to work with Blackstone on the exchanges, but we're retaining the exchanges. So we're doing design, broking, actuarial as those are put into place, and Blackstone will be doing administration delivery against that platform. Again, we think this is going to be a very seamless connection.","And the beauty of this is we're going to have more innovation on the topic of exchanges than ever before, us on the front end doing what I just described, Blackstone on the operating back end doing what they described. And it allows us to apply data and analytics more effectively to actually create that innovation. And you can expect Blackstone will be doing the same thing on technology innovation from an operations standpoint. And for us, the net is, as Christa described before, we're in a less capital intensive situation in which we're able to focus on advice and solutions consistent with what our overall strategy is.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Let's say hypothetically an employee accesses a portal and the company is giving $150 \u2013 $200 to the exchange operator. Is Aon getting those revenues or is Blackstone getting those revenues?","Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc","These are split. Blackstone owns the processing pieces of this, as I described before. And we own the front-end design, broking, actuarial pieces, as I described before.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And so you'll share portal fees?","Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc","We're going to get a commission from that standpoint. And then from the operating side, Blackstone will get the operating revenues from that.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Charles Sebaski from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you, good morning or afternoon I guess. I guess, Greg, I was hoping you could just walk us through or at least help me understand relative to the original Hewitt acquisition in 2010. I know in your prepared comments at the beginning, you mentioned that this is a low margin business and low growth and compared it to the previous sale of underwriting. I can understand, but the underwriting business was a legacy business I guess when you came on board and the construct of Aon, as opposed to Hewitt, which was a deal you guys did and the benefits in HR BPO being the lion's share of that business when it was transacted.","I guess I was trying to understand. What's transpired over the last six years that's given you a different view of that because on a return on capital basis of that $4.9 billion deal done in 2010, I guess I'm not seeing the return on capital of that transaction then? Or is it just \u2013 is the world different? Did the pieces come together differently than expected in hindsight, or just the thought process I would appreciate?","Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc","Let me just step back, Charles, because I think you're making some assumptions which actually are not how we saw it at all. In fact, if you step back, we couldn't be actually more excited and pleased with bringing Hewitt into the Aon family. This has always been about building content capability around the topics of risk, retirement, and health. And Hewitt brought such tremendous capability for us on retirement and health.","We're sitting today in the strongest position we've ever been in categories we absolutely love. We just delivered record margin against those categories. And now we're in essence in a position where we can continue to grow and reinvest in those areas. So for us, Hewitt was just an incredibly positive catalyzing event for Aon that really reinforced and underpinned our strategy. So we love this.","And the outsourcing business from that standpoint was a business that was more capital intensive, was a business that was lower margin, lower return on invested capital, but we continued to invest and build that as well. And now we have an opportunity, as we announced today, to step back and say now that we've achieved that, we can actually now divest that asset and now redeploy back into the areas that we have really been focused on all along. So for us, this is very much a continuation and very much a logical step and a strategy we've had for over a decade, and really reinforce it.","And by the way, just as a reference, again if one were doing the math, if you were to go back in 2010 and look at our return on invested capital, and since 2010, our return on invested capital has increased 540 basis points. We feel pretty good about that progress. We can always do better, feel pretty good about that progress, and it's a record now 17.1%. And the day before we announced it to you, I think we're trading at about $38, and last I looked, we were slightly higher than that now.","So from a standpoint of how things worked, we feel great about that, not so much from a return standpoint, which by the way, the mechanics were exceptional, just exceptional, but really from a strategic standpoint. And I would urge you not to compare what the acquisition of Hewitt was versus what today is because we didn't keep Hewitt separate. Hewitt was about Aon. It was about strengthening Aon, and it actually accomplished all that frankly and exceeded our expectations.","Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. And then I guess \u2013 I appreciate that \u2013 and I guess a couple of numbers questions. For Christa, I guess thinking of the free cash flow going forward, you guys have put in this presentation the annualized growth, which is very helpful. Is it reasonable since how you calculate the cash flow of operating cash flow less CapEx, but we don't have it split out by business, our starting point of the $2.1 billion for 2016 just being netted down by the adjusted EBITDA number that you provided for the sold business, is $1.6 billion the adjusted starting point for cash flow for 2016? Is that a reasonable way to think about your double-digit starting?","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","Yes, I think that, and then there was CapEx of about $80 million. And so as you think about that, you're starting with slightly higher basis and then double-digit cash flow growth from there I think is the right way to think about it.","Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. And then finally on taxes, I know you don't giving guidance. But the tax hit on the sale, about 30% I think on the $3 billion cash versus the $4.3 billion sale price, is that going to have a disproportionate effect in 2017 numbers relative to your tax rate going back? Is that going to flow through differently than the business would? I'm just trying to understand on how that's going to affect current year's overall organizational tax for the 2017 period.","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","I would separate out the transaction from the operating rate. And I did say again for 2016, the right underlying operating rate for Aon was about 19%, and it has remained that way for several years. And so that's been the operating rate for the last couple of years. The transaction is a one-time item and would not flow through the adjusted EPS and effective tax rate.","Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you very much for the answers.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey, thanks. I just had a question on how we should think about the level of accretion possible here relative to the consensus $7.97. Because I guess thinking about the deployment of proceeds into all buyback or M&A and the lost operating income of $323 million doesn't seem to quite get me back to $7.97. And I hear you guys that you're not giving the guidance on the tax rate or specific cost saves, but I'm wondering. Should we be thinking about this as significantly accretive to $7.97 to compensate you guys for the risk of having to do this, or is $7.97 more the target now for 2018? Thanks.","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","So, Ryan, what we've said is we're going to be accretive to the FactSet $7.97. We haven't given more guidance than that. And what I would say is it is a combination of proceeds and return on those proceeds from the transaction, continued organic revenue growth and margin expansion in our businesses, savings as we bring together the operational model, particularly in IT and real estate, and a reduction in tax rate. So they're the component pieces that get you there.","Gregory C. Case - Aon Plc","And what I might add, Ryan, if I could, we didn't see this, you mentioned risk, compensate for risk. We don't see it that way. I just want to emphasize again. We really see this as an opportunity to take another step forward in a journey that we've been on for over a decade. This is exactly consistent with what we continue to do as we allocate capital, reallocate capital, think about our structure, think about performance improvement, all against a strategy around being the preeminent firm focused on risk, retirement, and health in every single way, and using more and more data and analytics, content, insight as a way to drive that strategy.","And so for us, this was a natural progression. In fact, the possibility to do it and serve clients well on the outsourcing side for us made it an imperative. This is something we absolutely had to do because we're excited about what it means for Aon. We're excited about what it means for Blackstone, and we're excited about what it means for our clients. So for us, this wasn't about risk. This was a real step forward that strengthens our firm for the long term. And we'd just say, as we started this conversation, we see this as a real catalyst for shareholder value creation for Aon.","Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay, understood. Thank you. And then I think Christa just mentioned that what can continue to drive accretion here is margin expansion in the remaining businesses. I guess looking at organic growth this year, just in the brokerage side 3%. To have margins expand off of that, are you saying that you think that organic can accelerate off the 3% next year, or do you think that 3% organic growth can still produce margin expansion in that business? Thanks.","Christa Davies - Aon Plc","Ryan, one of the things we're extremely proud of is in 2016, our risk business, we delivered 3% organic revenue growth overall and record margins of 24.5%. And one of the things that we've mentioned many times is, because of the investments we made over the last several years in data and analytics, we can drive margin expansion quite substantially at lower levels of growth. It's certainly not our aspiration. Our aspiration is to grow higher than we are today. But we are getting return on those investments in data and analytics, and that is driving more than half of the margin expansion you've seen in each of the last three years. And so we're very confident about continued margin expansion in our risk business.","Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you for the questions.","Operator","Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg Case for closing remarks.","Gregory C.

If anyone has an objection, you may disconnect your line at this time.","I would also like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded and that it is important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our second quarter 2018 results as well as having been posted on our Web site.","Now, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, CEO of Aon Plc.","Gregory C. Case","Thanks, Shaun, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter 2018 conference call. Joining me today is our CFO, Christa Davies. After many, many conference calls, we\u2019re excited to introduce a new approach today all intended to be hopefully more helpful for all of you. Christa and I would like to start by highlighting our colleagues around the world delivered a strong result in Q2 and the first half of the year reinforcing our continued momentum we talked about in the first quarter call as well.","Beginning on today's call, what we plan to do is post for your a comprehensive standalone document that provides both financial backup and a commentary on our strategic priorities, and really how are plans are producing results. And we're confident, you will let us know how we can improve the new approach, but we really want to make sure you know what our intend is here, a broader based conversation.","Fundamentally the document we posted is meant to provide all that we\u2019d have covered in our initial commentary and more. And as a result, we plan to use our time on the call to provide a little bit more insight into the longer-term view for the firm. This approach will also allow us to describe two or three investment or growth areas that we think are strengthening our capability to serve clients pretty fundamentally and hopefully you get the idea.","We hope to give you a better insight on Aon, and important areas around our firm, like our journey to deliver Aon United. And that's really a perfect place to start a discussion today. The idea of Aon United at scale and the benefits that accrue when our global firm works together effectively are substantial. And it's not historically -- never, we\u2019ve covered on this call, but nonetheless it's a very important piece of our long-term success and a real growing strength of Aon.","You will see we took significant steps over the last quarter to build on that strength, executing our announced changes to deliver more consistently. On a value proposition, we know our clients like and are demanding more and more, and we know its distinctive. And this is really about how we make available to them. The global capability of our firm tailored to them, fully suiting their business needs and objectives and we will be bringing us together the capability of Aon against client needs in a very broad based way, it is highly effective. Its powerful. It's meaningful. And we call this leading Aon United.","More specifically, you saw the thinking and the commitment reflected in our May 15 announcement, which described all these -- the number of these changes, all of which were designed to make it easier to bring the best of the firm to our clients. So you saw, we\u2019re moving around leadership. We establish co-presidents, Eric Anderson and Mike O'Connor, two great colleagues of the firm that will be wonderful in these roles. They will also be overseeing a new global Aon Operating Committee, which also includes direction of global business services, all of which reinforces the single P&L that we announced in 2017 and really encourages Aon United decisions that accelerate growth by bringing the best to the firm to our clients. So a series of moves around leadership.","Single brand. You saw us announced that we'd be again retiring the remaining business unit brands, primarily Aon Risk Solutions and Aon Benfield, following on a similar step with Aon Hewitt in 2017. And I would tell you we\u2019re very excited -- very excited about the prospect of 50,000 Aon colleagues going to market as Aon. I'm from Aon. Reinforcing our priority to address client opportunities and innovation and really creating more distinctive solutions. So a whole series of things around a single brand, around Aon.","And finally you saw moving around innovation, structural movement. We created a leadership capacity to drive more effort and drive forward on our new Data and Analytics offerings, we expanded John Bruno's role to become CEO of Data and Analytics services and always again designed a focus on investments and strengthen our innovation agenda and drive long-term growth. So in Aon, that\u2019s -- what this is all about, long-term growth.","The idea of leading Aon United. For us, this is well beyond improving the value and the power of this idea and this ethic. We see very clearly so many examples of the economic leverage embedded in this pursuit. Now our leadership focus and what you\u2019re seeing us do is how we deliver this more consistently, how we deliver this upscale across the firm. And we believe this is highly relevant for a call like this with our long-term partners as leading Aon United is a source of client value. It's also very compelling for our colleagues. It's really a magnet to attract and retain talented leaders.","And I will say we\u2019ve been laying the foundation for Aon United for over a decade, evolving our portfolio, investing in new content capability, bringing those pieces together more closely together through programs like Aon Client Promise, which we\u2019ve talked about before, but a number of others as well. But it's really just in the last few quarters that we truly entered the era of Aon United and taking more structural change to bring that about.","And I will just say, again on the spirit of the format here, I will just give you one example. And this is an example discussed last week with our colleagues, the large U.S health system. And the example brings to life, how colleagues come together to talk to clients. And this is historically been a strong commercial risk clients. So imagine we\u2019re in the room with the risk manager and our commercial risk team, historically been a great client as I described before, as part of the Aon Client Promise work, which is a systematic way to understand client needs, our team begin to understand this major U.S health system at a desire and a strategy to begin to have their hospitals really seek out sort of the idea of be getting paid for outcome. So outcome-based payments. Obviously, this is a major trend that this client really wants to lead the way in that and obviously a whole series of substantial operating challenges ahead for them to do that.","But our team having heard that stepped back. So this risk team gather capability from around the firm. They brought commercial risk capability together more broadly. They brought our reinsurance colleagues to the table, reinsurance analytics colleagues to the table, and after a few hours together it was really clear. If our clients successful doing what they wanted to, they\u2019re going to inject greater volatility into their business. They may be right in the first six or seven years, but in the eighth year, if something happens to the population, they\u2019re actually trying to support, there's a lot more volatility, in fact, put the hospital at risk.","And when we talk to our clients about it, they were absolutely concerned. They really want to understand what we could do. And in the end our reinsurance colleagues bring to table analytic capability to model the risk, to really understand what was on the table for them and then giving them solutions on ways they could potentially transfer the risk. In essence what our colleagues did is we went from a risk discussion on the commercial side to really a more strategy discussion on how we can enable their strategy and lower the volatility and lower their risk. And this was really -- if you think about it, a constellation of colleagues, which we brought together broader commercial risk team with the reinsurance team and a set of topics we never would've talked about before with his client.","And this commercial risk capability, the reinsurance modeling access to the markets literally change the discussion with this client. And if you think about it, this opportunity for our colleagues was incredibly compelling. They\u2019re very excited to serve this hospital system in a much more broad based way. Our clients are excited and I don\u2019t need to tell you what that probably does for our -- back to our original relationship. On the commercial risk side, what that retention would look like sort of over time. So very, very powerful in terms of what this could be. So just to reflect sort of on those examples, these are the kinds of things that Aon United leadership enabled us to do. ","In terms of financial impact and what this bring for us, we just highlight three overarching takeaways that come out of the first half of the year. The first, continued momentum. And we saw this in our accrual results and truly just continuous to increase the conviction we have to run or exceed $7.97 of EPS for the year, highlighted by a Q2 performance of 5% organic growth, margin expansion of 130 basis points, EPS growth of 31% and free cash flow growth of 17%. So strong momentum for the first half of the year and for the quarter.","Second, we are continuing to invest and to generate long-term growth, supported by our strong balance sheet and significant free cash flow. As I mentioned earlier, we believe leading Aon United at scale will translate into stronger organic growth. And we continue to invest in our inorganic opportunities that allow us to innovate faster than our clients on the topics that matter most to them. Then again in the spirit of the new format, the example the World Bank cap on I talked about in the last call, very compelling to think about that doesn't happen without Aon United behavior.","When you\u2019re connecting the World Bank, trying to protect Chile, Columbia, Mexico and Peru, from earthquake risk that was here for -- not covered before, and you\u2019re trying to bring together a constellation of leaders in each of those countries and the World Bank, imagine who we had to bring to the table or make that happen. But we have the analytic capability, the data capability to do this, but that wasn't enough. We also have the relationships at each one of the countries and with the World Bank to do it, but that wasn't enough. And it wasn't until we brought this whole group together that we have come up with a incredibly innovative solution of $1.4 billion bond that by the way the World Bank invest back into the country, so it strengthen their economy and protects them from a risk that here before was never, never covered before and a real investment instrument that has ever been brought to market before.","So you get the idea in terms of sort of what this means for innovation on top of just client leadership and finally it's important to highlight the long-term productivity improvements from a global business services model, also continue to enable additional investment in emerging client needs like cyber intellectual property. So whole series of things sort of come out of the quarter and come out of the first part of the year that reinforce the momentum and what we want you to try to understand is this context underscores that Aon United is all about growth. So we discuss with our team Aon United equals growth. When we drive this set of behaviors on behalf of our clients, good things happened. Client leadership happens, retention happens, new client opportunities happen, innovation happens. And again it's a simple concept to describe, but difficult to replicate, especially in our industry. And I will just say I\u2019m very grateful to our team for their willingness to take on the opportunity and really excited about the progress we've made in these new expanded roles over the course of the quarter, over the course of the year, and what this means for us as we move Aon forward.","So giving you a little perspective on the topic, Again, we wouldn\u2019t have discussed on this call traditionally. For us its fundamental to the long-term growth of our firm and we will drive long-term growth in our firm and we want to give you a little context that you wouldn't have otherwise got to put sort of the results sort of in the perspective.","And with that high level summary in mind, I\u2019d like get Christa to offer a few thoughts and then we will open up to your questions. Christa?","Christa Davies","Thanks so much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. In the spirit of this new format, I will cover the key metrics, and then talk for example how we\u2019re driving operating leverage and investing in Aon, both organically and inorganically. The steps we\u2019re taking and our strong progress here to date continues to reinforce both our short and long-term performance target.","Our performance in the first half reflects organic revenue growth of 4%, an acceleration from 3% in the first half of 2017. In addition to accelerating organic growth, M&A is continuing to contribute, both improving the mix and driving total growth of a 11% for the first half of 2018. Adjusted operating margins increased 200 basis points year-to-date, an acceleration from our historic average of 70 to 80 basis points a year over the last 10 years.","Accelerating revenue combined with margin expansion is delivering operating income growth, which was exceptionally strong at 20% year-to-date with core operating income growth reflecting half of the performance. EPS growth of $0.28 year-to-date places us firmly on track to exceed our short-term target of $7.97 in earnings per share for 2018.","And lastly, reported free cash flow decreased $52 million year-over-year, driven by increased restructuring, reflecting this is our peak year of restructuring cash usage. Adjusting for restructuring, underlying free cash flow grew 17% year-over-year, reinforcing our commitment to double-digit free cash flow. And even stronger performance when combined with the 6% reduction in shares outstanding.","Overall, the strong financial performance and long-term outlook are supported by the investments we\u2019re making in our operating model in an Aon United way, as Greg described. Through the creation of our next generation of global business services model, we\u2019re creating greater scalability, productivity, and operating leverage. One example is the consolidation of all of our North American call centers across our solution lines.","We implemented a single industry leading cloud platform with global reach. It resulted in higher support for clients, better flexibility in managing capacity and cost savings of approximately $10 million annually. Another example is consolidating our procurement spend globally. We now manage approximately 80% of our spend or $2 billion across nine major categories in four regional hubs. That\u2019s up from about $1 billion of spend across four categories in our two largest countries.","To do this, we implemented a cloud based to pay solutions across 60 countries, supported by an offshore model. And that cloud platform is giving us greater insight into that total spend to be able to manage it more effectively over time. Through this, we\u2019ve delivered $30 million of value in 2018. These are just two examples of the long-term margin expansion that will continue through productivity improvements from our single operating model and the remaining savings from our restructuring program.","We are also making investments organically and inorganically to shift the portfolio towards higher growth, high return on capital areas. With a strong discipline against capital allocation and maximizing return on invested capital. An example of investment is in our delegated investment management business where we have added over 50 colleagues and deep research capabilities in our core strength areas of DB and DC while continue to invest and expand capabilities in broader asset pools like insurance, sovereign wealth funds in the nonprofit arena. This is driving double-digit organic growth through new client wins as well as driving significant inorganic growth with the acquisition of Townsend.","Since inception, our AUM is growing from 0 to over 150 billion AUM, driven by strong performance, transparency fees and innovative solution for clients. Another example of investment is $950 million we invested in share repurchase in the first half of 2018. This remains the highest return on capital opportunity across Aon, given our valuation of Aon based on our free cash flow growth over time.","In summary, acceleration in revenue growth, greater operating leverage and continued working capital improvements of $500 million over time give us confidence in our ability to deliver double-digit free cash flow growth. Double-digit free cash flow growth combined with a reduction in total shares outstanding will drive significant long-term shareholder value creation.","With that, I will turn the call back over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session of today's conference. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Sarah DeWitt from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Sarah DeWitt","Hi, good morning, and thank you for the new format. Given your comments on the growth initiatives in Aon United, where do you see the long-term organic growth profile of the company over time? I mean, clearly a 4% organic growth year-to-date you\u2019re growing faster than the global economy, but where do you see that spread headed over the long-term?","Gregory C. Case","So first of all, Sarah, I hope you like the format, love to get your comments, thoughts, if we can make it more helpful to you, but again we are trying to provide a little more perspective on sort of the long-term underpinning as sort of what's driving results. And this idea on Aon United is exactly at the core of what you're asking about. Aon United is growth for us. It really is about accelerating organic growth, that plus M&A we think is a very, very strong engine. And this idea of Aon United really fundamentally emanates from a client need, client view. They have talked to us about sort of how their needs are changing. They made it very clear when we bring our firm more effectively. It's very, very powerful. And if you think about that, we have done a number of things to reinforce this in an -- organically around the firm. Things like Aon Client Promise we have talked about or the Aon Impact model on how our colleagues conduct themselves. Things like articulating value, a whole series of things. But more recently, you have seen us take structural move. This is the new news. This is the news of the quarter, if you will, in terms of sort of how we're taking something we have done for a while and really accelerating it and it underpins organic growth. So we expect a continued progression. If you think about the last four years, 3%, 4%, and we have got momentum still building on that and we expect it to continue.","Sarah DeWitt","Okay, great. Thanks. And then just the expense savings, you have done $250 million to date and you target $300 million for '18. So should we expect a meaningful slowdown in the savings in the back half of '18, or are you running ahead of schedule or should we think about that ultimate target of $450 million as maybe being conservative?","Christa Davies","Sarah, what we would say is where we\u2019re up to year-to-date gives us a very strong confidence in being able to deliver the $300 million in savings in 2018 and the $450 million in savings in 2019. And so we're really pleased with the progress and confident about where we are up to year-to-date and we're not updating guidance for this year or next.","Sarah DeWitt","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Kai Pan","Thank you and good morning. Thank you for the refreshing format. We are still adjusting to it. And the first question follow-up to Sarah's question, organic growth. You have seen acceleration. And could you tell us a little bit more about is -- has the macro environment help you on that? And going forward, is your growth acceleration depend on macro environment improving further from here, or it's a self driven story?","Gregory C. Case","Look, Kai, as we\u2019ve said before, listen, our strategy, our approach is not to rely on market condition. Our approach is to rely on client needs and to address and to deliver on client need. And you have seen us consistently do that quarter-after-quarter. And to Sarah's question, we now believe we have the mechanism in place to accelerate that. And what you saw in the quarter overall from a market standpoint, look, at the end of the day we still continue to see exposures are modestly positive, the impact from pricing on average flat. There are spikes in different places, but on average basically modest. So this isn't about the market per se, this is about what we're doing to gather --- win more clients, retain more with those clients, we call it rollover doing more with them, rollover. So from our standpoint, we're going to continue to build that profile. I just would note, you saw real moment in commercial risk, you saw real moment in the reinsurance world, in the health world, real moment in the retirement world in terms of what we're trying to do. And so for us, what we have in place is designed to drive organic growth. And what we do know for sure is client need around the world is substantial and continues to grow. And so while we may lead a number of these markets, the world that we live in and our set of competitors are massively underpenetrated. So we believe there is substantial opportunity irrespective of market conditions to drive organic growth.","Kai Pan","Okay. That's great. My second question is focusing on margin expansion. I hope you can comment on three particular points. Number one is, the 130 basis point margin expansion in the second quarter, mostly driven by the 160 basis point savings. Since not a lot sort of operating synergy or leverage, I should say, given that organic growth of 5%. Number -- the second item is that in the second half the cost saving, incremental cost saving will be much less than the first half. Does it mean that margin expansion would now be as strong? And the third item is you mentioned little bit in your prepared slides about drag from the recent merger acquisition, I hope you can give EBIT like figures around it.","Christa Davies","Kai, I will certainly try to answer all those questions. So let's start with the facts. We\u2019re up 130 basis points in margin expansion in Q2 and we are up 200 basis points in a margin expansion year-to-date. In any quarter this moment and we would highlight a few underlying drivers such as restructuring and FX as you mentioned, and with these our margins in the core standpoint are up 50 basis points year-to-date, a little more in Q1 and a little less in Q2. That said, there are other impacts as you mentioned in the quarter. We have a minus 60 basis points impact from M&A and a minus 30 basis point impact from FX, and a minus 30 basis point impact from timing from E&O. And so we have got sort of substantial headwinds in the quarter in addition to the investments we're making in growth. And so it's -- while it's easy to strip out certain items in and out of the quarter, we do manage margins overall for the year and that's why we feel very strongly about our margin expansion year-to-date at 200 basis points, and it gives us confidence at our full-year margin expansion and as you described leading to margin expansion in 2019 and beyond. And so, 2018 margin expansion will be driven by accelerating organic revenue growth, mix shift and operating leverage, both coming from restructuring and productivity.","Kai Pan","Okay. Thank you for the detail. Last one, if I may, in the spirit of your new model. You also mentioned potentially inviting the business leader to this conversation. I don\u2019t know if Eric or Michael is on the phone, so I would like to ask them what has changed into the day-to-day operation under the new model compared with the quarter's ago? And any potential -- you talk about the benefit, I just wonder is there potential drawback or downside risk to -- in the sort of implementation of the new model?","Gregory C. Case","So, Kai, they\u2019re not on the call today, but what we will do next is to tee up. We will actually start the call next time on sort of operational implications of Aon United. Eric and Michael comment on those directly sort of all the things that are happening in the marketplace, sort of on a positive way and sort of how they\u2019re leading and managing that and how it's coming through. I think what you're going to find is you talk to them is the opportunity here is so substantial. Again, the client need is great. This is all driven on client need and when our colleagues get around the table and talk about client issues, and those colleague has come from the full complement or capability we\u2019ve got, we create all kinds of possibilities. And even when there is not a commercial outcome, the client thinks about us differently. So fundamentally when we deliver Aon United capability, client perception changes and economics change, growth changes. So I think you're going to hear a lot about that. They can also talk a little bit about sort of the Aon Operating Committee they pull together, that really gives us a chance to sort of think about Aon United types of decisions in a way we have never done before. So a lot of momentum on this. And what we are excited about, I think you will hear it in their conversation is again we worked this for a decade on a number of different things we have done to create the conditions. Now we are taking structural change. Now we are doing things like the Aon Operating Committee, like the co-presidents, like the single P&L, like the single brand. These are things we have never done before that we believe will accelerate a proven concept and drive organic growth. So I agree with you. There will be two highlights, Eric and Mike for the next call.","Q - Kai Pan\\","That would be great. Look forward to it.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Yaron Kinar from Goldman Sachs. Yaron, your line is now open.","Yaron Kinar","Good morning. First question I just want to, I guess it's more of a clarification point. Christa, the 30 basis points in E&O timing and 60 basis points in M&A drags on the margins, were those year-to-date or for the quarter?","Christa Davies","It was for the quarter, Yaron.","Yaron Kinar","Okay, got it. And then if you look at the second half of this year, you're running up against maybe tougher organic growth comps. You highlighted FX, there's a potential drag as well as currency remains as is. Do you think that -- is margin improvement achievable ex restructuring phase?","Christa Davies","Yes, it is, Yaron. So what I would say is as we look at the full-year 2018 and the second half, we are going to drive margin expansion through organic growth, continued investment in M&A, mix shift across the portfolio as we continue to invest in higher growth, higher margin areas. The operational leverage we're getting in our business both from restructuring and the productivity we are getting from the Aon United operating model.","Gregory C. Case","And I would say, overall, Yaron, sort of we are continuing to build momentum sort of on the organic growth side. If you think about sort of where we\u2019ve come in the first half of the year, very, very positive. The second half, we think we will have continued progress. There are a couple of categories, the reinsurance 8% sort of in the quarter when we have done for the first half. We are also going to be -- by the way up against a high comp in the second half. We also had some events that happened sort of last year that may or may not happen. Assuming they don't happen, there obviously be some -- there will be a little bit of a headwind to get some of those comps. But frankly we are going to continue to push and build momentum there. On data analytics, on the other side of the equation were negative for the quarter as you see when we talked about its due to a single incident and we expect the second half to be more positive. So there are lots of puts and takes through the course of the year, but you can expect us to continue build momentum sort of on the organic growth side.","Yaron Kinar","Okay. And Christa you highlighted M&A as potential source of margin improvement in the second half, is that just the timing of the M&A that\u2019s already come in that now becomes accretive or are there other elements there?","Christa Davies","Yes. So what I would say is look I wouldn\u2019t over [indiscernible] on M&A in anyone quarter. I would say over the course of the year, we expect investments we are making organically and inorganically in the business to contribute to margin expansion.","Yaron Kinar","Okay. And maybe one last quick one. The $7.97 target, EPS target, is that still in place even with the potential pressures from currency?","Christa Davies","It certainly is, Yaron. So we feel really confident about exceeding $7.97 for 2018, driven by core performance, restructuring savings, the returns on the investments we have made in M&A and allocation of capital.","Yaron Kinar","Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Adam Klauber from William Blair. Adam, your line is now open.","Adam Klauber","Good morning, everyone. Free cash flow, I believe peaked in 2016 around $2.1 billion. Do you think you will get back there by 2019, just roughly, an outlook for guidance? And then, once you hit that core rate, again, will growth of free cash flow be higher than EPS or more in line with operating earnings?","Christa Davies","Yes. So, Adam, what I would say is we are not giving new cash flow target. What we have said is we are going to drive free cash flow on a double-digit basis. You can see that on underlying basis year-to-date of 17%, which we\u2019re very pleased with. And what you have seen and you will see in calendar year 2018 is we\u2019re at a peak year of restructuring cash usage. So you will see free cash flow on a reported basis accelerate in 2019 and that reported and adjusted free cash flow will start to come together in 2019 as the restructuring cash outlay winds down. As we think about free cash flow growth the longer term, you\u2019re really going to have operating income growth plus improvements in working capital. We really outlined about $500 million of working capital primarily receivable sitting in our balance sheet, that we will free up over the next couple of years that will contribute to strong cash flow growth and strong double-digit great cash flow growth combined with the reduction in shares will dramatically increase free cash flow per share over time.","Adam Klauber","Thanks. And how should we think about, again, looking a bit more forward not look for guidance, but how should we think about CapEx and pension? Will they be positive and negative for free cash over the next couple of years?","Christa Davies","So, we have given specific guidance on CapEx. And what we have said is CapEx is elevated in the current year and next due to the restructuring program and that is coming down and then pension is also coming down over time.","Adam Klauber","Okay. And then just a follow-up on health solutions. A good quarter, I think you mentioned that, there were strong growth in the U.S. What, I guess -- what was driving the U.S growth?","Gregory C. Case","Again, Adam, step back and essentially think about sort of what we have done, as we described in the first quarter, we just have continued momentum in the first half of the year across all aspects of the business. Certainly like to benefit sort of the work the team has done around the world, terrific. In H&B, the work the team has done is terrific, but really across the board sort of in the exchange businesses as well. So it just continuing momentum on the health side. So the -- if you sort of think about what we have done historically sort of in health for the year, last year at 7%, we ended the quarter as you see, 7%. So you\u2019re just seeing the momentum overall. It really is performance across the board.","Adam Klauber","Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Meyer Shields from KBW. Meyer, your line is now open.","Meyer Shields","Great. Thanks. Greg, I don't want to over analyze the comments you made with regards to the hospital strategic discussion, but am I right to think that having a strategy consultancy something like Mackenzie within the portfolio of Aon companies would make those conversation more robust?","Gregory C. Case","Listen, Meyer, this is -- this -- I would also don't want to overplay. This is one example I pulled out sort of a last week example. Our team is bringing solutions. So forget sort of the traditional kind of strategic consulting firms, full respect to them, but our team is bringing solutions. They not only bought a diagnosis of the situation, which frankly open the eyes of the client, they brought a way to actually enable the client's strategy. And in this case, my gosh, without that there is a lot more risk in the process. So we have moved very much sort of around -- sort of a solution approach. You combine that with our data and analytics, we have in each one of the categories, we will bring to bear a set of -- the ammunition is amazing. It is always been amazing out there sort of the capability we have got in the data analytics on the commercial side, on the reinsurance, on the retirement side, on the health side, we have just got an incredible platform to sort of draw from. And what we have done before is taken that platform and pull it together and brought it and put it in front of the clients in a thoughtful way. Aon Client Promise gave us, Meyer, the basis of how much we can do that. It's a systematic way, we listen to clients, understand their needs, and react to those. And what we're doing is now breaking down structural barriers and make it easier for our colleagues to come together and talk about clients. And we just -- there is another example I could use, which is European headquartered, multinational building products company. You would know it very, very well and frankly had a very good relationship with them on the risk side, but they are under some real pressure from a performance standpoint. Our team brought together a full complement of folks from across our solution lines and came up with sort of whole way for them to think about their benefits for their colleagues, for their employees, and did it in a way that we believe will increase engagement. And it was a 50, 60 country answer. The client never would have thought about it and for god sake never would have thought anybody could execute it until we sat around the table, we got up 10 passports, talking about what we can bring to the table, from 10 different countries, I mean. And so, there is just so much opportunity and it's -- in so many respects, Meyer, it's so obvious and so clear, but doggone hard to execute. You\u2019re getting colleagues to sort of work together in ways they haven't before, bringing expertise in a more integrated way and we have to break down the barriers to do that. And as I said, we have proven this works exceptionally well. We have done it in one-off different situations. Now the new news, which you're hearing is, we're taking various structural steps to make it easier for our colleagues to do this. And the beauty is when it happens, it doesn't have too result as I said before, in commercial gratification immediately. This is changing the dialogue with clients. Our colleagues love doing that. It's reinforcing, it's contagious. It's in fact -- it's a wonderful sort of outcome. And so, all the capability, ours is that we have the leadership will to make it happen, and that's what we are excited about.","Q - Meyer Shields\\","Okay. Now, that's very helpful. Thanks. Two other quick questions. One, has the year-to-date results in organic fully reflect the strong acquisition activity last year. And Christa, could you identify the individual service lines that are most exposed to the FX headwinds on second-half revenues?","Christa Davies","Yes. So, Meyer, the first thing I would say yes the M&A impact from last year does not impact organic. It adds to organic and so it doesn't reflect. And if you think about the M&A we did in 2017, most of it was in Q4. And so what you will -- what's showing up in organic this year is not M&A related to last year. There may be some portion of it that shows up in Q4, but some of the acquisitions were done in December Q4. So very little will show up this year. And then as we think about sort of the FX, we don't really break out the impact by solution lines, but it's fair to say we do have a local revenue and expenses in 120 countries. And so we generally prefer a weaker U.S dollar. And the big exception to that for us, Meyer, is the pound, but what you\u2019re seeing I think in the FX headwind in Q3 and Q4 is primarily related to Latin America.","Meyer Shields","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Elyse, your line is now open.","Elyse Greenspan","Hi. Good morning. My first question on just a numbers question. There was about a $103 million of legacy litigation that you guys pulled out of our adjusted earnings in the quarter. Can we just get a little bit more color what did that stem from? And is that something that we should think about impacting your earnings going forward?","Christa Davies","Yes. So, Elyse, what we would say is we can't discuss the specific litigation. But one other things you should get comfort from is we have taken a number of steps over time to reduce volatility at Aon. We have put in place limits of liabilities. We've purchased additional insurance and what you will see when we file our Q later today is that we\u2019ve decreased the estimated losses related to disclosed litigation from $300 million to $100 million as a result of the actions we are taking. And so we're dramatically reducing really legacy litigation as we continue to take steps to drive growth across the firm.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. And then in terms of maybe a follow-up question on the margin side of things. You highlighted this quarter was impacted by 60 basis points from M&A and 30 basis points from currency to give us about the recent hit for the next couple of quarters. How do we think about currency, I guess, the margin impact on a quarterly basis implied by that? And then also you -- based on your commentary it seems like the drag from M&A will get better over the next couple of quarters? I'm just trying to tie together those numbers.","Christa Davies","Sure. So the first thing I would say, Elyse, is we don't give guidance on the FX impact on margin. It's frankly pretty difficult to predict. But what we can say is that on an EPS basis, we expect $0.03 impact in Q3 and a $0.03 impact in Q4, primarily driven by Latin America. And then what we would say is we did have an impact as you mentioned, minus 60 basis points from M&A in Q2. We would expect over the course of the year for that to neutralize. I think we have spoken previously when you do M&A, the first year of integration is largely a negative impact on margin. And so, as you integrate the business and then longer term, it for sure drives margin expansion, because we are investing in high revenue growth, high margin area. So I hope that helps.","Elyse Greenspan","Yes. That's helpful. And then in terms of on the organic growth side, would you say I guess, it seems like other than the one-off that you called out on the data side that the quarter probably represents more or less a run rate level. I guess aside from maybe some of the headwinds on the reinsurance side and is that how we can kind of think about the growth level being sustained over the balance of the year? And just based off, how you guys see exposures in pricing and your ability to generate new business? How would you think about the organic growth outlook for 2019 as well? Do you have a kind of initial view at this point?","Gregory C. Case","Elyse, as you know, we don't give specific guidance on sort of the growth profile and what it is going look like what you have seen it and fully agree with you on, so the quarters will be variable when you sort of saw things move around in the quarter. But over the course of the year, the first six months, it really is about continued momentum. And our goal each year is to sort of continue to build momentum. We have the structure in place to do that, the investments in place to do that. And that's really what we intend to do for '18 and into '19 and into '20. I want to emphasize again that for us this is not about pricing, this is really about what we do in the marketplace on behalf of clients to drive long-term value. That's going to be the driver of growth for us by far and sort of pricing and insured value sort of are important to understand, but are not going to be the drivers for us. And so you will see our anticipation is continuing momentum on the growth side in '18 and in '19.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. And then one last question. One of your peers saw a slowdown in their defined benefits on consulting business. You obviously don't break out that line items. I'm not sure how much detail you want to go into, but are you just -- is that -- are you observing a slowdown in that business? Any color you can give us, and I'm assuming it's absorbed by growth within other area of your retirement business, if you're seeing that?","Gregory C. Case","Well, listen, overall when you think about sort of the retirement piece, elements of this business are growing, elements are not growing, what we do know for sure back to the client orientation is that when you think about sort of retirements in the world today, roughly 20% of the population's prepared for retirement. Our companies, our clients are sort of dealing with that every day. It's becoming increasingly difficult for them to actually help their employees think about how they can deal with retirement. So we are bringing to bear as best we can, a full complement of ideas and perspectives to help them sort retirement. And we think that\u2019s a major sort of opportunities long-term. Certainly elements within that will be positive and negative, but our view overall, but Christa thoughts on that?","Christa Davies","Yes. So, but I would say, Elyse, is our results actually reflect solid growth in our core actuary retirement business. So we are very pleased we got a fantastic team serving clients. And it's driven by an increase in volume and rates across North America and EMEA. We're really helping clients solve a lot of pension issues around derisking, taking risk off the table, given interest rates j risen. And so there is a lot of opportunities for us to do that with clients and we are very pleased with the progress we are making to date. And, Elyse, it reflects a lot of other things that we're doing in our own pension plan at Aon as we continue to take risk off the table as you've seen, given the rise in interest rates and the ability to do that in the marketplace today.","Elyse Greenspan","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Paul Newsome from Sandler O'Neill + Partners. Paul, your line is now open.","Paul Newsome","Good morning. The only question I really had was, I would like to if you would dive a little bit more into the organic growth for the reinsurance segment. And it seems like and tell me if I'm wrong that pricing is a little weak, but customers maybe buying more. What I don't know is whether or not there is actually a change in market share amongst the brokers themselves?","Gregory C. Case","Listen, Paul, let me step and we would say overall market conditions are -- continued to be if you\u2019re going to think about this from a one standpoint, challenge from the stand -- there is plenty of capital out there, lots of opportunity to serve our clients on that beyond -- on behalf. But if you look at our fundamental results on the reinsurance side, they continuous to be the basics. It is success in treaty, its success in fact, it success in insurance length securities, it's across the board. By the way it's another quarter of net new business win for us when you think about where we are. The data analytics, our team has is, its exceptional and just reflect back, a few years ago on these calls, everyone was asking about what about growth, what about growth, I just would just remind you there was a time when you literally were talking to the number one place in the world on treaty and basically property with 6% of the revenues and by the way a big chunk of that was in the U.S and those prices were down massively, and we are still net new wins. And so all those fundamentals are sort of in place and have been for a couple of years and continue to build and sort of you're seeing that result. And again, I would say obviously the result for the quarter is exceptional. We would ask you to sort of think about over the course of the year and our view is it's just reflects on 2018 versus 2017 versus 2016 and reinsurance you're going to see momentum.","Paul Newsome","Greg, thanks. Congrats on the quarter.","Gregory C. Case","Thanks.","Operator","Our last question is coming from Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley. Kai, your line is now open.","Kai Pan","Thank you. I have two more follow-ups. Number one on the buybacks. It looks like year-to-date you bought back a nice $50 million dividends like close to 100, and the acquisition probably about $50 million, so together $1.2 billion outlay. If you look at free cash flow including the restructuring charge $300 million and you\u2019ve seem to raise a little bit short-term debt like $500 million. So I just wonder compared to those source of cash and use of cash, do you see that buyback has to slowdown in the back half of the year or -- and that the free cash flow coming in or you have additional room for the leverage?","Christa Davies","Yes. So, Kai, it's a great question. And what we would say is as we think about cash flow over the course of the year, our strongest cash flow quarters have always been Q3 and Q4 and that remains true. So as you think about cash in second half of the year, it will be stronger in terms of just cash flow from operations. And then as we think about uses of cash, obviously, as we allocate cash to different activities, we are going to do it based on ROIC. And so what you're going to see is we will continue to allocate cash to buyback, because it remains our highest return on capital opportunity across the firm. You will see us continue to invest in M&A and organically as the return on capital opportunities are substantial. And then you did see us increase leverage slightly and we return to 2016 levels over the course of time. And then what you will see on debt really is as EBITDA grows we will continue to add debt, keeping our leverage ratio aligned.","Kai Pan","Okay. My last one is back to the full-year guidance, $7.97. If you step back to the beginning of the year when you first sort of gave out the guidance, and you now seems like there is a little bit benefit about $0.06 that benefits from foreign exchange and also about $0.10 benefit from the lower overall tax rate. So why you\u2019re not -- full-year guidance, why not be like 2% higher? Am I reading too much into it?","Christa Davies","Yes. Well I would say, Kai, we don\u2019t normally give guidance. When we announced the transaction in May 2017, that drove amazing benefits to shareholders, left Aon with a portfolio with higher revenue growth, higher margin, higher return on capital and a terrific cash benefit to shareholders, $3 billion. We really at that point in time, May last year, wanted to be clear that we would exceed EPS guidance for 2018. EPS is up 28% year-to-date and we feel confident about exceeding the $7.97 for 2018 and we're not updating guidance.","Kai Pan","Okay, great. Thank you so much and good luck.","Operator","We have one last follow-up question in queue from Yaron Kinar from Goldman Sachs. Yaron, your line is now open.","Yaron Kinar","Hi. Sorry for fixating on this, but I want to go back to M&A for a second. So, Christa, if I understand your comments correctly, basically you\u2019re going to get some lift as you\u2019re integrating some of the previous acquisitions and getting them into higher margins. But if we expect an overall lift in margins for the second half of the year, doesn't also mean that you are not getting as much of new M&A revenues coming in the door in the second half of the year that would offset the lift that you\u2019re getting from previous M&A?","Christa Davies","Yaron, I think you are hoping for a level of guidance on M&A that we are probably just not going to give. What I would say overall is as we think about M&A, the first year M&A integration is largely negative on margins, you saw that particularly show in Q2. Over the course of the full-year, it will be a little less than what you saw in Q2. And then over time what you see is M&A from previous years, example 2016 starts to contribute to margins, and so you have a mix shift going on. Of course, we are investing in higher margins businesses, in the businesses we bring into the firm, so that will contribute positively to margin over time. The last thing I would say on margins is, we do expect -- we are up 200 basis points year-to-date in margins. We expect margin expansion in the second half of the year to contribute to $7.97 exceeding EPS guidance for the year.","Yaron Kinar","Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg Case for closing remarks.","Gregory C. Case","Just want to say, on behalf of Christa, I appreciate everybody being part of the call today. As we said at the beginning, we took a bit different approach today, different format, trying to give you a view which sort of highlight some of the long-term efforts we\u2019re taking or efforts that we think will impact the long-term success of the firm. So hopefully you found it helpful. If you have thoughts or comments or other ways we could sort of do this or create this kind of perspective, let us know. But really appreciate being part of the call today and look forward to our conversation next quarter. Thanks very much.","Operator","And that concludes today\u2019s conference.

At this time all participants will be in listen-only mode until the question-and-answer portion of today's call. If anyone has any objection, you may disconnect your line at this time.","I would also like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded. And that it is important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature, as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risk and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our first quarter 2016 results, as well as having been posted on our website.","Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, President and CEO of Aon Plc.","Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter of 2016 conference call. Joining me here today is our CFO, Christa Davies. I would note that there are slides available on our website for you to follow along with our commentary today.","And consistent with previous quarters I'd like to cover two areas before turning the call over to Christa for further financial review. First is our performance against key metrics we communicate to shareholders. And second is overall organic growth performance, including continued areas of strategic investment across Aon.","On the first topic, our performance versus key metrics. Each quarter we measure our performance against the key metrics we focus on achieving over the course of the year, grow organically, expand margins, increase earnings per share, and deliver free cash flow growth.","Turning to slide 3. In the first quarter organic revenue growth was 3% with growth across every major business, highlighted by 4% growth in each of our retail brokerage businesses and positive organic growth in Reinsurance. Operating margin increased 20 basis points, reflecting strong operating performance in Risk Solutions. EPS decreased 1% to $1.35, including a $0.10 unfavorable impact from changes in foreign currency. And finally, free cash flow was $221 million, reflecting solid underlying performance in our seasonally weakest cash flow quarter.","Overall, our first quarter results reflect the strength of our industry leading franchise and a solid start to the year. With organic revenue growth across every major business, adjusted operating margin expansion, improved return on invested capital, and effective allocation of capital, highlighted by the repurchase of $750 million of stock.","Turning to slide 4. On the second topic of growth and investment I want to spend the next few minutes discussing the quarter for both of our segments.","In Risk Solutions organic revenue growth was 3%, similar to the prior year quarter, driven by growth across all major businesses. As we've discussed previously we're driving a set of initiatives and making strategic investments that are strengthening the underlying performance and position our Risk Solutions segment for long term growth and improved operating leverage.","With management of our renewal book through Aon Client Promise and retention rates of more than 90% on average across retail brokerage, highlighted by record retention levels of nearly 94% in U.S. Retail and EMEA. New business generation of $225 million across retail brokerage, including record new business in U.S. Retail. Twenty consecutive quarters of positive net new business in core treaty Reinsurance.","An increased operating leverage from our significant investments in innovative technology and data and analytics, including Aon InPoint, which captures over 3 million trades and $160 billion of bound premium. ReView, our reinsurer dashboard combined with strategic consulting to help reinsurers to be more effective capital markets for seeing company clients. And our Aon Broking initiative to better match client need with insurer appetite for risk.","A great example of our innovation in data and analytics was the launch of Aon Client Treaty, the largest ever underwritten portfolio of risk in the history of Lloyd's. Since launching on January 1 we remain very excited about the positive impact of the Client Treaty for our largest and most sophisticated clients. We've had terrific success in feedback from clients around the world. And continue to attract new clients with the Client Treaty being a major differentiator.","And finally, we're expanding our content and global footprint through tuck-in acquisitions that increase scale in emerging markets or expand capability.","Reflecting on the individual businesses within Risk Solutions. In the Americas, organic revenue growth was 4%, similar to the prior year quarter. Exposures continue to be positive across the region, while the impact on pricing was negative, resulted in a relatively stable market impact overall, similar to the last six quarters. We saw double-digit growth in Latin America, driven by management of the renewable book portfolio with many regions delivering strong growth, despite macroeconomic challenges facing the region.","In U.S. Retail growth was driven by solid retention rates and continued record new business generation, led by a diverse portfolio of products, including health, P&C, and surety. Affinity also recorded solid performance, highlighted by strong growth in the consumer solutions.","In International organic revenue growth was 4%, compared to 3% in the prior-year quarter. Similar to the last six quarters exposures continue to be stable. And the impact from pricing was modestly negative on average, driven by fragile market conditions in various countries across Europe and Asia and continued pricing pressure in the Pacific region.","Results reflect strong growth in Asia, including strength in Health and Benefits and strong management of the renewal book portfolio. In Continental Europe we saw solid growth, driven by both new business generation and management of the renewal book portfolio, reflecting strong leadership across the region, as the macroeconomic environment continues to stabilize. And in the Pacific we saw continued strength in New Zealand, while Australia showed modest growth.","In Reinsurance organic revenue growth was 1%, compared to negative 1% in the prior year quarter, reflecting our previous guidance of an expected return to modest growth in 2016. Results in the quarter were primarily driven by growth in global facultative placements, cedent demand in treaty, and from new business generation. Results were partially offset by unfavorable market impact.","As the rate of price decline continues to moderate, capital is being deployed to new markets, including U.S. mortgage credit risk, life and annuity risk, and other emerging risks, such as cyber liability. And as highlighted in our prior discussions, new opportunities for growth, combined with industry leading data analytics, has positioned our Reinsurance business for a return to modest growth in 2016.","Turning to HR Solutions. Organic revenue growth was 2% with growth across both businesses. We're seeing growth in high demand areas, where we have strategically invested in innovative solutions and clients serving capabilities, reflecting Aon Hewitt's leadership and in depth understanding of market trends. Including as clients manage risk against pension schemes that are frozen, largely underfunded, and facing regulatory changes; solutions to de-risk pensions plans; and support for delegated investment solutions, a strong growth area, where assets under management have grown from $10 billion to roughly $85 billion in 5 years.","Continued investment to strengthen our industry leading portfolio of health solutions, covering a full range of benefit strategies, client size, and funding choices, including our suite of private health care exchanges.","We're also investing in Software-as-a-Service models in our HR BPO business, where growth in new clients and conversion of existing clients is driving strong demand as well as the expansion of our capabilities to include financial implementations.","And finally, we're investing in our Talent and Rewards business, as we're seeing strong demand for data and analytics to support increasing organizational change.","Turning to the individual businesses within HR Solutions. In Consulting Services organic revenue growth was 3%, compared to 2% in the prior year quarter. Results in the quarter reflect continued growth in retirement consulting, primarily driven by demand for delegated investment consulting services. We also saw growth in core pension solutions, where we provide clients the best combination of expertise and execution. And modest growth in communications consulting.","In Outsourcing organic revenue growth was 1%, compared to 4% in the prior year quarter. The prior year quarter included certain out of cycle follow-on enrollments on our Retiree Exchange related to a very large client implementation. Results excluding the follow-on enrollments in the prior year reflect strong growth in HR BPO driven by new client wins in cloud based solutions.","In summary, we delivered solid organic growth across every major business and strengthened our operational performance, driven by our industry leading platform of client serving capabilities and investments in data and analytics.","With that said I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Christa for further financial review. Christa?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks so much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg noted our first quarter results reflect a solid start to the year. We delivered organic revenue growth across both segments and delivered strong operating margin improvement in Risk Solutions. We improved return on invested capital through the disposition of certain businesses and effectively allocated capital, highlighted by the repurchase of $750 million of ordinary shares in the quarter, more share repurchase than we've done in any quarter since 2008. Strong share repurchase, coupled with the recent announcement of a 10% increase to the quarterly cash dividend, reflects our long term belief in the strengthening free cash flow of the firm.","Now let me turn to the financial results for the quarter on page 6 of the presentation. Our core EPS performance, excluding certain items, decreased 1% to $1.35 per share for the first quarter compared to $1.37 in the prior year quarter. Certain items that were adjusted for in the core EPS performance and highlighted in the schedules on page 12 of the press release include non-cash intangible asset amortization.","As we noted at the beginning of the call we evaluate performance over the course of the year as macro factors or certain actions to strengthen underlying performance may distort results on a near term basis.","To help put the first quarter underlying EPS in context, first we incurred unfavorable foreign currency related impacts totaling $0.10 per share, including $0.05 per share of translation for a stronger U.S. dollar and $0.05 per share for remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities in non-functional currencies, primarily resulting from significant devaluation of the exchange rate in Venezuela. Going forward, if currency were to remain stable at today's rates, we would expect an immaterial impact for the rest of the year.","Second, we took steps to further strengthen return on invested capital with the disposition of certain businesses. In HR Solutions we incurred $0.06 per share of transaction and portfolio repositioning related costs in connection with dispositions. These costs were more than offset by $0.10 per share of gains recorded in other income.","Lastly, the prior year quarter benefited from $0.12 per share of other income gains.","Now let me talk about each of the segments on the next slide. In our Risk Solutions segment organic revenue growth was 3%, operating margin increased 100 basis points to 24.2% and operating income increased 3% compared to the prior year quarter. Operating income included a $13 million unfavorable impact from FX. Excluding this impact underlying operating income increased 6% versus the prior year quarter.","Operating margin improvement of 100 basis points includes a 30-basis-point favorable impact from FX. Excluding the impact from FX, underlying operating margin improved 70 basis points in the quarter. Strong operating improvement in the first quarter reflects organic growth in each business, including Reinsurance, and improved return on our investments in data and analytics across the portfolio.","We continued to face certain headwinds in the first quarter from an unfavorable market impact in Reinsurance and weaker economic conditions in a number of geographies. Despite these challenges our performance in Risk Solutions reflects strong new business generation and increased operating leverage in the business.","We expect continued growth and operational improvement throughout 2016 as we make progress towards our long term operating margin target of 26%. In addition, if short term interest rates continue to rise, we believe we have significant leverage to an improving interest rate environment, as every 100 basis point rise in global interest rates should result in approximately $45 million of investment income.","Turning to the HR Solutions segment, organic revenue growth was 2%. Operating margin decreased 140 basis points to 11.8%. And operating income decreased 14% compared to the prior year quarter. Results were exactly in line with our previously provided guidance. Operating income included a $3 million unfavorable impact from FX.","As mentioned previously, underlying results in the quarter included $20 million, or minus 220 basis points, of transaction and portfolio repositioning related costs as we continue to drive improved return on capital for the firm. The gain relating to the sale of our Recruitment Process Outsourcing business was recorded in other income. Strong underlying operating performance was driven by organic revenue growth in high demand areas where we've been investing as well as expense discipline and return on our investments.","Looking forward, we expect continued growth in revenue, operating income, and margin in 2016 towards our long term target of 22%, with quarterly patterning of operating income results in HR Solutions similar to 2015. More specifically, operating income will be down in the first half and up in the second half of the year, most notably in Q4.","Now let me discuss a few of the line items outside of the operating segments on slide 9. Unallocated expenses were $46 million compared to $47 million in the prior year quarter. Interest income was $2 million compared to $3 million in the prior year quarter. Interest expense increased $4 million to $69 million due to an increase in total debt outstanding.","Other income of $18 million primarily includes gains on the sale of certain businesses partially offset by losses due to the unfavorable impact of exchange rates on the remeasurement of assets and liabilities in non-functional currencies. Going forward, we expect a run rate of approximately $45 million per quarter of unallocated expense and $3 million per quarter of interest income.","Interest expense in the second quarter is expected to be approximately $72 million or modestly higher than the first quarter due to the overlap of $750 million of notes placed in February and $500 million of notes due in May. We currently expect interest expense to decline to $70 million per quarter thereafter.","Turning to taxes, the effective tax rate on net income from continuing operations decreased to 18.4% compared to the prior year quarter at 19.1% due to the geographic distribution of income and certain favorable discrete tax adjustments.","Lastly, average diluted shares outstanding decreased 5% to 273.7 million in the first quarter, compared to 287.1 million in the prior year quarter, as we effectively allocate capital and manage dilution. The company repurchased 7.7 million Class A ordinary shares for approximately $750 million in the first quarter. The company has $3.3 billion of remaining authorization under its share repurchase program.","Actual shares outstanding on March 31 were 264.8 million. And there are approximately 5 million additional dilutive equivalents. Estimated Q2 2016 beginning dilutive share count is approximately 270 million, subject to share price movement, share issuance, and share repurchase.","Now let me turn to the next slide to highlight our solid balance sheet and strong cash flow growth on slide 10. At March 31, 2016, cash and short term investments were $1.1 billion. We expect levels to return to our normal run rate between $600 million to $800 million in the second quarter.","Total debt outstanding was approximately $6.6 billion. And total debt to EBITDA on a GAAP basis was 2.7 times.","Cash flow from operations for the first 3 months decreased 8% or $25 million to $273 million. This was primarily driven by unfavorable timing of certain tax related items that we expect to normalize by Q2, partially offset by working capital improvements and a decline in cash paid for pensions and restructuring.","Free cash flow, as defined by cash flow from operations less CapEx, decreased 6% or $15 million to $221 million, reflecting a decline in cash flow from operations, partially offset by a $10 million decrease in CapEx.","Turning to the next slide to discuss our significant increases in free cash flow. We value the firm based on free cash flow and allocate capital to maximize free cash flow returns. Free cash flow of $2.4 billion in 2017 is not our end goal, as further long term sustainable free cash flow will be driven by continued operating income growth and additional working capital initiatives beyond 2017.","There are four primary areas that are expected to contribute to our near term goal of delivering $2.4 billion or more for the full year 2017. The first is continued operational performance, driven by organic revenue growth and margin expansion. The second is working capital improvements, as we focus on closing the gap between receivables and payables. The third is declining uses of cash for pension, CapEx, and restructuring, which we expect to free up more than $90 million of annual free cash flow between the end of the 2015 and 2017. And fourth, lower cash tax payments reflecting a lower effective tax rate.","Turning to our pension plans. We've taken significant steps to reduce volatility and liability, as we've closed plans to new entrants, frozen plans from accruing additional benefits, and continue to derisk certain plan assets. We currently expect contributions to decline by approximately $44 million in 2016 and expect non-cash pension income to be a modest benefit in 2016 versus 2015.","Regarding our restructuring program. As all charges related to restructuring program have been incurred, we expect cash payments to decline by $9 million to approximately $19 million in 2016. And continue to decline thereafter to an immaterial amount.","In summary we delivered solid underlying results in the first quarter. Investments in our industry leading platform of client serving capabilities across risk, retirement, and health continue to position the firm for long term revenue growth, further margin expansion, and strong free cash flow generation towards our near term goal of $2.4 billion for the full year 2017.","With that I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And now our first question comes from the line of Sarah DeWitt of JPMorgan. You may now ask your question.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Sarah.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I was wondering if you could talk about what you're seeing in terms of the broader macro environment and your confidence in your ability to grow in both Risk Solutions and HR Solutions in the face of a softening P&C market and somewhat choppy economy.","Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer","Let me just reflect and take a step back a little bit, Sarah. We feel very \u2013 candidly, very good about continued progress. You saw it. And you've seen us grow in each of the last number of years.","But if you think about our confidence both in the current environment for the coming years \u2013 by the way, not just grow the business but also improve margins, tracking toward our 26% and 22% goals in Risk and in HR Solutions.","And I would just say, listen, just as an example. This often gets linked back into the pricing on the insurance side. And we would encourage you to separate those and just consider \u2013 think about from Aon's standpoint, three sources of growth. And just thinking on the Risk side for a moment.","Our ability to grow in the traditional business, property\/casualty, D&O, all those pieces reflects a multiyear investment in something we called Aon Client Promise. This is really helping us bring more new clients into the fray and do more with the existing clients. And as proof points for that set of \u2013 that roll out \u2013 by that way, that's also across HR Solutions as well. Look at new business in Q1. It was a record in U.S. Retail. It was a record worldwide. By the way, that's a record on top of a record. It was the same in Q1 in 2015 with record levels of retention. So this is just 94% in U.S. Retail, for example, and EMEA. So these are just examples of sort of what's happening in the core business and what we're about.","And we would say, by the way, as an aside, the market overall as we look at it is a bit frankly more \u2013 a bit more stable when you think about pricing and insured values. But that's just one aspect of Aon.","Another aspect is our ability to grow outside the traditional core. And think about in this regard just a couple of examples here. We got two existing $1 billion revenue businesses we've invested in heavily. Affinity being one, $1 billion business growing exceptionally well. Health and Benefits, $1 billion business plus, also growing just proportionately well.","So you've got the traditional. You've got these things outside the core I just described. And then equally exciting for us is the ability to grow in new areas, where we've made substantial investment. And just a few examples of those would be like Aon Client Treaty, I highlighted the largest ever underwritten portfolio of risk for Lloyd's. Aon InPoint, 40 plus carriers on that platform now. And ReView.","And then finally I would just highlight what we just did in U.S. mortgage over the last couple of years has frankly brought insurance capital into the mortgage market. And in 2015 alone I think that's about $3.5 billion in net new premium, $5 billion since inception.","So the point being here, Sarah, this is such an important question. We believe we continue to prove the point that organic growth and margin improvement for us is not about insurance pricing or market impact. It's really about our ability to continue to invest and bring market \u2013 bringing into the market capabilities and real products that help our clients succeed. And frankly, that engine is under our control. It's working. And it's continuing to build. And a lot of the things we've invested in historically are just coming online.","And you saw it also in the momentum as we finished 2015. In 2015 we grew organically, had record margins in Risk, record margins in HR Solutions, record free cash flow, and record EPS. That momentum in 2015 carries us into 2016. And it really is that engine that's driving it. So does that answer your question around growth?","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes. That's great. Very thorough. And then secondly, there were recent new inversion rules, which propose essentially limiting the amount of inter-company debt. Could you just talk about what the implications for this could be for Aon and as well as your tax rate?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. So I think there were two primary sets of proposed regulation published by the U.S. Treasury. The first proposed regulation applies to inversion transactions, and therefore does not apply to us. We completed our redomicile over 4 years ago. It was signed off by the IRS in September 2013. And following our redomicile our capital structure looks like any other foreign based company in a territorial tax system.","The second proposed regulation applies to inter-company debt placed after April 4, 2016. Our inter-company debt was placed prior to April 4 and would also not apply to Aon's current global capital structure. The majority of our existing inter-company debt will come due on 2023 and after. Overall, we feel really comfortable with our current effective tax rate for the foreseeable future.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And I know it's a ways away but what would happen in 2023?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I mean the way we think about this, Sarah, is we have an overall capital structure. And we use inter-company debt as one part of that to help drive investments globally. But there are many other factors that influence that. As a U.K. company we operate in territorial tax system, which has different repatriation impacts than a worldwide tax system. We're growing in geographies with declining statutory tax rates, such as the U.K., where we're domiciled, where the tax rate is currently 20%. And it's going to decline over the coming years to 17%.","And so statutory tax rates are a really important part of the business decision for where we invest and build new products and services. And we also leverage net operating losses where possible to decide where we invest and grow businesses.","So I guess what I would say is, as we think about our business going forward, our overall global capital structure we feel is appropriate for our business. And therefore, we feel really comfortable with our current effective tax rate for the foreseeable future.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Dave Styblo of Jefferies. You may now ask your question.","David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for the questions. The follow-up on Sarah's, I certainly appreciate the macro comments and the new areas of growth. That's I'm sure attributing to the stronger growth in Retail I suspect with the 4% up there.","But I'm also wondering, more on the core side, and we've seen of couple of your peers post slower growth than that. And actually talk about some sluggishness in the EU. Of course the pricing pressures and so forth and just overall tempering of growth.","So I'm curious if you're just in areas or markets that are not seeing that? Or if you're perhaps gaining some share from peers? What's sort of your assessment more on the core part of the business?","Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer","We can step back, David, and essentially say, look \u2013 and I described three areas around \u2013 the traditional, sort of areas outside the traditional, and then areas related to some of the data and analytics efforts we've made around investments. And we're seeing growth in all three areas. Frankly, we saw growth.","And we're in all the countries. So we're in 120 countries around the world. It's the most comprehensive platform out there. And we saw growth in EMEA, in Germany, in France, in Italy. We \u2013 note the retention rates I described before and the new business generation.","So while they're \u2013 while the market conditions we think remain relatively stable \u2013 and again we would say on balance, when you think about pricing and insured values, put those two together and call those market impact. Often times you hear about pricing, you don't hear about market impact. Market impact has as much impact as pricing.","On balance we actually think 2016 looks than better than 2015 for our global footprint. But you saw growth across EMEA and the countries I just highlighted. You're seeing new business generation. This is in the core business, net new business generation in the U.S. and in EMEA that is literally record levels in Q1. And it was record on top of record. So the comps are extremely, extremely high. And record new retention rates that \u2013 approaching 94%, 95%.","So for us, look, we're going to keep investing around how we \u2013 in client leadership how we actually bring new clients in and how we serve them. And serve them more comprehensively. And that's the engine we have control over. And that's the engine that's working both in a traditional side, very much the traditional side, as well as the areas like Affinity and Health and Benefits, as well as the net new areas we're investing in beyond that.","David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Very good. If I can move over to the HR side, the Solutions side there, and just dig into a little bit more of the Outsourcing. That was a little bit more of a standout being particularly soft and it was sort of similar to a prior year.","But can you tell us more about the puts and takes there, the retention, the business activity? And then as it relates to sort of the margins in the segment and earnings, I know you said it was consistent with what you were looking for, but a little bit steeper than I guess what we had expected or I had at least expected from the outside. Does any part of \u2013 did you expect the repositioning costs and so forth to happen when you originally set guidance? Or is this something sort of new?","Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, I would start \u2013 let me just start a little bit of top line growth overall and then Christa can give a little background on some of the \u2013 on details around the margin opportunities here.","First, we would say our first quarter performance in Outsourcing is exactly consistent with what we left the year with in 2015. And our expectations for 2016 are exactly in line with what we had expected them to be. So there has really not been a change. There's a bit of noise in the quarter, which we could describe, but it's exactly the same.","By the way, if we just think about Outsourcing growth overall and go back to 2013, 2014, and 2015. 2013 is 1%; 2014 is 1%; 2015 is 4%; 2016, it's back to 1%. It's 4% in 2015 because we were very fortunate to support a very, very, very large client on a Retiree Exchange opportunity. And that actually skewed 2015. Absent that, the trajectory looks exactly the same.","And from a growth standpoint for the year, we feel very, very good about what we're able to do. In particular, some of the things we're doing with cloud based applications, which has just been exceptionally strong underlying growth and a stronger pipeline.","So top line growth, we feel very good about where we are, how we started the quarter, and no change in expectations for 2016.","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And then in terms of your question around did we expect the charges in reconstructing we took in this quarter. Absolutely. We've really been very focused on return on capital for a number of years now as you know. And we gave guidance in Q4 that we would grow revenue, operating income, and margin for the full year 2016 in HR Solutions. And we're absolutely going to do that.","And we also gave guidance that operating income would pattern similar to 2015 with operating income down in the first half, up in the second half, and up particularly in Q4. And really what you observe in Q1 is us continuing to improve return on capital as we manage our portfolio. And we did exit the Recruitment Process Outsourcing business. And you can see the gain of $0.10 in the other income line.","And then transaction and deal related costs in the HR operating income line of $0.06 or $20 million. And that really had a minus 220 basis point impact on margin in the quarter. Ex that, you can see that the HR Solutions margin in the quarter would have been 14%.","So you can see the underlying improvement in margin in our business as we continue to focus on return on capital and drive revenue, operating income, and margin growth for the full year 2016.","David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC","That's great. And then just one final one on the treasury to come back to the inter-company debt aspect in 2023. So it's my understanding that there's nothing wrong with having inter-company debt. It's just the matter in which it's being used to support the business. Is that something you guys, one, agree with?","And number two, is there any way to quantify how much debt you have and to give us a sense of is there any of that that might be at risk that might not be categorized the way it is as debt right now?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We would say that we're going to continue to invest in the U.S. And inter-company debt is the way in which it will be enabled. And so we will continue to use inter-company debt to help us invest and grow our U.S. business over the coming years. So absolutely we think it's a core part of the way we run our business.","And then we absolutely think about inter-company debt similar to third party debt. We manage it in terms of coverage and leverage ratios as you would expect. And we really have a global capital structure that looks like any other foreign based company in a territorial tax system.","So we think that our global capital structure is appropriate for our company. And we feel really comfortable with our current effective tax rate for the foreseeable future.","David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Quentin McMillan of KBW. You may now ask your question.","Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer","Quentin, you may be on mute.","Quentin McMillan - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Sorry about that. Thank you so much. Greg, you called out particular strength in the Health business in your prepared comments. And I just wanted to sort of drill into the Health and Benefit segment a little bit more specifically. I think you said it's sort of a $1 billion business now.","Can you give us a little bit more color on in terms of if that's growing at an organic clip sort of above or in line with what the rest of your brokerage segment is? Maybe what the profitability is? And sort of how you guys view it currently and going forward?","Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I would just literally \u2013 what I just was trying to highlight a little bit was just when you think about some of the investments we're making outside of some of the retail brokerage pieces, as Sarah was highlighting, that's one example. That just happens to be Health and Benefits.","What we're very excited about, Quentin, is the overall Health category. And this is a category we've been investing in substantially for a number of years. And you're seeing that literally on the Health and Benefits side, which is a $1 billion plus business, growing exceptionally well.","But you also see it on what we're doing on the exchange side, a whole range of health solutions. We administer benefits for 22 million plus Americans, 11 million of which is really on the Health side. And for us we see this category as one of the primary areas of investment for Aon over time. And it's been exceptionally positive really across the board.","Quentin McMillan - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Great. Thank you so much. And then secondly, Christa, if I could just ask a question in terms of the share repurchase. Obviously you guys have been very clear that you believe share repurchase is the best and highest return use of capital.","But is there a way for us to sort of get a better understanding in terms of how you look at the return metrics on share repo versus M&A versus investment in the business? Maybe just what's most important to you? And if you can give us any kind of color or clarity in terms of what the level of return might be in one versus the other?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So we have been very clear that we manage this in terms of return on capital. The way we measure the return on capital is on a cash-on-cash metric. And as we think about sort of share repurchase and the return that that generates, we have a discounted cash flow view of Aon over time. And it is a very conservative view of the company, because we've beaten our own cash flow forecast in each of the last 5 years. So this kind of cash flow really is the value highlighted by the $2.4 billion in free cash flow we'll generate in 2017. And then future growth in cash from there onwards.","And we do absolutely trade off investment in share repurchase, M&A, organic investment, pension, et cetera. And so that's how we think about it. And in terms of Q1 we did take advantage of a lower share price in the quarter to do the largest amount of share repurchase we've done, $750 million, since 2008.","Quentin McMillan - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Great. And I just \u2013 one of the parts that I wanted to sort of touch upon in that \u2013 and I apologize for not asking it more clearly \u2013 is just the divestiture you had in the business as well. Sort of the overall return you have. That you mentioned improved the return on invested capital. Is there sort of other businesses that might be dragging that down? And are you sort of looking to optimize the entire portfolio that way? Or are \u2013 do you feel good about where everything sits currently?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I mean you should think over the coming years that we're going to continue to manage our business on a return on capital basis. We'll continue to invest in the highest return on capital areas. We'll continue to divest or invest less in the lowest return areas.","So we're going to continue to manage this portfolio over time. And I wouldn't note that it \u2013 I'd note that it's happening across the firm. We had a small divestiture in our Retail Brokerage business in the first quarter too. And so you should just think about us continuing to manage the portfolio and to continue the drive return on invested capital across the entire business.","Quentin McMillan - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Perfect. Thanks so much for the time.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Kai Pan of Morgan Stanley. You may now ask your question.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning. Thank you so much. It's just a follow-up of Quentin's question, buybacks. So it looks like $750 million, a very strong number especially for seasonally weak in the first quarter. I just wonder, does it alter the pace of your buybacks throughout the year?","And also could \u2013 if could you talk a little bit more about the source of funding for buybacks? Because \u2013 in related to last 2 year, pretty strong, like $2.3 billion in 2014 and $1.6 billion in 2015.","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So, Kai, if we think about buyback, we've absolutely described it as the highest return on capital use of cash we have today. And therefore, as you think about the sources of cash that can contribute to buyback, it's really about the strong free cash flow growth we're generating from the business each year.","And then as we think about leverage, we really think about our current investment grade rating as incredibly important to us and staying within our existing debt-to-EBITDA ratio. But as EBITDA and free cash flow grows, it really creates an opportunity for us to add additional leverage. And so there are the two sources, free cash flow from operations plus additional leverage as our cash flow and EBITDA grows over time.","And as we think about the balance of the year, we're not really giving specific guidance, Kai. But really what I would say is, as you think about the cash we generate over any year, we're going to manage the investment of that cash based on return on capital.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Then just follow up at the leverage. If the 2.7 [times] level is the optimum level you want to maintain? Or there you want to work it down? Or you can even lever up from the current levels?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So as we think about our current investment grade rating, Kai, what we would say is it's really 3 times to 3.5 times on a Moody's basis, which is really how we manage it internally. And if you translate that to a GAAP debt-to-EBITDA basis, it's 2 times to 2.5 times. So it's slightly above the range that we would like to be in an optimal basis.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Okay. That's great. And then for Greg is, could you comment broadly about the recent market dislocation as well? Your commentary about the rising tension between brokers as well as the carriers.","Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. From our standpoint as we think about where we are in the market, we're not seeing anything unusual about what's gone on over time frankly. We've got a set of market partners who we \u2013 who are incredibly important to us, because they're important to our clients. And our focus every day is really maniacally around how we bring solutions to clients to help drive their business. And candidly, the market partners are central to that. Absolutely critical.","So we find ourselves actually working more and more with market partners in ways to sort of come up with new and innovative solutions. And it's really been great.","I mean one of the things we just spent time talking about, something we call Carrier Link, which is actually enabling us to bring our global capability or global demand to carriers around the world. Carrier Link for example for Lloyd's but for other carriers as well to actually make it more electronic, to actually make it more efficient.","So for us we see our market partners as extremely central. And just want to continue to reinforce and foster those relationships on behalf of our clients.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That's great. If I may last one is that is there any better way for us to model the other income line?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I mean I would say it is inherently on an underlying basis flat. I think it has been very lumpy, based on sort of the return on capital moves we've been making around some portfolio repositioning. But we ourselves, when we budget internally, budget it at $0.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you so much for all the answers.","Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Vinay Misquith of Sterne Agee CRT. You may now ask your question.","Vinay Misquith - Sterne Agee CRT","Hi. Good morning. So, the first question is on the Consulting segment. Christa, you mentioned that the margins were 14%. So just wanted to reconfirm that that's the right base for the future. Is the 14% margin the right base? And also surprised that margins increased about 80 basis points, when organic growth 22%. So can you help me on that please?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. So if you exclude the one-time charges of $20 million in Q1, then 14% Q1 HR Solutions margin is the right underlying margin for the business. That is absolutely right.","And then what I would say is we've been investing a lot in that business. We've been investing in our delegated investments business, which is growing fantastically. We've now got $85 billion in assets under management. We've been investing a lot in our BPO SaaS business, which is growing fantastically. We're winning substantial deals. And the pipeline there is fantastic. And we're investing a lot in our Talent business. We just bought a business called Modern Survey during the first quarter, and it's fantastic.","So we're feeling really good about the investments we've made in this business. And really what you're observing is the return on those investments.","Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer","One of the \u2013 look, of I'd add today as well. As you think about these investments drive top line, as Christa has just described. But they also in many respects \u2013 not all \u2013 but in many respects inject a level of operating leverage into the business that's actually quite powerful.","So we're growing top line. But we're also able to improve margin at lesser levels of growth, if you see where I'm coming from. And by the way, you see that in Risk Solutions and you see that in HR Solutions both. So these investments we've been making over time that are beginning to \u2013 you're beginning to see show up have both pieces in the context of that. So it really is an investment at scale, if you will, in terms of sort of making a difference across Aon.","Vinay Misquith - Sterne Agee CRT","That's very helpful. And the sale of the piece of the business in that segment had a 7% I guess negative impact on the top line this quarter. Should we expect a similar level for the next few quarters? And part of the guidance I believe was that you would grow your total revenue. So is it the growth even after the sale of the segment?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We will continue to grow even after the sale of the segment, yes. And one of the things that I would observe that you saw in Q1 2016 as Greg described is we had an unusually strong comparable in Q1 2015 with the enrollments and the Retiree Exchange of one of our largest clients.","But I think what you're seeing in the column \u2013 I guess it's page 11 of the earnings release \u2013 that minus 7%, is really two things going on. It's the exit of the business in Q1 2015, where we exited a business in our payroll segment. And then the business that we also exited in Q4 2015. So there's a number of different components going into this. So it isn't one business.","Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer","But you will see us over time, Vinay, grow this business organically as we described before. And this will strengthen our ability. We believe this will strengthen our ability to grow organically. And you will see that play out over the coming quarters.","Vinay Misquith - Sterne Agee CRT","Sure. Fair enough. And just one follow-up on the capital management. Sorry to beat this to death, but the way that I understand that is that just the free cash flow minus the amount you spend on dividends and M&A. So what number are you looking at in terms of M&A for this year already?","And also the debt increase, my estimate is that you're going to be up by around $250 million net debt this year. Just wondering if that number makes sense.","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So we're not going to give specific guidance around M&A in any particular year. Because the way we run the process is really around managing return on capital every week and every month to optimize our investments organically, investments in M&A, investments in share repurchase, et cetera. And so we actually \u2013 while we intend to spend certain amounts on M&A in a year, it's going to end up being a different number than \u2013 depending on what the actual opportunities and the returns on those opportunities are.","And then in terms of your debt question, it's really around, as you think about that ratio, 2 times to 2.5 times debt to EBITDA on a GAAP basis, that's really how we think about managing the company. And so that's the right leverage level for us going forward.","Vinay Misquith - Sterne Agee CRT","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith of UBS. You may now ask your question.","Brian Robert Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Yes. Thank you. Just a quick one. Greg, can you talk about potential implications of Brexit for you guys?","Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer","Operator, you just broke \u2013 oh. Yeah. Sorry about that. Got it.","Brexit. Listen, step back overall. It's obviously a topic of conversation now daily with clients around the world. Obviously as you get into Europe and the U.K., more frequently than that. As we think about \u2013 and we really think about this, Brian, first and foremost for our clients. And we see there's lots of ways it could \u2013 that if it ends up happening that it could impact them and their operations of their businesses over time. And that's really what we're most vigilant on.","For Aon we actually feel very comfortable. We'll help them manage through it if they have to endure that. And if not, we feel comfortable with that as well. So there's not as much impact on Aon overall.","But from our standpoint feel that there is a set of opportunities here that come out of disruption, if that's the case, and there's a set of items we're going to help our clients to address it. But for us it really \u2013 that's how we'd shape it out.","Brian Robert Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Great.","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And, Brian, the other thing we'd say is any time there's a regulatory change, it means you've got to help clients through that. And so helping clients navigate business interruption insurance, when you've got to separate out the U.K. from Continental Europe, or pension plans, which across EMEA and you've got to separate them out. There's a lot of activity that would be generated for us.","And the other thing I would say is we have substantial business in the U.K., where we have the U.S. dollar revenue and a pound expense base. And so to the extent that the pound becomes weaker because of this, it actually benefits us.","Brian Robert Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. That's helpful. And then last question. I wonder if you could give us a little bit of a look at what's the pipeline look right now for the Corporate Exchange business.","Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer","We actually feel really good about the continuation of this, Brian, as I said before. First of all, for us, first and foremost, it's really the Health category. Absolutely really like the position we're in and how that's continuing to grow. And on the exchange side our clients continue to experience very, very good results. A large percentage of our clients actually had rate decreases in the last cycle overall. Satisfaction continues to be very high. And the pipeline is very, very strong.","We know it takes time for these things to evolve. And you're seeing that play out on the Health Exchange side. But it really is part of an overall Health Solution, which is actually quite, quite strong.","Brian Robert Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks for the answers.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Charles Sebaski of BMO Capital Markets. You may now ask your question.","Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning. Thank you.","Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Charles.","Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Just curious, Greg, about growth in the Risk business. And not for this quarter per se, but I guess over the next couple of years. Obviously you guys don't give \u2013 expect to give guidance on M&A. And you haven't done much in this space over the last few years, as you had really strong cash flow growth.","But if looking forward over the next couple of years, does that math change? The margins on that business have increased incredibly well. A lot of the restructuring and whatnot has been taken out. And you guys have one of the best toolboxes in the industry. Wondering \u2013 I guess I just sort of think that the growth in that business should even be better. While 4% organic is really good in this market, I guess I at some level think that the total line of that business would be even more than that and maybe should be over the next few years.","Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer","Listen, we agree in terms of sort of overall opportunity. If you step back and think about the journey that Aon has been on as we've shaped and built our firm, we would say this is an unfinished business for us. This is \u2013 while we've made great progress, and it's really a credit to my Aon colleagues around the world, the progress they've made over the last number of years, the platform we have and given the current state of the \u2013 state of where our clients are with unprecedented risk spacing, traditional and non-traditional. Think about global warming, pandemic, cyber, terrorism, all the different pieces. The challenges on Health, which are unprecedented literally in the U.S. and around the world, the challenges on retirement.","These set of issues for us represent what we believe is an incredible set of demands for clients, needs for clients. And our platforms are actually very, very well positioned against these mega, really global needs from a client standpoint.","And as I said at the beginning to Sarah's question, the ways we're helping clients are traditional brokerage, all the different pieces around that. There are areas that are outside that, as we continue to evolve and develop. By the way, that's in HR Solutions and in Risk Solutions. And then in areas like data and analytics, which frankly are opening up an entire new vista for us that we've invested in. This is not flavor of the month for us. This has been a 7-year set of investments in which we're investing $300 million, $400 million, $500 million over time around on data and analytics and insight.","So for us we see this as a tremendous opportunity. And it's not just top line. It really is around operating performance improvement, which is why again we look at 2016, 2017, 2018 as just a continuation. This is not new news. A continuation of building Aon, strengthening Aon on behalf of clients. And the record shows we're making progress against that with more opportunity to come.","Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","I guess what I was trying to get to is even towards your goals, right, if you look at the long term operating margin in Risk, you're kind of already half the way there, if I look back to when you laid out your cash flow doubling plan in 2012. And as you encroach on that, if I think of 2016 or 2017 cash flow doubling, I guess does the math conceptually change where M&A might become more attractive than share buyback? Because the rapidness of improvement of the core business has been \u2013 so much has already been done.","Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Well, listen. Again remember back to what Christa described in terms of our overall framework. We have a pretty maniacal framework around return on invested capital. And what I would highlight for you is, while we've done a lot of buyback in the last 10 years, we've also done $7 billion, $8 billion worth of M&A. So we've done a tremendous amount of M&A. We've done a tremendous amount of buyback. And over a 10-year period, we've improved operating income 10% per year over that period of time and grown EPS about 16% per year over that period of time.","And so we're going to keep looking at these tradeoffs. And we \u2013 as we make our cash flow goal in 2017 of $2.4 billion and continue to build on it, as Christa described, our capacity to invest back in the business organically, M&A, buyback, we have all these at our disposal as we build the firm. And that's why candidly we're very \u2013 we're excited about where we are on the journey and what the possibilities are going forward. And we see more possibilities going forward than we do historically in terms of what the opportunities are going to look like.","Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","I appreciate the answers. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you very much. And our last question comes from the line of Josh Shanker of Deutsche Bank. You may now ask your question.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you for taking my question. Obviously Sarah had some interesting questions regarding the inter-company debt and the 2023 date. When I look at your balance sheet by I guess company segment, it seems to be that half the debt of the $19 billion facility seems to be in current liabilities and half of it seems to be in long term liabilities. How does that work? And in terms of what you're reading of the new proposals are, will those current liabilities be able to be rolled over for another year?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. But, Josh, as you look at our balance sheet, you can see that we have a normal intercompany trade receivables and payables, as all companies do who operate in more than one country. And it's split into short term and long term. And so that is a normal part of doing business.","And as we said earlier to this question, we feel really comfortable with our current effective tax rate for the foreseeable future. Because as we think about the new proposed regulations, we're going to continue to invest in the U.S. via inter-company debt, because inter-company debt is permissible under the new proposed regulations.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Well, and will that \u2013 I guess that $9 billion of current liability debt inter-company be able to be rolled over for another year?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Ryan (sic) [Josh], there's a bunch of normal \u2013 it's not inter-company debt. That is normal trade receivables and payables.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Inter-company \u2013 I guess \u2013 so when I look at it, it's hard to say. I actually see the \u2013 those $19 billion, I guess it looks like debt. If it's not really debt, how does that work exactly?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So we have normal trade receivables and payables, as you would expect in any global company. And so the majority of that is not inter-company debt.","Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer","I think the punch line, by the way, if you step back and think about sort of the trades, because we've gotten a few questions here on the balance sheet with more interest than we've ever had before. If you step back and think about the tax rate that I think you're getting back to. And Christa's point that literally we feel very comfortable with where it is.","By the way, we feel very comfortable with where it is and for the foreseeable future. That's past 2021, 2022, 2023, so past that time period. So you take all the debt pieces off the table completely and ask, how comfortable are we with our current tax rate? We feel very comfortable with it.","It will evolve over time back and forth. But we feel very comfortable. And nothing that's happened the last 6 months or the last 6 weeks has changed that point of view in the least bit. So just \u2013 I think that's the governing thoughts. And so you might want to take away from where we are.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Well, I think that's very reasonable. Thanks, Greg.","Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","Thank you very much. I would now like to the turn call back over to Greg Case for closing remarks.","Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer","I just wanted to say thanks, everybody, for joining today. We really appreciate it. And I appreciate your interest in Aon and look forward to the next call. Thanks very much.","Operator","And that concludes today's conference. Thank you all for participating.

Welcome to the Aon Plc Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all parties are in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer portion of today's call. If anyone has an objection, you may disconnect your line at this time.","I would also like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded and that it is important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our third quarter 2015 results as well as having been posted on our website.","Now, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, President and CEO of Aon Plc.","Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter 2015 conference call. Joining me here today is our CFO, Christa Davies. I would note that there are slides available on our website for you to follow along with our commentary today. Consistent with previous quarters, I'd like to cover two areas before turning the call over to Christa for further financial review. First is our performance against key metrics we communicate to shareholders, and second is overall organic growth performance including continued areas of strategic investment across Aon.","On the first topic, our performance versus key metrics. Each quarter, we measure our performance against the key metrics we focus on achieving over the course of the year: grow organically, expand margins, increase earnings per share and deliver free cash flow growth.","Turning to slide 3. In the third quarter, organic revenue growth was 2% overall with growth across both segments, highlighted by 5% growth in the HR Outsourcing business and 4% growth in the Americas Retail Brokerage business. Operating margin increased 30 basis points, reflecting solid operating performance in both segments.","EPS decreased 4% to $1.24 as unfavorable foreign currency translation and a gain on the sale of a business in the prior year more than offset organic growth, operational improvement and effective capital management. And finally, free cash flow for the nine months is up 21% to $850 million, a strong performance driven by operational improvement and working capital management.","Turning to slide 4, on the second topic of growth and investment. I'm going to spend the next few minutes discussing the quarter for both of our segments. In Risk Solutions, organic revenue growth was 1% overall in our seasonally weakest quarter, similar to the prior year, reflecting growth across Retail Brokerage partially offset by decline in Reinsurance. For the nine months, organic revenue growth is 2%, in line with our expectation of low to mid-single-digit growth going into our seasonally strongest quarter.","As we've discussed previously, we're driving a set of initiatives and making strategic investments that are strengthening the underlying performance and position our Risk Solutions segment for long-term growth and improved operating leverage with: management of our renewal book through Aon Client Promise and retention rates of more than 90% on average across Retail Brokerage, new business generation of $240 million across our Retail business with record new business in U.S. Retail, 18 consecutive quarters of positive net new business in core treaty reinsurance, increased operating leverage from our investments in innovative technology and data and analytics including in the Global Risk Insight Platform which now captures over $2.9 million trades and $139 billion of bound premium with more than 40 carriers utilizing the platform today.","ReView, our reinsurer dashboard, combined with strategic consulting, helped reinsurers be more effective markets for ceding company clients. And our Aon Broking initiative to better match client need with insurer appetite for risk and to identify structured portfolio solutions.","And finally, we're expanding our content and global footprint through tuck-in acquisitions that increase scale in emerging markets or expand capability.","Reflecting on the individual businesses within Risk Solutions. In the Americas, organic revenue growth was 4% compared to 2% in the prior year quarter. Exposures continue to be positive across the region while the impact from pricing was modestly negative, resulting in continued stable market impact overall.","We saw growth across all regions. U.S. Retail, Latin America and Canada including growth across all businesses, property casualty, health and benefits, and affinity. In U.S. Retail and Canada, growth was driven by strong new business generation while strong management of the renewal book drove growth in Latin America.","In International, organic revenue growth was 1%. Exposures continue to be stable and the impact from pricing was modestly negative on average, driven by fragile market conditions in many countries across Europe and continued pressure in the Pacific region.","We saw strong growth in New Zealand, driven by double-digit new business generation. Results also reflect solid growth across Asia, primarily in emerging markets, China and Thailand, driven by strong management of the renewal book portfolio.","In Continental Europe, we continue to see modest growth and with strong leadership across the region we are well-positioned to benefit from potential improvements in the macroeconomic environment.","In Reinsurance, organic revenue declined 4% similar to the prior year quarter, and for the nine months was minus 2%, roughly in-line with our expectation of a modest decline for the year. Results in the quarter primarily reflect significant unfavorable market globally, a modest decline in facultative placements, and modest unfavorable impact from timing.","In our treaty portfolio, we saw a record level of new business generation in the quarter, driven by an increase in ceding demand and growth in new products, primarily such as U.S. Mortgage and ReView. And while excess capital continues to place pressure on the market, the rate of price decline continues to moderate. Against that price pressure, clients are buying more and capital is being deployed to new markets. New opportunities for growth combined with industry-leading data and analytics is positioning the business for a return to growth on a quarterly basis in the next 12 months.","Overall, across Risk Solutions, we continue to deliver new business generation and strong retention, driven by a unified approach to serving clients across the portfolio and industry-leading data and analytics. We expect improved performance in the fourth quarter, placing us firmly on track for solid organic revenue growth for the full year 2015 despite continued pricing pressure in Reinsurance and fragile economic conditions in Continental Europe.","Turning to HR Solutions. Organic revenue growth was 5%, with solid growth across both major businesses and in high demand areas where we have invested in innovative solutions in client-serving capability. These reflect investments from Aon in client leadership and our in-depth understand and influence on overall market trends, including as clients manage risk against pension schemes that are frozen, largely underfunded and facing regulatory changes. Solutions to derisk pension plans and support for delegated investment solutions are a strong area of growth where assets under management have grown from $10 billion to roughly $70 billion in five years.","Continued investment to strengthen our industry-leading portfolio of health solutions covering the full range of benefit strategies, client size and funding choices. Across Aon's suite of private health exchanges, we expect to enroll roughly 1.4 million lives across 150 clients, compared to roughly 1.2 million lives across 100 clients in the prior year, broken down into active exchange with 1 million enrolled lives across 55 clients, and retiree exchange with 400,000 enrolled lives across 75 clients. The growth reflects continued progress to achieve scale and drive new revenue as roughly two-thirds of all clients who have joined the exchange are new to Aon.","Our growth reflects both self and fully-insured solutions, including the industry's leading large corporate, fully-insured multi-carrier model. Our range of solutions provide clients with a unique ability to seamlessly transition between funding choices depending on their level of risk tolerance. In addition, representation now spans 22 distinct industries.","We look forward to providing further details after we complete the enrollment in the fourth quarter, with potential further updates on client wins as we're already in very active discussions for 2016 off-cycle and 2017 enrollment.","We would also highlight our investment in Software-as-a-Service model and our HR BPO business where growth in new clients and conversion of existing clients is driving strong demand as well as the expansion of our capabilities to include financial limitations. And finally, we're investing in our talent rewards business as we're seeing strong demand for data and analytics that support increasing organizational change.","Turning to our individual businesses within HR Solutions. In Consulting Services, organic revenue growth was 3%. The prior year quarter included a significant favorable benefit from timing due to a change in revenue recognition policy in our compensation consulting business. Results in the quarter reflect continued growth in retirement consulting, primarily driven by demand for delegated investment consulting services.","We also saw continued growth in consultation consulting driven by demand for survey work as companies require benchmarking and assistance with plan design to address retention and ways to compete for talent more effectively.","In Outsourcing, organic revenue growth was 5% compared to 3% in the prior year quarter. Results reflect solid growth in benefits administration driven by an increase in project-related work and growth in our absence management business. We also saw continued growth in HR BPO, driven by new client wins and cloud-based solutions and growth in our healthcare exchange business from off-cycle enrollments on the retiree exchange.","Overall for HR Solutions, we are well positioned to deliver continued organic revenue growth across both segments for the fourth quarter and full year 2015, driven by high demand areas where we've made investments as well as continued leadership across our core businesses.","In summary, despite short-term headwinds, we continue to drive growth across both segments, improve our operational performance and deliver significant free cash flow growth. Looking forward, we expect a strong finish to the year and continued long-term growth driven by our industry-leading platform of client-serving capabilities and investments in data and analytics.","With that said, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Christa for further financial review. Christa?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you so much, Greg. And good morning, everyone. As Greg noted, our third quarter is our seasonally weakest quarter and we continued to face both macroeconomic and specific industry headwinds. However, against these headwinds, the strength of our industry-leading franchise continues to perform. Our results in the quarter reflect organic growth and operating margin improvement across both Risk and HR Solutions, substantial free cash flow growth and effective capital management, highlighted by the repurchase of $600 million of ordinary shares in the quarter.","Now, let me turn to financial results for the quarter on page 6 of the presentation. Our core EPS performance, excluding certain items, decreased 4% to $1.24 per share for the third quarter compared to $1.29 in the prior year quarter. The prior year quarter included a $25 million pre-tax or $0.07 per share after-tax gain related to the sale of a business. Certain items that were adjusted for in the core EPS performance and highlighted in the schedules on page 12 of the press release include non-cash intangible asset amortization. Further, included in the results was a $0.09 per share unfavorable impact related to foreign currency translation due to the U.S. dollar strengthening against most major currencies.","Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, our core earnings per share in the third quarter would have been $1.33, up 3% from the prior year quarter. Going forward, while currency movement has been challenging to predict, if currency were to remain stable at today's rates, we would expect a similar impact in Q4 as we incurred in Q3 due to continued U.S. dollar strengthening.","As we look forward to 2016, we would anticipate substantially less of a headwind as year-over-year comparisons become easier with an unfavorable impact of roughly $0.05 to $0.10 per share for the full year 2016 compared to approximately $0.41 of impact for the full year 2015. I would note this assumes FX rates remain stable at today's rates.","Now, let me talk about each of the segments on the next slide. In our Risk Solutions segment, organic revenue growth was 1%. Operating margin increased 50 basis points to 20.8%, and operating income decreased 6% compared to the prior year quarter. Operating income included a $25 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation.","Excluding this impact, operating income increased 1% versus the prior year quarter. Operating margin improvement of 50 basis points reflects the 40 basis points favorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign currency, underlying operating margin improved 10 basis points in the quarter, driven by continued operational improvement in our seasonally weakest quarter.","Overall, in Q3, we delivered underlying operational performance in Risk Solutions despite continued headwinds from an unfavorable market impact in Reinsurance, fragile market conditions in Europe and historically low interest rates.","If short-term interest rates were to rise, we believe we have significant leverage for an improving interest rate environment, as every 100 basis point rise in global interest rates should result in approximately $45 million of investment income.","For the first nine months, excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, operating income increased 4% and operating improved 50 basis points. As we approach our seasonally strongest quarter in Risk Solutions, performance places us firmly on track for further margin expansion in 2015 towards our long-term target of 26%, driven by growth, return on investments, and expense discipline as we optimize our global cost structure in areas such as IT, real estate and global procurement.","Turning to the HR Solutions segment, organic revenue growth was 5%, operating margin increased 90 basis points and operating income increased 6%. Results reflect solid organic revenue growth, expense discipline and improved profitability in the areas where we've been investing for long-term growth including: delegated investment consulting, cloud-based solutions in HR BPO, and healthcare exchanges where we believe we have achieved enough scale to deliver modest profitability in 2015.","For the first nine months, excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, operating income increased 6% and operating margin improved 30 basis points. As we approach our seasonally strongest quarter in HR Solutions, performances places us firmly on track for further margin expansion in 2015 towards our long-term target of 22%, driven by growth, return on investments and expense discipline.","Now, let me discuss a few of the line items outside of the operating segments on slide 9. Unallocated expenses were $45 million, in line with quarterly guidance. Interest income was $3 million, similar to the prior year quarter. Interest expense increased $7 million to $72 million due to an overlap of expiring debt in the quarter. Other income of $8 million primarily includes net gains from certain long-term investments, while the prior year quarter benefited from the sale of certain businesses and net gains in certain long-term investments.","Going forward, we expect a run rate of approximately $45 million per quarter of unallocated expense and $2 million per quarter of interest income. Interest expense in the fourth quarter is expected to be approximately $68 million as $600 million of overlapping notes were paid in September.","Turning to taxes. The adjusted effective tax rate on net income from continuing operations, excluding the applicable tax impact associated with expenses related to legacy litigation in Q2, decreased to 16% compared to the prior year quarter at 19.1% due to the favorable impact of certain discrete tax adjustments. Our underlying operating tax rate remains at 19%.","Lastly, average diluted shares outstanding decreased to 283.8 million in the third quarter compared to 296.1 million in the prior year quarter. The company repurchased 6.3 million Class A ordinary shares for approximately $600 million in the third quarter. The company has $4.5 billion of remaining authorization under its share repurchase program. Actual shares outstanding on September 30 were 273.9 million and there are approximately 7 million additional dilutive equivalents. Estimated Q4 2015 beginning dilutive share count is approximately 281 million, subject to share price movement, share issuance and share repurchase.","Now, let me turn to the next slide to highlight our solid balance sheet and strong cash flow on slide 10. At September 30, cash and short-term investments were $783 million. Total debt outstanding increased to approximately $6.1 billion and total debt to EBITDA on a GAAP basis increased to 2.6 times.","Cash flow from operations for the first nine months increased 22%, or $192 million, to $1.1 billion driven by working capital improvements, a decline in pension contributions, restructuring and cash paid for taxes, partially offset by a significant increase in cash paid to settle legacy litigation flowing through net income in the second quarter.","The increase in cash paid of $137 million to settle legacy litigation in the previous quarter will provide a tailwind to free cash flow growth in 2016. Free cash flow, as defined by cash flow from operations less CapEx, increased 21% or $146 million to $850 million, reflecting strong growth in cash flow from operations partially offset by a $46 million increase in CapEx. The anticipated increase in CapEx in 2015 is associated with investment in certain real estate projects as we continue to optimize our real estate portfolio globally.","Turning to the next slide to discuss our significant financial flexibility and the opportunity to further increase cash flow generation. We value the firm based on free cash flow and allocate capital to maximize free cash flow returns. There are four primary areas that are expected to contribute to our goal of delivering $2.3 billion or more for the full year 2017.","Free cash flow of $2.3 billion is not our end goal, as further long term sustainable free cash flow will be driven by continued operating income growth and additional working capital initiatives beyond 2017. We continue to believe the plans we put in place have positioned the firm to benefit from abnormal growth in free cash flow and free cash flow per share in the near term, providing significant opportunity for shareholder value creation.","From the graph in the presentation, based on current assumptions, we expect annual free cash flow to increase by approximately $230 million from the year-end 2014 to year-end 2017 based only on a reduction in cash use of pensions, restructuring, and CapEx. Combined with operational improvement in the business, lower cash tax payments and working capital improvements in areas such as accounts receivable and accounts payable, we have line of sight to delivering on our expectations for substantial free cash flow generation.","Regarding our pension plans, we've taken significant steps to reduce volatility and liability as we've closed plans to new entrants and frozen plans from accruing additional benefits and continue to derisk certain plan assets. We currently expect contributions to decline by roughly $96 million to $220 million in 2015 and continue to decline thereafter. These expectations are based on 12\/31\/2014 actuarial assumption. A rise in global long term interest rates could potentially decrease contributions further.","Regarding our restructuring program, cash payments were $82 million in 2014. As all charges related to the restructuring program have now been incurred, we would expect cash payments to decline by $51 million to approximately $31 million in 2015 and continue to decline significantly each year thereafter.","In summary, we delivered organic growth and margin expansion across both segments as we continue to manage expense and create greater operating leverage from our investments in data and analytics. Strong operating performance in the fourth quarter combined with declining uses of cash and working capital improvements are expected to deliver double-digit free cash flow growth for 2015, placing us firmly on track towards our goal of generating more than $2.3 billion of free cash flow for the full year 2017.","With a strong balance sheet and significant financial flexibility, we've positioned the firm for significant shareholder value creation in 2015 and beyond. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question will be coming from Dave Styblo with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer","Dave, you might be on mute. Go to the next one, operator.","Operator","Dave Styblo of Jefferies. Your line is open.","David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC","Can you guys hear me at this point?","Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. We can.","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. We can.","David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Great. So, first of all, I was just saying thanks for taking the questions but you missed that part. But wanted to talk a little bit about the Americas business, the Retail side there held up well at plus 4% and I guess I was surprised it did so well considering it includes Latin America where you've got economies like Brazil which are now experiencing a GDP decline. So, can you help me understand, is the outperformance or the strong performance there in Latin America continuing or are we doing just that much better in the other parts of Canada and the U.S. to offset some of the pressure that might be going on in Latin America?","Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer","Actually Dave, we have solid growth across the board and it comes in different categories in different places but if you think about how we think about growth, it's new business and then retention, something we call rollover, overall. And we've been able to generate substantial new business growth which is new clients coming into the firm as well as doing more with existing clients, which is retaining, and then rollover, which is actually doing more with them.","And then in businesses like our affinity business which has been exceptionally strong, we're also seeing substantial growth. And we really have on the U.S. side record new business generation. So a lot of the investments we've made over time continue to reap benefits and you're seeing the results. Would emphasize again, though, look at it on an annual basis. Quarter-to-quarter always moves around to different places but it's a very very positive piece overall.","David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And on HR Solutions, the margins up 90 basis points there year-over-year in light of what I think \u2013 I think you guys had a tough comp last year where you had some favorable timing that lifted revenue and margins. Was there any sort of timing in this quarter? Obviously you guys talked about two of the three factors that did help this quarter and if you could elaborate, to what extent are those sustainable versus sort of project-oriented and maybe one-time in nature?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. We feel really good about the performance of HR Solutions, not just in Q3 but really in the nine months year to date. We've had operating income growth of 6% excluding FX in the nine months year to date and margin expansion of 30 basis points and we would say they are well on track to solid revenue growth, margin expansion, and operating income growth for the full year. And that's really coming from the return on the investments we've made. We're getting continued revenue growth and margin expansion from the significant investments we made in delegated investment consulting and health care exchanges and in HR BPO SaaS.","David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Great. And then just lastly on the exchanges, it sounds like the $1.4 million, is that a estimate for January or sort of year-end 2016? And I guess that implies something along the lines of 15% or 20% membership growth which is maybe a little bit lower than peers. Curious to hear sort of what you're seeing in the market, is there some clients who maybe have deferred or what is sort of your thoughts on the adoption and pace of adoption relative to your expectations?","Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I'd say step back overall. First of all, the number we report,1.4 million, is enrolled lives. So, these are actually folks who are paying us and money is changing hands for solutions we provide. And there's a lot going on around definitions and how different folks describe the business overall. We are very explicit about how we describe it around enrolled lives.","I would say, Dave, overall, we agree the adoption across the board, when you think about it, especially at the larger end of the market, has not been as fast as we would have expected. This is especially true given the results we've seen with our existing exchange clients. I mean, we have been able to sustainably lower cost, reduced volatility and, very importantly, the employee choice has gone up, and there's very, very high satisfaction.","Our view is we're very confident that, over time, you're going to see the market develop. It's going to accelerate. It's going to be an uneven pace, no doubt. But our pipeline is strong. We're in discussions with a number of very large innovative companies around solutions and ideas, and so we feel very, very good about the development. I would highlight, we've gone from zero to 1.4 million lives as \u2013 and Christa described, we're marginally profitable in 2015. So, we've made progress, and we're seeing continued development on that platform.","But last point I'd make on this, it is important to put this in context over overall health effort. I mean, we love the health space. We believe in it, we believe we're going to make a difference globally on behalf of our clients. And from classic health, health and benefits, global benefits, I'd just remind you, we place more than $10 million in health benefits in the U.S. alone every year and the exchanges have been very, very strong, zero to 1.4 million. By the way, as I said in my opening comments, two-thirds of the clients who've come in in the exchanges are new to Aon and 150 clients overall. And so we see this as very, very positive continued development. And overall, in the context of the health opportunities, we see it as quite strong.","David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC","Okay. That's helpful. So just the paying numbers, sort of what you'd get in January, is what that 1.4 million is then, right?","Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer","Correct.","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes.","David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer","Lot that's going on mid cycle. Lot that's going on in terms of overall (28:12), but that's literally clinically as of today.","David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC","Got it. Thanks.","Operator","Next, we have Adam Klauber of William Blair. Your line is open.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning. So just one follow-up on the active exchange. So for those large clients, what are the one or two factors that's holding them back from pulling the trigger right now?","Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer","I think, Adam, actually it's a range of different pieces. And it really \u2013 they don't look at it as this year or next year. They're really looking at what's the best interest over time of their employee base and how that's developing. They're also looking at sort of the trend line in the marketplace and what's happening with overall health costs and level of urgency. And so for them, it really is a range of different items. We would come back to \u2013 for the clients who we brought into this environment, the impact has been substantial and now sustained over a multi-year period. And more and more companies are seeing that and actually taking some comfort in some of the sustainability of the overall model.","But as I said before, the pipeline is strong and this is going to develop. If you think back, the lessons around DB to DC and the overall solutions, these things take a period of time. But what we keep coming back to is the fundamental value proposition is quite strong and now sustained and we think that's going to carry the day over time. But still keep coming back to, though, it's about an overall health platform and a level of demand across health which we think is going to continue to go up and the exchanges serve one part of that overall market.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then on cash flow, the operating cash flow from operations was very strong this quarter. It jumped from $365 million to almost $1.1 billion. I guess two questions. One, was there anything unusual in that? And also, historically third quarter is strong but fourth quarter is stronger from an operating cash flow, should that continue to hold?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, Adam, I think that's a great question. We are exceptionally pleased with the cash flow in the nine months year-to-date. There are no unusual items in there. And yes, Q4 is our seasonally strongest cash flow quarter. And so, we are well on track to deliver double digit free cash flow growth in 2015. The thing I would note that was unusual in calendar year 2015 was the $137 million impact to cash in Q2 that was an outflow of cash on litigation settlements.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC","True. Okay. And then also on cash flow. I think you said you expect $230 million annually of free cash flow, does that exclude or not include just normal improvement from earnings?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So, what I referred to there was from year-end 2014 to year-end 2017, you can see in the slides that we posted on our website that there was an increase in cash flow of $230 million just from decreased cash spent on pension restructuring and capital expenditure.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC","Right. Okay","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","There are really four big drivers of cash flow to get to our $2.3 billion in cash by 2017. The first is obviously growth in revenue and expansion in margin which will lead to operating income growth. The second is working capital improvements and we think they are sustainable for many years to come. The decreased uses of cash I just talked about. And the reduction in tax rate leading through to less cash spent on taxes.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you. And then finally, from what we hear, the Workday service implementation business is doing very well. Would you say that's growing much faster than your overall HR Consulting business? And as you look to 2016-2017, are you doing more types of products, not just Workday but adding other software suites to that business?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So, we've obviously invested significantly in this area of business through the acquisition of OmniPoint and the acquisition of Kloud. We are very pleased with the breadth of solutions we can offer clients in the HR BPO space and, obviously, Software-as-a-Service offers a much more feature rich and effective set of services for clients at a much lower cost.","And so it's a very high area of growth for us and it's continuing to grow double-digits. And so we feel really good about this solution and being able to continue to grow this solution set for clients.","Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer","And we put in context with the other investments we're making in terms of overall size. On the investment consulting side, the delegated side, investments on talent, obviously exchanges we've talked about. So, there's a portfolio of investments we're making and fully funding, by the way, as part of the P&L that we can drive performance and invest for the future.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC","And would you say the margin on that business equal or greater to your average HR Consulting margins?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","What we've said historically on our \u2013 as we think about our margin growth, from where we are in HR Solutions, let's call it 17% today to our 22% long-term target that there are really three big drivers of margin expansion. The first is the return on the investments that we've made. We've invested a lot in delegated and exchanges, et cetera.","The second is the growth in margins in our HR BPO business. We've talked historically about our HR BPO business being about a $500 million business that had very low single-digit margins. And, really, one of the things that is driving the expansion in margin is our investments in BPO staff and these innovative solutions for clients. And the third driver of margin expansion in HR Solutions is our expense discipline and continuing to manage expenses very carefully around IT, real estate and procurement.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","Next, we have Sarah DeWitt of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Sarah.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","In insurance brokerage, the organic growth in the quarter of 1% was at the lower end of your target of low to mid-single-digit organic growth. Is there anything unusual that depressed that and should we expect to see a rebound in the fourth quarter and 2016?","Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Sarah. I would characterize, really, and Christa started on this path. If you really look at for the first nine months of the year, first nine months of the year is as strong or stronger now than it was against 2014. So, the short answer is, no. In fact, look at it over the course of the year, nothing has changed. We would characterize the quarter as a quarter of continued progress against long-term objectives.","And look at Risk, organic revenue for the nine months was 2%, operating income increased 2%, margin up 50 basis points. That's roughly where it was last year. We're now going into our strongest quarter. We believe the Reinsurance business is improving. Continental Europe looks a bit more positive or at least stable. A lot of the investments we've made are very, very good. So, from our standpoint, we feel like this quarter in Risk, and by the way in HR Solutions as well, is just another good quarter of continued progress.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks. And then in HR Solutions, last year you did high single digit adjusted operating income growth and given that the private exchange enrollment for 2016 sounds \u2013 it's going to be a little bit lighter than we would have expected. Is that \u2013 can you still achieve that level of growth for the full year?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sarah, we are exactly on track with the goals we outlined for HR Solutions for the full year. We're going to grow organically, we're going to expand margins, and we're going to grow operating income in 2015.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. But no clarity on to what extent you can grow operating income, because it tends to be pretty lumpy, right, quarter to quarter?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, we have said, Sarah, that we are going to be modestly profitable in healthcare exchanges for the full year 2015.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks for the answers.","Operator","Next, we have Paul Newsome of Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open","Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Good morning and thanks for the call. I wanted to ask a little bit about the M&A outlook in general, and perhaps a little bit in specific in that it looks like you're actually divesting a little bit more than you're acquiring. Is that typical of the trend? You're obviously doing a lot of activity in the area. Could you just give us some general sense about what you think the direction of M&A is going for for Aon? What the outlook in general is for the sector?","Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. We would, Paul, not observe that trend In fact, if you think back and just reflect on Aon over the last 10 years, we've done roughly $8 billion in acquisitions over that period of time. And we said before, we're probably on track for kind of $200 million to $500 million a year, really adding content and capability that we can expand across our portfolio. We're looking to do that all the time.","To the extent, we divest it really is discipline around return on invested capital. We're deploying capital around the world whether it's acquisitions or buyback or whatever, organic investment around the discipline that Christa has set up really gauging each investment around improving return on invested capital. So to the extent, we end up divesting something, it's because we've made a determination that it's better off in somebody else's hands on behalf of our clients and we'll do that from time to time. But if you just think about just even in 2014, we did $500 million in acquisitions in a Flood business which we really love across the U.S. and a benefits business in the UK. So we are excited about adding capability when it makes sense to add capability.","Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","So we should assume that it's a positive number in terms of the revenue impact for, prospectively, from acquisitions.","Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer","I would say, generally, if you look over the last 10 years, absolutely, it will be a positive number. Again, it will be lumpy depending on what happens from quarter-to-quarter but overall absolutely positive.","Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","And I apologize, one more exchange question. A lot of your peers have talked about a move towards more middle market in exchange. Some have even talked about doing deals to move them in that direction. What's your thought on that and is Aon also doing a similar thing?","Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer","Again, we have to start, Paul, with we love the health business. We love the opportunity to serve clients who face increasing pressures that are very real for them on promises they've made to employees about trying to help them serve their family's health needs and the increasing cost of that. Against that backdrop, we provide an absolute large range of solutions. But remember, we actually do regular health benefits for greater than 10 million in the U.S. alone so we actually do more of this than anybody else and love that set of solutions.","Exchanges end up being a set of solutions for a subset of that group, like that as well and we've got exchanges, large, medium, small. We've got exchanges that are fully insured and self-insured. So, we actually go through a range of different options depending on the client situation. But in the end, we're addressing the health needs of clients which we believe are going to continue to increase over time. And again, we just love the platform and have been very successful in growing pieces called the exchanges, but also in developing other areas as well.","Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Next, we have Brian Meredith of UBS. Your line is open.","Brian R. Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Yes. Thanks. A couple of questions here. Hey, Greg, back on the healthcare solutions, has the discussion about the potential repeal of the Cadillac tax had any impact on just the large corporate markets and companies thinking about changing, not only to exchanges but other types of plans?","Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer","Not really, Brian. I think in the end, it's a great question, but really our clients are really looking at the pressure around cost overall. That could be an accelerant but, frankly, they're feeling the pinch anyway. They're also feeling the pinch around volatility, so it really is how do you help your employees meet their demands, what they need for their family, and do it in a way that's reasonably cost effective, more pressure there, and do it in a way that it's not super-volatile quarter-to-quarter for the company is very, very difficult, and wow. If we'd actually lower the cost curve over time which we've been able to do in the exchange examples, 150, 200 basis points a year, that's hugely positive. So, it really is, that's the dialogue. The Cadillac tax ends up being out there but it really hasn't been a driver.","Brian R. Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Did you think it'd be a catalyst, though, in the next, call it, next year or the year after as clients potentially face this Cadillac tax if it stays in place?","Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer","I would say either way it's going evolve because the answer is a good one and it has value and clients see that. Anything by the way that increases cost, the Cadillac tax or anything else, actually is a catalyst for change. So to the extent that's out there and it happens, it's a catalyst for change. To the extent it doesn't, I wouldn't overplay it either. As client see opportunities to reduce costs, flatten the curve and reduce volatility, they're going to embrace it.","And I would say, clients that really innovate on the health side drive it. I mean, give an example, we are working with a very well-known new car company who's as excited about innovation and health for their employees as they are about, frankly, changing the way the world buys cars. And against that, we've helped them create a solution that provides transparency, choice, accountability, a whole series of things for their employees.","And for them it's as much about innovation and the idea of better health and better wellness as it is about cost. And oh yeah, by the way, you can save and reduce volatility. So, that's really the dynamic that's going on.","Brian R. Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks. And then a quick question on the BPO business, I know margins are pretty low there as you're kind of investing in that business. What are the margins look like right now and then kind of what is the kind of outlook for those margins to kind of improve here? And how much of an impact did that have on the HR Solutions margins overall?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I mean, margins are improving, Brian, but what I would say is we're still at low single-digit margins. As you know, historically, several years ago the margins were negative. So, they have improved but we do believe that we'll move from low single-digit margins to sort of mid-teens margins over time.","Brian R. Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","How quickly can that happen? I mean, is it just simply just getting rid of some of these investments because they've been \u2013 for a long, long time, they have been low.","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I mean, we're continuing to improve margins every year, Brian, and clients today are on an average of three-year to seven-year contracts. And so as clients increasingly choose Software-as-a-Service options, our margins improve.","Brian R. Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Got you. I just thought we might be getting closer to the end of that three years to seven years since when you bought Hewitt.","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. It's progressing every year, Brian.","Brian R. Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Next, we have Meyer Shields of KBW. Your line is open","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. Two quick questions if I can. One, it looks like the average number of employees on the active exchange per company went down significantly. Is that because you're adding smaller companies? Or did any companies from last year did not renew?","Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer","No. Really, this is \u2013 again, remember we have been privileged. We've actually brought onboard on the exchange front the largest ever on the exchange. And so almost by definition, as we continue to add clients, the average is going to go down.","By the way, the same is true on the retiree exchange where we've added what was the largest client in history on the retiree exchange. So I wouldn't read too much into that. As we add clients, that average is invariably going to come down. We're not too worried about that.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. If there's any \u2013 I'm sorry. Go ahead.","Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer","We're still doing, in terms of the category, serving this category we think in a very unique way with a very unique set of options.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. No, that's helpful. Are there any margin implications of adding smaller clients besides the underlying trajectory for improvement?","Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer","No. For us, in the end, we've seen overall positive trajectory as Christa has described before. And we see opportunities here for improvement over time. And again, as I said, fundamentally this is a solution which has actually proved to be quite effective for the category of clients large and medium, and small, in fact. And we're excited about adding clients as it makes sense for them and as they elect to come onboard.","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","The other thing I would add is because we've created a platform, we're now adding more and more products to be able to offer to employees. We've now got over 11 different products, not just medical, it's medical, dental, vision, short-term disability, long-term disability, pet insurance, and others. And so, it becomes a platform for employees to really have choice as to how they want to invest their dollar.","Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer","And this is consistent on the exchanges, as Christa is describing there with the idea of a platform to serve similar to what we do across the overall health segment, which is really how do we actually serve clients in an effective way across a range of needs beyond a single product. And this just happens to be a platform to do that.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Oh, okay. No, that's very helpful. I appreciate the detail. On a year-to-date basis, I guess organic revenue growth in brokerage, how does that compare to overall global premium growth?","Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer","So, overall, if you sort of look at year-to-date, it kind of give or take 2% overall. That's probably roughly in line, we would sort of say, with overall premium growth globally. What you're getting to there is a great outcome that this really isn't about price. This really isn't about \u2013 it's really about underlying demand. Our view is underlying demand in the risk world is going to continue to grow. That's going to be reflected in premiums, which tend to increase year-to-year, and we're roughly in line with that.","We're also doing things to bring new categories into play. So, the work we've done, for example, in the reinsurance world, bringing reinsurance capital into the mortgage world actually creates net new markets for what we do overall. That's true in cyber. That's true in terrorism as well. And so for us, we think this is a demand opportunity irrespective of sort of what's happening to the micro price environment and we're seeing it play out over time and we're benefiting from that.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. That is what I was getting at. Thanks so much.","Operator","Next, we have Kai Pan of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you and good morning.","Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","First, I have two questions. First question on the margin. It's pretty good that you can maintain and improve your margin under Risk Solutions given the 1% organic growth. I just wonder what are the driver behind it to be able to better manage expense? And also, so looking longer term, if you look at Risk Solutions, the margin have been stable for about five years and the HR have been stable for four years. So, there's still pretty significant upside to your long-term aspiration goal. I just wonder, if the macro environment remain the same, what other key drivers within your control that we can see meaningful margin expansion in both segments?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I think it's a great question, Kai, because one of the things we have been investing in are investments in data and analytics particularly on the risk side. And they are enabling us to drive margin expansion at lower rates of growth.","And what you're seeing is, we absolutely invested disproportionately in our data and analytics business, particularly up until 2012. And what you're seeing in 2013, 2014, and 2015 are the return on those investments. And as we think about our margin growth from 22.9% which is where we finished at year-end 2014 to 26%, there are three big drivers of that margin expansion. The first is the return on the investments we've made in data and analytics which are substantial, and you're seeing that drive the majority of our margin expansion in 2013, 2014, and again this calendar year.","The second is the Revenue Engine which is allowing us to get record levels of retention of existing clients and record levels of new business wins and you've seen that in our business in calendar year 2015. And the third is the continued expense discipline across our Risk Solutions business. And we are on track for record margins in both segments in 2015.","Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer","And that would be, Kai, at the end of the day, we want to be really clear. Christa has described the track for us to improve margins irrespective of the external environment. So, we didn't talk about pricing, we didn't talk about inflation, we didn't talk about interest rates. We anticipate and expect none of those. If any of those happen, those are substantial accelerants of our margin expansion, but we've been able to expand margin without any of that help with increased operating leverage in the business. So, that's why we are comfortable, and this quarter has done nothing except for reinforce that comfort that we're going to improve margin in 2015, 2016, 2017 irrespective of the external environment.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So, to be clear, the pace of the improvements, that is similar to what we have seen in last few years if the environment keeps the same.","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We're going to continue to make progress in margin every year.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. That's great. And then my second question is on your capacity for buybacks. So, that (49:47) number is significant this quarter again. And if you're looking forward, if you achieve your $2.3 billion of free cash for 2017, which implies about $300 million year increasing in free cash flow through 2017 from 2014. And then the two variable then to drive your increased buybacks would be the merger and acquisitions as well as the debt.","You spoke about the acquisition side, but on the debt side, are there increasing capacity for you to issue on debt. For example, if your EBITDA grew about $100 million a year, would you be able to increase debt by $260 million a year to maintain the 2.6 times leverage ratio, or you want to sort of like keep the debt lower than the leverage ratio going forward?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Kai, It's a great question, and I think gets to the heart of free cash flow growth for Aon and how we allocate capital, and we expect double-digit free cash flow growth for the full year 2015. We've obviously demonstrated 21% growth in free cash flow in the nine months year-to-date. And we're heading into our seasonally strongest cash flow growth quarter. So, we feel really good about being able to grow free cash flow double-digits this calendar year.","And then as we think about the capacity for buyback, you're absolutely right. It's the growth in free cash flow and it's the leverage. And as we think about leverage, we are absolutely committed to our current investment grade ratings and, therefore, as we grow EBITDA and as our pension unfunded liability comes down, we absolutely have the ability to increase leverage.","So, that's the way we think about it. And then you could say, are we allocating this capital towards buyback, are we allocating it towards M&A and it's really about how we think about return on capital, which is on a cash-on-cash return. And our highest return on capital use of cash today is buyback. Because we do believe we're substantially undervalued because many people still look at earnings growth and for us there's a very big disconnect between earnings growth and free cash flow growth. And so, you do have double-digit free cash flow growth to deliver $3.3 billion in 2017.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So, you're comfortable with the 2.6 leverage ratio at these levels?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, we are.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah. Thank you very much.","Operator","Next, we have Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. Few questions. First on the tax rate. Legacy litigation had a benefit this quarter from the second quarter legacy litigation. Should we expect any kind of benefit on the tax rate in the fourth quarter or will it revert back to around that 19% level?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So, the way that works is that legacy litigation that occurred in Q2 that had a positive benefit on the tax rate will impact the full-year tax rate for 2015. So, yes, it will show up again in Q4, Elyse, and then it will not repeat in 2016. And as I've said, the underlying operating rate is 19%, and that's the right rate to use for 2016.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then shifting on to the private healthcare exchanges. The enrollment figures that you gave for 2016, I just want to make sure, are those just on the fully insured exchange? So, the 55 accounts on the active exchange, does that compare to the 30 that you had on last year?","Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. This is overall sort of what we put on the exchange, Elyse, and it's 1.4 million for 2015 into 2016 just as you described.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then so, what is the \u2013 are you breaking out the self-insured versus the fully insured component?","Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer","Look at that as an overall. We haven't broken it out explicitly. Basically we increased the number of clients from 30 to 55 on the active exchange. The majority are fully insured, but we also have a number on the self-insured side as well.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then in terms of thinking about the economics, Christa, I know you mentioned that you'll see modest positive earnings this year. When we think through that, is that more of a function of the investments and the expenses on the exchanges going down as it gains greater scale or growth in revenue? What's contributing, which of either revenue or expenses is contributing to you guys kind of hitting the inflection point this year and seeing positive earnings?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Elyse, the way to think about it is the investments we've made are really operating expense, so they're going to show up every year. And then as we get incremental participants enrolled, then our revenue increases which is how we get the scale to be modestly profitable this year and continued improvements in profitability in each year thereafter. So, it's the revenue growth, Elyse.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then lastly on the share repurchases. We saw that pick up this quarter from where you guys have been trending year-to-date? Did you move up any kind of share repurchases that you had geared for the fourth quarter? Anything more on just the pickup in the level in the third quarter and kind of expectations for fourth quarter that you have.","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Elyse, what we said coming into the second half of the year was that share repurchase would be stronger in the second half of the year than the first half of the year because the second half of the year is our seasonally strongest cash flow half. And that's exactly what you're seeing. And so, we would expect \u2013 Q4 is our strongest cash flow quarter. And so, if you think about share repurchase going forward, we would expect to continue to allocate capital based on the highest return on capital.","And then I would say as you think about sort of hitting the $2.3 billion in free cash flow in 2017, you should assume that the share count is going to continue to trend down over that time period. And so, if you think about the $2.3 billion of cash divided by share count, it is the highest return on capital opportunity we have.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Michael Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks so much. Just to go back to the cash question again here, I mean, if we go back to 2012 when we sort of laid out the double cash by 2017, I mean, since that point, we've had sort of very clear, tangible drivers of cash generation, the restructuring program, the reduction in pension contributions from freezing the pension plan, and then the reduction in tax payments from the lower tax rate. So, that gets us maybe \u2013 depending on what happens this year in the fourth quarter, maybe that gets us halfway there.","I guess I'm just trying to understand, looking from here, do we have line of sight into a chart similar like we have on page 11 in the presentation? What gets us the rest of the 50% of the way to that $2.3 billion? Because it's just hard to understand what that is, if it isn't going to be reaching those margin targets that you have guys have laid out specifically by 2017? Thanks.","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Look, it's a great question, Michael, because if you look at the pension restructuring CapEx, it's $230 million. You add reduction in cash taxes of about $100 million, you're about $330 million. So, you've got a gap. And the gap is really coming from operating income growth, both in revenue and margin expansion. So, that will be absolutely a big driver of the free cash flow growth. And the second is working capital improvement. Michael, if you look at 2011, our accounts receivable divide by revenue, so you get days sales outstanding. It was about 103 days sales outstanding in 2011.","And in 2014, that reduced to 85 days. So, you've basically got an improvement of 18 days in days sales outstanding over those four-year period, which on 2014 revenue is the equivalent of $575 million in cash from working capital.","And what I would say is, we've got substantial improvements in working capital to come over the next five-plus years. As we continue to improve the processes around Aon, and through the operating model and improve the collection of cash from customers and the payments to suppliers.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So, then, I mean from this point, I mean, it's really less about \u2013 or it's going to be less about earnings and margins and more about balance sheet optimization in order to extract that additional $500 million, $600 million of annual cash flow. Is that fair?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, actually. It's really about revenue growth and margin expansion. It's absolutely about operating income growth, so I did start there. So I would say there are two big drivers of cash flow growth other \u2013 there are really four big drivers of cash flow growth. One is revenue and margin expansion driving operating income growth. Two is working capital improvements, which we believe is sustainable over multiple years. Three is the reduction in uses of capital on pension restructuring and CapEx. And four is reduced cash taxes. They're the four big drivers, and all four of them will contribute.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Okay. And then, just if I could on healthcare exchanges, tell me you're getting closer to scale there. Do you have visibility or you can give some insight into what the model margins are on exchanges as you think about that relative to your benefits business? I mean, obviously, you've got still some investments in there and you're probably not fully at scale. But how should we think about the trade-off between your sort of legacy benefits business and this new sort of platform as you start to scale that up?","Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer","As we said before, listen, as we bring this up online, it is going to be higher accretive to our margin currently and certainly helps us and gets us on track and accretive to our 22% target. So, we're investing on behalf of clients. We've absorbing into the P&L. We're still able to improve margins. And as we bring this onboard and we continue to see adoption, it's going to reinforce our overall margin progress and margin improvements.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And then, last one on exchanges. I guess ADP is a large payroll company that has talked about building an exchange platform. Do you think \u2013 what is the risk, if there is one? Are those potential partners? Are those potential competitors? It's still somewhat unclear about how they're bringing people to the table and partners to the table and potentially competing in the space. How do you think about the potential encroachment either from new competitors or opportunity to partner with new partners like that? Thanks.","Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer","Again, we'd step back and say, listen, we're actually operating in the health space, which is why we love the space so much. This is massive, and we would say largely broken. So, this is one of the most important, biggest sectors of the global economy, certainly in the U.S. economy. And our clients are like begging for an option or set of options that can flatten the cost curve a bit, reduce volatility and, most important, give employees better choice and better transparency, and hopefully a bit of accountability, maybe even change their behavior, improve health overall. So, against that backdrop, we've brought a range of solutions. It is a massive, vast ocean with lots of opportunities there.","And the thing we love is we start with the fact that we actually already do this for 22 million Americans across the overall benefits spectrum, 10 million in health alone, so we've got very, very tremendous access to the companies to have a great set of discussions. And we would observe, by the way, when we first start talking about exchanges, most of the world said that, no, they don't like them, we should never have them, and then eventually, everybody showed with exchanges. And then we talked about the idea of actually maybe even putting the risk on an insurance balance sheet, let's call it fully insured, and everyone said, no, no, those are terrible, too. And then eventually, everybody's got one of those as well.","So, our view is there's going to be lots of folks coming to the floor here to try to serve this market. It's an important market. And at the end of the day, we really \u2013 we love our position. We feel very privileged to be where we are. But we also are very clear we need to keep innovating. We need to keep improving. We need to keep investing behind and on behalf of our clients because none of us have gotten our clients to a place where they really need to be going forward and that really is the aspiration.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you so much.","Operator","Our last question is from Vinay Misquith of Sterne Agee CRT. Your line is open.","Vinay Misquith - Sterne Agee CRT","Hi. Good morning. Most of my questions have been answered. Just one clarification on the working capital. Christa, if you could help me understand how that works, and I believe you're asking clients to pay up slightly earlier. So, curious about what impact it's having on client relationships and also how much more of this working capital benefits can you squeeze out over the next couple of years?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So, really, Vinay, the way this works is it's collecting the cash that customers owe us. And I think historically we've had a focus on revenue growth and then on margin expansion and then really sort of in the last four or five years, cash flow. So, I think we haven't had the discipline around the processes and the collections that we're now putting in place. And I think it's allowing us to translate a dollar of revenue into free cash flow much more efficiently.","And so, I would say it's both on that side. And then as we aggregate together our supplier spending, we're able to get better terms in terms of how we pay suppliers. So, both of those contribute to working capital. And I would say as we continue to bring together global Aon and improve our overall efficiency, we see substantial improvements in working capital over the next five years.","Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer","In many respects, Vinay, philosophically to the cash piece, I think it's worth spending a minute on this. Listen, we have brought what we believe is \u2013 it's not rocket science but in the world of brokerage, it's an innovation. No one has actually ever looked at the idea of how you translate operating income into cash. And it turns out we're actually not actually squeezing, we're actually just being slightly disciplined. And slight discipline means we've got a better engine to translate operating income into cash. And it turns out, it's massive. And that's why we've actually got a set of structural changes between now and 2013 (1:04:44).","Structural intention (1:04:46), structural in restructuring, structural in tax and structural in working capital that again aren't rocket science if you're outside the brokerage world, but in our world require a lot of energy, a lot to change. But when you do, it creates a tremendous benefit. And so, for every dollar of operating profit we're generating, our translation into free cash flow is stronger and getting stronger, and that gets us to the $2.3 billion.","I would highlight, as Christa described before, we do not need to get to a 26% margin and a 22% margin in our targets to make $2.3 billion. In fact, if we achieve those margins, we'd be well above $2.3 billion. So, from our standpoint, we're focused on cash because it's important to our investors and important to us. It's an important bellwether on how much we can invest back into the business, and we're taking steps to improve that profile. And the 21% in the first nine months has just said we're on track. And we're going to continue to do that. And I think importantly, as Christa described, we're going to be able to sustain that past 2017 and the $2.3 billion.","Vinay Misquith - Sterne Agee CRT","Okay. That's helpful. Just one numbers question on the tax rate. Christa, the fourth quarter, should we expect a 16% tax rate once again?","Christa Davies - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I mean, the operating rate is going to be \u2013 the underlying rate is really going to be 19%. And then I think it depends on discrete items and that's what you saw this quarter which made it lower.","Vinay Misquith - Sterne Agee CRT","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. I would like to turn the call back to Greg Case for closing remarks.","Gregory C. Case - President and Chief Executive Officer","Just appreciate everybody joining the call and look forward to our discussion next quarter. Thanks very much.","Operator","That concludes today's conference. Thank you all for joining. You may all now disconnect."]}}
