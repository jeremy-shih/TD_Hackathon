At this time, the telephone lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, there will be an opportunity for questions-and-answers with instructions given at that time. And as a reminder, today's call is being recorded.","I'll now turn the conference call over to your host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Sujal Shah. Please go ahead.","Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Good morning and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss TE Connectivity's third quarter 2018 results. With me today are Chief Executive Officer, Terrence Curtin; and Chief Financial Officer, Heath Mitts. During this call, we'll be providing certain forward-looking information, and we ask you to review the forward-looking cautionary statements included in today's press release.","In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussion this morning and we ask you to review the sections of our press release and the accompanying slide presentation that address the use of these items. The press release and related tables, along with the slide presentation, can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at te.com.","Finally, due to the increasing number of participants on the Q&A portion of today's call, we're asking everyone to limit themselves to one question to make sure we can give everyone an opportunity to ask questions during the allotted time. We're happy to take follow-up questions, but ask that you rejoin the queue and ask second question.","Now, let me turn the call over to Terrence, for opening comments.","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Thanks, Sujal, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today to cover our third quarter results and updated outlook for 2018. Before I get into the earnings slides, let me briefly recap our quarterly results and full year guide against the elements of our strategy and business model.","Our results in the quarter demonstrate successful executions, with ongoing investments to support an attractive and growing demand pipeline and another quarter of growth above markets in which we serve. On the top line, we delivered 6% organic growth in the third quarter and we also expect 6% organic growth at our midpoint for the full year and this is at the upper end of our 4% to 6% long-term organic growth target.","Our revenue growth continues to be driven by secular trends and our focus on co-creating with our customers by leveraging our leading global position in this increasingly connected world and this is enabling TE to consistently outgrow our end markets.","On the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share increased by 15% and we're raising the midpoint of our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance which also reflects 15% growth over the prior year. This growth is consistent with our annual double-digit earnings growth target and our business model. From a capital perspective, our strategy remains balanced through share buybacks, dividends, as well as a disciplined approach on acquisitions, and we continue to invest to support the organic growth opportunities in our business while maintaining ROIC levels in the mid-teens.","So if you could, let's move to the slides, and I'll start with slide 3 to review the highlights from our third quarter. We did deliver performance above our guidance with double-digit growth in revenue as well as adjusted earnings per share. Sales were $3.8 billion representing 12% reported growth and 6% organic growth year-over-year. We saw organic growth across all TE's businesses with the exception of SubCom.","In Transportation, we grew 12% organically, well above our markets, with growth in each of our three businesses in the segment, as well as in all regions. In Industrial Solutions, we grew 5% organically with growth across all businesses and also in all regions and our Communications segment declined 6% organically as we expected. We did have 10% combined organic growth in data and devices and our appliances business, and this was more than offset by SubCom year-over-year declines.","On the earnings side, from a margin perspective, in quarter three, we delivered 16.7% adjusted operating margins, with margin expansion in both the Transportation and Industrial segments. And one of the key highlights of the quarter was that our Industrial segment margins were up strong 150 basis points year-over-year.","In the Communications segment, margins declined as we expected due to SubCom where we had a tough year-over-year comparison versus very strong revenue in the third quarter last year, along with a margin impact from the program delay that we highlighted back in our first quarter earnings call. The SubCom dynamics negatively impacted our adjusted operating margin by 90 basis points year-over-year in the quarter. And when I look at our overall earnings, I'm very proud that we delivered 15% adjusted earnings per share growth, even with this headwind.","Earnings per share growth was an adjusted $1.43 and when you look at it, it's driven primarily by operational performance as well as the benefit from a favorable impact of currency translation.","Turning to the full year, we are raising our revenue and earnings per share guidance, reflecting stronger third quarter results, offset by incremental headwinds that are primarily due to foreign currency exchange rates, which changed from being a tailwind in the first three quarters to a headwind in our fourth quarter versus the prior year.","For the full year, we expect sales to be up 12% on a reported basis and 6% organically, with adjusted earnings per share of $5.57, which is up 15% of midpoint, which looks a lot like the quarterly three results we just delivered. And when I think about this year and the progress that we made in perspective, the guide we gave back at the beginning of the year back in November was 4% organic growth and $5.23 of adjusted earnings per share versus the 6% organic growth and 15% EPS growth that I just talked about.","So let's turn to slide 4 and I'll cover order trends in detail. As you can see when you look at the slide, we continue to see broad-based growth in orders across our three segments, which reinforce our growth outlook. Total orders excluding SubCom were $3.75 billion and our book-to-bill was 1.05. Orders were up 15% year-over-year on a reported basis and 9% organically. We continue to see growth globally with increases in organic orders in all regions. And by region, we had 16% order growth in the Americas; 8% Asian; and 4% in Europe.","Turning to orders by segment, in Transportation, orders increased 8% organically, with growth in all regions led by double-digit increases in both Asia and the Americas. In Industrial, our orders grew strong 12% organically year-over-year, with momentum in our aerospace, defense and marine business and strong order growth in our medical business. And in our Communications segment excluding SubCom, we saw year-over-year organic orders growth of 8% with growth across all regions and in both of the businesses.","So if you could please turn to slide 5, let me get into segment results and we'll start with Transportation. Transportation sales grew 12% organically year-over-year, with strong growth in each of our three businesses. Our auto sales were up 10% organically on 4% global auto production growth in the quarter.","Our strong growth above market continues to illustrate the positive impact of content growth in our auto business along with the benefits of our global leadership position.","We had 16% organic growth in the Americas, 11% growth in China, and 9% growth in Europe, as we continue to benefit from our new project long titles (08:48) as well as share gains.","Our performance continues to reflect content growth from the secular trends in this market, and we expect to benefit as adoption increases for both connected and electric vehicles.","We continue to increase our investment to support TE's momentum in these emerging growth applications. And we're extremely well-positioned with leading edge solutions and an increasing pipeline and design wins across our global OEMs.","In our commercial transportation business, we continue to outperform the market with organic revenue growth of 22% year-over-year, with balanced growth across all regions and strong growth within each submarket. We continue to see momentum in the heavy truck areas, as well as growth in the agriculture, mining and construction markets.","And in sensors, our business grew 8% organically year-over-year with growth across auto, commercial transportation and industrial applications. This growth is driven by the design wins we've been discussing over the past two years. And we continue to see strong design win momentum particularly in auto applications.","In fiscal 2018, our year-to-date, we generated $600 million of new sensor design wins in auto applications. This brings the total design win value to $1.8 billion since the beginning of 2016 across a broad spectrum of auto sensor technologies and applications, which will certainly set the business up for strong growth as we've talked to you about.","Turning to operating margin for the segment, margins were in line with expectations at 19.3%, and they were up 20 basis points year-over-year and reflect investments to capitalize on our strong design win momentum in both connectors and sensors.","So please turn to slide 6 and we'll discuss our Industrial Solutions segment. Segment sales grew 9% on a reported basis and 5% organically as we expected. Adjusted operating margins were 14.4% and expanded 150 basis points year-over-year from operating leverage on higher revenue.","As we talked to you about, we are in a multi-year journey to optimize our factory footprint and lower expenses to expand adjusted operating margins into the high-teens in the segment. And I really feel the results you see in this quarter show the progress that we're making on this journey.","So let me move to highlight the performance by business in the segment. In industrial equipment, organic growth was 6%, which is in line with our mid-single-digit targeted long-term growth rate. We saw growth across all regions and strength in both factory automation and medical applications.","In our AD&M business, we saw 6% organic growth, driven by commercial aerospace and defense, and we continue to see growth in both of these markets, as defense continues to improve.","In energy, our business grew 2% on an organic basis and this was driven by strength in the Americas offset by weakness outside the United States.","So please turn to slide 7 and I'll discuss our Communications Solutions segment. As I said earlier, the segment declined 6%, which was in line with our expectations and driven by the year-over-year declines in our SubCom business. Our momentum in our data and devices and applications (sic) [appliances] (12:30) businesses remain strong. And they have both company organic growth of 10% on a combined basis.","In data and devices, we grew 11% organically, with growth across all regions, driven by high speed connectivity and data center applications and content growth from electronification trends, where TE is providing integrated solutions.","In our appliances business, we continued our strong performance with 9% organic growth, with growth in all regions and continued share gains. We continue to benefit from the secular trends that include safety, efficiency and miniaturization in the appliance market, as well as leveraging our leading global position.","And in SubCom, our revenue declined to $184 million. The primary contributor to the year-over-year decline in SubCom was a tough comparison versus the third quarter last year, which we had revenue of $270 million in the quarter. Overall, this market remains in the healthy elongated cycle we've been talking about and our backlog remains at $1 billion.","For the segment, adjusted operating margins were 11.9%, and as we discussed over the past couple of quarters, segment margins are running below our targeted mid-teen operating margins due to the delayed SubCom program ramp and the project accounting nature of this business.","With that, I'll turn it over to Heath, and get into the financials.","Heath Mitts - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Thank you, Terrence, and good morning, everyone.","Please turn to slide 8, where I will provide more details on the Q3 financials. Adjusted operating income was $628 million, with an adjusted operating margin of 16.7%, leveraging the strong growth of 6%. GAAP operating income was $558 million and included $65 million of restructuring and other charges and $5 million of acquisition charges.","For the full year, I continue to expect the restructuring charges of approximately $150 million, driven primarily by activity in our Industrial Solutions segment, as we optimize our footprint and make structural improvements in SG&A across the company. This is consistent with what we've talked about in the past.","Adjusted EPS of $1.43, up a very strong 15% year-over-year, is driven by sales growth as well as the benefit from currency translation. GAAP EPS was $1.29 for the quarter included restructuring and other charges of $0.13 as well as acquisition related charges of $0.01.","The adjusted effective tax rate in Q3 was 16.9%. Looking ahead, we do expect a sequential increase in rates in Q4, resulting in our full year adjusted tax rate in the 18% to 19% range. Longer term, you should continue to view our tax rate at approximately 20%.","Now, if I get you to turn to slide 9, adjusted gross margin in the quarter was 32.4%, with year-over-year decline driven primarily by SubCom where Terrence outlined the moving pieces earlier. Given the relative strength of the rest of our portfolio, I'm pleased that we were able to offset SubCom driven margin pressure and maintain our overall adjusted operating margins from 16.7%.","In the quarter, cash from operations was a strong $800 million and free cash flow was $504 million. On a year-to-date basis, cash from operations is up 5% versus last year, and year-to-date free cash flow reflects the impact from increased capital investments.","As I mentioned last quarter, given the rich pipeline of organic opportunities, we are increasing our capital investment this year to be approximately 6% of sales. And as you know, this investment is for growth and is the highest return on investment for the company. We continue to target mid-teens adjusted ROIC and have seen nice improvement year-over-year in ROIC and I'm pleased with those results.","We also returned $382 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And we've included a balance sheet and cash flow summary in the appendix for additional details.","So before I turn this back to Terrence, let me just share our perspective on the trading policy and tariffs, as there are obviously many questions. While some of our products are directly affected by recently implemented U.S. tariffs, only a very small percentage of TE products are actually impacted.","Our strategy has always been to manufacture close to our customers to be aligned with our customers' supply chain strategies. Our global position and footprint helps mitigate TE from tariffs impacts. However, for those products that are impacted, we're committed to working closely with our customers to minimize the impact and we are proactively looking at a combination of actions including further optimizing current supply chains, continuing to leverage our global manufacturing footprint and in some cases, implementing surcharges to customers.","I would like to reiterate that, as a global company, TE is a proponent of free and open trade, tariffs and restricted trade policies create friction, uncertainty and added cost for businesses engaged in global markets. So we'll provide an update on any future impacts when we issue our fiscal 2019 guidance later this year and give you a sense for any impact that they would have in terms of future year guidance.","With that, I'm going to turn it back over to Mr. Curtin.","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Thanks, Heath. And let me get into guidance and we'll start with the fourth quarter on slide 10. When you look at the fourth quarter, we expect fourth quarter revenue of $3.59 billion to $3.69 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $1.31 to $1.33. At the midpoint, this represents reported and organic sales growth of 5% and adjusted earnings per share growth of 6%.","We do expect our fourth quarter look like a lot like our third quarter, with the exception of currency and tax impacts. When you think about the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar, we now expect the year-over-year currency exchange headwind of approximately $50 million and $0.02 in the quarter. Currency has been a tailwind for the first three quarters of the year, so that is going to flip.","In addition, our expected tax rate has a headwind of $0.02 versus the prior year, so operationally, quarter four looks pretty similar to quarter three.","If you move by segment, we expect Transportation Solutions to grow high single-digits on both a reported and organic basis, driven by all three businesses. In Industrial Solutions, we expect to grow mid-single-digits organically, with growth across all businesses in line with our long-term model. And in Communications, we expect to be down low single-digits, with continued above market growth in both data and devices and appliances and we expect SubCom revenue being at similar revenue levels as we just had in the third quarter.","So let me turn to the full year and if you can move to slide 11, please. For the full year, we now expect full year revenue of $14.58 billion to $14.68 billion, representing $1.5 billion of increased revenue year-over-year. At our midpoint, this represents 12% reported and 6% organic growth.","If you take the $1.5 billion of increased revenue and break it down, this is about $850 million due to organic growth. We're also benefiting $250 million from mergers and acquisitions, and the benefit of about $400 million from currency translation.","From an adjusted earnings per share, our growth is expected to be up 15% at midpoint, driven by the flow through from our sales growth, as well as the benefit of currency translation. Versus our prior guidance, we're increasing revenue slightly at the midpoint and adjusted earnings per share is up $0.02 to $5.57. We expect our strong performance that we had in quarter three, to be partially offset by the stronger dollar and a slightly weaker outlook for SubCom.","So let me get into color by our segments and our full year guidance. We expect our Transportation Solutions segment to be up in the high-teens on a reported basis and up low double-digits organically on assumption of approximately 2% global auto production growth in 2019. Our outperformance continues to reflect the content growth and share gains that we talked to you about and the momentum that we have. In commercial transportation, we expect to continue outperform our end market and we expect continued growth in sensors based upon the pipeline of wins that I highlighted for you earlier.","In Industrial Solutions, it's essentially unchanged from our prior guidance, with reported growth expected to be up high single-digits and organic growth up mid-single-digits. The primary growth drivers remain industrial equipment, commercial air as well as defense.","And in Communications, we continue to expect Communications to be down low single-digits on both a reported and an organic basis, with growth in data and devices and appliances being more than offset by the clients in SubCom. We continue to expect strong combined organic growth in data and devices and appliances for the year.","So before we go into questions, I just want to highlight some key takeaways as I think about the cold (22:31). I think we continue to execute very well against our strategy and business model and expect to deliver 6% organic growth and 15% adjusted EPS growth for the full year, which is in line with our business model. We continue to benefit broadly from global secular trends and consistently driving growth ahead of the markets we serve. And you see that through the broad growth we have in the business and the businesses that I highlighted today.","We continue to look at increasing our investments to support organic growth and our attractive and growing pipeline of design wins, particularly in auto, is going to continue to support future organic growth, and Heath talked about the increase in capital up to 6% and that's the key indicator, as we continue to make that be our best investment.","For the full year, we expect our Transportation margins to be at our target level of approximately 20% and in the strong margin expansion year-over-year that we demonstrated at Industrial I think is a really good step of where we're going with the margin in that segment. And the Communications segment, it's going to be a drag on TE margin in 2018, due to the program delay that we talked to you about in SubCom.","Also, I think it's key that we're generating strong cash flow and we're maintaining a balanced capital strategy and we're improving ROIC about 1 point this year. And the multiple levers that we continually review with you remain intact to drive continued double-digit earnings growth that will drive further value creation for our earnings.","So as we close, the one last thing I want to do is I do want to thank our employees around the world for their execution in the third quarter, as well as their continued commitment to our customers and making sure we create a future that's safer, sustainable, productive and connected.","So Sujal, with that, let's open it up for Q&A.","Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Allan, can you give the instructions for the Q&A session?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Absolutely. Our first question will come from the line of Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead, please.","Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes, thank you. A question for Heath on the Industrial margins, the 150-basis-point year-over-year increase looks like mostly probably operating leverage in the business, yet you're talking about some of the restructuring activities and more of a forward look in terms of footprint. So could you just talk about what you're seeing today and then how you envision Industrial margins going forward?","Heath Mitts - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Craig, thanks for the question. Honestly, the improvement that you've seen not just in this quarter, but for the full year outlook for 2018 for our Industrial margins, there is some belt tightening in there, but largely, we're seeing the benefit of the organic growth flow through. And as the businesses, as you know, we got all business units growing in that segment.","I would tell you that the charges that we're incurring today relative to restructuring generally have about a two-year payback. Some of these are outside the U.S., which tends to lengthen the payback period as you know.","So the restructuring activity and the benefit from those, which we've talked pretty extensively about to all of you, really starts to kick in more in 2019 and much more pointedly in 2020, as some of these big facility moves are completed.","So keep in mind that what we've talked externally about is about a 300-basis-point journey on operating margin expansion there. Certainly, we attributed about two-thirds of that towards footprint optimization and about a third of that through the flow through on the growth side. We're seeing the growth side of it now and the restructuring piece is yet to come. But we're pleased with the team's progress there, there's been a real heightened focus.","Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Okay, thank you, Craig.","Operator","And next, we'll go to the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen. Go ahead.","Tristan Margot - Cowen and Company, LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning. This is Tristan in for Joe. You had a very strong operational result that was somewhat, I guess, masked by the SubCom business. It was expected but (27:07). Are you looking to maybe be a bit more proactive on a potential divestment there?","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Thank you for your question. And as you all know that, while it's a good question, it's not a new question.","Our SubCom business is a unique asset that I've always told you about. While it's a good business, it is a business that is unique. So it's a business we feel, as long as we own it, we have to operate it. But it is something we always look at if there were offers on it.","Clearly, we've said this for a long time, there hasn't been. But as we own it, it needs to be run. And when you look at this year, we expected the business to be down overall, going from a very healthy level of $1 billion. And we told you earlier $700 million to $800 million. Certainly it's at the low end of that range. We feel good about the cycle that we're in. I mean, it is a healthy cycle, and you see that in our backlog.","But clearly, the disappointment this year in that business is the program delay that we teed up early in the year that is impacting our margin. It's also slowed things down. We do expect that program to wrap up in 2019. And we feel, as we go forward, it will be performing more like it has performed in the past than it is this year.","So feel good about where the business is positioned to where it is in the cycle. Certainly, this program delay that we've had around new technology has created a headwind that I'm very proud that the rest of the business has been able to make up for, as we've had margin expansion in both Transportation and a strong step that Heath talked about to the prior question.","So we'll continue to work through it. We always look at alternatives for SubCom, but I've been saying that since I've been CFO here for 10 years. So thanks for the question.","Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Thank you, Tristan. Could we have the next question, please?","Operator","We'll next go to the line of David Leiker with Baird. Go ahead.","Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hi. Good morning. This is Joe Vruwink for David.","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Good morning.","Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","When we look at Transportation organic growth and try to reconcile what that is relative to end market production, it looks like your above market growth is going to be around 9% this year. It was 9% last year.","So just relative to the guidance of 4% to 6% content growth, it certainly seems like it has been better than that. It can sustainably be better than that. Why can't TE sustain a high single-digit level of out-growth, above and beyond this 4% to 6% target?","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Thank you for your question. And when we look at it, as we just shared with you back in our Investor Day, we think long-term that 4% to 6% is right above production.","When you look at this quarter, production was a little bit stronger this quarter. It was up about 400 basis points in the quarter, and we grew about 10% in automotive.","I think the key is we continue to invest in the design wins that we have. You're going to continue to see and even if we think about like next year, we still view the world is going to have about a 2% production environment.","So when you sit there and you think about that 2% production environment similar to this year, I think you would be in the high single-digits in that type of production environment based upon the momentum we have in the design wins and that we're investing behind.","So when we look at it, we feel the momentum we have, not only from what we do and the wins we have, but also where we're globally positioned to capitalize for any little moves that happen on global production. It's one of the great things about our businesses, our global deployment and our customer breadth.","Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Okay. Thank you, Joe. Could we have the next question, please?","Operator","That will come from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Go ahead.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.","Yeah, thanks. Good morning. So back to SubCom, I think the production and approval process has been resolved relative to that project. So just wondering how the visibility is shaping up for magnitude, degree, and certainty around margin tailwind for that segment into next year, maybe on a neutral rev basis? And then separately, view to backlog converting to some revenue lift there.","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","So a couple of things. The backlog is strong as I've mentioned, around $1 billion. So I think when you look at next year, I think it's fair to say to your assumption, it looks a lot like this year at the top line.","And what we expect that you'll see is as this program works off, it is a program that will work off in 2019, you will get the margin lift. And I think you need to think about it as the Communications segment. And you'll see segment margin to move up from what are right now sub-12% back up into the mid-teens that we've talked to you about for the segment. And you'll see that in the next year.","Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Okay. Thank you, Chris. Could we have the next question, please?","Operator","And that will come from the line of Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.","Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes, thank you. Good morning. Terrence, can you address what some of the puts and takes were in the Transportation segment as it pertains to margins? Did it take down a bit in the quarter? You called out some of the investments to drive future growth. I was wondering if you can help be a little more specific on what those are? And any color on the magnitude of those investments and possibility of ongoing higher base of investments. Thanks.","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Yeah, thanks, Wamsi. I guess, first of all, I want to be clear. Our margin in Transportation came in where we expected. So I don't believe it was a surprise to us where the margin came in at. And we do expect for the year it'll be at that 20%, which we've always told you plus or minus 1 point where it would be. So I feel actually good about the margin in the business.","There are investments that we've talked to you about. Heath talked about CapEx increasing up to 6%, that's primarily in our Transportation business and, clearly, when we spend capital, that goes in to gross margin. But I want to go back maybe to the question that was asked earlier. The organic engine that we've had in automotive is very significant. Certainly, we talk about it in percentages, but just to frame it a little bit, we grew organically our Transportation business by $700 million last year. We're doing it by $800 million this year. And that's really a north of 20% increase in that one business over the past two years, if you really go back.","And we are, having to make sure we keep up with those type of demand profiles, and also putting the capacity in for the pipelines we have. So we have increased up CapEx, we have increased up R&D and, now, you'll see that in quarters, you'll have timing off a little bit, but we are completely committed to the 20% plus or minus, and we're going to continue to make the investments for what is the best return which is organic growth, and we've been doing that and we're going to continue to highlight that for you. But thank you for the question.","Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Thank, you, Wamsi. Could we have the next question, please?","Operator","And that will come from the line of Shawn Harrison with Longbow Research. Go ahead, please.","Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC","Hi, morning everybody.","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Hey, Shawn.","Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC","Just on kind of the third quarter versus fourth quarter dynamics, particularly maybe in Transportation, but in any of the other businesses, do you feel as if there was any maybe pull forward of demand? And the reason I ask that is it feels like seasonality is coming back into the business maybe that we haven't seen over the past 12 to 24 months.","Heath Mitts - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Shawn, this is Heath. There is some typical seasonality specifically in auto that generally makes Q4 a little bit lower than Q3. But generally, as we look at it, our third quarter and our fourth quarter look pretty similar in terms of our outlook. The challenge is in terms of the earnings side is that FX turns on us and goes from being a tailwind to a headwind, and then, tax is significantly higher in the fourth quarter, so the two of those together worth about $0.10 sequentially in terms of the third quarter versus the fourth quarter.","Otherwise, when you kind of look around the other businesses, they look pretty similar and we're just battling some of the, I'll say, non-operational pieces and, obviously, some of the things from SubCom that Terrence has already highlighted.","Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Okay. Thank you, Shawn. We have the next question, please.","Operator","Yeah, sure, that will come from the line of Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yes. Thanks a lot. Good morning, guys. I guess...","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Hi Amit.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. Terrence, I think you talked about $1.8 billion of total design wins you've had and I think there was a commentary on sensors specifically. What's the cadence do you think of that revenues under ramp over time? And I realized you've had really good growth, sensors have been 7%, 8% for a few quarters, but do you see that stepping up to maybe double-digits as you go next year given the backlog and the design wins you're sitting at?","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Yeah. When you look at it, Amit, thanks for the question, and I think it's very similar to what we've been telling you. What's great is the amount I'm talking about is an automotive online. So we also \u2013 you saw on the growth outside of automotive and sensors was very strong as well. But in automotive, you know how these programs come in.","You start winning them, they take two, three years to actually start from production and they ramp, and so, as we told you back at Investor Day is we do expect you're going to start seeing double-digit growth in our automotive as these layer in. They will layer in over time. Certainly, programs ramp over time. And, in many ways, it supports how we're going to get north of $5 per vehicle in sensor content that we talked to you about.","So I think the momentum that we've had just continues to be that the pipeline that we built, the technologies that we acquired with MEAS are we're able to get to our commercial teams and really make sure we're creating value and that's layering in and I feel very good about the momentum to really make sure of that sensors in automotive, you're going to continue to see nice growth as these things come into production and get built to our customers.","Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Okay. Thank you, Amit. Could we have the next question, please?","Operator","We'll go now to the line of Jim Suva with Citi. Go ahead.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Hi, Jim.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","I know you gave some nice comments on the global tariff and M&A, but I wanted to see if you had any actually discussions or actually any actions with some of your customers. I know like in the Industrial segment, there's been some recent news of some industrial companies talking about higher cost of goods sold by steel and aluminum tariffs. Are they talking to you about changing the location of manufacturing, supply relationships or anything going on actively on that front? Thank you.","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Yeah, Jim, thanks for the question. And to give some example, so number one, we are not a steel user. As you all know, we start from base metals, particularly copper and gold, and certainly, resins that we use and certainly, that's what our engineers use as a lot of our basic building blocks. So on the input costs while we have a little bit of tariffs, it's not that big.","Really, the discussions we have with our customers and you know our model. Our model is to design close to our customers, and then, be aligned to their supply chain. So in regard to where we serve our customer directly, there is lots of discussions around supply chain. Do we need to be moving some of production to certain parts to as they look at their supply chain, as well as just the whole logistics flow, because there are logistic flows that I think people are trying to understand is there a way to work the tariffs that away.","So they are real live discussion. As you know, it's very fluid. In areas where it is unavoidable, then we have tariffs or things that we go through our channel partners, there will be surcharges for tariffs that we cannot mitigate through manufacturing moves or supply chain moves. And that will be a surcharge, if we would do out or it's unavoidable.","So that's where it is right now. As you can imagine, with somebody that sells more than 500,000 discrete SKUs, it is very tactical right now. It's very much a lot of engagement with our customers, which I feel very fortunate with our closed business model with our customers. We're going to work with them to make sure that they can stay competitive and if we have to move some things around for the long-term, we will. So, thanks, Jim.","Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Thank you, Jim. Could we have the next question, please?","Operator","We'll go to the line of Matt Sheerin with Stifel. Go ahead.","Matthew John Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yes, thanks, and good morning. So question on regarding some of the supply chain issues that we're hearing about specifically component shortages, capacitor shortages whether seem to be hitting some of the EMS companies. Are you seeing any rescheduling or any mismatch of parts to customers that may be affecting your business?","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","No, Matt. So, as you know, we don't do those passive.","Matthew John Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah.","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","So we've not seen any rescheduling. Clearly, there is shortages in certain areas. Capacity is sold out. We've not seen any impact and you can see that in our orders, we've not seen demand impacts. As we told you before, our lead time overall has remained relatively stable, but we do have some pockets instead of product categories that we are extended just due to how the demand has increased. But I would say that's a minor part of our business, but we have not seen any demand changes where our customers told us, because they can't get a capacitor or another type of passive that they want us to stop shipping or slowdown. We have not seen that in any material way.","Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Okay. Thank you, Matt. Could we have the next question, please?","Operator","We'll go to the line of Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Go ahead, please.","Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Question on subsea. I think it had been a 50 bps drag to the corporate margin last quarter and if I heard correctly, Terrence, you said it's about 90 bps this past quarter. So if I better understand, the reason is maybe a bit larger of an impact now and just to clarify on how we should think about that improving.","Should we think about the magnitude of the impact of the 2018 on a somewhat linear basis, as we move through fiscal 2019 or does the magnitude stay at this kind of a level, and it's not until the program is done that it then goes away?","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","No, Mark. Mark, let me add some color and thanks for your question. The difference between 90 basis points and the 50 basis points is really \u2013 so our SubCom business had a great quarter last third quarter. It had $270 million of revenue. So that 90 basis points I referenced was really a year-over-year reference of what it did in TE's margin year-over-year. So that's what that 90 basis points is. The 50 basis points, you're right, that's the program delay impact that we've been seeing at the total company level what the impact has been. So that 90 basis points is very high volume last year, certainly, good flow through on it, just getting the volume more normalized, but the 50 basis points is correct on the program delay.","On linearity, I think when you look at it, it's going to be as the program wraps up, and that program will wrap up. And what you'll have is as that program wraps up, you'll see margin increase and work its way up back to where we expect the segment to be, and that'll be through 2019.","Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Thanks, Mark.","Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Thanks, Mark. Could we have the next question, please?","Operator","Pardon me. We'll go to the line of William Stein with SunTrust. Your line is open.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Two quick ones. First, I think you mentioned resins a moment ago. Our contacts have indicated that costs for these and maybe some other input materials have been rising. So I'm not talking about shortages of caps that would be sort of a not related to your supply chain is related to your supply chain, and I'm wondering if that's impacting margins at all and whether you're adjusting prices in response to that through the channel. Thank you.","Heath Mitts - TE Connectivity Ltd.","William, this is Heath. When we went out with our original guidance for the year, we talked some about what was embedded in our guidance and that was about $0.10 a share of pressure on our earnings relative to commodity inflation. And as you know, we have hedging programs in place and everything, so you don't see a ton of volatility up or down based on the way it kind of smooths into our cost structure.","However, your point is valid. There is some pressure out there on some of the commodities, metals and resins, and we're \u2013 its impact is \u2013 $0.10 is probably grown to closer to $0.12 as you see reflect in our results where we've got productivity programs in place and we're going after it, but there's a little bit of additional headwinds, especially as we exit the year on that. But the team is focused. We've got a world-class supply chain organization that's going after it and challenging some of those things. And where we do have more of those types of pressures that we have to realize, certainly, our commercial teams are in sync on that relative to price increases.","And you would expect price seem to stay pretty similar, but we have opportunities to raise price, especially through our distribution channel and those types of things. Those are proactively being done, some of it in context of the commodities inflation, the input side. And then, onboard, we have direct relationships. Certainly, those are fluid dialogues, but it's not lost on our customers either in terms of how we recover there and\/or sharing some of the pinch points, but we're geared up pretty well to handle these types of pieces.","And as we get closer to 2019, William, what I would say is certainly, we'll quantify that again. But you shouldn't expect us to be using this as a major excuse, because we're going to be ramping up our material sourcing programs as well to offset some of those pressures. But I appreciate the question.","Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Thank you, Will. Next question?","Operator","We'll go next to the line of Deepa Raghavan with Wells Fargo. Go ahead.","Deepa B. N. Raghavan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning.","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Hey, Deepa.","Deepa B. N. Raghavan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey. Good cost controls on the SG&A line. Just curious if those are from some of the structural changes you were targeting? Or was there something temporary this quarter, example, belt tightening just given forex headwinds, et cetera?","Heath Mitts - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Deepa, I appreciate the question. This is Heath. If you're looking at our operating expenses in general, whether that's SG&A, a component of that, or in total, certainly, we're tightening the belt. And we've talked about some of the activity that we've done to reduce structurally our SG&A. That still is in place and that will continue forward as we're looking at a lot of different opportunities and there's a high focus on that.","Having said that, I think the quarter came in a little bit lighter than what I thought. I would look at it more on a full year basis and the relative improvement that we're targeting. We've talked about taking a full 100-and-change basis points out of our operating expense structure.","Certainly, we're ahead of that in the quarter, but I'd say that when you look at a more normal \u2013 full year normalized basis, where that's still part of the journey.","Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Okay. Thank you, Deepa. Could we have the next question, please?","Operator","We'll go to line of Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Go ahead.","Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, good morning.","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Hi, Sherri.","Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Terrence, if you look at the business environment, we've been in a relatively strong business environment. And we've seen some benefits for TE in the Transportation and Industrial segments.","I guess when we think about the fourth quarter guidance, there's a bit of a deceleration in organic growth expectation. Can you maybe talk to what's driving that slight deceleration? Is it related to the business environment? Maybe some commentary on what you're seeing on demand trends and what's driving that. Thanks.","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","No, actually, Sherri, thanks for the question. Honestly, I don't see that we're seeing deceleration. I think one of the things \u2013 while our organic growth has changed, I think one of the things is SubCom also had a very strong fourth quarter last year as well as third [quarter]. You really take our organic growth without SubCom, we would have told you 9% this quarter instead of 6% and 8% in the fourth quarter versus 5%. So we will still have SubCom having a strong fourth quarter last year.","So when we look across and it goes back to my order activity, what we see is while auto production has been bouncing around 2%, the content wins that we see clearly are staying where they're at. Markets that we see continuing to have very strong momentum in addition to auto. Sensors we talked about during the call, as well as commercial aerospace, defense, medical, we really see strength in those markets. And certainly, in where we are affected by the cloud, like our data and devices, we continue to see strong momentum, and we would expect that to continue.","I think the markets we continually talk to you about, that we would say the lead, they have to get to a more normalized growth. Certainly, our industrial transportation business, our appliance business and our industrial factory automation business looks like it's getting there sort of where we are. You saw the growth this quarter, it's good.","So they're the only three that when we look at and we say, we're waiting for them to get to more normalized growth, because we are benefiting from some supply chain bump-ups. And I think as we look going forward, we expect they'll get to a more normalized growth pattern.","But net-net, I would say it's very healthy, you saw it in the book-to-bill, you saw it in our order rates being double-digit, you saw the broad based nature of it. That, it's still a very constructive economic environment, but in some of our businesses, we're not going to grow 20% a year for four years. It has to normalize.","Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Thank you, Sherri. Could we have the next question, please?","Operator","And that will come from the line of Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Go ahead, please.","Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks for taking a follow-up question. Follow-up question was on the automotive end market. Realize TE had very good results in the quarter. Some of the supply chain like Dimewar and OSRAM (50:34) have lowered their guidance. So I'm curious, did TE see any impact and was just able to overcome it? Or did you not see an impact at all?","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","No, we really didn't see an impact because of our global position, so no different than we told you throughout the year, 2% auto production. And while certain customers may have had some things they talked about, our revenue has been staying pretty steady.","And if you look at us operationally, both versus even 90 days ago, our Transportation top line is going to be pretty similar for 2018 that we told you 90 days ago. So and it's broad-based, it's broad-based across regions. So I feel very good about where we position ourselves.","Certainly, we have something that's unique with the content and where we play both into the connected car and the electric vehicle trends, not everybody in the supply base has that opportunity. So maybe they had some of those impacts. But I feel the content momentum we've had as well as our global position always gives us an opportunity to be isolated from one-off small events.","Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Thank you, Mark. Could we have the next question, please?","Operator","We'll go to Deepa Raghavan's line from Wells Fargo for a follow-up question.","Deepa B. N. Raghavan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks for the follow-up for me too. Heath, Terrence, could you slice up some of the possible forex headwinds into fiscal 2019? And is there a sensitivity we should be thinking about, so we could right-size our models just given the inflection point here? Thank you.","Heath Mitts - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Thanks, Deepa. And it's a fair question. We're obviously working it real time. If you look at the basket of currencies that we have, you've got to kind of look at when those kicked in in terms of the weakening and the strengthening dollar against that basket.","Certainly, at this point, it turns into a year-over-year headwind in our fourth quarter, which is the quarter we're sitting in today. And then, as we get into next year, it has a little bit less of a pointed impact at today's rates in our early part of fiscal 2019. And then it starts to kick in as a much more pointed headwind in the latter part of our second and third quarter.","Again, as rates get today, we're not economists, we're not trying to predict what the dollar is going to do. But we'll quantify that as part of the guidance. I would tell you though that it will be a net headwind for the full year 2019. We are not at the point to quantify that externally yet though, but \u2013 and we'll keep an eye on what the dollar does.","Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Okay. Thank you, Deepa. Could we have the next question, please?","Operator","And another follow-up question from the line of Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Go ahead.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Heath, I guess, when I look at the total restructuring initiative, I think $150 million is the number you guys have talked about. How do I think about the payback and when do you get the savings from that into your model? And very specifically, on the Industrial side, let's say revenues are flat in 2019, how much costs do you think you've taken out of the model to margins? I'm trying to figure out how much could margins go up in Industrial specifically even if you don't have revenue tailwind from the cost reduction initiatives.","Heath Mitts - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Well, Amit, good question. The dollars that you see us incurring now relative to restructuring are for things that have been announced in terms of facility consolidations largely and there's still a couple of more of those to come that you would expect to see in our fourth quarter results and into the early part of 2019.","However, just because those are announced and we reported the charge doesn't mean that the costs come out instantaneously. Those tend to be more on an operational timeline that continues to support our customers and everything else in those types of transitions. So it can be a couple of years depending upon where the facilities are. And I would tell you that we're still targeting the mid to high teens margin for the segment, similar to what we talked about at our Analyst Day, but it's going to take us a couple of years to get there.","2019 actually is quite a big year operationally for our Industrial segment as some of these announced restructuring programs and the site consolidations are being worked real time. Some of that is captured in the charge that we took, largely though that's around severance costs and so forth, there are any asset impairments. And then, there is real operational costs that are rolled through our results in 2019 relative to parallel production and then these types of things in terms of move costs.","So I wouldn't want to oversell that you're going to see another 100-basis-point improvement in 2019 in Industrial, but I do think we'll continue to push the peanut forward on that. And then, if you get into certainly 2020 when some of these sites officially go offline, you'll see a more pointed impact.","Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Okay. Thank you, Amit. I think we have one last question.","Operator","And that will come from the line of Shawn Harrison with Longbow Research. Go ahead, please.","Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC","Hi and thanks for taking the follow-up. Wanted to just get your thoughts on the M&A environment and the reason I ask is maybe two weeks ago, one of your quasi competitors paid, I think, a pretty healthy multiple, at least on a sales basis, for an industrial connector company. And so, are you seeing tuck-in M&A higher valuations out there in the market and you think this is maybe just kind of a one-off transaction?","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","No, Shawn. Thanks for the question. I think like we shared with you, what Jeanie (56:20) talked to you back in the fall, it is an expensive environment and it's been an expensive environment. I don't think that's changed. It hasn't decreased from where we've been. I think the key when you think about TE is how we've talked to you about where bolt-ons play in and where we \u2013 they kind of add strategic value. And I think our strategy is very \u2013 has stayed consistent as well as how do we make sure that we get return for our owners from ROIC over time.","So net-net, I would say the environment still is frothy. And I think we're staying disciplined during that environment, because we have something I think is pretty special in the organic growth opportunities we have. So I don't feel we need to be compelled to do something like we told you on Investor Day as to how do we continue to strengthen our portfolio long-term and create value for the investors. So I think it is a balance with organic first, inorganic supporting it. And we're going to be looking at how we invest our incremental dollars or free cash flow. And like Heath and I've been talking about, we have taken it up on the organic side here this year to really make sure we get the organic opportunities which is the best return.","Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.","All right.

Welcome to the TE Connectivity First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Sujal Shah. Please go ahead.","Sujal Shah","Good morning. Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss TE Connectivity\u2019s first quarter 2017 results. With me today are Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Lynch; President, Terrence Curtin; and Chief Financial Officer, Heath Mitts.","During the course of this call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information. We ask you to review the forward-looking cautionary statements included in today\u2019s press release. In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussion this morning. We ask you to review the sections of our press release and the accompanying slide presentation that address the use of these items. The press release and related tables, along with the slide presentation, can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at te.com.","Finally, for participants on the Q&A portion of today\u2019s call, I would like to remind everyone to limit themselves to one follow-up question to make sure we are able to cover all questions during the allotted time.","Now, let me turn the call over to Tom for opening comments.","Tom Lynch","Thanks, Sujal and thanks everybody for joining us today. We had an excellent start to fiscal 2017, delivering revenue growth, margin expansion and earnings growth well above the midpoint of our guidance. Improving markets coupled with strong execution across our segments drove this performance. I will provide some highlights and context for our Q1 results and then I will turn it over to Terrence to provide more detail on our performance and outlook.","TE\u2019s strategy has been driven around three key pillars for sometime now. First, our focus on harsh environment applications, these applications demand engineering and manufacturing excellence, which provides competitive differentiation. TE stands out as a company with a broad range of harsh application knowledge and products that can provide solutions to customers anywhere in the world. Second, driving our TEOA operating system throughout the company to improve customer service and productivity and reduce our fixed cost footprint. You can see and feel the benefits across the company and through feedback we received from our customers. Third, consistently execute on our balanced capital allocation strategy, which has enabled us to make strategic acquisitions that have expanded our harsh environment portfolio, while consistently increasing dividends and buying back significant amounts of stock.","Since becoming a public company in 2007, we returned approximately $12 billion to shareholders and bought back 184 million shares. We expect to maintain our balanced capital strategy returning two-thirds of free cash flow to shareholders and using one-third for acquisitions. The cumulative effect of this strategy enabled us to grow share on the markets we serve and transform our portfolio with more growth opportunities, while consistently returning capital to our owners through a strong cash return business model. The net effect is that a $1 of revenue today drives 50% more adjusted EPS than 5 years ago.","This quarter\u2019s results reflect the benefits of this strategy. Organic sales growth was 7%, driven primarily by strong demand throughout our businesses in Asia; adjusted operating margins exceeded 17%; and adjusted EPS was $1.15, well above the midpoint of our guidance. We delivered another strong quarter of orders growth, with growth across all three segments. We continue to perform very well on harsh applications and are getting growth and profit to contributions across the portfolio.","In the Communication segment, we saw year-over-year organic growth in data and devices earlier than our expectations. This is driven by ramps of high-speed solutions at cloud infrastructure customers. I am pleased that the multiyear transformation of D&D has resulted in a refocused portfolio that will drive growth and higher profitability for the segment. We are also performing well in our acquired businesses, with a growing design win pipeline that gives us confidence for future growth.","The first quarter demonstrates the strength of our business model. For the full year, we are expecting to expand adjusted operating margins by 50 to 70 basis points on 4% organic growth, with margin expansion being driven by all of our three segments. Versus our prior view 90 days ago, we are raising our full year organic revenue outlook by 100 basis points and our adjusted EPS guidance to $4.40 at the midpoint. Currency exchange rates are expected to impact full year adjusted EPS by $0.16 versus our prior view, and this is factored into our guidance. I am pleased that we are growing adjusted EPS 11% year-over-year even with the negative impact of the stronger dollar. Terrence and Heath will go through the moving pieces in more detail as we go through the call.","Terrence, I will turn it over to you.","Terrence Curtin","Thanks, Tom and good morning everyone. Before we get into the segment results and updates that I typically go through, I want to cover our orders for the quarter, which help provide the foundation for the trends that we are seeing as well as of our expectations going forward.","If you could please turn to Slide 4, which shows our order trends, excluding our SubCom business. Demonstrating our continued momentum that started late last year, orders were up 11% year-over-year, with the book-to-bill of 1.06. And on an organic basis, orders grew 10%. We saw organic orders growth across all three of our segments in quarter one, excluding SubCom. We also saw orders growth in all regions with particular strength in Asia, which grew 26% year-over-year, with strength in China. In Europe and the Americas, orders grew approximately 3% and 1%, respectively.","In Transportation, orders increased 12% year-over-year and were up 4% sequentially as China OEMs increased production ahead of the expected expiration of government incentives at the end of the calendar year. Industrial orders grew 15% year-over-year due to the Creganna and Intercontec acquisitions and organic orders grew 4%, with growth across each of our three industrial businesses. In Communications, excluding SubCom and the sale of our Circuit Protection business last year, we saw year-over-year organic orders growth of 14%, including 7% growth in data and devices as we begin ramping high-speed connectivity that is benefiting from cloud applications as Tom mentioned.","Please turn to Slide 5 so we can discuss our results by segment and let me start with Transportation. The first quarter was an excellent quarter for our segment, with sales growing double-digits year-on-year and adjusted operating margins expanding 340 basis points on increased volume and productivity improvements. Segment sales exceeded the expectations due to strength in China and Korea. Our auto sales were up 13% organically in the quarter, well ahead of auto production growth of 5% due to increased content from the secular trends we talked to you about around safe, green and connected, coupled with our very strong global leadership position. Growth was led by demand from China as the expected expiration of government incentives spurred demand in the quarter. Note that these incentives are now being faced out over the course of the year, so as we look forward, we expect that vehicle production growth in China will continue to be front-end loaded in the first half of 2017.","For the full year, we expect 4% growth in vehicle production in China and 2% growth in auto production globally. While this assumption of 2% auto production growth globally is an increase from our prior view of 1%, this sell-side comes from the strength in the first half in China, with our outlook for the second half production being the same as our view 90 days ago. For the full year, we expect to continue to outpace the growth of production due to the continued benefit of content growth as well as share gains.","Turning to Commercial Transportation, our team delivered another very strong quarter against still a tough backdrop. This was outperformance versus the market, with organic revenue up 16%, driven by a very strong heavy truck market in China, content growth due to the adoption of new emission standards and regulations as well as share gains. In our sensors business, the acquisition last year of Jaquet drove 3% growth overall. The business declined slightly on an organic basis, with growth in automotive applications and industrial applications being offset by softness in the North American heavy truck applications. We are expecting organic growth for the year in sensors and continue to expect a further growth inflection as we go into 2018 as further auto applications ramp the volume. For the segment, adjusted operating margins of 22% were up 340 basis points year-over-year, with strong flow-through on a double-digit organic sales and increase of productivity improvements. When you think about the segment margin, our margin expectations remained the same for the segment and you should continue to think of steady state transportation operating margins as 20% plus or minus to 1.","Please turn to Slide 6, so I can discuss our Industrial Solutions segment, which performed in line on both the top line and on the margin side in quarter one. Industrial solutions sales grew 12% on a reported basis, driven by the Creganna and Intercontec acquisitions and generated 30 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion, despite the 80 basis points of headwind from the declines in oil and gas. If we had owned Creganna and Intercontec in the year ago period, our growth for this business would grow up at 16% year-over-year, demonstrating strong performance of these acquired businesses. Industrial Equipment, we grew 1% organically, driven by strengthening market around the factory automation area as well as growth in medical. Aerospace and defense remained strong with 4% organic growth, driven by increased content on new airframe builds as well as momentum in defense programs.","Oil and gas declined 24% as expected due to the weakened market conditions and we feel that our oil and gas business has now bottomed and expect this business to remain stable at the current level as we benefit from new programs ramping later in the year. Our energy business declined 3% organically, with growth in North America and Asia more than offset by the softness in Europe. Adjusted operating margins were in line with expectations and expanded 30 basis points year-over-year to 11.3%, which includes the oil and gas impact I mentioned earlier. Going forward, we do expect the industrial segment operating margins to expand over prior year levels in the second quarter and then further into second half throughout the segment. I would also like to note that we also included adjusted EBITDA margins on the chart show margins and margin expansion, excluding the impact from the acquisition related amortization. And you can see in the segment that the year-over-year adjusted EBITDA margins expanded 120 basis points to 16.4%.","So please turn to Slide 7, so I can talk about communications solutions. Quarter one was a solid quarter from the Communications segment, including our achievement of a key milestone in our data and devices business. D&D has returned to organic growth following 3 years of decline from product exits as we refocused the portfolio within the business. Organic growth is occurring six months sooner than we expected in the business. I would also like to highlight that we also have a very strong quarter growth in our appliances business and we saw continued operational improvements throughout the segment that I will talk more about in a little bit. Organically, sales were up 3%, with reported segment sales down 4% year-over-year, due primarily to the sale of the Circuit Protection business in March of last year. Our appliance business has very strong quarter growth, with 14% organic growth year-over-year, driven by China market growth, share gains and strength in North America. The growth in D&D is the result of new ramps at cloud customers and a completion of our multi-year journey to refocus the product portfolio in key growth applications. D&D grew 2% organically in the quarter and now we expect organic growth for the full fiscal year. In addition to the growth that we are excited about, data and devices also doubled its top earning adjusted margin from a year ago and we expect this business to be an increasing contributor to the profitability of the Communications segment going forward.","On SubCom, the business declined slightly in the first quarter as a result of program timing. Our momentum continues through this growth cycle and we continue to expect SubCom to grow approximately 5% in fiscal 2017 based upon our very strong backlog. For the Communications segment, adjusted operating margins were 13.2% for the quarter, down 70 basis points year-over-year. And if you remember, this time last year, we had a one-time benefit on our SubCom business related to an early program completion, which raised our first quarter \u201816 margin in the segment by approximately 400 basis points. If you would normalize for this impact, Communications\u2019 adjusted operating margins expanded significantly in the first quarter of \u201817. And to really illustrate the progress that we have made in this segment over the past four quarters, adjusted operating margins have expanded from approximately 8% in the second quarter of last year to 13% in the quarter we just completed. And we are proud of that accomplishment.","So let me turn it over to Heath and he will cover the financials.","Heath Mitts","Thank you, Terrence and good morning everyone. Please turn to Slide 8, where I will provide more details on Q1 earnings. Adjusted operating income was $536 million, with an adjusted operating margin of 17.5%, driven by strong organic growth of 7%, productivity improvements and favorable mix. GAAP operating income was $486 million and included $47 million of restructuring charges and $3 million of acquisition related charges. For the full year, we expect restructuring charges of approximately $150 million, driven by footprint consolidations from recent acquisitions and structural improvements. GAAP EPS was $1.13 for the quarter. Adjusted EPS was a new record for the first quarter at $1.15, it was up 37% year-on-year and significantly above our guidance range set 90 days ago.","Additional demand from China and productivity improvements drove the performance above our guidance to midpoint of $1. The 37% growth above prior year is driven by all of the levers we have in our business model. We benefited from volume fall through, on increased sales, acquisitions support, share buyback and a lower adjusted effective tax rate of 19.2%. Versus our guidance view of Q1, the currency exchange headwind was greater than expectations at $45 million of revenue and $0.02 of EPS. As a point of reference, our guidance is simply the dollar to euro conversion of 1.10 and the dollar strength has significantly hits the euro and it gets most major currencies in the quarter. For the full year, we are expecting currency exchange rates to unfavorably impact revenue and adjusted EPS by $300 million and $0.16, respectively versus prior guidance. I continue to expect full year adjusted effective tax rate of 20% for fiscal 2017, which is higher than the ETR last year. While nothing has changed in our tax rate assumptions, I want to point out that year-over-year, we get an EPS benefit in the first half of fiscal \u201817 and have an EPS headwind in the second half of fiscal \u201817. Remember that our third quarter of 2016 and fourth quarter of 2016 tax rates were 17% and 13%, respectively. With our 20% tax rate assumption this year, we expect to see year-over-year EPS headwind in the second half of approximately $0.13 due to the difference in our tax rates. This is not a change versus our guidance from 90 days ago, but I wanted to provide some color on the timing. Page 16 of our slide deck contains a bridge that provide the details for the first half and second half.","Please turn to Slide 9. As Tom mentioned in his opening remarks, our solid results reflect the impact of our transition to a higher margin, harsh environment portfolio, our focus on TEOA and our capital strategies. Our business is generating higher operating leverage as a result of the strategy and each dollar of sales generates 50% more adjusted EPS today than it did 5 years ago. Adjusted gross margin in the quarter was 34.8%, a 140 basis point improvement from prior year, driven by volume fall-through on increased volumes, productivity improvements, favorable mix and savings from portfolio actions with D&D.","As noted earlier, adjusted operating margins were 17.5% in the quarter, up 180 basis points year-over-year. In the past, we have discussed how our business model outlines that TE can generate 50 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion on organic growth of 5% to 7%. However, with the transformation of the portfolio and continued successful execution of our TEOA initiatives, we believe that we could generate 50 to 70 basis points of adjusted margin expansion in 2017 on 4% organic growth, which demonstrates our strong organic model. We will also increasingly discuss adjusted EBITDA at the segment level to help explain the cash earnings of our businesses as it exclude the impact of amortization from acquisitions.","For TE, adjusted EBITDA margins in Q1 were strong at 22.7% and up 190 basis points year-on-year. To show the progress that we have made, adjusted EBITDA margins are up over 500 basis points from 5 years ago. Cash from continuing operations was $404 million and free cash flow was $218 million in the quarter. We returned $234 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in the quarter. Looking ahead, we continue to expect free cash flow to approximate net income, capital expenditures to be approximately 5% of sales. We remain committed to our disciplined long-term capital strategy of a balanced return on free cash flow to shareholders, while still having ample free cash flow for acquisitions. As a point of reference, we have increased the dividend per share by approximately 300% since becoming a public company. Our balance sheet is strong, with reasonable debt levels and then the ability to continue to support the return on capital and acquisitions going forward. We have added a balance sheet and cash flow summary in the appendix for additional details.","Now, with that, I will turn it back to Terrence.","Terrence Curtin","Thanks, Heath. So now, I will get into our guidance for the second quarter as well as for the full year of 2017. So, if you could please turn to Slide 10 and I will follow up with the quarter two outlook. We expect second quarter revenue of $3.025 billion to $3.125 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $1.05 to $1.09, representing sales growth of 4% on both the recorded and on an organic basis and 19% EPS growth at the midpoint. This guidance does include the impact of a stronger dollar, which we expect to be a $60 million headwind to sales and a $0.03 headwind to EPS on a year-over-year basis.","Following two consecutive quarters of record adjusted earnings per share and strong orders in the first quarter, we expect our second quarter adjusted EPS to also be a quarterly record and our guidance represents a strong first half of fiscal 2017. By segment, we expect Transportation Solutions to grow mid single-digits organically and low single-digits on a recorded basis due to the impact of the dollar. This is above expected auto production growth levels of 2% in the second quarter, where exact growth will be driven by Asia and in Europe. Commercial transportation growth is expected to be driven by China. In industrial solutions, we expect to grow mid-teens overall through the Creganna and Intercontec acquisitions and we will be up low single-digits organically. And in communications, we expect mid single-digit organic growth, with growth in all three of our businesses.","Now if you can turn to Slide 11 and let me cover full year guidance. Relative to our prior view 90 days ago, we are raising our organic growth expectations for 2017 by 100 basis points and raising the midpoint of our adjusted EPS guidance, with better operational performance more than offsetting the headwinds from the strengthening dollar that Heath highlighted. While we are raising our guidance for the full year, we are maintaining our previous view of the second half by keeping our second half organic growth expectations consistent with our view, 90 days ago. I believe this is prudent given the uncertainty in the macro environment. And when you look at the implied trends for first half to second half, please keep in mind the impact of the stronger dollar and the tax dynamics that Heath mentioned earlier and we have some slide details in the back of slide material for your reference.","For the full year, we expect revenue in the range of $12.2 billion to $12.6 billion and adjusted EPS of $4.30 a share to $4.50 a share. This represents 3% reported growth, 4% organic growth on the top line and 11% adjusted EPS growth at the midpoint versus 52 weeks of fiscal 2016. Relative to our prior view of revenue guidance, reported revenue growth is down 200 basis points due to the $300 million impact from the currency exchange rates. Our organic growth is up 100 basis points, reflecting improvement in the transportation and communication segments. We are raising the midpoint of adjusted EPS from $4.34 to $4.40, which in essence, includes a $0.22 increase due to operational improvements and better performance from our acquisitions. Then this is offset by $0.16 of headwind from the stronger dollar. So really, highlighting the strong business model Heath and Tom talked about.","I do feel very good about our ability to drive 4% organic growth, expand the operating margins by 50 to 70 basis points and generate double-digit adjusted EPS growth in this uncertain macro environment. This is an improvement and demonstrates as the portfolio is delivering, while we continue to benefit from the secular trend of content growth across our businesses. While much of our operating margin expansion in the past few years have been driven by our transportation segment, I am pleased that in 2017 our operating margin expansion will be driven by all three segments, with more contribution from communications and industrial. So before the full year guidance and thinking through the segments, we expect transportation solutions to be up mid single-digits organically, on 2% auto production growth reflecting content growth trends and share gains. We also expect commercial transportation to outperform its end market again this year, benefiting from content expansion in the heavy truck market. And we expect sensors to grow mid single-digits in total year-over-year.","Industrial Solutions\u2019 organic growth guidance is not changing from 90 days ago and we continue to expect growth to be up low single-digits organically, with continued gains in commercial aerospace and defense as well as medical. Communications is expected to be up mid single-digits organically, an increase versus our prior year view due to the strength in appliances and data and devices. And as I mentioned earlier, we\u2019ve hit a milestone of improved performance in the D&D business. Progress and growth and profitability is ahead of our prior expectations. We now expect organic growth for D&D in fiscal 2017 in the low single-digits and momentum in SubCom remains strong. And we continue to expect growth in the mid single-digits for the year in SubCom.","Before I turn it back to Tom for closing comments, I do want to highlight that this is Tom\u2019s last earnings call as our CEO, after doing about 40 of these earnings calls with you all. And I do want to say on behalf of the leadership team as well as our 70,000 employees I want to publicly thank Tom for his leadership over the past 10 years.","So with that, Tom I will turn it back over to you for closing comments.","Tom Lynch","Thanks, Terrence. I appreciate that. Well, to sum things up, this was a great quarter and positions TE for another very good year of performance. Our portfolio is focused on the right markets and we are the leader in the vast majority of these markets. We are consistently improving our customer satisfaction growing margins and earnings per share and returning capital to shareholders. Most importantly though we have a strong passionate organization across the globe that really is dedicated to providing our customers with an extraordinary experience. It\u2019s making a difference.","Our customers have given us the feedback. They have given us more opportunity and it\u2019s definitely showing up in the financials. As this will be as Terrence mentioned, my last earnings call, hard to believe, where does the time go, I also want to take a moment to thank all of our investors and the analysts who have covered us. I really have enjoyed our relationship over the past 10 plus years. And it\u2019s been very rich. And most importantly, I want to thank the entire TE team for the greatest experience of my career. It\u2019s hard to imagine that you could be this fortunate to work with a team like this for this long. In March, Terrence will succeed me as CEO in a very well-planned transition. Terrence is uniquely positioned to take TE to the next level of performance and I really \u2013 I just couldn\u2019t feel any better about this succession. I am really \u2013 we worked together for \u2013 since the beginning. He has been a driving force in building this company and he has a clear vision, for taken in a really strong team to work with, to go there. So I will miss it, for sure, but it is the right time to turn it over to this team. So with that, let\u2019s open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Okay. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Wamsi Mohan","Yes. Thank you good morning. Tom, good luck. It\u2019s been a pleasure and hey, you are handling all the ratings here on a high note with all-time margin highs. So for my question, you had really strong auto revenue performance relative to production growth in the quarter reflecting some really strong content growth, I was wondering if you could share some color around this content growth where that was strongest regionally and some other drivers that supported it, any color around that. And it looks like when I look at your full year guide for the Auto segment revenues relative to production, it looks like that relative growth delta sort of slows down for the course of the year, so is that just conservatism or what are the dynamics that you are seeing there and I have a follow-up?","Terrence Curtin","Yes. Wamsi, let me take that. When you look at it, the first quarter what was a very strong quarter and it was driven at Asia. We saw I think, continued trends around sort of North America being flat, but we also did have growth in Europe. When you think through the content, it\u2019s broad based. It is not one application and I think really when it comes to the perfect content and the share gains, it represents our strong global position that we have throughout automotive. I think when you look at the year, like I said in the guidance, we did expect automotive in the second half of the year production to slowdown versus the first half. We kept that the same. We still feel when you get to the second half, while production globally, we assume to be relatively flat. We are going to still drive mid single-digit organic growth, improve that organic content and growth story. So it\u2019s just one of the elements of how production is with the strong Asia part in the first half, a lot of it is driven by China. But the content along all the trends we have, whether it\u2019s electronification of the car, how the car gets more connected or around the green side of the car, how emissions and electronics get put them on. So it isn\u2019t one specific area, it\u2019s really the combination of all the trends we talked to you about.","Wamsi Mohan","Okay, great. Thanks for that color Terrance. And as my follow-up, any early thoughts here on the potential impact from the border adjusted tax or more broadly maybe you can just talk about your manufacturing footprint today and how that might possibly change under different scenarios that might play out here with the new administration? Thanks.","Terrence Curtin","Hey Wamsi, it\u2019s Terrence again. So as you know, we produce where our customers consume. So when you look at our footprint and a lot of the work that we have done to get our capacity to the right part that Tom and Heath talked about in their prepared comments, we feel very good about where our footprint is aligned with where our customers are. So we are fairly balanced when it comes to that element. How the border tax comes out, I think we all have to sit there and wait to see how that does. When we sit there today, we like where we are positioned manufacturing wise and we will keep you all updated. Clearly, on things and tax related to repatriation, being a Swiss company, that doesn\u2019t really impact us positively or negatively. So from that viewpoint when we look at the guidance we gave you, it\u2019s pretty much a steady-state guidance as we think about it.","Wamsi Mohan","Okay, great. Thanks a lot Terrance and good luck guys, great results.","Tom Lynch","Thanks Wamsi.","Terrence Curtin","Thanks Wamsi.","Sujal Shah","Could we have the next question please?","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Craig Hettenbach","Yes. Thanks. First question, I just wanted to touch on kind of the content near-term environment, as you said you may be taking a hopefully conservative approach to the back half of the year and not flowing this through, but just I feel like we have been here in the last few years a couple of times where there has been some glimmers of expansion and it kind of fades, so anything different you are seeing from customers or any types of inflections, design-ins, things like that, that you kind of compare and contrast where we are today versus the last few years?","Terrence Curtin","What I would say Craig, I think there is a couple of things. One of the things, if you look to the quarter, it\u2019s very broad based across all our businesses. And that\u2019s something you haven\u2019t seen in a while. I would also say both through our direct customer relationships, I would also say our channel partners you will see some confidence in some of their activity. The other thing that I would say is \u2013 it is across \u2013 all orders grew in all three regions. So there is to your view, some glimmer of I think it shows the background around our markets, but I would also say there is still uncertainty in the macro when you deal with things like the currency rates that while we have capped our back half the way it is from where we guided. So when we sit there, I do think you are going to continue to see improvement. Clearly, you are going to see improvement in our Industrial and Communications segment as we go through the year. I think the order trends for some of the comments we made show very strong trends that we are excited about. And then also the element around D&D growth. That\u2019s not a headwind thereafter. We did a lot of pruning to get that business focused on applications where we thought we could get paid for the great engineering and serve our customers for that we do. So I do think there are some positive glimmers of momentum not only in the business, but in the markets we serve. So, I do think it feels a little different from the backdrop than it was a year ago or even during certain times last year.","Craig Hettenbach","Got it. Thanks for the color there. And then just as a follow-up, I know the company is highlighted from an integrated product perspective the opportunity in transmission applications, just wanted to get an update kind of where you are there. And then really even beyond that, are there other types of applications within autos where you see the potential for some integrated products?","Terrence Curtin","Absolutely, certainly when you think about integrated products and where we bring [ph] sort of giving much more than just an interconnect product, but other technologies like sensors and sometimes even some of our cable technology on the material side, it does go broader than transmission. I know we use the transmission example as one to bring it to life, but it is then brake applications. It is then track applications. It\u2019s throughout the auto, is where we get those. So it is much broader than that and probably what we should do is break some of those and there is the life as we talk to investors. I know we have been talking a lot about the transmission example. But Craig, I think the important point is, when you see the content growth that we are driving above production like we did in the first quarter and what we guided for the year in auto, it shows integrated solutions that help drive that content up. That\u2019s why we have confidence that over time, what we do around $60 today, over the next 5 years, we can take up to that $80 range, not only from the trends that we benefit from, but also bringing those integrated solutions to our customers and we become more important to them and serve to many where they are in the world.","Craig Hettenbach","Okay. Thanks.","Tom Lynch","Thanks Craig.","Sujal Shah","Thanks Craig. Could we have next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Amit Daryanani","Thanks. I have two as well, but first, congratulations and best of luck Tom, on your next chapter.","Tom Lynch","Thanks Amit.","Amit Daryanani","I guess just start to with on transportation side Terrence, could you just quantify \u2013 did you say 20% off margins plus or minus 100 or 22% for the rest of the year. And within that, just what sort of headwind do you think you have in transportation right now, from Sensor segment margins being below the transportation averages and if you could quantify clarify that part for us?","Terrence Curtin","Sure my comment was 20% Amit, plus or minus 1%. So I appreciate you being aggressive. Well and on the sensors, sensors actually \u2013 we all know that, that\u2019s running single-digit as we continue to invest ahead of the range that we have ahead of us that will begin in 2018. So we do think that, that will be a lever over time as those programs ramp, but we saw a significant investment in those programs. So as we talk to you, we do think that app will get up to mid-teens EBITDA over time, but we are going to make investments and plan to ramp this programs and we are from a margin perspective, investing ahead. So I do think that\u2019s something that we will have a little bit more of detail on it, but it will help the transportation margins over time.","Amit Daryanani","Got it. Eventually, it will be 22% plus or minus 100, just not right now. I guess maybe a follow-up, if I look at your full year guide, right, either on the op margin expansion that you guys are talking about, or really the EPS growth, it all seems very first half heavy to me, the back half margin, I think implied flat EPS probably down I think in the back half and again, the tax rate adjustment is a big factor there. But I guess just talking about given the strength you are seeing in end demand, auto book is really good, your book-to-bill is really strong, it doesn\u2019t seem like you are extending this positivity into the back half of the year. What holds you back and what refrains you from doing that right now?","Heath Mitts","This is Heath. I think we are taking a prudent view of the back half of the year, just with the \u2013 certainly we are benefiting the first half from some very strong Asia auto, but the broadening strength across the portfolio is encouraging. And we will continue to update you as we move along throughout the year. I would say we just want to make sure that people well understand the second half impact of the higher sub tax rate relative to some lower tax rates we had in prior year in the second half. And then the FX \u2013 the anticipated FX headwind is more significant in the back half. So from those will impact, how we think about is year-over-year second half EPS, from a margin perspective, we admittedly, the 17.5% is everything pointing in the right direction for mix and everything else in the quarter and we are taking a prudent view as we look through the back half of the year. But there is nothing that I say artificially inflates that 17.5% and nor do we expect something that comes in, that is significantly unfavorable other than just the operating activities in the back half of the year.","Amit Daryanani","Perfect. Thanks a lot and congratulations on a nice win guys.","Tom Lynch","Thank you.","Heath Mitts","Thanks.","Sujal Shah","Could we have the next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Suva from Citi. Please go ahead.","Jim Suva","Thank you very much. Many of the questions and comments before this were focused on the auto sector and transportation, which is rightfully so. So, I think my follow-up questions I will ask on the other segments. And that is two questions I will ask them at the same time. First on industrial, we do note that oil prices are up year-over-year. So, one would hope that maybe that would help out with, say, the industrial segment some, is that starting to kick in or maybe I am off on what the key performance leading indicators are that you are looking at or how should we think about that? And especially with the new Presidential Trump administration signing in things like Keystone products, EPA changes and things like that, how should we think about it? And then my follow-up question is on the SubCom business, you mentioned last year you\u2019ve got a benefit of course, but your guidance on SubCom looks a bit different than say some of the other customers and competitors who are seeing extremely strong SubCom pipelines. And I was just kind of curious about what you are seeing on the SubCom side? Thank you.","Terrence Curtin","Sure, Jim. Let me take both of those. So let\u2019s start with oil and gas. Number one is when you look at our oil and gas business, we basically are seeing stabilization. And that stabilization, we are happy to see certainly we hope upside comps as oil moves, but right now, I would say as we see it from the programs we are exposed to is much more around stabilization than I would say any ramp up. The other element that I would say when you think about our oil and gas business, it is very much around oceanic oil. So pipelines, land-based, we are not strong in that. So on that, it is important to understand this is really around offshore oil and gas and the indicators around that are really offshore rigs. So where we see things right now is it\u2019s still stable in our guidance, and hopefully, we get some benefit from some of the things that President Trump is talking about that those kick in and help them back to get us little bit more upside in industrial. But that\u2019s not assumed right now. On SubCom, we feel very good about where we are at. Similar really, not much has changed since the last quarter. Our guidance for the year is to be up 5% that will put us well over $900 million in revenue. Our backlog, we are booked for the \u2013 so really when we look at the programs that we win throughout this year, it\u2019s really around 2018. So, 2017 is very locked and loaded. Our team is working very hard to execute to the backlog with where we are from an execution perspective and really program \u2013 it\u2019s a pipeline of programs that we are quoting and trying to win, it\u2019s still very active. So we still think we are in a growth phase, but I would just say, right now, the 5% that we talked about last quarter being up year-over-year, even though we were down a little bit due to timing in the first quarter, we feel right in front of us and it\u2019s really around execution for us this year. So clearly, benefit from cloud applications, not only in SubCom, you\u2019ve heard it in D&D, where we have also had that benefit. The hyperscale customers and we are getting benefits in both the segments from them.","Jim Suva","Okay, thank you for your details. Much appreciate it.","Terrence Curtin","Thank you, Jim.","Tom Lynch","Thanks, Jim.","Sujal Shah","Could we have the next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Shawn Harrison from Longbow Research. Please go ahead.","Shawn Harrison","Hi, good morning. I wanted to just, I guess, get the earlier recovery within data and devices and maybe just kind of what brought about the earlier recovery? Did the winds ran faster? And maybe just what could be the growth rate within that business going forward since we really don\u2019t have a comp for the past couple of years given that the pruning in the business sales and everything else?","Tom Lynch","Sure, Shawn. If you look at it, it really comes down to penetration on high-speed applications and with the growth on how they are ramping with some of the cloud infrastructure providers and hyperscale customers. So really when you look at it, those customers are probably about 20% of our data and device businesses today. We have been focused on it. And the adoption that we are seeing and the ramps that they have done have been a little bit quicker than we expected. So, I think the momentum that you have been waiting for and we have been waiting for, we are very pleased at 6 months ahead and it actually shows the design wins and the execution momentum we are getting in the business, again, to drive growth. 90 days ago, we told you we were probably going to be flat in data and devices for the year organically and with growth in the second half. We closed 200 basis points here. We do think it will be in the low single-digit for the year, but I think you are going to get growth throughout the year. And I think the real thing about you should assume right now is that we believe this business can be a low single-digit organic grower right now and it\u2019s really going to be as we continue to build our product focus there, how much higher can we take it. And I would still say, what\u2019s great is we are at that inflection point that we have been waiting for and it\u2019s a real testament for the team getting that momentum sooner and certainly been focused on the customer\u2019s organization. So clearly pleased with where we are with it, because it\u2019s also focused on the right customers and getting wins with the right customers, everywhere in the world.","Shawn Harrison","That\u2019s helpful, Terrence. And then a follow for Heath, if I may. I think the restructuring charge for the year may have went up a bit, maybe I am wrong, but I was hoping you could actually speak now that you have been there for more than a few \u2013 a month or so, for I think the last \u2013 with the last call. Just the kind of maybe some opportunities in terms of just maybe leaning out the organization and how you are going to approach M&A going forward, maybe some \u2013 are there opportunities like Intercontec that are out there in the TE kind of funnel that we could see close during the year? So if you could just touch on those topics? That would be great.","Terrence Curtin","Sure. Well, a couple of different angles there. We did inch up the restructuring comments from 90 days ago and largely there is not one item on there that drives it. There is a list of several things, particularly around some footprint consolidation that continues to go on, or deals for acquisitions that have been completed over the last few years. And marginally, that\u2019s facility consolidation. And then there are some structural things that we look at and we will continue to be ongoing, I\u2019d say for this year and probably into the early part of next year, just in terms of how organized and the layers within the company. So more to come on that, but I think we are sharpening our pencils certainly. Not all $150 million of that restructuring would be cash charges. There is some things in there that are non-cash that we will talk about later in the year. So, more to come on that, but in the M&A side, certainly we are active. Intercontec has been a great performance out of the gate. We are also very pleased with the performance on the medical side, Creganna \u2013 well, both of those are well ahead of the deal model expectations and are executed very well. And Creganna, we will anniversary here little bit late this quarter, in terms of the fresh full year on our portfolio. The Medical space has continued to have legs to it. And so looking at things along that, maybe not the same size necessarily of ground type transaction, those things are a little bit closer to the Intercontec size or something, plus or minus in that range that have good margins and where we can get to a return on invested capital may be a little quicker than historically we have, so lots of opportunity out there, but we will be choosy and spend the shareholders\u2019 dollar wisely.","Shawn Harrison","Right, that\u2019s grateful and congrats on the quarter and Tom thanks for all the help. I appreciate it.","Tom Lynch","You are very welcome. Thank you.","Sujal Shah","Could we have the next question?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of William Stein from SunTrust. Please go ahead.","William Stein","Great. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats to everyone on the roles, especially Tom, you have really transformed this thing from the old Tyco.","Tom Lynch","Thank you.","William Stein","But I did have a question on the sensor demand, it sounds like you are lowering that outlook modestly, we have thought that this would be sort of an accelerating market for content share and integration, can you offer us a little bit more detail on how that market is progressing for you now, how you expect it to perform over the next several quarters?","Terrence Curtin","Yes. A couple of things, well, thanks for the question. Our expectations around sensors has not changed for the New Year. Overall, we expect growth to be mid single-digit. The only change we would have to be due to FX, so our expectation has not changed versus where we were. I think when you look at it, certainly, we did get impacted in our sensors business by the same thing that impacted our industrial business since we bought Measurement. And Measurement was very much focused on industrial applications. So as there was the industrial recession going on that impacted our Industrial segment, it did also impact the Measurement asset, then the growth was a little bit slower. What we really get excited about was when we bought Measurement, we basically signed up to scale that and use our go-to-market and take that great Measurement technology into different markets like automotive and to places like industrial transportation. And really, those program wins and that momentum there is very strong, that program pipeline is strong. But as you know, those programs don\u2019t \u2013 one of the day and ship them in three months, they are programs that we have been building out past couple of years. And really you are going to see the growth of that, really in 2018 as when we are going to start having some of our launches. That\u2019s why we are investing ahead in sensors and part of those programs. And in some cases, that they are integrated products. They are not just the sensor element, they are things that also have additional things on them. So we feel very good that we are leveraging our go-to-market to get those wins. Certainly, you are not seeing them in the numbers yet. And 2018 is when you are going to start to see those come through with revenue and going to be excited to show it to you in \u201918 and shows you normalcy in 2017, is not just where the program ramps are.","William Stein","It is actually really good color and my follow-up related to that is pretty brief. Those gains that you are ramping now in terms of the design wins, where we will see revenue in \u201818, would you expect those to wind up coming at the expense of another company already in that space or are these brand-new applications and I assume it\u2019s mostly in automotive?","Terrence Curtin","Yes. They are a big chunk order in automotive and they are among many technologies. So there you amended either temperature, the pressure, they are among many different technologies and in the sensor space the fragmentation around the sensor space, really make to that, you compete against different people not one competitor. So what\u2019s really great about the programs we have won is they are among varying technologies, they are at different regions of the world, which really shows the strength of our go-to-market and then it also comes out some of that business case that when we bought Measurement to get these technologies, how do we leverage our go-to-market in places where we have very exceptional leadership positions like our Transportation segment, we are leveraging. So we will continue to share those as they ramp, but 2018 will be the year where you will start seeing it in the numbers versus just from our works.","William Stein","Thanks and congrats again on the great print.","Tom Lynch","Thanks Will","Sujal Shah","Thank you. Could we have the next question?","Operator","Your next question comes on the line of Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Mark Delaney","Yes. Good morning. Thanks so much for taking the questions. Congratulations on good results and Tom, let me add my best wishes for you going forward.","Tom Lynch","Thanks Mark.","Mark Delaney","The first question is just specifically on Asian auto, there is talk about some potential slowdown there on the call and if we strip out the FX impact, your 4.40 becomes 4.56 for full year guide and you guys were on a 4.60 run rate, so it seems even excluding FX, there is some slowdown baked into the business as we go through the year, is there anything you are actually seeing in the Asian automotive business that\u2019s starting to slowdown either in terms of orders or customer conversations or is that just you are doing your best to forecast the potential change there for the back half?","Terrence Curtin","When you look at it Mark, similar to last quarter, we knew there is this China incentives that was ending at the end of the first quarter. We expected a slide in China demand that the incentive is sort of phased out throughout the year. We do expect production to still stay strong into the second quarter, but there is still is an element of when you have incentives, this is pull forward demand. And so when we look at it and talking to our customers, they have told us things back to production to moderate in the second half versus a very strong level we are going to have in the first quarter and continue a little bit in the second quarter. So it\u2019s not really different that while we pull forward, just we are getting a little bit decreased production due to the incentive being phased out. So when we look at the second half, the second half is identical to where we were 90 days ago and if there is more incentives around China, I would expect we would benefit from it, but they are not there yet. And we are really aligned with our customers. So like we said, we expect auto production in our third and fourth quarter to be relatively flat, globally. But we expect organic growth in our automotive business, even in a flat environment due to our content and share gains. So when you look at that year-on-year, we do expect growth in transportation in a flat backdrop production months right now.","Mark Delaney","That\u2019s helpful. Follow-up question is on margin and the gross margin in particular came in very nicely at 34.8, I think it\u2019s all-time high, certainly more than I was looking for, I think it was something unusual in there, but there is guidance it seems assumes margin to moderate as we go through the year, can you just tell us specifically, how should we think about the gross margin line and what sort of factors help to get to that 34.8 and why should we expect it to come down as we move through the year on the margin level?","Heath Mitts","Mark, I think it\u2019s similar to the same answer that I provided earlier on the overall operating margin. I think in the quarter certainly, we benefited from the volumes being higher than I think would be certainly guided earlier. And then we also invested favorable mix in the quarter in terms of just geographically where things were delivered. So I don\u2019t think we are looking at a significant drop in gross margins, but you could be with that a point or so.","Mark Delaney","That\u2019s helpful. Thank you very much.","Sujal Shah","Thank you, Mark. Could we have the next question?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Fox from Cross Research. Please go ahead.","Steve Fox","Thanks. Good morning. First of all Tom, not to date myself too much, but if I think back to what you were handed when you took the job, I never would have thought you would have been this successful with the business, but congratulations.","Tom Lynch","Thank you very much.","Steve Fox","Every thing you did, surely one of the better managing jobs I have ever seen. So in terms of just big picture question, if I could, one of the things that I noticed at the last CES I attended in January, was that a lot of the Tier 1 OEMs are sort of moving further up the stack and I am thinking the guys that also make sensors and connectors and as they do that, it seems like they are looking to put more turnkey solutions out there, integrating some of the products that you are focused on and I was curious if you think that, that\u2019s either a competitive threat, maybe pressure to margins or how you would deal with that in your own roadmap, going forward and I know that\u2019s a longer term question, but I was just curious what you thought? Thanks.","Terrence Curtin","Tom, do you want to start with that and I will jump in then?","Tom Lynch","No, I think you should take this Terrence, go ahead.","Terrence Curtin","Alright. Now, when you look at it clearly, we view that as an opportunity. When you get into any integration and one of the things that\u2019s great about the business that we have always had is we benefit from electronics trends, but we also get integrated out due to electronic trends. Connectors can be integrated out by semiconductors and so forth, but because there are more electronics happening, it also creates in that content opportunity. I think when we look at it Steve, it\u2019s really around it creates more opportunity because of the abilities we have and the value we provide to our customers. So why as we said there it\u2019s why we get excited about our content in auto being able to grow from the 60 to 80 that we talked about, because what sensors brings to it, how we integrate these things in, I mean we probably aren\u2019t to a turnkey level, but you describe how I think about it, but that integration we provide to allow some way to get to a turnkey level is very important. And that drives the content growth opportunity and the stickiness we have with our customers and our engineers basically create so much more opportunities. So we knew that\u2019s a net-net opportunity. We don\u2019t view its displacement, because we are very close to the architecture of the vehicle and what we do. And that is a very important factor as people continue to evolve the architecture. The world that we play in partnering with BOEs and the Tier 1s, both of them are our customers is really what we get excited about why I am so buoyant on the content opportunity. So it\u2019s all plus.","Steve Fox","That\u2019s helpful Terrance. And then just a quick follow-up to that, I guess as it applies to acquisitions, would you envision acquisitions still being focused on sort of discrete sensor and connector technologies or are there other materials and integration skills that you may add through deals?","Terrence Curtin","I think when you look at it, I think you can always think that we have always a priority towards the components side, but even when you do take Creganna, that is doing more than just a component. So I think you will see things over time of that can add integration like skills. But I think it will be a balance of both and it will be how does it tie into our strategies in different markets. I think you have seen move into that with Creganna, but we had more the component they had much more a full assembly and integration capability that we had and that\u2019s one of the things we get excited about the close of our customers and medical wanted that. And we would bring it organically alone. So I think you will see a little bit of a different answer in different markets, but I think you expect a little bit above from us.","Steve Fox","Great. Thank you very much.","Terrence Curtin","Thanks Steve.","Sujal Shah","Thanks Steve. Could we have the next question?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Sheerin from Stifel. Please go ahead.","Alvin Park","Yes. Hi, this is Alvin Park speaking on behalf of Matt Sheerin. First of all, Tom, congratulations and wish you the best of luck.","Tom Lynch","Thanks very much.","Alvin Park","Yes. Just one in terms of commodity pricing, prices have been increasing particularly for copper, so could you have some insight into how that might affect gross margins going forward for the rest of the year and if you will be able to pass those costs along to the customers?","Terrence Curtin","Well, as we think about fiscal \u201817, we do not anticipate a material impact from that, but that\u2019s largely because of our hedging programs that we have in place that protect us in the near-term. We will honestly monitor that as we go forward more thinking about the impact in 2018 and how we want to handle that from both the hedging as well as how we incorporate that into our cost pricing structure. But for \u201817, at this point, there is enough balance back and forth in terms of where we are seeing the different commodities move as well as where we have our programs in place, that we don\u2019t anticipate\u2026","Alvin Park","I see and another quick follow-up. On D&D, you talked about cloud infrastructure and I think in the previous question you mentioned the cloud infrastructure opportunity represents roughly 20% of D&D, I think you mentioned hyper conversion and the likes, but could you give us some more color and details in terms of what penetration \u2013 what areas of penetration and what opportunities you look to see going forward?","Terrence Curtin","When we look at it, we very much have focused portfolio around [indiscernible] applications. So went back 5 years ago, we would have talked to you about consumer electronics, devices and it\u2019s very much as we have gone through our journey there to reposition. It\u2019s been very much around high speed applications. And the great product for us we have around that which also includes miniaturization, but high speed de-coupled together. So when we sit there, it is really around the hyper scale providers certainly the big four and the people that also help them build out the cloud. So that\u2019s the one that we have been penetrating very well. We are very pleased with that they are 20% of our D&D business today. And that\u2019s going to be the area we continue to invest in on the high-speed side.","Alvin Park","Thank you. Thank you very much.","Sujal Shah","Thanks. Could we have the next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sherri Scribner from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Sherri Scribner","Hi gentlemen. Thank you. I just want to ask the question sort of at a high level, if you think about the update that you are giving us versus 90 days ago, it sounds like there is a bigger FX headwind than originally thought due to the stronger dollar, but your organic outlook for transportation and industrial is really unchanged, maybe a bit more front end loaded, but on the communications side, it sounds like you have a bit more of a positive outlook for the full year, is that driven by sort of a reacceleration in SubCom through the year or is that driven by the better outlook in data devices, though I guess one is that sort of the right way to think about it and two, what\u2019s driving that outlook in communications?","Terrence Curtin","I think the first part of your assumption is accurate. Obviously, the strengthening dollar in the quarter versus our prior guidance has added some headwind to the year. We will quantify that at roughly at the current rates about $300 million versus our prior guidance on revenue. In terms of our outlook by segments, your comment \u2013 we are still projecting transportation to be mid single-digits, but on the higher side of mid single-digits than what we had thought 90 days ago. Industrial, right on track in terms of what our prior guidance is and you are correct on communications. We have moved that from low single-digits up to mid single-digits in terms of organic growth from Communications segment. That\u2019s largely \u2013 that increase is largely driven by appliances and D&D though. SubCom is unchanged since our last projection. We feel good about the SubCom number. It\u2019s all down to execution that\u2019s fully booked up, but the change there with the bias towards the upside is coming from the better projections out of D&D.","Sherri Scribner","Okay, great. And then can you give us some high level thoughts on what you are seeing geographically in the industrial business? Thanks.","Heath Mitts","Sure. Sherri, one of the things I mentioned was I am very pleased globally, geographically that across the \u2013 we had growth in all regions. When you look at the Industrial segment, we talked a lot about Asia with communications and transportation during our comments. We also had nice growth in industrial in Asia, for about 6% organically in Asia in the quarter. And orders drove about 18% in Asia as well, so on an organic basis. So we saw it there. We continue to see Europe in a nice position, organically sort of low single-digits. And lastly on an order side, in North America still is relatively flattish and in the industrial space for us, organically and we do expect that through the year, some of the comm air programs and medical that we will take up, but really, we see \u2013 we saw a lot of strength in Asia.","Sherri Scribner","Thank you.","Heath Mitts","You\u2019re welcome.","Terrence Curtin","Thank you, Sherri.","Sujal Shah","Thanks Sherri.

Instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Sujal Shah. Please go ahead.","Sujal Shah","","Good morning. Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss TE Connectivity's third quarter fiscal 2014 results. With me today are Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Lynch and Chief Financial Officer, Bob Hau.","During the course of this call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information. We ask you to review the forward-looking cautionary statements included in today\u2019s press release. In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussion this morning. We ask you to review the sections of our press release and the accompanying slide presentation that addresses the use of these items.","The press release and related tables along with the slide presentation can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.te.com. Finally, for participants on the Q&A portion of today's call, I would like to remind everyone to limit themselves to one follow-up question to make sure we are able to cover all questions during the allotted time.","Now, let me turn the call over to Tom for some opening comments.","Tom Lynch","","Thanks, Sujal. Good morning, everyone. I am very pleased with the results we delivered in the quarter. Sales were up 4%, despite a very weak subsea communications market. Adjusted operating margins exceeded 15%, adjusted earnings per share growth was 14% year-over-year at the high-end of our guidance range and a new record for the company. We also continued to generate strong cash flow with over $500 million of free cash flow in the third quarter.","Here are the key takeaways from today's call. Most of our key end markets have positive trends, especially in the transportation and industrial segments. The subsea market has continued to be weak, but we believe the market has bottomed and I will share some additional good news on this market with you in a minute.","We continued to generate strong performances in businesses that serve our harsh environment applications, which account for approximately 70% of our revenue. As I mentioned earlier, we continued to deliver solid financial performance with improved operating leverage and strong cash flow. The strong cash flow enables us to return significant cash to shareholders and strengthen the company through acquisitions like those recently announced.","The last point is that we are reaffirming our full-year guidance that we gave 90 days ago, despite a weaker SubCom business in Q3 and Q4.","Now, I will comment on these key takeaways in a more detail. On the market trend side, we do continue to see positive trends in the majority of markets we serve, and the combination of these trends and strong execution will result in strong financial performance this year.","During the quarter, strength in the transportation market continued and most industrial markets continued their steady improvement. Transportation solutions grew 8% organically, with sales and order growth in all major regions. Our Industrial Solutions segment grew 4% organically and our Appliances business in the Consumer Solutions segment grew by 9% organically.","Revenue in our Telecom and Enterprise businesses were largely in line with our expectations. Revenue in the Consumer Devices and SubCom businesses were slightly below expectations in the quarter.","On a regional basis, excluding SubCom, sales grew in North America, Asia and EMEA, driven by particular strength in the U.S., China and Germany.","We continue to execute very strongly in businesses that focus on harsh environment applications. As you know several years ago, we launched our strategy to increase the company's focus in the harsh environment applications. We have been increasing organic investment and have focused our acquisitions in these areas.","The strategy is paying off, as over 70% of our businesses are in these segments generating mid-to-high single-digit organic growth and above our company average margins. These solutions are highly engineered, designed in partnership with our customers and are characterized by relatively longer product cycles and higher margins.","This capability is not easily replicated and we believe that TE's ability to provide this broad range of solutions for harsh environments will remain a strong differentiator and growth driver as we move forward.","Below the top-line, our efforts on TEOA continued to drive productivity gains and operating leverage. Our gross margins have improved to the 33% to 34% range and we are now consistently generating 15% adjusted operating margins on an annual revenue run rate below $14 billion.","We also continue to generate strong cash flow with over $1 billion of free cash flow through the first nine months of the year, supporting our capital program and acquisition strategy.","Subsequent to the quarter, we closed the acquisition of the SEACON Group, which expands our business in a very attractive oil and gas market. In June, we announced the acquisition of Measurement Specialties, which establishes us as a leading supplier of sensors and connectors at nearly 40 billion to our addressable market and further increases our content in harsh applications.","Once the transaction is complete, TE will have a broad portfolio of sensors to go along with our leading portfolio of connectors. Our existing scale coupled with Measurement Specialties' product range will enable the combined companies to accelerate sensor growth as we reach many more customers.","Now let's turn to Slide 3. Revenues in the third quarter were in line with expectations and adjusted EPS of $1.00 dollar was at the high end of our guidance range and a quarterly record for the company. Free cash flow was strong at $530 million and we returned $169 million to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases.","For the full-year, as I mentioned, we are reiterating the mid-point of our revenue and EPS guidance. Expected revenue of $13.95 billion represents 5% growth versus the prior year and adjusted EPS of $3.78 represents 17% growth versus our prior year performance, a very strong year for TE.","We closed the SEACON acquisition just after the quarter and the Measurement Specialties acquisition is on track to close this calendar year.","I will now provide some detail by business within each segment in the next four slides. Unless I indicate otherwise all changes are on an organic basis, which excludes the effect of currencies, acquisitions and divestitures.","Please turn Slide 4. Transportation Solutions had another great quarter with sales of $1.585 billion, up 8% over the prior year and with orders growth of 7%.","Sales and orders grew across all regions and global auto demand continues to be solid with vehicle production of about $21.4 million units. The end market continues to be healthy and TE is performing well.","We delivered adjusted operating margins of 21% due to volume growth, product mix and productivity improvements driven by our TEOA program. Looking forward, we expect another strong quarter in Q4, with sales up high single digits and operating margin expansion versus the prior year.","Please turn to Page 5. Market demand in the Industrial Solutions segment was in line with our expectations in the third quarter. Revenues were up 4% and orders were up 2% versus the prior year. The majority of the industrial markets we serve continued to gradually improve.","Industrial equipment revenues were up 3%, driven primarily by double-digit growth in China. Our Aerospace, Defense, Oil and Gas business was up 8%, due to continued strength in commercial aviation and the oil and gas units.","Our energy business was up slightly in the quarter, with growth in the Americas and Asia Pacific regions offset by weakness in Europe. Adjusted operating margins were up 160 basis points versus the prior year as a result of increased volumes and productivity increases and I'm especially pleased with our margin improvement in this segment.","Looking forward, we expect another good quarter in Q4, with sales up mid-single digits organically and approximately 10% on an actual basis, including the SEACON acquisition. ","Please turn to Page 6. Sales in the network segment were down 8% versus the prior year, due principally to continued project delays in our SubCom business. Excluding SubCom sales were down 2% organically. SubCom weakness drove the decline in Network Solutions' operating margin in the quarter. Just to put it in perspective, our SubCom revenues were down 50% versus last year's Q3.","Telecom and Enterprise businesses were down slightly year-over-year, but in line with our expectations. Strength in fiber-optic and wireless deployments is being offset by declines in copper network investments and our DataCom business was down 5% due to continued market related weakness.","In our SubCom business, I am happy to report, we recently received down payments on two major projects. The AAE1 project, which connects Asia, Africa and Europe, was announced in April and we received the down payment on that. Then earlier this week, we announced the Hibernia project, which will connect New York and London. That's the first significant cross-Atlantic [building] building some time which is very good news. We also received the down payment there. Both of these projects will start in late Q4, which we believe marks the beginning of the upturn in this cycle. On a combined basis, these projects are worth approximately at 700 million plus over the next two to three years.","In Q4, we expect network revenues to be flat, excluding SubCom. While we will start to build very early stages of the build, we are not going to get too much impact from these projects until next year.","Please turn to Slide 7. Revenue in our Consumer Solutions business was roughly flat versus the prior year and this continues to be kind of a tale of two cities. We had another strong quarter in the Appliance business, where we have our global leadership position in operating margins run above our company average. Sales in this business were up 9% year-over-year, due to strengthening demand in the Americas and Asia.","This growth was offset by lower customer demand for mobile phone components and continued weakness. Although looks like a PC business is starting to stabilize in the consumer devices business. Adjusted operating margins in this segment expanded 120 basis points year-over-year, due to the strong performance in the appliance business.","In Q4, we expect revenues to be down slightly versus the prior year, due to continued weakness in the consumer devices portion of the business we do expect another solid growth quarter in our appliance business.","I will turn it over to, Bob, to cover the financials in more detail.","Bob Hau","Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. Let me discuss earnings which start on Slide 8. Adjusted operating income was $550 million, up 8% versus the prior year. GAAP operating income was $535 million and included $14 million of restructuring and other charges most of which was in the consumer segment and $1 million of acquisition related charges in the quarter.","We anticipate full year restructuring charges of approximately $65 million for the full year. Adjusted operating margin was 15.4%, up 60 basis points from Q3 last year. The improvement versus the prior year is driven by improved manufacturing and productivity across all of our segments and volume leverage in the transportation and industrial segments. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.00 and GAAP earnings per share were $0.97 for the quarter. GAAP EPS included $0.03 of restructuring and other charges.","Turning to Slide 9, our gross margin in the quarter was 33.6%. This is an 80-basis point increase versus the prior year, due to increased productivity from our TEOA or lean programs. The cost savings from restructuring and metals, and general volume increases offset by the impact of lower SubCom sales.","Our total operating expenses were $654 million in the quarter, which was up 5% versus the prior year. The increased resulted primarily from increased investments in sales and marketing to support growth initiatives. On the right side of the slide, you will see net interest expense was $26 million in the quarter and I expect about $26 million of expense again in the fourth quarter.","Adjusted other income was primarily relate to our tax sharing agreement was $9 million. In the fourth quarter, I expect other income of about $8 million. The adjusted effective tax rate was 21.8%, slightly better than expectations as we saw large portion of our income earned in lower tax jurisdictions. I now expect the full-year effective tax rate of approximately 23%. ","Turning to Slide 10, I will discuss our balance sheet and free cash flow. Cash from continuing operations was $501 million and our free cash flow in Q3 was $530 million. Net capital spending during the quarter was $171 million or 4.8% of sales. I expect the capital spending rate to be approximately 4.5% of sales for the full-year.","In addition, we made a $200 million tax payments related to a pre-separation tax audit during the quarter. Our working capital was in line with our expectations, with receivable days outstanding at 63 days. Inventory days on hand were 68 days and payable days outstanding were 54.","Now, let me discussed the sources and uses of cash outside of free cash flow shown on the right side of the slide. Began the quarter at $1.4 billion of cash and increased to $1.6 billion in advance with the acquisition of SEACON, which closed subsequent to the end of the quarter.","During the quarter, we returned the totaled of $169 million to shareholders. We paid dividends of $119 million and we repurchased about 1 million shares for $50 million. Outstanding debt remained at $3 billion at the quarter of the quarter.","Now, I will turn it back to Tom.","Tom Lynch","Thanks Bob. Please turn to Slide 11, and I'll cover our outlook. We expect another strong quarter in Q4, with revenue of $3.56 billion to $3.66 billion, which will be up 47% year-over-year and we expect adjusted EPS of $0.98 to $1.02, an increase of 5% to 10% over year. Again, that's covering up a very weak year-over-year performance in the SubCom business.","We do expect continued strength in transportation and industrial. For the full-year, we expect revenue of $13.9 to $14 billion, up 5% versus the prior year. We expect adjusted earnings per share of 376 the 380 and that's an increase of 16% to 18%. As I mentioned earlier, very, very strong year for the company.","We are going to open it up for questions. Then I will make some closing comments, when we are done the Q&A.","Operator, if you could open the line for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani. Please go ahead.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets","Thanks a lot. Good morning, guys. Two questions for me. One, I guess, Tom, on the networking side, the Subsea business, given the wins you had recently, I sort of come up with a $120 million, $130 million run rate that is feasible in FY'15 on a quarterly basis.","I'm curious if that's a reasonable expectation to have. Then, importantly, how do you think leverage plays out on the upside in the undersea business? Is this something that can sustain 50%, 60% conversion margins as you start to see some revenue growth?","Tom Lynch","Thanks, Amit. As you know we will give guidance for the full-year next year, so I am not really going to get into any details, but I'm very encouraged. Finally these projects which we had won and been awarded are going to come into force and when we get the down payment, that's really the proof point.","I think in the beginning, it will start slow, right, as we are ramping. It will take a couple of quarters to really get at peak efficiency, but the way I would think about it at this point is it's been a pretty significant headwind for the last couple years and it should become a tailwind next year.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets","How do we think of conversion margins, I guess, on that business, Tom, as you start to get incremental sales?","Tom Lynch","Well, again, I don't want to get too specific on that, but it will be reasonable margin conversion. The first job, as you build, as you add jobs you\u2019re your capacity, the conversion margins increase, so we are still going to be not running at capacity with the first job over the second job.","If you look at our history, it's when you have three or four jobs running. That's when you really see the margins starts to ramp up, but it should be a nice positive next year.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets","Got it. Then just secondly on the cash flow usage dynamics, the buyback pays at $60 million this quarter was a lot below the historical trends you have done for the last several years now, I am assuming you guys are busy, because of Measurement Specialties this quarter, so maybe that negated it.","Maybe just talk about why was that pace slower. Is that something you should expect to see as you go forward or should we expect that to uptick? Then maybe just touch on the $200 million payment you guys had to make for the tax separation.","Bob Hau","Yes. It's Bob. I guess both pieces. One, on the share repurchase, we did repurchase about 1 million shares in the current quarter for about $50 million. That is below what we have been running over the last several quarters and it is directly attributed to the M&A activity with measurement in particular where we had as you might suspect material non-public information, so we were blacked out of the market for essentially the vast majority of the quarter. That limited that capability.","As we indicated when we announced the Measurement Specialties' acquisition, out into the future, we don't anticipate that deal impact our go-forward plans in terms of return of capital to shareholders, maintaining the two-thirds back to shareholders over time.","In terms of the $200 million pre-separation tax payment, that was done in conjunction with the other parties Covidien is Tyco International to pay in advance the 2005-2007 tax audit that is winding up its near completion. We are waiting for the final paperwork from the IRS, so we need that payment in the third quarter to essentially stop the interest calculation on that liability.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets","Very helpful. Thanks a lot, guys.","Tom Lynch","Thanks, Amit.","Bob Hau","Thank you, Amit.","Tom Lynch","Next question please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Amitabh Passi. Please go ahead.","Amitabh Passi - UBS","Hi. Thank you. I had a question if you could help us in terms of thinking about normalized margins as we look further to 2015, so kind of piggybacking on the last question. Automotive or transportation, you are kind of running just above 21%. My question was, is there meaningful room to expand that?","The bigger question is, network solutions, how do we think about normalized margins? Can that segment get back to at least the high single digits to lower double digits over the next four to six quarters?","Tom Lynch","Sure. Thanks, Amitabh. The normalized margin, as you know, we are pleased to be at this 15% at under $14 billion run rate. I think, automotive - I think this is what I have said the last couple quarters, but plus 20% margin win with kind of normalized vehicle growth, which has been 2.5% to 3% range.","I feel confident that we will continue to generate these kinds of margins. This year we are getting a little extra benefit from the great, the really positive mix in heavy trucks both, the Deutsche acquisition and legacy TE business there, so that has given us a push. Our productivity is strong in that business, so I feel good where the margins are and the ability to sustain them.","I do expect that we will improve the Network Solutions margins. SubCom is a pretty significant negative margin in the second half and as we get these two jobs rolling that will start to turn in our, what we call the B&S unit, which is Telecom, Wireless and Enterprise, that's running in double-digit margins now. This year it will be the second year in a row that we have added 100 basis points in margin improvement there, so I do expect the Network Solutions to move back toward double-digit margins over the next year to 18 months, depending on the end demand, but we sized for that to take advantage of reasonable growth.","Amitabh Passi - UBS","Tom, just as a follow-up on the network solutions, particularly Telecom Networks and Enterprise Networks, these segments are still kind of flat on a year-over-year basis. Can you give us a sense of what you are seeing in the demand environment, perhaps by geography and how we should be thinking about growth in 2015?","Tom Lynch","Again, we are not giving any guidance yet, but this quarter we will give you specificity around the big businesses. What we are seen around the world is mix, that the project business. In this past quarter, European projects were strong in Telecom, weak in Energy.","U.S. was a little soft. I think, there is so much going on right now at the macro level in the U.S. telecom-related business that's delayed a few things, but we believe the fundamentals are there to support solid growth in the U.S. going forward.","Australia, that important job is building, despite the political uncertainty, so there is and China, as we have mentioned, we have been retreating a little bit from the China market, because a good portion of that market just isn't very attractive.","It's kind of a mixed bag. The good news is that we have a really win rate on the fiber awards, and the fiber portion of the network for the second year in a row is growing in solid double-digit. Copper is shrinking, but the good news is the copper base is getting smaller and smaller, so we think the math is the turn pretty soon where that double-digit fiber growth and more and more jobs out there is going to start to deliver this into kind of a low to mid single-digit business and there was pretty good operating leverage in the telecom portion of that business, because it's a nice margin business because of highly engineered products there.","Amitabh Passi - UBS","Okay. Thank you.","Tom Lynch","Thank you, Amitabh. Next question please?","Operator","Your next question comes from a line of Wamsi Mohan. Please go ahead.","Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Yes. Thank you. Good morning. Bob, can you bridge the [90]-basis point decline in transportation margins on a quarter-on-quarter basis? Obviously, it is still very strong versus a year ago, but any color you can share in terms of how it played out between price volume mix or was operating margin more driven by increased investments? If so, where those investments were focused? I have a follow-up.","Bob Hau","Essentially, from a sequential quarter-over-quarter, there are probably two significant drivers. The first one being the main one and it's a bit of mix of the automotive versus the industrial commercial vehicle piece, the heavy trucks. We're overweighed in the second quarter on the commercial vehicle business which has a higher operating margin.","Secondly, we are making investments in the combined transportation business and that is ramping up over time, so there is a bit more in terms of OpEx in the third quarter relative to the second quarter of this year.","Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks. Tom, can you talk a little bit about that commercial transport strength and how much longer it can persist? I think a couple quarters ago, you had noted there were pre-buys and expected that market to sort of soften, sounds like there were puts and takes by different regions, but you are still tracking pretty strongly, so just wondering is there something that is driving more persistent strength in that business over the next few quarters as well?","To touch on Consumer Devices really quick, that was weaker. Sounds like even next quarter you are not really expecting that to recover. There are some significant consumer product ramps that are happening as we speak, so are you not levered to that? How do you feel about your position in that market longer term? Thanks.","Tom Lynch","Sure. The commercial business for the next quarter, it looks, and we will talk again next quarter about what we see in '15. It has been a little bit stronger than we had expected throughout the year. I think you are seeing the pent-up demand in heavy trucks in the U.S. and China and a little bit in Europe, just starting.","I think, there's still a fair amount of momentum in the market, because the new China emissions standards don't cut over really until January, so there's a pre-buy, but most of is going to be the post-buy. As we are across all of our businesses, the China businesses is strong again, so if that continues there's strong activity which will require continued investment in heavy trucks and we will see the shift away from the local that we are beginning to see from the local truck manufacturers, so there are more multi-nationals because of the emissions standard.","I don't expect it to continue with this rate. Buried within that is a pretty weak Mining, Construction and Agricultural business. It's growing at a much lower rate, the Mining business as you know has been very weak for the last six months for heavy equipment, so I would expect heavy truck demand to start slow down. Then the heavy equipment demand to start to pick up and this continue to be a very solid growth business for us.","Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Thanks, Tom. On Consumer Devices?","Tom Lynch","Consumer, we have a thin base. That's our issue, of if a customer or two has a shift, we pay. We can get a nice windfall or we suffer and we are just thinly based in the business. We continue to be selective. I think the team is doing a good job, but that is just not a strong business for us. As I think I have indicated. It's going to take a couple of years really to some wind in our back.","Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Thanks, Tom.","Tom Lynch","Thank you, Wamsi. The next question please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Wood. Please go ahead.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Capital (USA) Inc.","Hi. Thank you. Thanks for the color on the $200 million tax payment. How does this compare to that [scenario] in your reserves regarding the intercompany interest exclusion and would there be any major variance versus what you have reserved in the settlement based on - it seems like you are nearing that closure.","Tom Lynch","Yes. The $200 million was essentially settling or is an anticipation of settling the '05-'07 audit period excluding intercompany debt. Once we get the final settlement, which we anticipate now in the fourth quarter, essentially we will have settled all pre-separation matters with the exception of the intercompany debt.","As you know that is currently going through the tax courts. We anticipate that to take some period of time. We are always open to settlement conversations, but right now that looks like it's going to wind through the tax courts which will take a couple of years.","When we first separated and started talking about the tax liability for the company pre-separation tax liability, we essentially indicated $600 million to $700 million of cash payments would be anticipated over an extended period of time.","With this most recent payment, we have essentially got about $450 million of that behind us, so going forward once we settled that intercompany debt, we think there is another $200 million of cash will have to be paid out.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Capital (USA) Inc.","Great. With, Measurement Specialties, since the announcement, there has been some news about a factory strike in China and shareholder lawsuits fairness, which I think that gets filed typically after every public company is taken out, but are these issues settled and would they have any impact on the timing of closing?","Tom Lynch","No. They are not going to have any impact. Again, we haven't closed yet, so I won't imagine they are managing through the labor issue in China, which also is not unusual in these kind of deals too. It's they anticipated it, we anticipated and the shareholder suit is it happens every time I think.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Capital (USA) Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Tom Lynch","\u2026any real issues.","Sujal Shah","","All right. Thank you, Mike. Can we have the next question please?","Operator","Your next comes from the line of Matt Sheerin. Please go ahead.","Matt Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co.","Yes. Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted a follow-up on your comments regarding the profitability in Network Solutions. Tom excess Subsea or SubCom business, sounds like you were saying the other three segments are at high-single digit to low double-digit operating profit. I just wanted to double check that, particularly on DataCom, with profitability there.","It's unsure. Although, obviously, year-over-year comps are getting easier there, still doesn't look like you are optimistic about that market, so what's your near and long-term strategy there in terms of profitability? Whether or not you are going to take another look at restructuring that business or taking another approach?","Tom Lynch","I would break the Networks, really, and it's kind of we have it in three major pieces, so there's the Telecom, Wireless and Enterprise businesses that are submarkets, but we have them run by one team. That's the business I answered to the earlier question on that has operating margins in low double digits today, where we have strong market positions, where we have a great fiber product line and we are really seeing the shift to fiber continue to increase. I think that's well positioned, as the market picks up, as that mix of fiber and copper continues to move in our favor to have operating leverage on the margin.","SubCom, I talked about that's negative margin, but historically it will run in the double-digit range and DataCom is still the weakest margin of the three in the single digits. A lot of that is because we are investing pretty significantly in the next generation platforms, and we have very little revenue there, so I feel good about those high-speed platforms, but there is no question.","We are winning awards, but the markets are adopting slowly. As you know in that whole space right now, there is an awful lot of change going on in the whole, what I would call the communication equipment infrastructure side.","Again, we don't have a real strong position there. I think there is an opportunity for us, we are investing for the company relatively modest amount - significant in that business, but pretty modest amount of investment to make sure we have a strong high-speed play.","Matt Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co.","Okay. Thanks. Then just wanted to follow-up regarding the SEACON acquisition, could you tell us what the revenue contribution approximately would be this quarter? Is it roughly $30 million or so?","Bob Hau","Yes. That's exactly right. There is about $30 million, $35 million of revenue and that is encompassed in our guidance for fourth quarter.","Matt Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co.","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Sujal Shah","","Thanks, Matt. Can we have the next question please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Suva. Please go ahead.","Jim Suva - Citigroup","Thank you and congratulations to you and your team. I have two questions. The first is, when we consider the transportation segment, I believe long-term you are saying that growth rate should kind of be 6% to 8%.","Now that we are seeing that Europe is improving, which has very high content per cars and also there is newer hybrid technology catching on, and you just posted organic growth rate of 8%. Is there anything in there that makes it especially on the high end or are we actually shifting towards - long-term we could be at the upper end of that normal range of 6% to 8% or even higher given the hybrid technology coming on?","Then the second question is, I guess, for Bob, the CFO, on restructuring with these acquisitions that are being folded in. Outlook on restructuring charges that I believe you have been kind of actively focused on reducing your restructuring. I did not know if that was on an apples-to-apples basis or all of a sudden now with acquisitions we need to model in some additional integration, acquisition restructuring charges?","Tom Lynch","Thank you, Jim. Regarding the automotive growth rate, you are right. We do see it at 6% to 8% and we took that up a little over a year ago. We used to see it as 5% to 7%, a couple factors in there. More, I would say content-driven for sure. I think it will - most so called experts would see that the typical production growth is going to be in the 3% to 4% range, so solid content.","HEV, hybrid electric vehicles, definitely the bigger that gets the bigger that is for all of our supplying into the market, because that's more content. Then, of course, the Measurement acquisition is going to help our content.","As we get their products and we start selling them in to the automotive market, which they're not today, they have a nice business in the industrial transportation, but the really big opportunity is automotive and we would expect. We are not changing. You know, it's too early to change the range, because there are so many factors that go in to that. Certainly, I would say there is a lot more pointing to the higher part of the range than the lower part of the range at this point.","Jim Suva - Citigroup","Great. Then on restructuring charges?","Bob Hau","Yes, Jim. In terms of restructuring, both acquisitions that we have got going on right now SEACON just recently closed and Measurement that will close by the end of the calendar year, either one of them have significant restructuring associated with them, so I don't anticipate big movement above what we have indicated as kind of more normal level of restructuring on an annual basis about $50 million to $75 million, I think, will be in line with that going forward.","Of course, as we look at our acquisitions that may change, but we will indicate that when that changes.","Jim Suva - Citigroup","That's great news across the board. Thanks and congratulations to you and your team there.","Tom Lynch","Thanks, Jim.","Sujal Shah","","Thank you. Can we have the next question please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sherri Scribner. Please go ahead.","Kirti Shetty - Deutsche Bank Securities","Hi, this is Kirti Shetty call on behalf of Sherri Scribner. I actually just had one question one the operating margins. Given your long-term target of 15%, and looking at where you have reached this quarter was around 15.4%, how should we think about the target? Do you still maintain it at 15% or how should we be visioning your op margins going forward?","Tom Lynch","I think the best way to think about it is, as we laid out our operating model, we would expect the business in an economy that has grown 3% to 4% to grow by 5% to 7%organically and that operating model should generate in a kind of a normal copper environment, no big swings in exchange rate 20% to 25% flow through.","All other things being equal, we would expect that to lift our margins 30 basis points to 50 basis points.","Kirti Shetty - Deutsche Bank Securities","Okay.","Tom Lynch","We are not setting a new target like we did before, but I think we have good operating leverage in the company now. Of course, our big thing is to continue to drive solid consistent double-digit EPS growth and cash flow that continues to approximate net income. As we are on track this year for another year of free cash flow above 10% of our revenue.","Kirti Shetty - Deutsche Bank Securities","Okay. Got it. Just to look at the different segments, I was just wondering, is there any kind of seasonality that we can look into? For example the transportation and especially with networking and given the SEACON weakness and things like that?","Tom Lynch","Yes. It's interesting. I think, seasonality, it still exists, but it's because the markets are so global now, the seasonality pronounced as it used to be. Having said that, which will typically see like we are seeing now in our fourth quarter Automotive, sequentially, will go down because its heavy vacation in August and that's when the biggest model changeover occurs in August.","Typically, broadband or the non-SubCom DataCom portion of Networks, this will be a stronger quarter because of the weather. You know it's pretty much good weather everywhere typically and that's a business that's very affected by that's, because it's outside primarily.","Then, we are not in a big consumer. We don't have a big consumer-electronics business, but that cycle would typically be strong right now because of getting ready for the holiday season. I think over time these peaks and valleys of seasonality are starting to get smoothed out of it.","Kirti Shetty - Deutsche Bank Securities","Okay. Got it. Thanks. Then one last, just wanted to confirm. You said the guidance factors and the SEACON acquisition of 30 million to 35. Was that million?","Bob Hau","That's correct. In terms of revenue, right?","Kirti Shetty - Deutsche Bank Securities","Yes. Okay. Great. Thank you.","Tom Lynch","Thank you.","Sujal Shah","","All right. Thank you. Can we have the next question please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of William Stein. Please go ahead.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Great. Thanks for taking the question. First, I'm wondering if you can comment on PCs. I think you noted that as weak in the quarter, but we started to see that turned at a lot of companies in particular, Intel, so I am wondering if you can give some color there.","Tom Lynch","I mean, it looks like that business might be finally leveling off. We still have a pretty nice position in the PC business. In the grand scheme of things of the company, it's not that big, so up or down.","We like it being up better than down so that's encouraging, but our real focus there is to build a better position in smartphones and tablets. You know, we are better than we were a couple years ago, but we are still not where we need to be.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Great. Then in the wireless infrastructure end market, I apologize if you already mentioned this, but I must have missed it. This is an area where people have been paying a lot of attention to relative to try to China Mobile build and we saw one very problematic data point last night. I wonder what you are seeing in that market.","Tom Lynch","Yes. I mean, again, we have a pretty [nichie] wireless infrastructure business, so in our DataCom business, that business is going well. I would say more, because we have a great product line that goes on the tower, so as much the sheer benefit is market.","Then in our the Telecom business, we have a digital antenna system and that business is pretty vibrant right now in the U.S. as its way of expanding coverage and capacity, especially around large venues like stadiums, so we are seeing that pick up. Again, in the grand scheme of wireless, we are kind of a niche player. I don't think it would be indicative of a trend one way or another.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","That's helpful, Tom. Just one other one I can squeeze it in. On the M&A pipeline, you guys have been pretty clear that you are focused on sensors. Now, with Measurement Specialties, what should we think about as the focus going forward? Is the company ready and able to target additional acquisitions? How should we think about that, please?","Tom Lynch","Sure. I would say, I would start with were folks on harsh environment, so continuing to build that part of our business. If you go back a few years it was about 60% of our business.","With these two new acquisitions, it's moving close to 75% of our business as we have also sold out of things like Magnetics and Touch, so we are continuing to reposition the company. I think that's working well for us.","We do have a very, let's say, robust pipeline as you know it usually takes longer rather than shorter to bring the ones that you really like, and if you can bring them in at all, so we do have the desire and the capability to do more and we are very selective.","We had two hit quickly here. It just happened to be that's the way the timing worked out. Two years before that and, you know, it's two plus years before that, so there is no real consistent timing I would say.","What I like about where we sit today is, we are building a good reputation for how to do these and I think we are an attractive acquirer to a company and I know the companies that are coming in feel really good about coming in to TE and we are also selective, really selective.","I think, we want to continue both, organically and inorganically, build that harsh because that's our sweet spot. That's what we do best and we think we can do it better than anybody.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Thanks, Tom. That's helpful. Appreciate it.","Tom Lynch","Thanks, Will.","Sujal Shah","","Thank you. Could we have the next question please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Delaney. Please go ahead.","Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs","Thanks very much for taking the questions. Bob, I am hoping you can help me bridge the implied operating margin guidance for 4Q versus 4Q of 2013. It seems by my math that op margins are relatively flat year-over-year.","I think you guys should be getting some restructuring and commodity benefits that are flowing through on a year-over-year basis, but maybe you could just help me understand and quantify what some of the dollar headwinds are, be it, Subsea being lower profitability, maybe mix or some of these other factors you already discussed, like the new investments.","Bob Hau","Yes. Thanks, Mark. Yes. We are about flat. The biggest swing is Subsea of sure. I mean, it was reasonably probable last year and unreasonably loss this year, if could say it that way. That's a single biggest thing. Pretty much everything tracking, I think, Consumer Devices down a little bit kind of hanging around the same margin level we have been, but I think the good news is that consistent margin in the Industrial business company and the Transportation business now operating at consistently above 20%.","That transportation business can move from 22% to 21% to [20% to 20.5%] depending on mix in the region we are selling in, but what I am really happy about it is it is consistently above 20%. We feel it will be consistently above 20.","Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs","That's helpful. Thank you. Then maybe you could just help me understand specifically what we should be expecting for restructuring savings for this year and then into next year. My understanding was there should have been about $100 million of savings that the company was expecting to realize in fiscal '15, but sounds like there were some reinvestments going on, and maybe you could just help me understand what the net savings now we should be thinking about now?","Bob Hau","Yes. The restructuring benefit for a 2014 is about $80 million. We have been saying $70 million to $80 million. We are at the upper end of that range. Our expenditures is a little bit about what we were anticipating in the first half of the year, so there is a slightly more benefit accrued.","A big chunk of that benefit is associated with the large restructuring actions we took last year, so we got some of the benefits in '13, we get the majority of the benefit in 2014. I would expect a more nominal benefit in thousand '15. We will give some color around that when we give 2015 guidance at the end of the fourth quarter.","Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs","Thank you very much.","Bob Hau","Thank you.","Sujal Shah","","Thanks, Mark. Can we have next question please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Fox. Please go ahead.","Steven Fox - Cross Research ","Thanks. Good morning. Two questions from me. First of all, just to be clear on the SubCom business. It lost money last quarter. It looks like it lost more $0.02 per share than you were thinking going into the quarter, but you are saying that the next couple of quarters the loss sort of don't get any worse and start to improve mid-year next fiscal year. Can you give us an idea of when breakeven will come back?","Secondly, just on the Auto market, just to be clear, it looks like auto production ticked up a little bit more than you would have said 90 days ago, your Transportation sales are basically unchanged, so was there anything you saw in the channel in terms of inventory build that made you sort of maintain the sales outlook you have relative to what is going on in the end demand? Thanks.","Tom Lynch","Yes. Let me answer the second one on Auto. I mean, you know, the industry numbers, they are always getting refined. We have pretty good visibility into what our customers are telling us to build for them and it is a strong fourth quarter. Sure by far the strongest since I have been here.","There isn't any underlying conclusion to draw from that Steve, I think it's the strong fourth quarter and we will see how it plays out, but we at this time in a quarter, we are responding to what the customers are telling us to build.","Could it be a little better or worse? Yes, but it's not going to be - I would be surprised if it was materially different and we don't really see any inventory issues. We are not hearing anything around that kind of watch outs and we are pretty plugged into that.","The first part of your question on SubCom, I think, yes. You summed it up. It has cost relative to where we were before few cents versus our guidance. 90 days ago, we offset that with other improvements, which is the good news and that's kind of early I would Q2 to start to be profitable again, but we will get specific on our guidance, we will give a little granularity there.","We will be further into the projects and see at what rate they are building, but we are hiring people in New Hampshire. That's the ultimate sign, because we don't do that unless the designs are pretty much finished and customers are ready to eat get going, so that's why we are feeling better, but not giddy given how the last few years have been in SubCom.","Steven Fox - Cross Research ","Understandable, I appreciate the color. Thanks.","Tom Lynch","Welcome.","Sujal Shah","","Thanks, Steve. The next question please?","Operator","Your final question today comes from the line of Shawn Harrison. Please go ahead.","Shawn Harrison - Longbow Research","Hi. Just following up on the SubCom, Tom, as you gave with within Network Solutions implies that business lost $15 million to $20 million in the June quarter. Am I in the right ballpark with that math?","Tom Lynch","Yes.","Shawn Harrison - Longbow Research","Okay. I guess, maybe the better question is, when do you expect it to break even again?","Bob Hau","Yes, Shawn. I think, with risk of avoiding giving guidance too early, I think it's going to be in the first half of next year. I want to see us, how do we come out of this quarter, at what run rate on the projects.","As I said, we are hiring the people. That means we are building the cable. Once the ships get in the water with the cable, then historically jobs run very consistently other than weather, but we always have that.","The key thing is, get the award, get the down payment, that's happened. Start building the cable, that's starting. Then get the cable on the ships and the ships are in the, we are actually starting to lay cable and then it's a lot easier to predict, but that's how I feel about it right now.","Certainly, our team has a strong view of what is going to happened, but before I go out there with more granularity, I would like to see how we come out of this last quarter of the year.","Shawn Harrison - Longbow Research","That's fair. Then just on SEACON. What is the EBIT margin projected to be for that business? I think, initially it was like a 30% EBIT margin, which would imply something like $0.07 to $0.08 of maybe potential EPS accretion in 2015, but if any more granularity on the profitability of SEACON, as we enter 2015?","Bob Hau","Yes. Shawn. It's Bob. The business is about, call it, $120 million of revenue and when we announced the acquisition, we did indicate that they do about 30% EBITA margin, so you got the numbers right. Obviously, we haven't given 2015 guidance for the total company. Certainly, not for SEACON at this point in time, but that is that 30% EBITDA margin of pre-acquisition.","Shawn Harrison - Longbow Research","Okay. Would you expect a lot of integration costs? If so would that just fall into 2014?","Tom Lynch","There is not a lot of integration costs and we just completed the deal, so we are now in the midst of bringing that company into the full, but there is not significant restructuring solution with it.","Shawn Harrison - Longbow Research","Okay. Thanks so much.","Bob Hau","Thanks, Shawn.","Tom Lynch","Thanks, everybody, for your questions. Just a few closing comments, I'm excited because we are coming down the stretch of a very good year for the company.","As I mentioned earlier, we expect to deliver 5% organic growth overcoming an incredibly weak SubCom business, 17% adjusted EPS growth and another tremendous year of free cash flow.","Our harsh environment portfolio is performing very well. We are really pleased with that and we also are continuing to strengthen the company with the strategic acquisitions of SEACON and Measurement Specialties.","As Bob indicated, we will continue to consistently return capital to shareholders, so I think we have very balanced capital allocation strategy, I think we have a balanced business strategy and I feel good about where the company is positioned.","Thanks again for joining us this morning and have a good day and a great rest of the summer.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be available for replay after 10:30 Eastern Time today through July 30th.","You may access the AT&T TeleConference replay system at any time by dialing 1-800-475-6701 and entering access code 329466.

All participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, which at that time, I'll give instructions.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Sujal Shah, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Good morning and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss TE Connectivity's fourth quarter and full-year 2018 results. With me today are Chief Executive Officer, Terrence Curtin; and Chief Financial Officer, Heath Mitts. During this call, we'll be providing certain forward-looking information, and we ask you to review the forward-looking cautionary statements included in today's press release.","In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussion this morning and we ask you to review the sections of our press release and the accompanying slide presentation that address the use of these items. The press release and related tables, along with the slide presentation, can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at te.com.","Please keep in mind that we announced the sale of our SubCom business last quarter and expect the transaction to close by the end of this quarter. With the sale, SubCom is reflected as discontinued operations and is not included in our results or guidance. Also, prior periods have been recast to reflect SubCom's discontinued operations treatment.","In our fiscal 2018, SubCom generated approximately $700 million in sales, with a minimal contribution to adjusted EPS. Note that, all prepared remarks on today's call will reflect TE continuing operations unless otherwise noted. We've included slide 15 in our earnings presentation, which shows recast financial information for continuing operations.","Finally, due to the increasing number of participants on the Q&A portion of today's call, we're asking everyone to limit themselves to one question to make sure we can give everyone an opportunity to ask questions during the allotted time. We're willing to take follow-up questions, but ask that you re-join the queue if you have a second question.","And let me turn the call over to Terrence, for opening comments.","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Thank you, Sujal, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today and I'll cover our 2018 results as well as our outlook for 2019. As we're going to be going through both our fourth quarter 2018 as well as the full-year 2018 and the guide, I'd like to start with framing the key messages for today's call by referencing our long-term business model.","To remind you, back at our Investor Day earlier this fiscal year we conveyed a long-term business model of 4% to 6% annual organic growth where we would deliver 30 to 80 basis points of margin expansion and double-digit earnings per share growth, which we expect to deliver over a full market cycle. As Heath and I recap 2018, you're going to see strong results that are well ahead of this business model on all fronts, on the sales front, margin front, earnings per share growth, as well as capital generation and deployment.","When we talk about 2019, and over the past three months, we have seen changes in the macro environment and our guidance for 2019 does reflect slower growth in certain end markets that we'll highlight during this call. While this may cause 2019 to be slightly below our target business model, I want to make sure you know we remain committed and are going to accelerate the leverage we talked to you about that are under our control to ensure we accrue financial performance as we move through 2019.","So let me look back now at 2018 a little bit before I get into the slides, and I'm very proud of our results. I think the results show the power of our strategy, as well as the execution of our teams. Some of the things I want to highlight before we jump into slide 3 is some of the significant progress we feel we've made this past year in creating long-term value for our owners.","First off, as Sujal highlighted, we announced the sale of our SubCom business, which improves our portfolio by lowering our volatility, enhancing our long-term growth and margin profile and positioning TE for stronger returns on future investments. Also, during 2018, the revenue growth result which was 15% overall and 9% on an organic basis \u2013 and 9% organically is a $1 billion of organic revenue growth, I think demonstrates the performance that's significantly ahead of growth in the markets we serve.","We ended this year expecting 4% organic growth and our strong outperformance this past year once again reinforces the secular content trends that drive our results and business model. We saw this illustrate among many of our markets including auto, commercial transportation, sensors, factory automation as well as appliances.","On the earnings front first; adjusted operating margins expanded a 100 basis point with increases in each of our three segments and the expansion being driven primarily by our Industrial and Communications segments, which we talked to you about, as key drivers for margin expansion over many years now and we saw the results here in 2018.","On an earnings per share, we grew 26%, which represents strong performance versus our industrial technology peers. And lastly, about our business model, it is the cash generation that I know we all like and we generated $1.4 billion of free cash flow this past year and expanded return on invested capital by over 150 basis points, which reflect both our disciplined and balanced capital strategy. So I do have confidence that our portfolio is well positioned to continue to generate growth ahead in the end markets we serve as we go forward.","So, let's get into the slides and we're going to start with slide 3 and I'm going to jump back over and just talk about the fourth quarter. And as we talk about the fourth quarter, as Sujal said, in continuing operations, which excludes SubCom, we delivered another quarter of above-market performance with growth in all businesses.","Sales were slightly ahead of our expectations at $3.5 billion and this represented 9% reported growth and 8% organic growth year-over-year. In Transportation, we grew 8% organically, well above our markets with growth in each of the segments' three businesses. Industrial Solutions grew 6% organically with growth across all businesses and our Communications segment grew 12% organically, with strong growth in both data and devices and appliances.","Orders were up 4% organically with growth in each segment, but we did see our orders decline sequentially by 8% and this reflects both return to more typical seasonality for our business, as well as a slower market environment in certain markets. In the fourth quarter, we delivered 17% adjusted operating margins, expanding 110 basis points year-over-year with margin expansion across all segments. Adjusted earnings per share was $1.35, which was above our guidance and grew 19% versus the prior-year, driven entirely by operational performance. In fact, currency exchange and tax rates were actually a headwind to our results in the quarter.","Free cash flow was very strong at $670 million and we returned over $500 million to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. So if you could please turn to slide 4, let me jump back to the full year for 2018 and then also talk about our guidance for 2019. For the full-year 2018, our sales were $14 billion, up 15% on a reported basis and 9% organically. Transportation grew 11% organically with 8% organic growth in auto versus the global auto production growth at less than 1%, and this demonstrates our performance versus the market due to content growth trends, as well our strong global position.","Industrial Solutions grew 6% organically with growth across all businesses and benefit from content growth, and our Communications segment grew 11% organically with double-digit growth in both appliances and our data devices units. For the full-year, our adjusted operating margins were up 100 basis points to 17.7%, but I do want to note that we exited the year at a 17% margin run rate, which represents a level of profitability that reflects a moderating macro environment. We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $5.61, which was up 26% over the prior year.","As we look forward, we are providing fiscal 2019 guidance for continuing operations for sales of $14.1 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $5.70 at the midpoint. This guidance represents 1% reported growth and 3% organic revenue growth and low-single digit EPS expansion. Our guidance reflects moderating order trends I'll discuss on the next slide, but we do expect growth in each of our segments and performance above our markets driven by content growth.","The one big item is, while we have 3% organic growth and that would equate to about $500 million of organic revenue. As we've been highlighting, currency exchange effects are changing from being a tailwind last year to being a material headwind in 2019. And we expect currency exchange effects to negatively impact our revenue by $400 million.","Adjusted earnings per share includes a $0.30 combined headwind from currency effects as well as the higher tax rate that Heath will talk about. Without these headwinds, our EPS guidance would represent high single-digit growth were it not for these. While we can't influence the market environment, we are going to execute on leverage we can control to accelerate cost reduction plans in the first half and expand margins and EPS in the second half.","So let's turn to slide 5 and let me get into the order trends that I've mentioned and where we see the markets and we'll get into it both overall and by segment. So on slide 5, as we discussed with you throughout 2018, we did have some markets that were running well ahead of trend line.","These include commercial transportation, factory automation and appliances. As we expected, we saw growth rates moderate from the first half to the second half of this year and expect these markets to continue to normalize in 2019.","We did see global auto production fall to less than 1% in 2018 with 2% production declines in the fourth quarter. This is different than what we talked about 90 days ago. Right now, we expect full-year auto production to be flat in 2019 with first-half production declining 2% year-over-year before improving in the second half. And offsetting some of this weakness, we continue to see good momentum in our aerospace and defense, medical, and data and device end markets.","If you look at orders on the slide, we saw 4% year-over-year growth on an organic basis. This was driven by growth in North America and Europe of 12% and 3% respectively. And this was partially offset by weakness in Asia, which declined by 2%. The slower growth rates we're seeing is reflected in the sequential decline that you see on the page in orders from quarter three to quarter four of 8%.","We have been running a book-to-bill ratio above 1 for quite some time and this quarter's book-to-bill of 0.99 reflects the slowing of the certain markets that I just mentioned earlier, and a return to more normal seasonal patterns for our business.","And just to remind you, since we haven't experienced these normal season patterns in a while, we typically see mid-single digit revenue declines sequentially from quarter four to quarter one, followed by sequential growth in quarter two, and additional growth in the second half and that's in line with how we're guiding.","Looking at orders by segment, Transportation organic orders were up 4% with growth in automotive and in sensors. And Industrial orders grew 3% organically year-over-year with growth driven by aerospace, defense and marine, as well as medical applications.","In Communications, we saw year-over-year organic order growth of 4% that was driven by the data and devices unit, partially offset by declines in appliances, and our guidance for revenue growth reflects trends we're seeing. So let me get into our results by segment and if you could please turn to slide 6, we'll start with Transportation. Transportation sales grew 8% organically year-over-year with strong growth in each of our three businesses. Our auto sales were up 6% organically in an auto production environment that declined 2% in the quarter, again reinforcing our ability to outperform the end market due to secular content growth trends. When we look at the quarter, we had solid growth in the Americas and China, while Europe was flat as customers were impacted by the WLTP implementation.","In commercial transportation, we continue to outperform the market with organic revenue growth of 15% year-over-year and double-digit growth across all regions and submarkets. But we have seen those orders reduce off of where we just had the revenue. Our sensors business grew very nicely 10% year-over-year with growth across auto, commercial transportation as well as industrial applications. In the auto sensor space, we generated over $800 million of new design wins in 2018. And this brings our total design win value to over $2 billion since the beginning of 2016 across a broad spectrum of auto sensor technologies as well as applications.","For the segment, adjusted operating margins expanded 40 basis points year-over-year to 18.1%. As we've indicated, we have increased investment to support strong pipeline of new design wins, including those in the electric vehicle and autonomous driving applications. At the same time, we have seen production slow in both China and Europe, causing a near-term correction in supply-chain that has impacted margins for our business. We will balance near-term margin performance with long-term growth opportunities and are committed to getting margins back to our target level of around 20% in the second half of 2019.","So if we can move to Industrial Solutions. Please turn to slide 7 in the deck. The segment sales grew 6% organically year-over-year to $1.1 billion, with contribution from all businesses. In industrial equipment, organic growth was 4%, led by strength in medical applications and a slower growth factory automation environment.","Our AD&M business delivered 9% organic growth with growth across all businesses and particular strength in com air. And our energy business grew 8% on an organic basis with growth in all regions. When we look at the industrial space, we are continuing to see sustained momentum across a broad set of end markets. On the margin side in the segment, adjusted operating margins expanded a very strong 160 basis points year-over-year to 15% with operating leverage on the higher revenue. As we outlined earlier this year, we are on a multi-year journey to optimize our factory footprint and reduce expenses to expand adjusted operating margins into the high teens. Our plans are on track, as you can see, in the fourth quarter and we expect fiscal 2019 to be a year of heavy lifting, as we increase some investments to support factory consolidation activities, leading to nominal margin expansion for this coming year, and this is consistent with the plan that we've been outlining to you to expand long-term operating margins in the segment.","So let's turn to Communications and that's on slide 8. During the quarter, Communications grew 12% organically with data and devices and appliances delivering another quarter of very strong results. And it's nice that you get to see the true progress that our team has made in this segment without the volatility of SubCom. In data and devices, we grew 17% organically with growth across all regions driven by high-speed connectivity in data center applications and content growth from electronification trends.","Our appliance businesses grew 5% organically with growth in all regions as we continue to benefit from our leading global position. Adjusted operating margins were 16.8% in the quarter and expanded over 300 basis points from the prior year. For our Communications segment, going forward, we are targeting a long-term model of low to mid-single digit organic revenue growth with mid to high-teen operating margins.","Before I get into guidance a little bit later, I do want to turn it over to Heath to cover financials for the fourth quarter as well as for the full year.","Heath Mitts - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Thank you, Terrence, and good morning, everyone.","Please turn to slide 9 where I will provide more details on the Q4 financials. Adjusted operating income was $597 million, with an adjusted operating margin of 17% and 110 basis points of margin expansion, driven by the strong 8% organic growth in the quarter. GAAP operating income was $570 million and included $22 million of restructuring and other charges and $5 million of acquisition charges.","For the full-year, restructuring charges were $140 million and I expect another year at this level as we continue to execute on optimizing the industrial footprint that Terrence mentioned earlier and improving the cost structure of the organization.","Adjusted EPS was $135 million, up a very strong 19% year-over-year, driven by sales growth and operating margin improvement in all segments. GAAP EPS was $4.78 for the quarter and included a tax benefit related to utilization of net operating loss carry forwards. This benefit was partially offset by restructuring, acquisitions and other charges of $0.06.","We ended 2018 with an adjusted effective tax rate of 17.1% for the year versus our long-term model of 19% to 20%.","As we look ahead to 2019, I expect a more normalized effective tax rate at the low end of this range, so closer to 19%. This results in a tax headwind, though, of approximately $0.14 in our 2019 guidance compared to our 2018 results.","If you turn to slide 10, adjusted gross margin expanded 70 basis points in the quarter to 33.7% with improvement from prior year, driven primarily by fall through on increased volumes. Adjusted operating margins were up 110 basis points year-over-year to 17%, with strong organic growth driving leverage in the operating structure of the company. We are proud of the expansion that is across all our segments in Q4 and for the full year. Adjusted EBITDA margins also expanded year-on-year to approximately 22% in the fourth quarter.","In the quarter, cash from operations was $922 million and up 10% year-over-year. Free cash flow was $670 million and we returned $570 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in the quarter. For the full-year, free cash flow was $1.4 billion and included a step-up in capital investments to support the rich pipeline of organic opportunities that I have discussed with you over the past year. This CapEx investment is to support growth, and as I've mentioned before, have the highest return on investment for the company, which is contributing to the over 150 basis points improvement in adjusted ROIC this year to 15%. We continue to target mid-teens adjusted ROIC as we balance organic investments with acquisition opportunities.","In fiscal 2018, we returned $1.6 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and used $153 million for acquisitions.","Our balance sheet is healthy, and we expect cash will remain strong, which provides us the ability to support both return to our shareholders and the acquisitions over the long term. Given where we are trading, our valuation is attractive. We'll take advantage of this opportunity and balance share repurchases with acquisitions that arrive this coming year. Also, as we mentioned before, we're committed to returning the proceeds from the SubCom divesture to our shareholders in addition to the buybacks from the normal share repurchase program.","Please turn to slide 11 to summarize our financial performance for the full-year and illustrate the progress we've made in each of our segments over the past two years as we execute on our strategy. As Terrence mentioned, our performance was ahead of our business model in 2018 with 9% organic growth and a 100 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion. This included double-digit organic growth in both Transportation and Communications segments.","While we had margin expansion in all segments, I'm very proud of the performance of our Industrial and Communications segments as we execute on the levers to improve the operating performance of these segments. The Industrial segment benefited from volume leverage this year, and is making great progress on their margin expansion goals.","In Communications, our results reflect the heavy lifting that our team did to restructure and reposition the data and device business over the past several years. We expect to apply the same process to our Industrial segment to drive margins to the high teens.","In Transportation, our 2018 growth was well ahead of our initial expectations, and while this is great for sales and earnings generation, we did experience some operational growing pains, which unfavorably impacted the Transportation margins. Fortunately, we feel these growing pains are well understood and have been taking actions to improve the efficiency of our operations within the segment. And as Terrence mentioned, as we progress to 2019, our expectation is that the Transportation margin gets very closer to our target margin rate. We continue to have significant growth opportunities in the Transportation segment, we will continue to fund these investments, while also balancing the operational improvement and the financial results.","With that, I'll turn back over to Terrence to cover guidance.","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Thanks, Heath. And let me get into guidance. I know I talked a little bit about it but let's click down a level and if we can start on slide 12, let's start with the first quarter. We expect first quarter revenue of $3.33 billion to $3.43 billion, and adjusted earnings per share of $1.25 to $1.29. At the mid-point, this represents reported sales growth of 1% and organic sales growth of 3%, and adjusted EPS expected to be down from the prior year first quarter.","Given the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar, we expect the year-over-year currency exchange headwind in the first quarter of approximately $75 million and $0.04 in the quarter. Because the number of dynamics in quarter one on a year-over-year compared basis, I think it makes more sense that we reference back to the quarter we just ended as a baseline when looking at our quarter one expected performance.","Our outlook for the first quarter of this year reflects the business returning to normal seasonal patterns that I discussed earlier, combined with a slower growth in certain end markets. Our revenue guidance implies a 4% sequential decline in quarter one and quarter four, which is in line with the mid-single digit declines that we would typically expect.","We expect operating margins to be slightly below our quarter four levels of 17%, as we adjust to the slower market environment. However, we expected the margin expansion from the first half to the second half driven by the levers that we control resulting in a full-year adjusted operating margin expansion from the 17% exit level in 2018.","Talking by segments, within the first quarter, we expect Transportation Solutions to be up low single-digits organically. Auto revenue is expected to be up low single-digits organically versus a global decline in auto production of 2%, driven by weakness of production in Europe and China. Our outperformance versus the market again reinforces the benefit we drive from content growth.","Industrial Solutions is expected to grow mid-single digits organically with growth across all businesses. And we expect Communications to be up mid-single digits organically, driven primarily by data and devices.","So let's move to the full year of 2019, and if you can move to slide 13, I'd appreciate it. As I said earlier, we expect full-year revenue of $13.9 billion to $14.3 billion, which represents reported sales growth of 1% and organic sales growth of 3% at the midpoint. Once again, when you think about the top-line going from where we just ended, it's about $500 million of organic sales growth, offset by $400 million of currency headwind at the mid-point.","Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $5.60 to $5.80, and we have the two headwinds both from currency and tax, that both Heath and I talked about, but without those headwinds, adjusted earnings per share would be growing at a high single-digit rate at the midpoint, and without these headwinds, it would be closer to $6.","So, let me provide some color on the segments on the full year how we're seeing it from a market and a revenue perspective. We do expect our Transportation Solutions segment to be up mid-single digits organically, content gains are expected to drive mid-single digit organic growth in auto, even in a flat global auto production environment that we assume for 2019. We are expecting high single-digit organic growth in sensory, driven by the ramp-up of new auto design wins that we discussed earlier.","In Industrial Solutions, we expect to grow low-single digits through the year organically, with growth in aerospace, defense and medical being offset partially by slower growth in factory automation.","And in Communications, we expect it to be up low single-digit through year organically, driven primarily by our data and devices business. So before we go to questions, I just want to recap some of the key takeaways from today's call.","We delivered exceptional results in 2018 across all levers of our business model. And I think we demonstrated the positive impact of the portfolio changes we've made and the benefit from the global secular trends that are going to consistently drive growth ahead of markets we serve. As we move into 2019, we are in a slower growth environment, which we have reflected in our guidance and it's also important that we remain committed to our long-term business model and we do have levers to respond to the market conditions and you'll see it in the first half and second half margin expansion and EPS expansion that's included in our guidance.","And as always, we all appreciate a strong cash generation model that we have and we are going to continue to maintain our balanced capital strategy to make sure we're driving value creation for owners.","So as I close, I just want to thank our employees across the world for their execution through 2018, as well as their commitment as we go into 2019 to both our customers and our owners and as we create a future that's safer, sustainable, productive and connected.","So Sujal, with that, let's open it up for questions.","Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Okay, thanks, Kailey. Could you please read the instructions for the Q&A session?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question will come from the line of Amit Daryanani of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks a lot guys. I guess","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Hi, Amit.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. Terrence, given your expectations for auto production for the full year being flat, how do you think China is going to stack up within those expectations? And how do you deal with a potential China stimulus, I guess, helping you guys over fiscal 2019, if that's baked into your guide or not? Thank you.","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","No, thanks, Amit. Let me get into the geographies as we see them and that's assumed in our flat auto production environment. And it is something versus 90 days ago \u2013 90 days ago, we would have told you we would have thought auto production in 2019 would be similar to what we were experiencing in 2018, which is 1% to 2% and it did turn flat based upon some of the dynamics we're seeing.","By region, as we look at next year in that flat environment, it's really North America continues to be in the continued flat environment it's been in. We see Europe being slightly down. And we actually see Asia being slightly up and that does include, what we believe the stimulus that the Chinese government looks like they're going to put in here beginning in January on the smaller size combustion engines. So when we look at our flat next year, I think you're going to have Europe slightly down, North America flat, Asia driven mainly by China being slightly up.","Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Okay. Thank you, Amit. Can we have the next question, please?","Operator","We'll go to the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Thanks. Just wanted to ask about the free cash flow outlook and how to think about conversion, the 70%-plus conversion was a little light in 2018? CFO was clearly good, but as we look into next year, just wondering on the swings, where does CapEx go? Is working capital kind of an opportunity on the slower growth?","Heath Mitts - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Sure, Chris. This is Heath. I think if you think about our cash flow for 2018, couple things you have to take into consideration. One, we consciously took up our CapEx year-over-year to take advantage of some very attractive growth opportunities, particularly in the Transportation segment. That's across the board, both auto, commercial transportation as well as sensors.","And many times in this market you've got to invest in some things after you win a program, maybe up to two years in advance of when you'd actually see the revenue. So that's a \u2013 if I was looking at our CapEx, I'd say that's a good indicator on our confidence towards our revenue pipeline there. The other thing is, obviously, we did eat through with the type of organic revenue growth that we're talking about for the year nearing double-digits. We did use some working capital. As you think forward into 2019, the slower growth, that working capital, much of it is going to come back into cash flow out of inventories and receivables.","And then from a CapEx perspective, I would say it will moderate some from what we spent this past year, but it's still going to be somewhere in that $800 million range of CapEx.","Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Okay. Thank you, Chris. Could we have the next question, please?","Operator","We'll go next to line of Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes. Thank you. Good morning. I was hoping, Terrence, you can talk a little bit about the linearity this year, given the fact that you're starting off with this assumption of 2% decline in auto production and ending for the full year at flat. How should we think about the seasonality different this year relative to, let's say, last year? And Heath, perhaps you could address like what specific steps you're taking to accelerate cost savings here and how we should expect that profitability linearity also to progress through the course of the year? Thank you.","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Thanks, Wamsi, for the question. Let me talk a little about the seasonality because it's something \u2013 in the environment, I think all of us have had for the past couple of years, in some cases our seasonality hasn't been typical but when you look at our guidance and even when you see the orders, orders did grow during the quarter, certainly at a slower rate than we've seen, but you saw the sequential decline that I mentioned and that is pretty typical for our business.","And so when we look at our guide for this year, we are pretty guiding that historical seasonality, which is the first quarter comes down a little bit off the fourth, you get a little bit more growth in the second quarter, and then certainly, the third quarter it is typically our strongest and then a little bit of moderation into the fourth.","So our guide, as we looked at where orders were, does show a more natural shape. From the standpoint of, clearly \u2013 and it goes a little bit back to Amit's question, when you have an environment that goes from 2% growth to declining a little bit like in auto, you are going to get a little bit of supply chain movement. That we are dealing with, that's reflected in our guidance. But I'll let Heath talk a little bit about what we're going to do from a linearity on the profitability side.","Heath Mitts - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Sure. And, Wamsi, I appreciate the question. There's a couple of things that we've talked about in the past, which we described and continue to describe as a multi-year journey, most specifically that's our industrial footprint optimization. And that's not \u2013 we've been well underway with that as we worked our way through 2018 and certainly even more aggressively in 2019.","I would say, from a segment perspective, some of the bigger actions that we're taking in 2019 in the industrial footprint, we'll see a much more significant margin rate improvement as we get into actual 2020. This is kind of a year internally that we said a year of execution for our industrial team as there's a couple of very large sites that are coming offline. And as that happens, those are not things that happen overnight. So, this has been in progress for a while. I think what you'll see is modest or flat margins in our Industrial segment in 2019. And then as we exit the year, you would expect some significant improvement there.","The other thing we have got to take a look at is we just sold a business roughly $700 million of revenue and what that does create an element of stranded cost that we have to address in our structure. And that does put near-term pressure on our margins as we pull out that amount of revenue without that amount of cost. So, we'll be addressing that. We've already begun taking those steps and we'll continue to do so through the first part of this year. So, you would expect our second half margins, in aggregate for the company, to be higher than the first half as we tackle these things.","Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Okay. Thank you, Wamsi. Can we have the next question, please?","Operator","We'll go to the line of Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.","Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","[Technical Difficulty] (37:11 \u2013 37:37)","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Yeah. I'm sorry about that. We're going to go to the next question, please. And, Craig, we had a bad connection. Maybe we'll come back to you.","Operator","We'll go to the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen. Please go ahead.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Hey, Joe. Good morning.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","So can we go through kind of what you're seeing in the supply chain, I know, Heath, we talked last \u2013 like on a year-on-year in auto last year it was a headwind, I think it was like 150 basis points from kind of supply chain inflation and some stuff you had to do on the logistics side to expedite, can we talk about what we're seeing now, is that kind of pressure accelerating, moderating a little bit, and implications on auto margins there?","Heath Mitts - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Sure. I think that when we think about supply chain, there is a couple of pieces here. I'm going to tackle the first half, and then I want, Terrence, to grab the second. There's certainly some things that we have dealt with relative to our operational matters that involve our supply chain and availability of parts, and be able to get things and then through our factories and the cost to expedite some of that, much of that is behind us, or we're on the better end of that journey in terms of the pain points that that has caused.","Albeit, we're not \u2013 we're never going to let our customers down in terms of being a critical component of their supply chain and so we at times have to do things that drive inefficiencies in our factories to make sure we get out and some of the capital that we've spent this year in addition to the growth programs has gone to address those types of matters. So I feel that we're on the right end of that journey, but again you'll continue to see margins march up as we progress through the year.","And then relative to the supply chain and some of our prepared remarks that is causing some air pockets in our demand for sales. I'll let Terrence grab on to it.","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Yeah. Certainly, Joe, on the other part there. We have seen in certain markets customers get conservative and inventory levels while we see things like PoS staying in this moderating growth environment. We have, due to some of the inflationary pressures we're seeing elsewhere as well as I think some of the tariff effects, actually pause a little bit. So, we are seeing that as part of our moderation. It's very different depending upon the market dynamics. Markets that are hot, we don't see it, markets that are moderating a little bit, we are seeing some pauses in the supply chain in the purchasing activity that we see, as typical those type of effects work through in three, four months and we do see it in certain markets right now.","Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Okay. Thank you, Joe. Could we have the next question, please?","Operator","We'll go to line of Shawn Harrison of Longbow Research. Please go ahead.","Mr. Harrison, your line is open. If you have a mute button on, please take it off or pick up the handset.","Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC","Hi. Morning all. This is probably the last time ever you'll have this question but SubCom. What was previously the embedded earnings forecast for that business in 2019 prior to the sale? And do you anticipate through buyback and cost reduction actions that you'd be able to fully offset any dilutions from that sale?","Heath Mitts - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Well. Shawn, this is Heath. We didn't get into disclosing given where we were in the process internally what the impact would have been for our 2019 numbers, because we had a pretty good indication early on during our budget process, where it was going to fall out. So, did try to put in a 2019 number on there would be somewhat speculation at this point.","In terms of the dilutive impact, obviously it did not have a material amount of profitability as you review the numbers that we disclosed in the 8-K that was sent out earlier today. You'll see that there was not much profitability in that business in our fiscal 2018 numbers. So from that perspective, which was obviously a number that was \u2013 had been, we worked through the quality issue with one of our contracts and that had, certainly, an unfavorable impact to the business's overall margins.","But as we think through more of a normalized piece for SubCom, relative to the price that we got and the shares we're going to purchase back, I would say that on a year-over-year perspective you'll see a very moderate amount of dilution. And you'll see, obviously, when we normalize the numbers, an uptick in our gross margins and in our overall operating income.","Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Okay. Thank you, Shawn. Can we have the next question, please?","Operator","We'll go to the line of Matthew Sheerin with Stifel.","Alvin J. Park - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yes. Hi. This is Alvin Park on behalf of Matt Sheerin.","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Hi, Alvin.","Alvin J. Park - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Hello. And just in terms of content spread with the auto production growth. The quarter had 8% organic growth in Transportation on a 2% decline implying a spread of roughly 10 points. Just wondering how management is viewing that spread come fiscal year 2019. And if that large spread cadence can be maintained or if you see a compression, just any color on that?","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Couple of things. Let's go back to what we believe that spread should be and that spread, like we said in our Investor Day, is that mid-single digit spread, both from the trends we get around electronification content changed due to both what's happened in electric vehicle as well as autonomy and the connected car.","So that spread does not change. This past year, certainly, our performance was well ahead of that, but as we look at next year in a flat environment, we believe our auto business will grow mid-single digit right at that content that we've always said. On a quarter or a period you will get programs that may kick-in and move out, but long-term that 4% to 6% and mid to single-digit content is what we expect based upon the programs we're seeing to drive up to the content per vehicle, we've always talked to our owners about.","So while we may have a little bit of a supply chain effect in quarter one, we feel very good at it in the flat environment. We're going to grow that mid-single digit, where we guided for the year.","Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Okay, Thank you, Alvin. Can we have the next question, please?","Operator","Okay. We're going to go back and try Craig Hettenbach's line again from Morgan Stanley.","Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Sorry, there was some line issues, so Terrence just the question on the sensor wins you called out, $800 million in fiscal 2018. Can you talk about in areas where you are winning kind of where you are differentiating versus the competition? And then as part of that I know the company has talked about kind of leveraging the core connector technology with sensors, and what type of traction you're seeing that as a go-to-market with auto OEMs?","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Sure. Thanks, Craig. So first off, we talked about the wins that I mentioned in the call, you see the momentum we continue to have and those sensor wins were over $2 billion. And you've also seen, we're starting to see the growth on the auto programs as we've always told you, when you win an auto program, it take years for that to actually launch and you've seen that we continue to have momentum there and that will help the growth where we guided in sensors next year.","When we bought MEAS, it was always around how do you take their great product bag and technology bag they have and really get it, focus on vertical applications. And our first approach was very much around would we leverage TEs in the transportation space. And I think that's what you see, it is very broad, the sensor space is a very broad space, it is space where there is internal divisions we compete against with, some small companies, certainly some larger companies, and our wins we're competing against that fragmented space.","What I would say from applications, the application we feel very fortunate because we're starting a little bit from a clean slate since MEAS didn't have much automotive business. And I think we're really driving wins where they are differentiated, and whether that or other things around electric vehicles, certainly around humidity, temperature, pressure, it's a very broad-based that we feel good about. And we're going to continue to leverage it.","We're also looking where other verticals that we should be looking at sensor (45:58) I would say that's still, how do we scale that, there's still some of the opportunity we have as a company, but early out of the gate it was very much transportation focused.","Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Okay. Thank you, Craig. Can we have the next question, please?","Operator","We'll go to the line of Jim Suva with Citi.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you very much. And thus far you've provided great details. One follow-up I have is in your prepared comments you've mentioned about right-sizing and realigning some of the businesses, as we look into the 2019 and looking at your reporting lines of businesses where can we see the most focus for that right lining of those businesses maybe by segment about where the most effort will be?","And is it kind of a near-term pressure or pause on the margins of those businesses before they get better? And is it all internally planned or is it also driven by some of the political items that are going on with the tariffs adding to that or would that be incremental depending upon how that all sources sorts out? Thank you very much.","Heath Mitts - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Jim, it's Heath. I appreciate the question. Let me give you my perspective in terms of where our efforts and focuses are. Certainly, what we've talked about relative to the Industrial segment is unchanged. We have been undertaking, we continue to undertake some footprint consolidation activities. We will, in 2019 because there are some investments that get made as we do, we were running parallel as things move to different regions and things like that. You won't see a ton of margin expansion that probably guide you to the model of roughly flat year-over-year at the segment level with an expectation that as we exit the year you'll start to see this tick up as some of the bigger cost locations come off line.","So, that's an organized effort of largely the team that right-sized our data and device business over the last several years, that same team is now involved with the Industrial segment. And they are well underway in terms of what they've been working on towards that goal.","As we think about Transportation, I think what you'll see is you'll see where we exited this year with Transportation in terms of 2018. There are, certainly, some activities in place to make sure that we are sized correctly as well as in the right areas. My expectation is that you will continue to see the margins tick up as we move from quarter-to-quarter sequentially and certainly from the first half to second half and realize the benefit of some of those actions that are underway, while we're still investing into the growth profile of that business, because that business continues to have strong trends and nothing has changed from that perspective in terms of where we're going within the transportation world, whether it's sensors business that Terrence has talked about or certainly in commercial transportation and auto that are benefiting from the trends of electronification of vehicles.","So, there will be a balance there. But as you model the year, you should expect margins to tick up sequentially as well as certainly first half, second half. And then Communications, right, now Communications is a business that certainly from a margin perspective has finished 2018 very strong, the data and device business and appliance businesses, which are the only to be used left in that segment, right. They're both doing well; you'll see more growth out of data and devices this year. And then appliances, I think you'll see a little bit slower growth because we've come to enjoy outsized growth relative to those end markets, but you'll still see nice numbers there.","From a margin rate perspective, this is a little bit less about restructuring and more about growth from where our focal points are. But no, it's just the law of small numbers, you can see some volatility quarter-to-quarter within that segment as any one quarter could have better mix than another quarter and so forth and you don't have quite the amount of variability in there that maybe once had. So, just keep an eye on that, but if you wanted to guide mid-to-high teens for that segment, I think that's a fair place.","Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Okay. Thank you, Jim. Can we have next question, please?","Operator","We'll go to the line of Mark Delaney of Goldman Sachs.","Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question.","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Hey, Mark.","Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","I was hoping you to talk more about commercial transportation specifically and the commentary about some slowing in orders as you exited the fiscal year? Was that a broader base comment or is that more specific to China? And then just maybe remind us how much of the commercial transportation business is China exposed?","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","No, I think when you look at our commercial transportation business, we've had tremendous growth the past couple of years there and a lot of it has been driven by the truck market in China. And it's been both a market benefit as well as a content benefit. About half of our growth over the past couple of years has been content driven. And I think it's what our teams have done, that I've been very pleased with. What we have seen is certainly China from a truck perspective, we do expect that to be down. So we are going to get impact of that as well as the supply chain effects that go with that.","So China is a big driver of it, that drives that overall market with where it has shifted. If you look at that business today, that business today is about 30% China, the rest of it would be in the West, between Europe and America. So I think it's one of the things that was a much smaller penetration for us historically. I think it's a real success. And a lot of content win there but the market is \u2013 we see some market changes there.","Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Okay, thank you, Mark. Can we have the next question, please?","Operator","We'll go to the line of Deepa Raghavan of Wells Fargo Securities.","Deepa B. N. Raghavan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning.","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Good morning, Deepa.","Deepa B. N. Raghavan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Wanted to talk about free cash flow a little bit more in detail. Just given all the incremental cost actions that you're taking, would that be a little bit more of a headwind to free cash flow into 2019. And the second part to that is, I don't know the cash profile of your SubCom business, just curious how does your free cash flow settle for 2019 just given your incremental cost actions and your SubCom exit? Thank you?","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Thank you, Deepa, good question. So, relative to the amount of restructuring cash as I mentioned, we guided throughout 2018 that the P&L impact on restructuring to be about $150 million. You can assume about 75% of that was real cash versus, I'll say, non-cash charges inside there. We ended the year about $140 million. I would tell you that if you're modeling, I think $150 million is probably a good number as we think about it.","As we progress through the year, we'll keep everyone updated if that number changes and we update our forecasts relative to that. But I don't see relative to how we thought about the cash flow impact of the restructuring in 2019 to have a material difference from how it impacted us in 2018 from a cash perspective. The biggest benefit we're going to get from cash perspective is certainly working capital back off now that we're at, I'll say, more moderate growth rates versus the organic trends that we had been at. And that will have a more significant impact driving our cash higher.","As we think about SubCom, SubCom is a business that, at times, very lumpy cash flow. So the cash flow in that business did not always follow necessarily where revenue and profit followed in that business just by the nature of when you receive progress payments and money that was received upfront from time to time as well as when projects were commissioned you might receive a windfall towards the back end of a project. So it was very lumpy as we think about that business in 2018 relative to 2019. Obviously we've pulled those numbers out from a discontinued operations perspective, but not going to have a significant impact from how I would think about cash conversion.","Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Okay. Thank you, Deepa. Could we have the next question, please?","Operator","We'll go to the line of Steven Fox with Cross Research. Sir, your line is open.","Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC","Hi. Yeah. Sorry about that. Good morning.","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Hey, Steve.","Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC","Hi. So a couple questions from me, please. First of all, obviously there's been a pretty sizable change in the industry's outlook for auto production. It sounds like some of it is actually related to some spot plant shutdowns. So I'm trying to understand like the risk between now and the end of the year that you see maybe some more unexpected plant shutdowns, how much that is already factored into your guidance. And then how you would deal with sort of that to avoid extra inefficiencies? And then I had a follow-up.","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Yeah, well, Steve, first off, we've taken the data that we see here and from our customer interactions as well as where do we see order forecasts. So we have all of that that when you look at here and you sort of say before the end of the year, I'm assuming calendar year, we get orders from our customers because it is a just-in-time industry that's there. So feel that what we've gone out with reflects those shutdowns certainly that we saw some of it taking advantage of Europe specifically and that was also the WLTP, which I think is less around Europe shutdowns, but certainly regulation and I think everybody's trying catch up on.","So I feel that where we've guided reflects the areas that we've heard from our customers. And what we've been doing, as Heath mentioned, is there are areas when you get an adjustment like that, we have to adjust our operations for. And that's what we're doing across auto it is, so business is going to grow at 5%, mid-single digits next year in a flat environment. So when we look at it, we have to adjust from running at 10% like we had almost this year down to about half of that growth and that's what we're working through right now.","Operator","We'll go next to the line of William Stein with SunTrust.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great. Thanks for taking my question.","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Hi, Will.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hi. The last time we had a meaningful slowdown in automotive, that is the credit crisis and I'm certainly not saying that's what unraveling today. But during that time, we saw a pretty significant inventory reduction across the supply chain, that triggered meaningfully below unit growth for your transport sales despite the content growth story that was in full swing at that time as well. So it sounds like you think that the current environment is sort of a one and done pause quarter or maybe something like that, very short but very small. What gives you the confidence to guide that way for at least that's how it feels for the year? Thank you.","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Well, I think a couple things, Will, I think you have to get at where auto builds have bid and some of it is last year's first quarter was very strong builds. We could see moderation occur here, adjusting like we said a little bit in Europe, a little bit in China. North America has been flat for three years. So I don't think we've been in an accelerating automotive environment. We've been in a decelerating auto production environment when it comes to growth for multi-years now. Certainly, we thought it was going to be more like 1% to 2% growth going into 2019.","It's a little bit sharper. It's down to zero, so I do think auto production has been adjusting and, from that viewpoint, we think it's appropriate. When you look at auto production, we see it basically being about 24 million units the first three quarters and then actually going to 22 million units like it normally does. So when we look at our flat, some of that's related to compares of where do we see production and, certainly, there are pauses in places like Europe, right now with WLTP and certainly China is adjusting. But we expect they should have low-single-digit growth, it's nowhere close to the growth it had three, four years ago.","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Okay. Thanks, Will. Can we have the next question, please?","Operator","We have a follow-up from the line of Joe Giordano of Cowen.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the follow-up here.","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Hey, Joe.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Just, I know you guys are generally pretty conservative in your guide, but let's just say we do have a further deterioration in end market conditions and you guys do have a pretty high volume, fixed cost base. Given the spending that you're planning on doing to right-size everything, how quickly could you tamper spending to kind of deal with a slower growth environment than you're currently contemplating?","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Well, Joe, I think it's a fair question. Certainly, we contemplate a lot of different scenarios as we put together these plans and the teams rally around in terms of levers that can be pulled. There are levers that we're pulling now relative to just the overall softening of the general macro situation and everything we've talked about over the last hour. There will be additional levers that certainly we have queued up that if things worsened and you expect us to pull those. So, how quickly can we pull them? Well, pretty quickly. We have \u2013 this wouldn't be starting from scratch. We've done the work and we've taken a look at it but no different than you would expect us to in preparing the company for various types of macro conditions.","At the same time, we will balance out the growth. We're not \u2013 these are businesses and we start talking about things like automotive across the board and aerospace and so forth that when you're running programs and you're being spec'ed in to programs with our customers that sometimes you're going to have to swallow hard in the near-term to be successful in the long-term. And I think if you look at our history of that, even well before I got here, the company has done a good job of balancing that out to make sure that we keep our customers happy and that we don't lose something because of shortsightedness.","So there will be a balance. There are some self-help things that certainly we will execute on and have been executing on and you'll see those start to be reflected in the financial results. At the same time, there's a level of agility that we talk about internally and that we have queued up to allow us to pull those levers when and if they happen.","Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Okay.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. And I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Sujal Shah. Please go ahead, sir.","Sujal Shah","Good morning, and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss TE Connectivity's fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2014 results. With me today are Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Lynch; and Chief Financial Officer, Bob Hau.","During the course of this call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information, and we ask you to review the forward-looking cautionary statements included in today's press release.","In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussion this morning. We ask you to review the sections of our press release and the accompanying slide presentation that addresses the use of these items.","The press release and related tables, along with the slide presentation, can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at te.com. [Operator Instructions]","Now let me turn the call over to Tom for opening comments.","Thomas J. Lynch","Thanks, Sujal, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Here are some highlights of the call, and then we'll go into this in more detail over the balance of the call. We delivered strong results for fiscal year 2014, achieving our -- or exceeding all our business model targets. I feel very good about how we continue to execute our strategy of strengthening our leadership position in harsh environment applications, with another strong year of design wins in Auto, Industrial and Appliances. We also made key acquisitions in sensors and oil and gas, which significantly expand our TAM. For 2015, the midpoint of our guidance reflects 8% actual revenue growth, 6% organic revenue growth and double-digit adjusted earnings growth. The benefits of recent acquisitions, the rebound of the SubCom business and solid performance in the transportation and industrial segments will more than offset a slight slowing in EMEA and China, as well as currency headwind.","We do have multiple levers below the top line to drive EPS growth, most notably our TEOA program, which is really helping us improve customer satisfaction and driving productivity as evidenced by our margins.","And then lastly, but not least, of course, we expect to generate continued strong free cash flow growth, enabling us to return approximately 2\/3 of our cash to shareholders while continuing to strengthen the company through acquisitions.","Now please turn to Slide 3. Q4 was a strong finish to a record year for the company. Sales were just shy of $3.6 billion and up roughly 4% year-over-year. Adjusted EPS of $1.02 was up 10% at the high end of our guidance and free cash flow was $661 million.","Our Q4 results were driven by the continued strong performance of our Transportation and Industrial Solutions segment, as well as our Appliance business in our Consumer segment. Growth in these businesses more than offset weakness in our SubCom market, which has now bottomed -- which has bottomed and is now earning a growth cycle. So in a nutshell, Q4 results really continued what we saw through the first 3 quarters of the year.","Please turn to Slide 4. I'm really pleased with what our team accomplished in the fiscal year 2014. We delivered strong financial performance, strengthened our leadership position in harsh connectivity and expanded our TAM through a major sensor acquisition. Our sales growth was 5%, overcoming the bottoming out of the SubCom market. Adjusted operation -- operating margins were 15.4%, primarily powered by our TEOA program, and this was a very key milestone for the company to get through a full year at 15-plus in operating margin at less than $14 billion of revenue.","Adjusted earnings per share grew 17% and we generated $1.7 billion of free cash flow, our seventh consecutive year of 10% or better cash flow yield on revenue. We continued to execute our long-term strategy of extending our leadership position in harsh environment applications, which are highly engineered, designed in partnership with our customers and characterized by relatively longer product cycles and margins above company average. Our Transportation and Industrial segments as well as our Appliances business continue to generate design wins at rates ahead of market growth, which positions -- which strengthens our long-term market position.","We also made these 2 key acquisitions establishing us as the leader in offshore oil and gas and the high-growth sensors market. Measurement Specialties establishes us as a leading supplier of sensors and connectors, adds nearly $40 billion to our addressable market and further increases our content in harsh applications. Overall, our harsh businesses now account for approximately 70% of company revenue, up from the 50% range a few years ago and are generating operating margins above the company average.","This is our wheelhouse, so to speak, and we will continue to accelerate investment into these businesses.","With the addition of a broad sensors portfolio, TE owns valuable real estate that serves as a gateway for customers to collect and analyze data, whether in Automotive, Industrial, Communications or Consumer Applications.","In our short cycle businesses, Consumer Devices and Data Communications, this was a tough year for financial performance, but a year of progress in innovation, key customer design-ins and continued cost improvements. As a result of this progress, I expect that these businesses will be contributors to the company's earnings growth in fiscal 2015.","In our networks business, it was a mixed year in terms of financial performance but a good year in terms of strategic progress. SubCom bottomed out in fiscal 2014, with less than $300 million in revenue and generated an operating loss. On the bright side, we had an excellent year winning key projects and these projects are now coming into force.","In our Broadband Network Solutions business, which includes telecom and enterprise, we had a solid year. Sales growth returned for the first time in 3 years and profitability improved for the second consecutive year.","I'll now provide some detail by business within each segment in the next 4 slides. Unless I indicate otherwise, all changes are on an organic basis, which excludes the effect of currencies, acquisitions and divestitures. Please turn to Slide 5.","Our Transportation business had another outstanding year in fiscal 2014, with 10% growth and 20%-plus operating margins. Content growth is driven by new safety features, higher emission standards and the broadening adoption of infotainment applications, which require increased data transfer, more electrical connections and more sensors. Electronic growth is a strong secular driver that will continue to fuel growth for TE. Last year's results clearly demonstrate how our company is benefiting from electronic content expansion and importantly, an increased new platform win rate in both the Automotive and Industrial Transportation business. As our revenue growth more than doubled OEM production growth of 5%. I really feel the investments we made in the downturn are paying off big time for us in this business.","Q4 was another strong quarter with sales of $1.5 billion, up 6% over the prior year, outpacing global vehicle production growth of 2.8%. We delivered adjusted operating margins of 20%-plus due to the volume growth and continued productivity improvements driven by TEOA.","Looking forward, we expect another good quarter in Q1, with actual sales up approximately 10%, including about 10 or 11 weeks of Measurement Specialties revenue.","Please turn to Page 6. Our Industrial business performed very well in fiscal 2014. Revenue of $3.3 billion was up 6.6% and 5% organically. Adjusted operating margins increased 80 basis points to 14.7%. We had strong performance in Asia and the U.S., more than offsetting a relatively flat European market. In Q4, revenue was up 10% due to strong organic growth of 6%, coupled with the acquisition of SEACON in our Oil and Gas business. Within this segment, Commercial Aerospace, Oil and Gas and Industrial Equipment grew mid-single digits in the quarter and the full year. Our robust organic product pipeline coupled with the Deutsche and SEACON acquisitions has positioned us very well in these attractive markets, which we believe have strong underlying secular trends that should provide attractive growth for years to come.","The Industrial Equipment market is growing again and our industrial equipment business has exhibited strong growth over the past 5 quarters, benefiting from our increased focus on factory automation markets as well as a strong rail market in China.","Our Energy business grew 2% in the year, with strength in Asia and an improving U.S. environment, being offset by a weak European market. Overall, this was a very good year for the industrial solutions segment and we expect 2015 to be a good year as well due to our strong position in these harsh environment markets.","Please turn to Page 7. In Q4, sales in the Network segment were down 3% versus the prior year due to declines in our SubCom business. Adjusted operating margins of 9% were down slightly from last year due to losses in SubCom. SubCom did grow 65% sequentially, and we are confident the business is now moving into a growth cycle. We now have 3 programs that have come into force. The AAE-1 project, which connects Asia, Africa and Europe, was announced in April. Last quarter, we announced the Hibernia project, which will connect New York and London. And then earlier this month, you should have seen an announcement regarding Project Monet [ph], which is a program involving Google that connects Latin America with the U.S. On a combined basis, these projects are worth over $900 million over the next 2 to 3 years and with that, we now expect SubCom revenues to grow approximately $300 million in 2015 based upon these programs.","So in a nutshell, the SubCom business is turning from a headwind into a tailwind in '15. Our Broadband Network Solutions business, consisting of Telecom and Enterprise, was roughly flat in the quarter. We did see some project delays in the U.S. and that was partially offset by continued growth in our data center -- in the data center market. For the full year 2014, BNS delivered organic sales growth of 3% and increased profitability. So it was a good steady -- a year of steady progress in our business in these markets. Our DataComm business was down slightly in Q4 due to a week market in Japan.","In Q1, we expect total Network Solutions revenues to be up low single digits versus the prior year as SubCom growth offsets slightly lower spending in the U.S. broadband market.","For the full year, we expect roughly 10% growth in Network Solutions, primarily due to the SubCom strength. And we also expect to deliver significant improvement in operating margins driven by these volume increases and continued productivity improvements.","Please turn to Slide 8. Performance in our Consumer business was in line with our expectations in Q4. Revenue was down slightly. We did see continued strength in our market-leading Appliance businesses, and this was offset by lower revenue in our Consumer Devices business. For the full year of 2014, organic revenue declined about 1%. That's similar to Q4, devices decline offset appliance growth. Adjusted operating margin exceeded 10% for the second consecutive year in this segment. For fiscal 2015, we expect this segment to deliver low single digit organic growth and a continued improvement in operating margins. We expect another good -- very good year in our appliance business and stable performance in Consumer Devices. Our devices strategy continues to be a selective one.","Now let me turn it over to Bob. He's going to cover the financials in more detail.","Robert W. Hau","Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Let me discuss earnings, which starts on Slide 9. Adjusted operating income was $571 million, up 6% versus the prior year. GAAP operating income was $521 million and included $17 million of restructuring and other charges, most of which were in the Network segment and $33 million of acquisition-related charges in the quarter. Full year restructuring and other charges were $59 million.","Adjusted operating margin was 16%, up 30 basis points from Q4 last year. And the improvement versus the prior year is driven by improved manufacturing productivity across the company and volume leverage in the Transportation and Industrial segments. Adjusted EPS were $1.02 and GAAP EPS were $1.60 for the quarter. GAAP EPS included the acquisition-related charges of $0.08, restructuring and other charges of $0.02, and a tax benefit of $0.68. The tax benefit primarily stems from the increased ability to utilize U.S. net operating losses based on forecasted future taxable income and the integration of SEACON.","For the full year 2015, I expect approximately $50 million to $75 million of restructuring and other charges reflecting $0.09 at the midpoint, roughly flat versus last year. We expect roughly $0.23 of charges associated with the recent acquisitions, which will be more than offset by reserve reversals from favorable tax settlement of non-intercompany debt pre-separation tax liabilities.","Turning to Slide 10. Our adjusted gross margin for the quarter was 33.6%. This is roughly flat versus the prior year and up 50 basis points excluding SubCom. Total operating expenses were $631 million in the quarter, with SG&A increasing versus the prior year to support growth initiatives but declining as a percentage of sales year-over-year.","On the right side of the slide, net interest expense was $31 million in the fourth quarter, and I expect $31 million of expense in the first quarter of 2015. Adjusted other income, which primarily relates to our tax sharing agreement was $6 million. And in the first quarter, I expect other income of about $8 million.","The GAAP income tax rate of minus 34% was driven by the one-time gain previously mentioned. The adjusted effective tax rate was 22.3% and I expect full year adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 24% for 2015.","Turning to Slide 11. I'll discuss our balance sheet and free cash flow. Cash flow from continuing operations was $754 million and our fee cash flow in the quarter was $661 million. Gross capital expenditures were roughly flat year-over-year. However, we did see a decline in net capital spending to $93 million. During the quarter, we sold an underutilized asset generating approximately $100 million of cash. I expect capital spending rate to be approximately 5% of sales in 2015.","Working capital was in line with our expectations, with receivable days outstanding at 61 days, inventory days on hand at 65 days, and payable days outstanding, 53 days.","Now let me discuss the sources and uses of cash outside of free cash flow, shown on the right side of the slide. We began the quarter with $1.6 billion of cash and increased this to $2.5 billion at the end of the quarter in anticipation of completing the Measurement acquisition, which closed on October 9. During the quarter, we utilized $504 million to support acquisitions, primarily SEACON. We also returned a total of $283 million to shareholders. We paid dividends of $119 million and repurchased 2.6 million shares for $164 million. Outstanding debt grew to $3.9 billion at the end of the quarter, reflecting the added debt for the Measurement Specialties acquisition.","Now I'll turn it back to Tom.","Thomas J. Lynch","Thanks, Bob. Please turn to Slide 12 and I'll cover our outlook. Although the environment is a bit more uncertain than 90 days ago, we do expect to deliver another solid quarter in Q1, with revenue of $3.46 billion to $3.56 billion, up 4% to 7% year-over-year and in line with our normal seasonal patterns. We expect adjusted EPS of $0.88 to $0.92, which is an increase of 7% to 12% year-over-year. Our Q1 outlook does include a headwind from currency exchange rates, which are negatively affecting our guidance by approximately $100 million in revenue and $0.03 to $0.04 per share in EPS versus the prior year.","In Q1, we expect 10% growth in transportation, including contributions from Measurement Specialties. We are assuming global auto production to be up 1% to 2%, which is what the industry is guiding to versus the prior year. We expect Industrial Solutions to be up mid-single digits versus last year, with solid growth in the U.S. and Asia more than offsetting softness in Europe. We expect double-digit growth in the Aerospace and Oil and Gas businesses driven by strong organic growth and revenue contribution from SEACON.","Network Solutions is expected to be up low single digits led by growth in our SubCom business as we discussed before with 3 programs now in force. And we expect our Consumer Solutions business to be down mid-single digits as growth in Appliances more than offset our continued slower device business.","Now please turn to Slide 13. Our strong performance across the company in 2014 positions us for another year of solid sales, profit and EPS growth as we enter fiscal '15. We have a number of catalysts for growth, including the secular growth of electronic content; the SubCom recovery; the tremendous design win momentum across our harsh environment businesses; and the contributions from acquisitions in sensors and oil and gas. We expect momentum in these areas to more than offset some of the weakness we're seeing in Europe and China and headwinds from currency exchange rates.","For the full year, we expect revenue of $14.7 billion to $15.3 billion, up 8% versus the prior year and reflecting 6% organic growth. We expected adjusted earnings per share of $4.05 to $4.35, an increase of 11% at midpoint. And our revenue and EPS guidance does include an approximate $400 million revenue and $0.15 a share EPS headwind due to the currency exchange rates versus the prior year that we mentioned earlier.","In Transportation, based on 2.5% to 3% vehicle production growth, we expect mid-single digit or better organic revenue growth and double-digit growth, including contributions from Measurement Specialties. We expect Industrial Solutions to be up mid-single digits versus last year on an organic and actual basis. The benefits of the SEACON acquisition are offsetting the negative impact of currency. Organically, we expect strong growth in our Aerospace and Oil and Gas businesses, single digit growth in Industrial Equipment and continued low single digit growth in Energy, which has most of its business in Europe. Network Solutions is expected to be up approximately 10% this year with most of the growth being driven by strength in the SubCom business. And we expect our Consumer Solutions business to be about flat versus last year with the same trends we've been seeing, strong performance in Appliances, which we expect in the low to mid-single digits and offset by slight declines in consumer devices.","We have covered a lot of ground today as always, and I'll make a few points before we move to Q&A. Despite the somewhat uncertain times we're in, and the indicators, as you all know, are bouncing around quite a bit, it feels like they're generally positive, more than negative, recently. But there is uncertainty out there. We feel the most important thing is that the underlying secular trends driving our business are very strong. And in this increasingly connected world, TE is really well positioned with our tremendous range of connectivity and sensor solutions that are so critical to that connected world. We also continue to strengthen the company's leadership in harsh application markets as we've said. And in 2015, this will account for approximately 75% of our total revenue. And we've made key acquisitions to broaden our TAM and give us more opportunity for growth.","Just as important as any of this, we continue to improve our execution, driven by our TEOA program, and you can see it in our operating margins exceeding 15%. Our net margins exceeding 11%. And in Q4, we're just under 12% and our cash flow meeting or exceeding 10% of revenue for the seventh consecutive year. So I feel like we have the operating side of this business moving very well. And we continue to have a balanced capital allocation program and expect to return about 2\/3 of free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchase.","So a very good year, and looking for another solid year in '15. So operator, let's now open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from the line of Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I have a question and a follow-up. I guess, Tom, maybe you can start with the Networking segment. You talked about how the funded backlog has gone up to about $900 million. Shall we talk about what is the total backlog number today, because I'm assuming it's much bigger than $900 million? And talking about the cycles starting to reaccelerate. The last time that we're in an up-cycle, revenues actually peaked, I think, at $320 million, $330 million, the revenues up. So I'm curious what's the backlog broadly? And do you think that level of peak could be feasible over the 2 years, maybe?","Thomas J. Lynch","Sure, Amit. The $900 million really relates to those 3 big projects. We have awards that aren't in backlog well above that. And as you know, as we've said before, we don't really put it into backlog until we have a down payment. So these 3, we also have a base level of maintenance business that goes on year in and year out, and it's more like a regular business where you get orders quarterly to do work for our customers. So this $900 million is really what's going to lift us from the level of what we were at last year in the $250 million to $300 million range, to the kind of the $550 million to $600 million range. We think it bodes very well for how the cycles, to the second part of your question, typically go. We have seen a pickup in bidding, so we would expect that this is really the indication of the cycle picking up and yes, it did peak at over $1 billion several years ago. When we model everything and the demands on bandwidth, the age of certain networks under the sea, the desire for more and more redundancy, it all says that this should be another very strong cycle.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Perfect. And then I guess, just as a follow-up, Bob, if you could maybe just talk about the Measurement Specialties acquisition. You have a few other things moving around in the models, it's unclear to me. But maybe you just talk about for fiscal '15? In the past, you had talked about $0.04 to $0.06 of accretion for Measurement. My math shows it's probably a $600 million-plus revenue, $0.10 accretion based on what you guys are talking about right now. So could you just maybe confirm that? And also just talk about what's the December quarter impact for Measurement? And if there are one-time charges like inventory adjustments and so on, that you intend to flow through the model for Measurement Specialties, I guess?","Robert W. Hau","Sure, Amit. First off, your numbers are essentially on what we described when we announced the acquisition of Measurement was, the business was, call it a, $550 million revenue business and we anticipated generating mid-single digit EPS of $0.04 to $0.06. With our guidance here in 2015, our revenue is about $600 million. Obviously, there's some growth in the market. We're seeing good content growth across the space. And from an EPS standpoint, it's probably about $0.10, a little bit better than we initially guided. Part of that is better performance. We've now have been doing some due diligence and integration -- pre-integration work, now owned it for a couple of weeks. And we're seeing slightly better performance coming into 2015, as well as there is some restructuring. And when we gave that $0.04 to $0.06, we indicated that did include some modest restructuring. There's not a big restructuring play with the acquisition, but there's some modest restructuring, and that will be dialed out. We're continuing with the $50 million to $75 million of restructuring that I talked that are in GAAP earnings but not adjusted earnings. It does include the integration or the restructuring that we'd have associated with Measurement. And in terms of impact to the December quarter, if you take those numbers and roughly divide by 4, there is some seasonality into that, but you won't be too far off. In terms of what's baked into the numbers, the near-term amortization of things like the inventory step-up and the backlog step-up will be excluded from earnings and included in GAAP but not included in adjusted earnings.","Operator","We do have a question from the line of Mike Wood from Macquarie.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Research","You gave a lot of color on the SubCom sales outlook. Can you just describe if there's anything unusual in the project recognition? I know you discussed this last quarter on the call, how the accounting may differ there and how profit margins might look throughout the year?","Thomas J. Lynch","Right. I think it's really -- Mike, thank you for the question. It's -- what we said -- said last time, that the business really goes in phases, especially when you're ramping up or ramping down. So ramping up in the beginning, you're doing a lot of planning. You're -- we now -- we've actually doubled the number of people at our New Hampshire factory where we build the cable for the projects that are on this side of the world. And so you typically have lower profitability early on. We do percentage of completion recognition, but just the nature of the business when you're early in the project and have 98% of it to complete, you'll -- what we've always been, is you're a little more conservative in the early part of project because you don't know what the unexpecteds are going to be. No change in how we do it. We would expect that as we ramp to the kind of $0.5 billion range, it's mid-single digit type of OI margins from where we are today. And then when we get back to the normal range, which is more that $650 million to $750 million, that's when you see it being in -- closer to the company average. So we actually expect the same patterns as last time.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Research","And then in terms of the following-up on network, x Subsea, you're guiding to relatively flat for next year. Can you maybe give some color on that maybe by region? I understand the U.S. Telco CapEx backdrop is challenging, but I know you're increasingly exposed to the higher growth fiber rollout.","Thomas J. Lynch","Sure. I expect it to be similar to this year. I'm hopeful that it will be better than that because I do believe in all the modeling we do that there's pent-up demand, but we have been off on that in our -- I've been off on that in our estimates of the last few years. The nice thing is the fiber\/copper crossover has happened, and so copper is a much smaller part of the total buildout and fiber continues to grow at double-digit, and that's really our sweet spot. It tends to be much more project oriented business. And this year, this past year, we saw strength in Europe. A couple of significant builds. We saw mixed in the U.S., I expect the U.S. to pick up in the second half because the newcomers into the U.S. market are starting to really build momentum and we are doing very, very well with them. So it is a little bit of a mixed bag, as you say. But I think we're positioned well, we're cost efficient in the business. It is a double-digit margin business that we've improved the last couple of years and we've really structured it to be a very low growth business but be able to take advantage and therefore, get the higher flow-throughs on the margin as we grow above low single digits. Does that get at your question?","Mike Wood - Macquarie Research","Yes, it does.","Operator","We do have a question from the line of Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.","Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","A question on MEAS, Tom. If you look at that company, they've been fairly acquisitive small deals prior to you guys taking them out, can you just talk about kind of the pipeline of M&A potential in that space? And then also, what MEAS does for TEL in terms of your sales approach and being more strategic to OEM customers.","Thomas J. Lynch","Sure. I'll answer the second part first because that's really the strategic theory behind the acquisition that we have all these resources at these customers. And not unusual when you're a smaller company, you have to be much more selective in who you go after. With us, we're in with all of them early in the architecture. So we're only 2 weeks officially into it, but our team, I know, is even more excited than they were 3 or 4 months ago, because we just see more and more of the depths of Measure's capabilities and products. And I think we feel very comfortable with the revenue synergies and we're getting more comfortable that, over time, it's going to probably be a little better than we thought. So that idea of our scale with the customer and resources in front of the customer, with their product line, is bearing out. It's still early, we have to deliver and all that, and nobody's taking anything for granted. And the teams are coming together very nicely. So that's -- I think that's as important as anything else. There seems to be real chemistry and the MEAS team is taking a significant leadership role in the business. The second part, the acquisition pipeline. Yes, I mean, we're still -- our #1 priority is to make MEAS and AST successful, get them integrated, no question about it. At the same time, where we can see opportunities that make sense to round out what we have, we're going to be in those conversations. But our team knows that the #1 priority is to integrate this and make this one team and very successful as we laid out when we announced the acquisition. And that is why we went with a company like MEAS that had that broad range, so that we could -- we didn't have to -- they did the roll-up and we didn't want to have to get into that kind of strategy in order to become a major sensor player. So don't be surprised as we add on to the portfolio with sensors, but #1 priority is clearly to execute what we have now.","Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Very clear. And as a follow-up, you mentioned some near-term uncertainty in the environment. So granted, it looks like you have some growth drivers to kind of help you get through. But on the environment, any other color you can add in terms of just what you're hearing from customers, how they're managing inventory and kind of how business trended September into October here?","Thomas J. Lynch","Yes, sure. As you can imagine, we've been -- we're always in front of the customer, but I have been talking to a lot more customers than normal lately, and part of that is just around what are you seeing out there, and that's the first question they ask me, too. So I don't think anybody has any particular advantage. It's mixed. I think we've seen, we saw late in the fourth quarter and early in the first quarter, the order rate dip, but then it's picked up. The last couple of weeks, how much the big dip in the stock market affected everybody's psyche. I know that seemed to make everybody a little, including us, more nervous, as that's going to have people get more cautious. But I'd say there's some positive indicators that doesn't mean there isn't uncertainty, but European car registrations are still positive, right? I think I would -- we would've been worried they were going to dip into the negative. So that's a really good thing. The consumer confidence in the U.S. is up. So that's a positive thing. It's always hard to call China, but we're coming off a double-digit growth in China again. So I'd say it feels a little more uncertain than when I was talking to you 90 days ago, but you can't put your finger on it. It's not as if, \"Wow, something has really dropped off.\" And in our biggest business, Transportation, steady as she goes with the order rate. So that's kind of it. I think we expect, no question, that our businesses with our customers in Europe will be a little bit slower in '15 than '14. I mean they were pretty robust in '14 and probably a little bit slower in China. But it's not -- it's slower growth, it's not decline. And we think that'll be offset with a little bit better in the U.S. and then these other tailwinds we have, like the acquisitions and SubCom. It feels like a pretty, obviously, we think it's a balanced look right now. It's always hard to guide next year at this time of the year when we're only in October, and nobody else is out there really talking about it officially, but that's how we see it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Amitabh Passi from UBS.","Amitabh Passi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Tom, I had a question and a follow-up. I wanted to go back to Network Solutions. If I look at that segment, I think x Subsea, we have peak sales in fiscal '11 at about $3.1 billion. Your guidance for fiscal '15 implies $2.6 billion. So we're still down about 15%. Just wondering, is there anything else you need to do in the segment in terms of rightsizing the cost structure? Do you feel the rest of the segment is fairly optimal? Because it still seems like structurally, we're well below where we were 4 years ago.","Thomas J. Lynch","Yes, a couple of points there. As Bob mentioned, I think Bob mentioned, if he didn't he probably will. We have been doing that. So both with -- since the revenue hasn't materialized as we expected. We certainly have been doing a significant amount of that and a large portion of our restructuring in the past year was geared at that segment. We -- it's really a few things. I feel like in the Broadband space, we're very well positioned. We have an excellent product line, we're winning a higher rate of fiber awards than we did 3 or 4 years ago because -- and it really is the benefit of the ADC acquisition. But no question, the market has been a lot softer than I thought. So you have a little bit of that, and we have taken a fair amount of cost out in response to that. And we're evaluating. But right now, I think, we feel like we're close to being at the right place from a cost structure. Because I am hesitant, having lived through the automotive downturn when we decided we're going to invest and certainly not cut, that it helped us. Now I know this is a different market, it's more volatile and it's not an automotive market, but we also don't want to cut into muscle yet, that's how I feel about the business. And I'm getting more optimistic about the outlook. The DataComm business is really a bigger issue for us because we had -- we always trailed in sort of this mid-speed communication product line and we made the decision many years ago to go to high-speed and sort of do a leapfrog strategy. We have a pretty good 25-gig plus product range in fiber and copper. It's adapting -- being adopted, I should say, very slowly in the market given all the change that's going on in the Communications Equipment market. So a little bit of a double whammy on us that we -- and we're still investing and I'm not ready to back-off the investment in high-speed because I think that would be shortsighted at this point. And so we're still investing. And the high-speed market hasn't really materialized. In the mid-speed where we're weak, we're not benefiting there. So DataComm is a business that's a mid-single digit kind of margin business. SubCom will get back to its normal over-the-cycle solid double-digit and that's strictly cycle, because we're executing well there. And BNS, which is $2 billion of that network segment for us, total revenue is $2 billion, that's low double-digits, which is up 2 years in a row. So I do feel like, for sure, the cost actions we're taking are paying off. And we're poised. We have a great product line as things pick up a little bit to really capitalize on it.","Amitabh Passi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And just a quick follow-up for me, Tom, just on the Subsea business. As we move to higher-speed rates of 100-gig, 200-gig, 400-gig, do you feel you guys have the active electronics portfolio fairly well established, or is there scope there for partnership and maybe even M&A?","Thomas J. Lynch","I feel like we have it fairly well -- very well established. I mean, we have led in the long-haul fiber transmission since it started. And this was a -- 15, 18 years ago really an AT&T-type, Bell Labs business. And that's the heritage and DNA we still have in that business. And it's an extraordinary group of talented engineers in North Jersey. So they are constantly driving the distances and the cost-per-bit down, and doing a lot of other things to enable our customers to have dedicated links within the cables providing tremendous amount of flexibility. So I do feel very confident about that. There's no guarantees, obviously, but we have not -- that's another one where even with the down cycle, and this team knows from being in it from the very beginning, you have to keep pushing the technology through the down cycle and we've done that. So I feel good about our position there.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt Sheerin from Stifel.","Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","I just wanted to ask a question to clarify the restructuring charges. Bob, you talked about, for FY '15. How much of that is related to acquisitions versus other activities?","Robert W. Hau","What we described was $50 million to $75 million of expenses over the year, roughly in line at the midpoint of that with what we spent in 2014. And what we said is really an ongoing level of restructuring. Obviously, we have been investing significantly higher than that in prior years, but we think this business and the way the markets run, that $50 million to $75 million of spending is kind of a run rate. And roughly, 15% of that or so is associated with acquisitions. Again, none of our -- the larger acquisitions, SEACON, Measurement and AST, which is a smaller one for that matter, not a lot of significant cost takeout. It's more of adding to our portfolio and getting the revenue synergies, but there's a bit of that coming through in 2015.","Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","So for the business, then, is that still predominantly focused on the networking area where you've been focusing your restructuring efforts, or is it just tweaking across the business?","Robert W. Hau","It's tweaking across the business, if you look at the spending that we did in 2014, we spent about $60 million, almost 60% of that was in networks alone. And as you look at our businesses, those that have below company average margins and below our margin expectations, networks and consumers, obviously, those are ones that we're looking more closely at for cost opportunities.","Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, that's great. And just another question on Measurement Specialties, if I can. Just regarding, Tom, the cross-selling opportunities. I know the big opportunity is to cross-sell that technology into passenger vehicles. What kind of time horizon or opportunity are we talking about in terms of the selling cycles?","Thomas J. Lynch","I would say, on average, it's going to be 2 to 3 years. There's some opportunities that will be in the 2-year range. The really sweet opportunities are more in the 3-year range just because that's just the typical design-in cycle. So in our model, when we bought them, we did not have any significant revenue from automotive until Year 3. We also have, across the portfolio, and it's primarily in the harsh businesses, but opportunities in Appliance, opportunities in Industrial Equipment and Industrial Transportation, much longer cycle in ADNM, so they're not really baked into sort of the model for the acquisition. But what's really potent about having both -- having a full range of sensors too, not just 1 or 2 technologies, but having a full range, having thin seen gauge wire, all the connectivity that we have, our material science-based businesses, that connect and protect things. When we go into a customer now, we can really offer some creative solutions on how to solve problems, the next generation of appliances, how do you substantially simplify the wiring harness, which if you look inside an appliance, I mean, it's kind of mind-numbing, the complexity of it, which makes repairs very complicated. So there's just so many opportunities. And what we're doing is we're being very deliberate with it because we don't want to get it out of focus. So it's prioritizing one at a time, getting success, and that's what we had baked into the acquisition. But we're very excited because it just opens up so much more of the customers' footprint, so to speak, or their real estate, so to speak, to us.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jim Suva with Citi.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I just wanted to clarify, on your Q1 guidance for the Transportation sector. If I back out the Measurements acquisition, are we looking at revenues kind of being flat to maybe up 1% year-over-year? And if so, that seems like a below market or kind of what's going on there, is my math's incorrect?","Thomas J. Lynch","I think -- I know it's murky. We don't have MEAS for the full quarter. But what we have in there for organic growth is right around 5% based on -- it's in that 4.5% to 5% range based on a 2% to 3% -- I should say, 1% to 2% production range. And right now, as I mentioned earlier, the order rate in that business is very solid. So no, we wouldn't expect our -- we're not seeing anything that would say that we're going to drift down into low single-digit organic growth.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great. And then with the gradual adoptions of more hybrid technology, more sensors, electronics in cars and electronic cars, is there a chance that the typical content range starts to increase the higher end or even above that higher end of the range? Or is there other obsolescences going on that will just keep it within that normal historical range? I think historically, connectors have grown, with kind of 6% to 8%, less a 2% ASP decline, is that the way to think of it?","Thomas J. Lynch","It's in the ballpark. I definitely think if there's more, let's say, there's more likelihood of it moving to the higher end of the range than the lower end of the range, I mean, that's clearly what we're seeing. And we're at every OEM in virtually every electronic application. And that doesn't really -- today, we have, plus or minus -- in the ballpark of $60 million of our content, connectivity-related content. $60, I mean, per car roughly. We have $2 of sensor content. So about -- what we would estimate is somewhere in the neighborhood of 1% of the sensor market and now, we're going to bring in a full range of sensors and just the constant march of more electronics. I mean, every time you try to move the emission standards up, the engine control units get more sophisticated, the semiconductors have more pins, and the kind of connectors that go with them are very sophisticated and more valuable. So it's almost -- I agree with you. I would continue to see that move up. And that's certainly -- our strategic plan assumes that, and that's why we continue to invest aggressively in engineering in that business, and in M&A.","Robert W. Hau","Jim, it's Bob. I think I heard you say 6% to 8% content growth less 1% to 2% price. It's more like 4% to 6% content is what we've traditional seen. But as Tom points out, with some of the content growth and the growth in electronics and sensors, we'll see it at the upper end of that 4% to 6% range.","Operator","We do have a question from the line of Shawn Harrison with Longbow Research.","Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC","I wanted to get, I guess, looking at out over the next, say, 24 to 36 months with Measurement Specialties. In terms of just profitability, the implication is, maybe a mid-teens EBIT margin for this year based upon the updated guidance. Where do you think you can get that within the next 12 to 24 months? Should we be at a mid-20s EBIT margin, or is that too aggressive?","Thomas J. Lynch","Time frame again, Shawn?","Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC","I would say within 24 months, run rate exiting 2 years from now.","Thomas J. Lynch","EBITDA range?","Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC","EBIT, EBITDA, either one is fair.","Thomas J. Lynch","I think, think of it this way. We would expect to improve it somewhere in the neighborhood of 200 basis points a year to 250 basis points, but the volume leverage being the biggest thing because it's not so much a cost play, as we said. And as we bring their products into the more attractive markets, which are the harsh environment markets. So there'll be some -- there'll be steady margin improvement in the next 24 months. But as we get designed into auto and into these other more harsh environments, that's when I would expect it to accelerate.","Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC","And this year, the EBITDA margin would actually be upper teens, then? Is that the correct number to use?","Robert W. Hau","Mid- to upper teens is about right.","Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And then I just want to focus in on the Consumer Solutions business. Appliances, you're doing fine. Consumer Devices, itself, we know the struggle. But I mean, what is the outlook, if we look over the next 12 to 24 months within that business, what can you either do to improve profitability or do you, at some point in time, walk away from the business, given the challenges you've faced so far?","Thomas J. Lynch","Sure. The Appliance business, we're doing very well in. That is one of our best businesses and we are very -- feel very confident we grew faster than the market. And I was just listening to one of our big customers talk yesterday and their growth rates by market, and we're exceeding them in every market. So we're getting designed in and around the world at a faster rate than ever before and it's an excellent business. And it's a very harsh environment business in most appliances. In devices, think of us as retrenching -- I can't imagine us exiting it, because the products that we develop there, they do find their way into other applications, outside of the Consumer -- the Consumer applications. So in that business, that's where we get miniaturization. The smallest products we design, that's where you get, -- you usually have your initial breakthroughs on how you optimize the metals that you use, where automation often comes in first, kind of breakthrough automation. So the way I think of it is the core connectivity part of the business is strategic to the company. It would be a flank that I would not leave open, given that it's the devices, the pure devices part of the business is 5% of the company-type level. I think our core connector business in there is a decent business. It's the products around that, that are not quite where we need them to be at. So that's a business, as Bob mentioned, we've taken cost out of. A business that we continue to be very selective, much more selective on what we bid on than we were 2 or 3 years ago. So don't be surprised if they get smaller with better margins before it gets larger.","Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. Is the business profitable currently, the devices?","Thomas J. Lynch","Yes, it is.","Operator","We do have a question from the line of William Stein with SunTrust.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","I'm hoping you can talk about the book-to-bill specifically, Tom. Earlier, you mentioned that orders took a dip in the quarter. I think you said they had recovered. Book-to-bill is below 1 overall and below 1 x SubCom in most of the segments as well. Is that sort of typical performance? Or if you contemplate that, including the more recent changes, let's say into the beginning of the current quarter, do those numbers look better? Is it more in line with typical? How should we think about that?","Thomas J. Lynch","Sure. I would say when you look at Q4 on a typical book-to-bill for Q4, but a little mix in there, probably a little better in Transportation and a little lighter in Industrial. And it's really, those are the business where the book-to-bill, I think, is most indicative. In our Networks and SubCom business it doesn't really mean that much because you can get releases against a big project. And so -- and book-to-bill at a moment in time, doesn't mean that much. As we -- the book-to-bill is positive so far in the first quarter. It's too early to read into that, but I'd say the last couple of week's orders look more like what we'd expect in a solid economy. But that's got to last. And as I said earlier, even when things are less uncertain, I'm always a little more nervous at this time in our quarter, because we come into the holidays and our Industrial and Automotive businesses are sizable in Europe. And we've seen occasionally, over time, unpredictability in the length of holidays, so I don't think it's anything unusual, but it's just, this is the hardest time of the year for us to call. But I'd say book-to-bills aren't really different from what we would expect, and that's why we are guiding the way we're guiding.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. Maybe the next one is for Bob. I'm wondering if you can comment on FX. It seems to explain about all the difference between your guidance and what was, I think, broadly expected if you include Measurement? But I thought that you had been hedging FX. I'm a little surprised that it's having such a near-term effect?","Thomas J. Lynch","Well, where we are, in fact, naturally hedged is on the transactional side of FX. So because we are very global in both our factory footprint, our sales footprint and our customer footprint, we buy and sell in typically the same currency, so we're largely naturally hedged. The FX impact that we're talking about, that impacted us in Q4, and now forecasted to impact us into 2015 is the translational side. We do not hedge translational. It's an accounting issue, it's not a free cash flow issue. And so the impact that we've talked about, the $400 million on revenue and the $0.15 on a full year basis is what we're seeing given the pretty significant strength in the dollar against essentially all currencies, but particularly for us, euro, yen and RMB are more of the big drivers for us.","Operator","We do have a question from the line of Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs.","Mark Trevor Delaney - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I know, Tom, you already talked about some of the sales opportunity with Measurement and the ability to cross-sell a broader range of products to some of the customers. I was hoping bit you could just also talk about the roadmap for products going forward. Is there any thought about doing integrated products where you'd be selling a full solution of a sensor with a connector, maybe, and some software on it, and moving further up the value chain?","Thomas J. Lynch","Sure. I would say, again, since we just completed the acquisition and while we did pre-integration planning and all those kinds of things, you can't really get inside until the deal closed. But having said that, part of our strategic objective is to be more than just a sensor seller. More than just well, we'll now carry -- we're already carrying a bag with connectors into the customer, now, we'll put sensors in the bag. That's the earliest. So the first synergy is through the channel. The second synergy is, hey, we just have more access to customers, as I've described earlier. But we do believe, absolutely with customers wanting fewer suppliers to simplify their world and suppliers who can provide more, so that they can get more value, which in some cases, it's, hey, I want a the solution that gives me less cost, or I want a solution that gives me less weight or less footprint. The more integration you can do, the better we will be. So I would say in the first year, think of it as experiments we'll be doing, right? We'll be picking a couple of customers, it's not going to be revenue in the near term. But seeing what's practical, what's doable, what's practical. But we already see from modules we do in some of our businesses, when we can integrate wire connectors and build a box for the customer that's smaller than if they had to do it themselves, there's value in that. So we definitely see that as a longer-term strategic objective. Now, we have to prove the theory.","Operator","We do have a question from the line of Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America.","Wamsi Mohan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Tom, your comments indicate better U.S. outlook versus Europe and China in 2015. But when I look at the fourth quarter results on an organic basis that you just reported, it appears that the largest incremental year-on-year contribution actually came from APAC followed by EMEA and then U.S. was only $10 million incremental. So what are you seeing that would explain this reversal? And how much of it is potentially SubCom? And I have a follow-up.","Thomas J. Lynch","What I would say on that, Wamsi, is it's all -- what I mean, I'm talking from a relative perspective. So for us, Asia grew 7% to 8% for the year last year. China, over 11%. I think that's going to be down a little bit. Not a lot. For us, Europe grew the year, 5 percent-ish. I think that's going to be down a little bit. Again, it's still going to grow because of our strength with the German automakers and the amount that they export, et cetera. I think in the U.S., we'll expect to see the Appliance business continue to be solid. The Energy business, which really began to pick up in the second half of the year for us in the U.S., we see that trend continuing as there's pent-up maintenance and expansion there that we're benefiting from. I think Auto will probably be -- it's hard to call it flat. It was very strong last year, so slightly down. So that's really how I kind of see it. It's not that -- Asia will continue to grow -- have a higher growth rate than the U.S. because of the demographics over there. It's just relative change in growth year-over-year. That's really what I meant. I don't know if that gets at your question.","Wamsi Mohan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes, yes, that's helpful, Tom. And Bob, can you maybe address what the hedge levels for copper and gold are? And what sort of margin benefit, if any, you're expecting in your guidance from metals pricing?","Robert W. Hau","Yes, so we hedge our copper, silver and gold on a monthly basis. So we look at our demand 18 months out, we take a position every month. So for the 2015 fiscal year, we'll probably call it 60%, 65% hedged for our overall demand. Tailwind, we had a really nice tailwind in 2014. It's a little bit less than that in 2015, call it, right now, about $20 million, $30 million of OI tailwind on a fiscal year basis.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank.","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Tom, I just wanted to ask you about the operating margin. If you look at the guidance for fiscal '15, it suggests operating margin somewhere in the range of 16%. And you guys have talked about 15-plus percent. How much of that upside to margins this year is driven by the improvement in the Subsea business? And what do you see as your sort of long-term operating margin at this point through the cycle?","Thomas J. Lynch","Sure, Sherri. There's going to be a lift on operating margin because it was such a drag with SubCom losing money. But SubCom will be still be, next year, below the company's average operating margin. So you do get some relative improvement, but it's still below the company average. I think the best way to think about operating margins for the company, and now that we really got the operations of the company tuned up and the footprint in good shape, is that if we're growing in this 5% to 6% to 7% range, we don't have unusual movements in metals or exchange rates. You have kind of some natural movements, let's say, that track to inflation. Then, in the 50 basis points per year range, I would expect to growth in that.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Steven Fox with Cross Research.","Steven Bryant Fox - Cross Research LLC","Just a couple of clarifications. Tom, based on what you've said so far in the call, are you're saying that SubCom lost more money in the quarter because of these program startups, or were you able to reduce the losses quarter-on-quarter? And if you could give us a hint in when it turns profitable again. And just to be clear, what currency rates are you using in your new full year guidance?","Thomas J. Lynch","Thanks, Steve. No, SubCom -- SubCom lost a little bit of money in the fourth quarter, less than the third quarter. And we'll start to get a little above breakeven in the first quarter, but it's a really good question to help us clarify. You'll start to see the momentum in SubCom in Q2 and beyond, because that's when the ships are really out there, not fully utilized, but a lot more utilized than we are today, laying the cable. So bottomed in Q3 in terms of profitability, started to see the revenue ramp in Q4, but not a whole lot of profit -- but enough profit with it to substantially help the bottom line and then beginning to get into the black in Q1 and then accelerate past there. So that's the way I think about SubCom. Bob, do you want to talk about FX?","Robert W. Hau","Yes, in terms of FX, we're essentially looking at the current FX rate. So call it $1.27 or so to the euro. We project that out for the -- we don't take a position on what's going to happen on currency. So if there's additional fluctuation, good or bad, that could impact the overall business. But of course, we've had a pretty significant decline in, call it, the last 30, 60 days of improvement, strengthening of the U.S. dollar, order of magnitude 7%, 8%. And that is baked into this outlook.","Sujal Shah","So there's no further questions, I'll just turn it back to Tom for a couple of closing comments.","Thomas J. Lynch","Thanks, Sujal. Thanks, everybody, for joining. Just to reiterate, we really had an excellent year, I think, in 2014. And as much as the financial performance, I feel like it's the execution of our strategy, which is to really build strong performance in for the long, long haul. I feel we're doing that. And I think you can see that, hopefully, in how we're guiding in an uncertain '15 with multiple levers, and importantly, going from 2 segments delivering most of the momentum to now 3 segments in '15, and a good portion of the consumer segment within Appliance. So I feel like we're hitting on most cylinders then. It's exciting because we still have a lot of opportunity and plenty of room to improve. So with that, I hope everybody has a good end of the year as we go into the holiday season, and I'm sure we'll be talking to you soon.

With me today are Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Lynch, President Terrence Curtin, Chief Financial Officer, Bob Hau.","During the course of this call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information.

Thanks everybody for joining us today. Over the next half hour, I will be providing a state of the company update, essentially a 2015 year-end review. I will also share our view of the economic environment in terms of what we see today and what we expect over the next year. Terrence Curtin, our President will discuss our business performance in detail. Bob Hau, our CFO will cover the highlights of Q4 and full-year financial performance and I will wrap up with the details of our guidance and key underlying assumptions.","2015 was a very important year for TE. We made excellent progress on our strategy of expanding our leadership position in harsh environment connectivity and establishing a leading position in the sensor market. Economic cycles will ebb and flow, but we believe the strong secular trend of electronic content growth has a very long runway, especially in harsh environments, where we have focused the company.","TE has the broadest range of connectivity and sensor products and we are very well positioned to take advantage of this secular trend. During the year, we strengthened our position in harsh markets with a significant level of design wins across our harsh portfolio, most notably in our automotive business. We expect that over the long-term we will generate sales growth of 6% to 8% in our core auto connectivity products on 2% to 3% vehicle production growth, which is a forecast for the next five years.","In fiscal 2015, we completed the integration of our Sensor acquisition. Our hypothesis underlying these acquisitions was that our unmatched presence across virtually every industry, coupled with the broad technology range we are acquired would enable us to grow faster than the market and eventually expand into integrated solutions. This is playing out very well in our designing pipeline is growing rapidly.","In August of this year, we completed the sale of our BNS business for $3 billion, several months ahead of our original schedule. With this divestiture, our portfolio is now 80% focused on harsh environment applications and approximately 90% of our business is connectivity and sensors and we have strengthened scale in all the markets we serve. As Bob will share more detail and as we communicated earlier this year, we expect to use the proceeds of the BNS sale on share buyback, which we believe is a great $3 billion investment of our capital.","Now please turn to slide three for some more details on fiscal year 2015. 2015 was a year of very good performance across the majority of our business. Organic sales were up 4% and were up 10% on a constant currency basis. This growth was driven by our harsh businesses and the beginnings of a new growth cycle in SubCom, which more than offset the declining revenue in our data and devices business as we reposition in that business.","Adjusted earnings per share of $3.60 was up 9% and up 19% on a constant currency basis. We delivered 80 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion on 4% organic growth exceeding our long-term model of 50 basis points of operating margin expansion on 5% to 7% organic growth.","Adjusted operating margins exceeded 16% for the first time, reflecting a healthy portfolio and strong productivity performance driven by our TEOA business process. We also continued our balance and disciplined approach to capital allocation, returning $1.7 billion to our shareholders. We increased the dividend by 14% this past March and repurchased 18 million shares.","Now please turn to slide four for a summary of Q4 results. Q4 was a challenging quarter as we saw further slowing of orders since our last call, reflecting weakness in China slowing in most of our industrial markets. Revenue of $3 billion was flat on an organic basis and up 6% on a constant currency basis, but slightly below our guidance range. Adjusted EPS of $0.90 was up 2% over the prior year and up 15% on a constant currency basis and at the low end of our guidance range.","Please turn to slide five for brief overview of Q4 order trends, which will help frame our segment results and guidance. This slide shows our fourth quarter sequential order trends. As you can see orders dropped significantly in Q4 and declined roughly $200 million versus our expectations when we provided Q4 guidance in July. We typically see a seasonal decline, but this was much larger than expected. China orders fell for the third consecutive quarter and are now running almost 15% below last year's rate with the slowdown impacting all markets.","We also saw a significant decline in global industrial orders due to a generally weaker growth outlook and the resulting typical contraction of inventory, both with OEMs and in the distribution channel. Recent order patterns and feedback from customers indicate that the majority of this slowdown appears to be a near-term adjustment due to lower levels of demand as opposed to a more profound downturn. And reinforcing this, we are not seeing cancellations or de-booking of orders. Looking forward, we expect continued economic growth in both the U.S. and Europe and as a result, would expect the industrial and distribution inventory correction to be largely behind us by the end of our second quarter.","China is a bit harder to call as the Chinese economy is going through several transitions and is being impacted by the slowing industrial growth rate in most of the world. But China does continue to show strength in its consumer driven economy and our assumption is that our China businesses will bottom in Q1 and will return to growth in the second half. And it was very encouraging to see new car sales in China return to growth in September.","With that backdrop, I will now turn it over to Terrence to cover each of our businesses in more detail.","Terrence Curtin","Thanks, Tom and good morning, everyone. If you could please turn to slide six for me to review transportation solutions. Overall our transportation solutions segment performed very well in fiscal 2015. Revenues of $6.4 billion was up 4% at both actual end rates as well as organic rates. Our adjusted operating margins were 20.4%. Once again we delivered growth above the market due to the secular driver of content growth, along with new platform wins across our global customer base.","In the fourth quarter, revenues in the segment grew 2% organically. Our auto business grew 3% organically in a flat global vehicle production environment. Growth in the auto business was driven by Europe and the U.S. as well as Asia Pacific outside of China. Our sales in China during the quarter were essentially flat. Our auto business is exceptionally healthy with a rich pipeline of new platform ramps from design wins generated over the past several years that will continue to drive growth well above the market.","From an order prospective, during the quarter we did see the slowdown in China we discussed last quarter and our order stabilized in the fourth quarter with the third quarter levels. These order trends, however, will affect our first quarter sales as China was very strong in the first quarter last year. For 2016, we expect China vehicle production to be up only 2% compared to 2015 and longer-term we expect China auto production growth in the range of 5% to 7%.","As expected, our commercial transportation business was down in the quarter due to the continued weakness in the global construction and agricultural markets with Europe being the only bright spot where we had growth in that market. We do expect the commercial transportation market will remain weak in 2016.","In our sensors business, we continue to build momentum and deliver strong performance. If you assume we have owned Measurement Specialties and AST in 2014, our total year-on-year organic growth in sensor would have been 12% in the fourth quarter. We have new design wins and a solid pipeline with the technology leaders in automotive, industrial and consumer markets. And to support the design win momentum and continued growth ahead of market, we expect to continue to invest aggressively as we build scale, supporting new design wins and adding to our unmatched customer facing sales and engineering resources.","And finally, on an adjusted operating income level, the segment's income was $306 million in the fourth quarter, which was approximately flat with the prior year as we expected.","If you could please turn to page seven so I can discuss industrial solutions segment. As Tom mentioned, we saw a slowing across several of the markets in the segment during the fourth quarter. When you look at the segment, 2015 started well but became more challenging as we moved through the year. The overall industrial market space slowed as a result of the oil and gas market decline and then by China slowing later in the year. To illustrate the trend we experienced, our organic growth in the segment was 4% in the first half of 2015 and in the fourth quarter we just experienced a decline of 7%.","For the year, segment revenue of $3.2 billion was down 4% overall and flat on an organic basis, while adjusted operating margins were 13.5%. Geographically markets were mixed with organic growth in Asia, offsetting declines in the U.S., that were driven primarily by the oil and gas declines we experienced of 30%.","From an end market perspective, the commercial air and medical markets do remain strong. The defense and energy and this energy does not include oil and gas remains flattish. And the real area that has slowed since our last call is the general industrial space with lower demand for factory equipment in connection with China's slowing. Our orders in the fourth quarter, as Tom highlighted, do reflect supply chain adjustments that are current both at our OEM and distribution channel partners. During the quarter, revenue in the segment declined 7% organically year-over-year versus an assumption of low single digit decline when we provided our guidance in July.","Industrial equipment was down 3% organically in the quarter with 11% reduction in orders as we began to experience the effects of the slowing both in China and in the U.S. with our OEM and distribution partners. In our aerospace, defense and oil and gas business, we continue to see strength in commercial air that is partially offsetting an approximate 40% decline in our oil and gas business that results in an 11% organic decline for AD&M in total. For our energy business, it did decline 5% organically in the quarter driven entirely by China, while the Americas and Europe remained stable.","Adjusted operating income for the segment was $110 million in the fourth quarter, which was down 23% year-over-year, due to the sales decline, currency translation and significant declines in our higher margin oil and gas and distribution business.","Please turn to slide eight so I can talk about communications solutions. Our communications solutions segment is a tale of two businesses in 2015, with growth in SubCom more than offsetting the planned declines as we continue to reposition our data and devices business. In the fourth quarter, revenue for the segment of $684 million was up 1% overall and 5% organically. Adjusted operating margins expanded 450 basis points exceeding 10%. And this strong operational performance is led by the SubCom growth from our program wins and restructuring savings that we have been driving in data and devices.","2015 was the beginning of a multiyear growth cycle for SubCom, with revenues just above $700 million. Based on the timing of the ramps of new projects, we expect to generate annual revenues between $700 million and $1 billion through this multiyear growth cycle. Our current backlog of programs in force is approximately $1 billion which reflect the completion of a large program at 2015. For 2016, we expect to grow SubCom high single digits year-over-year based on the timing of the project ramps and projects we see in the pipeline.","And lastly, in the fourth quarter, our data and devices and appliance businesses were both affected by China slowing and the supply chain adjustments by our distribution partners, which are expected to last through our March quarter. Additionally data and devices growth was impacted by product exits initiated in 2015 as part of the repositioning effort. These product exits will impact revenue by approximately $30 million per quarter in the first half of 2016 and then tail off in the second half.","Now let me turn it back over to Bob to cover the financials.","Bob Hau","Thanks, Terence and good morning, everyone.","Please turn to slide nine. It will provide more details on earnings. Adjusted operating income was strong at $488 million, up 12% in constant currency, including $60 million of foreign currency headwinds, operating income was flat with prior year. GAAP operating income was $407 million and included $11 million of acquisition related charges, $28 million of restructuring charges driven by data and devices, as well as oil and gas and $43 million of other charges related to the BNS divestiture.","Adjusted earnings per share was $0.90 for the quarter, $0.02 above prior year with strong operational performance on lower sales, incremental benefit from share buyback and negative impact of currency exchange rates. GAAP EPS was $0.34 for the quarter and included acquisition related charges of $0.03, expense from tax items of $0.40 and restructuring and other charges of $0.13. For the full year 2016, I expect approximately $75 million of restructuring charges.","We ended 2015 with a full-year GAAP income tax rate of 21.4% and an adjusted effective tax rate of 22.3%. I expect the full-year adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 23% to 24% for 2016.","Now turning to slide 10. Our adjusted gross margin in the quarter was 32.5%. It was negatively impacted by lower volume and lower sales of high margin products, including those in the distribution channel. Adjusted operating margins expanded 50 basis points driven by productivity from TEOA, restructuring savings and cost management. Total operating expenses were $482 million in the quarter and down 9% from the previous year, primarily driven by benefits of one-time expense reductions and overall cost control.","We are making reductions in discretionary spending, but also continue to invest in harsh businesses as we see the slowdown as temporary. As a result, we do expect operating expenses to rise sequentially in Q1 as we get back to a typical quarterly run rate. In the quarter, cash from continuing operations was $540 million and our free cash flow was $389 million. On June 4, 2014, we received $100 million benefit from the sale of an underutilized asset which impacts the year-over-year comparisons with the cash flow.","Gross capital expenditures were down $15 million year-over-year and expect capital spending rate to be approximately 5% of sales for 2016. We continue to have a balanced capital allocation strategy. In 2015, we returned $1.7 billion to our shareholders of which $759 million was returned in Q4. During the quarter, we bought back 10 million shares, roughly half of which came from the proceeds of the Broadband Networks divestiture. Since 2007, we reduced our outstanding share count by approximately 20% and expect to continue reducing share count in 2016. Now we have added a balance sheet and cash flow summary in the appendix for additional details.","I will turn it back over to Tom.","Tom Lynch","Thanks Bob. Please turn to slide 11 and I will cover guidance at a high level and we do have some additional details provided in the slide deck in the back. As we mentioned earlier, in the last 90 days we have seen demand further weaken particularly in China and across many industrial markets. This drove the weak Q4 orders I discussed earlier and translates to a soft Q1. We now expect Q1 revenue of $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion, down 8% from the prior year and adjusted EPS of $0.72 to $0.80, down approximately 15% year-over-year.","We do expect continued growth in the U.S. and European automotive market, commercial aerospace and in SubCom. This will be more than offset by broad-based inventory reductions in the channel and continued softness in China. Q1 is also impacted significantly by negative FX translation which is more than offsetting the benefits of the share repurchase on EPS.","Please turn to slide 12. For the full year, we expect revenue of $12.4 billion, up 1% versus the prior year and reflecting 3% organic growth at the midpoint. Our adjusted EPS guidance is $4, representing a year-over-year growth of 11% at midpoint. Our guidance does include the impact of a 53rd week in our fiscal year, which includes approximately $200 million in revenue, $0.05 in EPS. It also includes the benefit of share buyback and the negative impact of currency exchange rates. On a constant currency basis, revenue is expected to grow a little over 4% and adjusted EPS is expected to grow by 14% year-over-year.","Our full year outlook is based on the following market and regional assumptions. In transportation, we expect mid single-digit actual and organic growth. We are assuming that global auto production is roughly flat year-over-year with the first half being down slightly and the second half up 1% to 2%. We expect China to return to approximately 2% production growth in the second half. Longer-term, we do expect China auto production to be in the 5% to 7% range. We expect another year of strong growth in our sensors business and we expect that the commercial transportation market will remain weak.","In industrial, we are assuming low single digit actual and organic growth. We assume that global industrial demand stabilizes in the 1% to 2% growth range and as a result inventories come into balance by the end of Q2 ending the negative supply chain effect on our business. We are also assuming that the oil and gas markets remain weak.","In communications, we assume low single digit actual and organic decline, with growth in SubCom and appliances being more than offset by product exits in data and devices as well as continued China weakness.","By region, we assume that the overall U.S. and European economies continue to grow albeit slowly and that China begin to level off and return to growth in our markets in the second half. I mentioned earlier, we have already seen some pickup in auto sales and the government is recently taken some additional stimulus actions in China. We believe that the core driver of growth in China, the rapidly growing middle class will continue. Our guidance assumes current currency exchange rates and as the year goes on we have much less of a headwind from FX translation and an increased earnings tailwind from our share repurchase program.","Although this is a sluggish time in many markets I feel the company has never been better positioned with clear leadership across attractive harsh markets, a very focused portfolio, strong balance sheet and multiple levers to drive accelerated EPS growth. We have established a strong track record with 13% comp on annual adjusted EPS growth from 2012 through the midpoint that we are guiding for 2016. Constant currency terms will demonstrate a strong double-digit EPS growth in each year.","I think all the actions we have taken to transform the portfolio drives TEOA across the businesses and focus on harsh environment connectivity and sensors is really starting to pay off. Fundamentally we view we are in a couple quarters slow down here and expect to get back to strong performance in the second half of the year.","So with that, why don't we open it up for questions. Cynthia, could you give the instructions for Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And we will go the line of Amit Daryanani. Your line is open.","Amit Daryanani","Prefect. Thanks a lot. Good morning, guys. Two questions for me. One, maybe just looking at the fiscal 2016 EPS guide, I think at the midpoint you are implying about $0.40 incremental EPS year-over-year on probably no revenue, about 1% maybe, right. Could you maybe talk about, if I think about the $0.40 EPS uptick, how much of that is going to come from operating margins or whole levers versus buyback deals that you have are probably some kind of a split between the two?","Tom Lynch","Hi, Amit. I think kind of three key drivers. We certainly get a nice lift and Bob will talk a little bit more later on, I am sure, from the buyback in the first half of the year. We still have to overcome the negative impact of translation. We don't really see net impact of buyback or translation in any significant way until the second half. And our second half assumes we get back to low to mid single-digit growth rates, which we expect will power operating earnings improvement. So it's a pretty significant contribution from the buyback, lesser contribution for the full year from operating margin improvement. In a flat year, we expect that the relatively flat at the OI margin, but up in the second half over prior year.","Amit Daryanani","Got it. And then, Tom, Terence, you both seem to be fairly convinced that this is more of benign inventory correction and things should start to normalize in a quarter or so. I guess I assume you can talk about, are you seeing the different book-to-bill auto trajectory between what you see in the channel versus OEM that gives you comfort that this is more of an inventory correction versus a bigger demand vacuum that maybe we are getting into?","Terrence Curtin","Let me take that, Amit. Good morning. When you think about it, we did see and as I talked a little bit in the industrial overview I gave, we did expect through our channel partners, it would probably be pretty flat in the fourth quarter and actually their activity, through their point-of-sale and what we saw was probably more down mid-single digit which then clearly creates pressure on them trying to get their inventory back in position.","We did also see OEMs, especially in places like the United States that we did see the slowing, move a little before that earlier in the quarter. So we have seen the traditional OEMs start and the channel partners and when we look at it, it feels very similar back in 2012 and 2013, where we had a similar phenomenon where you had stepped out in growth that occurred and then clearly supply chain start to correct.","The other area that we are expecting a channel correction is in China auto. I think when you look at the order comments I made and where China those orders stabilize, but we are getting impacted in the first quarter as that growth of that market slows down from what used to be a 10% production environment to 2% production growth environment.","So there are a lot of signals. On that, I would say our orders in October are sort of where we expect them to be versus the forecast we have given. So it does seem to have stabilized, but we have to see. I think when it comes out is certainly the big wildcard.","Amit Daryanani","Thank you.","Sujal Shah","Can we have the next question, please?","Operator","And that will be from the line of Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Wamsi Mohan","Yes. Thank you. Good morning. Tom, can you elaborate on what you are seeing in China, particularly as it relates to the auto end market? Maybe if you could share some clarity on what the trends have been you to the extent that you can see between like Tier 1, Tier 2 cities versus lower tier and domestic versus multinational corporations? And I have a follow-up.","Tom Lynch","Sure, Wamsi. I was just there a couple weeks ago. Imagine, spent a lot of time with our auto team. So the macro trends is early in the year, this calendar year, we began to see the growth rate of registrations decline and production follow that. There was a couple of blips up and down through the year. But I would say, form March on a pretty steady decline through July. And a lot of folks think that's in reaction, a little bit of the slowing of the economy, I think the great uncertainty and then of course the volatility in the China stock market where individuals have quite a lot invested.","But what we have seen recently is registrations picking up and I think on the verge of the third month in a row of registrations picking up, which is a really good sign. In some ways not surprising because you still have a lot of positives in the China economy. The growth of the consumer and services sector, which the government has been trying to accomplish for a long time and now that's the biggest sector of the economy and that puts a lot less volatility in the economy. It also continues to drive significant wage growth as people move from the interior into the city.","In terms of demand between the Tier 1s, Tier 2s, Tier 3s, I think we will see that three and four cities growing faster just because there has been a lot less car purchases there over the last three to four years and those cities, they are growing faster than the Tier 1s and Tier 2s. And in multinational versus local, a little more momentum in the local customers lately. They have a very nice fleet of SUVs and SUVs has become very popular in the last year. For us, we are strong across all the OEMs there in the Tier 1.","So a switch between multinational and local doesn't really affect us. And in fact in the last big downturn, we did a lot of things to get much closer to the local suppliers and we provided more services to them than the typical connectivity supplier would and that served as well and got us a lot of designing over that time.","So shifting trends, but when you really translate that back into content per vehicle in China, it's still moving up. There isn't a big change in the content per vehicle. We continue to see the fundamental trends, the more electronics. And people want to own cars. So this recent trend is very encouraging as its ramping pretty nicely from registration level in July to registrations level in October.","Wamsi Mohan","Thanks, Tom I appreciate the color there. And then one for Bob really quick. Bob, is there a way to think much of that EPS benefit or margin benefit year-on-year's coming from a commodity tailwinds if you could quantify that for all of 2016, that would be great. Thanks.","Bob Hau","Yes. I think the best way to think about it, first off is, certainly we are seeing improvement\/tailwind in a number of our commodities, the largest one, the biggest to move is copper. So we are definitely anticipating improvement year-over-year on that. What does moderate that, of course, is we have a hedging program and so you don't see big moves or shocks to the up or down side of our commodities. So I would say, we expect probably$0.08 to $0.10 benefit in 2016 over 2015 as some of the hedging that we put in place throughout 2015 feathers in over the next 12 months.","Wamsi Mohan","Great. Thank you.","Sujal Shah","All right. Thank you, Wamsi. Can we have the next question please?","Operator","That will come from the line of Mike Wood with Macquarie. Your line is open.","Mike Wood","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. It would be very helpful if you could quantify the gross margin impact from the destocking in this quarter and then your fiscal first quarter 2016, just so we can get a better understanding of the underlying gross margin trends?","Bob Hau","Good morning, Mike. Yes. I think the way to think about it, as you saw in the slides in my opening comments, we definitely a decline in gross margin. That's been a key tenet of our operating performance over the last several years and it is still very nicely from where we were two or three years ago. What I think we are experiencing in Q4 is not only the impact of distribution in particular, but overall volume, revenue down on actual basis 3%, organically flat. You see that impact flow through the factories in terms of absorption of cost when you get that quick reduction. Additionally impacting is not only the declines in distribution, which is a higher gross margin business for us, but also things like oil and gas and commercial vehicle. So all three of those distribution, commercial vehicles and oil and gas are better than company average margins and that creates, use a four letter word, mix issue for us but certainly something that as the distribution channel recovers, as we see that inventory correction improve in the second half year, we will see those gross margins come back.","Mike Wood","Okay. Can you also given us the amount of TEOA operating margin improvement factored into 2016?","Bob Hau","So I think as I mentioned, we see the gross margin and the operating margins improve on a year-over-year basis in the second half, as certainly there is benefits of TEOA, there is benefits of the volume coming back, as well as benefits of some of the restructuring actions we have taken. I think in our opening comments, we did mention, we don't expect commercial vehicles to rebound. That's been a tough market for the last few quarters. We expect that to continue. Same with oil and gas. I think the distribution channel will help keep a lift but certainly continue to drive productivity through TEOA and the metals benefit will also impact gross margins, as I said earlier in response to Amit's question.","Tom Lynch","And Mike, I would just add one thing about TEOA. If you were to go back before we use, we really had TEOA well established in the company. We typically did not offset price erosion with productivity. So we are very dependent on the volume to carry margin improvement. One of the reasons we are up 400 basis point, some of it is certainly the portfolio and some of it is because now TEOA is offsetting typically the 1.5% to 2% price erosion. So it's a significant contributor to that margin growth. So that when we do get the 4% volume growth, which six or seven years ago would not produce 80 basis points of margin improvement, now has enabled us drive 80 basis points. So it's subtle and it roving in there, but it's very, very significant. And of course the key thing with TEOA and it's primary purpose of it is to drive customer experience and drive high quality, which we generally get the best marks for the industry and high on-time delivery. So it's just really served as well as we have driven this across the company.","Mike Wood","Okay. Thank you.","Sujal Shah","All right. Thank you, Mike. Can we have the next question please?","Operator","That's from the line of Matt Sheerin with Stifel. Your line is open.","Matt Sheerin","Yes. Thanks and good morning. A question regarding your comments on the communication solutions and your intent to deselect revenue and I think you talked about $30 million in the next couple of quarters. What does that translate in terms of annual revenue run rate? And what does that do to the margin structure of that business? And are there related restructuring charges or costs that you plan to take out there?","Tom Lynch","Yes. So Matt, a few of us can probably answer this question for you, part of our core strategy has been to reposition the business around the products that really have margins. The power products, miniature products, the high-speed products which we are best at and move away from the commodity products. So to kind of put it perspective, we took out almost $200 million worth revenue in 2015 and we held the profit in that business. And that was a negative margin business. It was very low margin business. We just felt it wasn't strategic in any way and had very little prospect to improve margins. So the cost actions we took to enable us to maintain profitability at the same level with $200 million plus margin, I think hopefully that gives you a perspective of where we are going with that business.","Terrence Curtin","I would also add, Matt, it's Terrence, when you look at next year, I mentioned there will be $30 million of a headwind in quarter one and quarter two, that will tail down probably for the year, about $90 million in total. It really ties in to when we talked last year about the combination of our Datacom and devices unit as we got that focus.","So Bob, if you want to talk to charges.","Bob Hau","Yes. I think, Matt, I mentioned that we have got about $75 million of restructuring charges anticipated in 2016. A good portion of that is associated with actions we have got underway in data and devices. As you recall, last year 2015, we also had significant restructuring charges. We spent on a full year basis, about $93 million. 60%, 65% of that was the data and device business units. So we are definitely aggressively attacking the cost structure as well as [indiscernible] benefit impact continues in 2017 and beyond.","Matt Sheerin","Okay. That's helpful. And then regarding the commercial transportation business. You talked about that continuing to weaken next year. Obviously you are starting off of a pretty low base and tough comps year over year, which will get easier at the end of your fiscal year. But are you expecting that to bottom in the next quarter or so and stabilize? Or will that continue to weaken?","Tom Lynch","No. we expect the market to remain weak and I do think we expect some bottoming around middle year. But overall we are expecting growth in that market for the year.","Matt Sheerin","Okay. That's it for me. Thanks a lot.","Tom Lynch","Thank you.","Sujal Shah","Thanks, Matt. Can we have the next question please?","Operator","And that will be from the line of Shawn Harrison with Longbow Research. Your line is open.","Shawn Harrison","Good morning. I was hoping to talk about the buyback just in terms of how much is left and maybe if you could walk us through the cadence of the buyback expected through the end or I guess throughout the next couple quarters? And when you think you will be done with using all the proceeds from the BNS sale?","Tom Lynch","Yes, Shawn. Good morning. We started the share buyback in the fourth quarter. We closed the deal at very end of August. So the month of September, we were in the market. For the quarter, we spent about -- we returned about $625 million. About half of that was the proceeds from the BNS transaction. So call it $0.7 billion or so left. And I think the way to think about it is, we will exhaust that. We will have completed that return probably by the end of third quarter of this fiscal year.","Shawn Harrison","And to be clear, that's in addition to the consistent cadence have of $150 million to $250 million a quarter, which you have targeted previously?","Tom Lynch","The money become pretty fungible one it hits the bank account. We have got the cash now and there are some practical limits to how many shares we can buy in a given quarter or a given day with some, the 10b-18 rules. So I think the way to think about it is the BNS proceeds get returned in the first three quarters and then fourth quarter we look to get back into the more normal phase.","Shawn Harrison","Okay. And then maybe just another way to ask the inventory question. Is there any way to parse out how much of the decline in bookings you saw exiting or for the quarter, that was tied to inventory corrections, be it either at the channel level or the OEM level versus just weaker general demand? I know it ends up being mixed a bit. But any clarity there probably gives us greater confidence in this back half ramp.","Terrence Curtin","Yes. Shawn, it's Terrence. When you look at it and certainly to your point, it does get mixed when you look at the math patterns. But we estimated both through channel and OEM ordering we think it's a little shy of $100 million. So probably in that $75 million to $100 million range, certainly spread across China, as well as our OEM and distribution partners.","Shawn Harrison","Thanks so much, Terrence.","Sujal Shah","Thank you, Shawn. Can we have the next question please?","Operator","And that will be from the line of Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Craig Hettenbach","Yes. Thank you. Tom, there still seems to be questions from investors in terms of buyback versus M&A and you are going to go through the proceeds of BNS to use that to buyback stock. But can you just talk about your balance sheet, your cash flow and the optionality you have for doing potential deals and also what the deal environment looks like today?","Tom Lynch","Sure. I think we feel very good as the highest level with a strong balance sheet, strong ongoing cash flow generation and especially a lot of cash in the bank now, the ability to return the BNS cash and to continue the two-thirds, one-third capital allocation, we feel like we have enormous flexibility. There is a nice pipeline that we have and it's very focused on harsh businesses, as we have dedicated many times.","And I think the way to think about it, it wasn't that long ago, we spent $2 billion on the sensor acquisitions and the oil and gas acquisition and they quickly went back into normal share buyback and then we did the BNS deal and now we are into much bigger share buyback, I think what all that says is, the broad strength of the company gives us a lot of choices.","If you go back a few years ago, when we met $2 billion on Deutsch, we went a couple of quarters without buyback, but then went right back into it. And then had a year of a lot of buyback, almost all of our cash flow going to buyback. So I think that we are pretty confident that while M&A may take precedence in one quarter and buybacks in another that over a couple year period, that two-thirds, one third, really fits with our business strategy, first and foremost.","So just to reiterate, we look at our strategies, the areas we want to lead in, the products that we want to add to our portfolio so we can take advantage with our scale, that's what drives our strategy and our M&A pipeline and then we balance that against where we believe this company has a lot of value creation ahead of us and it makes sense to use a fair amount of our cash flow to take back shares. So I think you could continue to expect a very balanced approach here operating within this two-thirds, one-third framework that we have. And whenever there comes a point that we need to change that, we will give plenty of advanced notice, but it's been working very well for us.","Craig Hettenbach","Okay. Thanks for the color. And as a follow-up for Bob, when you think about the SubCom business, the growth into fiscal 2016, can you touch a bit on the margins? I know typically as those programs ramp in force, the margins improve over the course of the programs. So can you touch on that?","Bob Hau","Yes. The way to think about it is, in this $700 million, $800 million range, we are nicely into double digits, low teens. As we approach $1 billion over the next several years, depending on the timing of new programs and how quickly those ramp up, you can expect us to get up in the company average operating margins.","Craig Hettenbach","Got it. Thanks.","Sujal Shah","All right. Thank you, Craig. Can we have the next question please?","Operator","And that's from the line of Jim Suva with Citi. Your line is open.","Jim Suva","Thanks very much. A question regarding the industrial solutions segment which, in my mind, has quite a bit of area for improvement. When we think about the decline in sales versus the decline in operating margins, obviously there's leverage there that's going on in a negative manner and things like that. Is there anything to believe that if we were to see the exact opposite, that margins shouldn't rebound right back up to where they were prior to that decline? Or is there something going on within the business? The reason I ask is, with actual down 12% in sales, organic down 7% and seeing operating margins down 23%, that's kind of quite a big deleveraging. So I am just wondering if there's anything in addition we should be aware of? Or if indeed sales at some point were to improve and say be up 12%, should we be up right back to where we were the operating margins or even better, given TEOA?","Terrence Curtin","Jim, it's Terence. So I think you are thinking about it right. When we look at that segment, we do view that segment long-term should be above the company average. So from that framing we still believe that. I think when you look at the fourth quarter, clearly the revenue decline as well as oil and gas with some of the distribution slowness which are higher all sort of hit at once. That exasperated the margin. But when you look at it, clearly places like commercial air, industrial equipment, defense are above company average. So I do believe that as that comes back and we get through some of the destocking, you will see that market move back up and there will be an opportunity.","Jim Suva","Great. Thank you very much and congratulations to you and your team.","Sujal Shah","All right. Thank you, Jim. Can we have the next question please?","Operator","That will from the line of Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Mark Delaney","Yes. Good morning and thanks very much for taking the questions. First question is a follow-up on the supply chain inventory reductions that the company was talking about. And I was hoping you could help us understand where you expect inventory of TE products to be at OEMs and distributors as you exit 1Q? And the reason I ask is, I am trying to get a better sense for what gives you guys the confidence for the revenue pickup in the remaining quarters of fiscal 2016, because even stripping out the extra week, it looks like you are assuming above seasonal quarter-on-quarter trends for the remainder of the fiscal year.","Tom Lynch","Yes. I think when we view this inventory correction, it's really a three quarter process. It started in Q4. Our current assumption is that it's the worst impacted in Q1, but still fairly significant impact in Q2. So it's going to take nine months. And we don't really have any big spring back baked in this year. So almost I think about it as, it kind of gets neutral in the second half of the year. So our second half isn't really thinking of a spring back.","The way I would frame it, were you to think about how the year will progress, starting with Q4 of this year you have a negative impact from China, you have negative impact form inventory and the continued year-over-year negative impact of foreign exchange. The core markets, everything excluding that, running pretty steady. We go into Q1, it's a little worse on China and inventory. It continues at about the same negative impact year-over-year on FX.","As you move into the second half of the year, our assumptions and we will have indicators over the next couple months, but our assumptions are inventories in balance as you end the second of the year, China has come down to a level where it should start growing again, because it come down quite a bit from where it was a year ago and FX is kind of a wash. The dollar could change, but if it stays at the current rate, it's pretty much a wash in the second half of the year.","And the rest of the business, we are not expecting any miracle in the second half. We are expecting production growth to be 1% to 2% in the second half. We are expecting core industrial demand to be 1% to 2%. So they are not really, I don't think aggressive assumption and really reflecting what we are hearing from our customers. So that's the way I, at a very high level, think about how we expect our year to unfold based on those assumptions.","Mark Delaney","Okay. Appreciate that. As a follow-up question, something to talk about OpEx. OpEx was nicely down in the fiscal fourth quarter, below what I was expecting. Can you help us understand where OpEx dollars should be in fiscal 1Q 2016? And then to what extent there's still any excess OpEx associated with the BNS transition agreement and if you could quantify that?","Bob Hau","Mark, I think the way to think about it is, first of all, we very typically have a rebound Q4 to Q1 of OpEx spending. There is typically a ramp that you see in the first quarter of every fiscal year. So expect to see that and we certainly expect OpEx, in general, to return to more normal level in 2016 over what we saw in fourth quarter more normal than first three quarters of the 2015.","In terms of the BNS transaction, we talked initially about what we refer to as stranded cost. Some of the cost of the central services that we have. We use that kind of revenue. You don't necessarily take out dollar-for-dollar from a cost standpoint. We are still in the midst of transition or transaction services, agreements with the buyer and that will be in place for up to help a few years, a couple of years. We don't expect them to last forever. And individual countries, individual activities will feather in an out and that will give us the opportunity to manage those costs as those TSA programs unwind.","Mark Delaney","Thank you.","Sujal Shah","Okay. Thank you, Mark. Can we have the next question please?","Operator","That will from the line of William Stein with SunTrust. Your line is open.","Joe Meares","Hi, guys. This is Joe Meares, calling in for Will. Thanks for taking my question. I just had two questions regarding meas and the sensor business. What inning would you say you are in with regards to margins going from being dilutive to the transportation segment to being accretive?","Tom Lynch","Well, I would say we are still in the early innings of that. As you know, we said it from the beginning, hypothesis was this will provide us accelerated growth in a market that we had a small beach at. That is definitely playing out as our design wins have been really great, even exceeding our high expectations and the core organic growth rate continues in double digits despite a sluggish economy. the margin, we expect will take a few years to move out.","It's definitely dilutive, but still generating 20 points margin in that segment. We do have the dilutive effect of sensors, but there is a clear path as we bring our scale to this business to get those margins. First thing, get them above company average and then get them up near the transportation average. But we are in the early innings on that. That's going to take some time, because the design wins to turn into sales and then to take advantage of that and turn that into scale. It's very much tracking to our plan and we feel great about that that acquisition.","Joe Meares","That's helpful. Thanks. I guess as a follow-on, you did mention, the transportation operating margin looked pretty solid despite the weakness in commercial transport at over 20%. What's helping here? Is it mostly the restructuring stuff that you guys have done? Or maybe mix in the other businesses?","Terrence Curtin","Yes, Joe. There has not been restructuring going on in transportation other than what we did several years ago. There was a little bit of work that was done early in the year around the acquisition. But that was very small and definitely behind us.","Tom Lynch","I think what it is, it is the basic productivity and efforts around TEOA and in this business. We expect the business to be at or better than 20% operating margin. I know there were a lot of questions at the end of the third quarter, because it dipped slightly below that. We, at the time, said look, it was largely driven by a pretty significant decline in commercial transport. We see that again this quarter, but we see the 3% organic growth in automotive that's just continuing to push productivity across the business. IT has been and will continue to be our highest operating margin business.","Joe Meares","Great. Thanks, guys.","Sujal Shah","Okay. Thank you, Joe. Can we have the next question please?","Operator","That's from Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Sherri Scribner","Hi. Thank you. Thank you for providing some of the detail on the linearity of your expectations for sales growth in automotive through 2016, but I was hoping you could give us some detail on your thoughts of the linearity of industrial sales as we move through fiscal 2016? What are your expectations? How much upside in the second half is baked in? And then following that, can you give us some sense of your expectations for operating margins in the industrial segment? Should we expect them to get back to fiscal 2014 levels? How should we expect them to progress through the year? Thanks.","Bob Hau","Sherri, it's Bob. I think the comments we made around the inventory correction has been in the distribution channel. You may recall that the largest segments that participate in the distribution channel is the industrial solutions business. So as we see that inventory adjustment work itself out in the first half of the year, you will see that improve towards our second half and get us better year-over-year growth rates second half over what we have got first half. That does give us, on a full year basis, a low single digit growth organically as those supply chain numbers work out.","In terms of operating margin for the industrial solutions business, I do expect an improvement in 2016 over 2015 and probably not too far off to think back in the 2014 levels. That 3% organic growth gives us a volume into our factories and we have said for the last couple of years volume will help continue to work TEOA. We did some restructuring back in 2013, 2014 in this business. And as that volume comes back, we will see those margins improve.","And I think Terrence, in an answer to an earlier question, we expect this business to be better than company average out into the future in terms of overall operating margin.","Sherri Scribner","Okay. That's helpful. I guess just to clarify on the growth you expect through the year, is the primary driver of weaker growth the inventory correction? Or do you see some overall demand that you think will improve in the second half?","Terrence Curtin","Sherri, it's Terence. I think there are a couple of things. So when you look at the first half, we are going to be impacted by the inventory as well as oil and gas. We will still have a little bit of a headwind on us in the first half, because of how that came down. So when you say that those two impacts will happen in the first half. When you look at the second half, like I said earlier, comm air side of the business, the medical part of the business, we do expect to be strong. But we do think the general industrial space did take a step down in growth. But we still think it will be growth once these inventory correction work out.","Sherri Scribner","Thank you.","Sujal Shah","Okay. Thank you, Sherri. Can we have the next question please?","Operator","And that will be from the line of Steve Fox with Cross Research. Your line is open.","Steve Fox","Thanks. One more question on linearity, if I could. Just to clarify in terms of your thinking from a broad standpoint, are you assuming that some of the growth rates that you are talking about for the second half of the year are achievable even if oil prices stay where they are and the U.S. dollar stays where it is, because that's obviously been affecting demand beyond just direct oil and gas segment.","Tom Lynch","Maybe one way to help put a little clarity, as we think of our portfolio, we see about 70% of the portfolio is going to solid mid single digit growth. And that's mostly our big harsh businesses like auto, commercial air, our sensor business for sure and SubCom. So when you put those together, we are going to have solid growth really through most of the year with the exception of Q1.","We expect our industrial and our energy and appliance businesses to get back and work through the inventory correction start to grow in the second half. But we are not looking at, as I said earlier, miraculous growth. Kind of low single digit growth. And we expect industrial transportation, oil and gas, data and devices to be down year-over-year for the year.","So I guess the answer specific your question, we are not assuming any benefit from something happening in oil and gas or any further worsening from oil and gas sure.","Steve Fox","That's fair. And then just one quick follow-up, given the timing of some of your acquisitions and the recent slowdown, I was just curious, have you seen any kind of unusual competitive behavior that you had to factor into your guidance for next fiscal year? Or do you feel like things, even with what's going on in terms of distribution, things are fairly well in check in terms of what you are using income from the contribution?","Tom Lynch","We haven't, Steve. And we monitor that kind of thing pretty closely. But I would say, no, I don't. It's such a fragmented industry with the exception of a couple of industries that we don't see any sort of competitor or two getting to progressive. I think basically the industry has gone through, a few industries have gone through a little pause, but most of these industries are still fundamentally healthy and it's essential for our customers to keep adding connectivity to their products for them to stay competitive. So that's this secular trend that is so beneficial to us and for example, we are not really seeing any change certainly no slowdown in the rate of projects we bid on, design activity our customers are bringing us in on. So we were not seeing any of that. So the fundamental drivers of the business are still very robust.","Great. That's encouraging. Thank you very much.","Steve Fox","Thank you.","Sujal Shah","Thank you, Steve. It looks like there is no further questions. If anyone has any questions, please contact Investor Relations at TE.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions]","As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Sujal Shah. Please go ahead.","Sujal Shah","Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Today we'll be discussing TE Connectivity's first quarter results along with the announcements to sell our Broadband Network Business to CommScope.","With me today are Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Lynch; and Chief Financial Officer, Bob Hau, who will provide an overview of the transaction, review our first quarter results and guidance and then talk about TE going forward. We will conclude with a Q&A session.","During the course of this call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information, and we ask you to review the forward-looking cautionary statements included in today's press release.

So please turn to Slide 4.","Earlier this morning, we announced a definitive agreement to sell our BNS business, which consists of TE's Telecommunication Enterprise Networks and Wireless business to CommScope. CommScope is an industry leader and we believe they are the right company to lead our BNS team and business forward.","Our BNS team has build a successful business and I want to thank them for their contribution, innovation, leadership and commitment to TE over the years and we look forward to working closely with CommScope to close out the transaction.","Our decision to sell BNS is really a key step in our strategy to continue to focus on strengthening the company's leadership position in the attractive connectivity and sensor market where we provide solutions that are essential for the connected world.","As you know earlier this year, we made the strategic decision to establish a leadership position in the sensor business. We believe that focus on connectivity and sensors with special emphasis on harsh environment solutions, position TE to provide our customers with an unmatched range of solutions and to further accelerate sales and profit growth.","When this transaction is complete, 90% of our revenue will be focused on providing connectivity and sensor solutions, which enable our customers to capitalize on the megatrends of safer, greener, smarter and more connected.","As billions of devices, objects and people become part of the internet of things, TE technology will play an increasingly key role. We have an unmatched range of products to meet these needs and unmatched resources facing the customer, designing and supplying the products.","Following the close of the transaction, 80% of our revenue will be focused on providing solutions for harsh environment applications, up from 50% several years ago. This has been a major focus of our strategy and I am very pleased with our progress and the results, which we will touch on in more detail when we review the quarter.","TE has a decade long track record of clear leadership and meeting the demand of connectivity and harsh applications. This is our sweet spot and importantly the transaction will enable us to continue to maintain a very balanced capital allocation strategy.","We intend to use the bulk of the proceeds from the transaction for share repurchase, while we also continue to aggressively invest organically and inorganically.","Now please turn to Slide 5 and I'll provide an overview of the transaction. The value of the transaction is $3 billion in cash with the valuation of approximately 10 times adjusted EBITDA. We believe this is an attractive valuation for the business, which generated $1.9 billion of revenue in fiscal 2014.","We expect the transaction to be neutral to adjusted earnings per share one year after closure when you factor in the use of the proceeds. Our guidance provided this morning includes BNS; however, moving forward BNS will be reported as discontinued operation.","As I mentioned earlier, the majority of the proceeds of the transaction are expected to be used for share buyback with flexibility to make strategic investment. The Board has authorized an increase to our share buyback authorization by $3 billion making our total share repurchase authorization now approximately $3.7 billion.","We do expect the transaction to close by the end of calendar 2015 subject to customary closing regulation.","Now I am going to shift over to the quarter and talk about the highlights in the quarters and now then I'll hand it off to Bob Hau, who will go into the quarter in some detail.","So Slide 7 provides a summary of our Q1 results. We delivered strong results for Q1 with organic revenue growth in line with expectations and 20% adjusted EPS growth year-over-year. Total company orders were $3.7 billion, up 9%, excluding SubCom, orders were up 4%. Book-to-bill excluding SubCom was 1.03%.","We continue to execute our strategy to strengthen our leadership position in harsh environment applications with harsh business revenue growth of 10% year-over-year. We continue to grow faster than the market in China in our harsh environment businesses.","TEOA continues to drive profitability and enhance our margins. Adjusted gross margins were up 100 basis year-over-year and adjusted operating margins expanded to 16%.","We're really pleased with the performance of Measurement Specialties and AST and have been successful in obtaining new sensor design wins across multiple market segments. I would say these acquisitions have pretty much seamlessly come into our company.","For fiscal 2015, we're holding our full year adjusted EPS guidance at the midpoint of $4.20 despite a much worsening headwind from FX. We expect continued strong performance from our harsh businesses and the continued recovery of SubCom to offset this FX headwind.","And then lastly, our Board has recommended an increase in the dividend to $1.32 per share. This is the fifth consecutive year of double-digit increase in the dividend. Our shareholders will vote on this proposal in March and it should go into effect in June.","With the most recent move of the dollar versus world currencies, our 2015 FX headwinds are now approximately $900 million in revenue and $0.35 in earnings per share versus last year, versus the full year guidance we provided last quarter, we have an incremental impact of $500 million on the revenue line and $0.20 per share.","Despite this headwind, we're maintaining our full year adjusted EPS guidance of $4.20, which delivers double-digit earnings per share growth. I have to say we feel pretty good about this performance.","Now I'll turn it over to Bob to cover our segment result's financials and guidance in a little more detail.","Bob Hau","Thanks Tom and good morning, everyone.","I'll start with the transportation on Slide 8, a business which continues to perform exceptionally well and extend our leadership position. In Q1, we grew 8% organically with OEM vehicle production growth of less than 1%. This performance reflects the steady increase in content growth, coupled with our broad based share gains over the last several years.","Q1 was our first quarter owning Measurement Specialties and the integration momentum of this business is ahead of our expectations. Within the first 90 days, we secured a new integrated sense in connector design win in medical application and our engaged new automotive applications.","We continue to expect our total sensor business to grow above market due to our unique combination of technology, resources and broad deep customer relationships.","Total transportation, adjusted operating income was $345 million in Q1, up 16% year-over-year with 80 basis points expansion in adjusted operating margins due to volume growth, favorable mix and strong productivity execution. Looking forward, we expect another good quarter in Q2 with actual sales growth up mid single digits.","Please turn to Slide 9. Our Industrial Solutions segment performed well in Q2 with 3% actual and organic sales growth, representing the sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth for this segment.","Industrial equipment was flat organically with growth in China offset by market softness in Europe and Japan. In Aerospace, Defense, Oil, and Gas, we saw 8% organic growth, driven by continued strength in commercial aerospace.","We received many questions about revenue risk from falling oil prices and our exposure is actually quite limited. As a result, we would expect continued strength in commercial aerospace to more than offset slight weakness in our oil and gas business.","In our energy business, we saw 1% organic growth with gains in Americas, offsetting market softness in Europe and China. Adjusted operating income was $101 million in Q1, up 1% versus the prior year and we continue to invest in footprint optimization and go-to-market resources to accelerate profitable growth.","For Q2 we expect to grow low single digits with mid single digit growth organically.","Turning to Slide 10, our Network segment grew 2% year-over-year on an organic basis, driven by growth in our SubCom business as a result of projects that are ramping ahead of schedule. We're increasing our revenue outlook for SubCom to approximately $650 million for fiscal 2015 and expect our three large projects, which recently came into force to contribute over $900 million over the next two to three years.","Our Broadband and DataComm businesses declined versus the prior year impacted by regional declines and project delays. In Q2, we expect total network solutions revenue growth in the high teens organically, driven by SubCom with Broadband and DataComm up slightly organically.","If you turn to Slide 11, I'll discuss our Consumer Solutions segment. In consumer devices, we continue to narrow our focus in order to improve profitability, while continuing to invest in technologies that are important to the company as a whole such as miniaturization, antennas and wearable enablers.","Today we're announcing plans to combine our Consumer Devices and DataComm business units. The customers we serve in these businesses are converging and much of the underlying technology and products are quite similar. This is the next key step to accelerate the performance in these businesses, which are core to our connectivity portfolio.","Please turn to Slide 12, where I'll provide more details and earnings. Adjusted operating income was $555 million, up 14% versus the prior year. The growth versus the prior year is driven by improved manufacturing productivity across the company and volume leverage.","GAAP operating income was $477 million and included $27 million of restructuring and other charges, most of which were in the Consumer Solutions segment and $51 million of acquisition related charges in the quarter as expected.","Adjusted EPS was $0.98 for the quarter above the high end of guidance, driven by strong productivity, mix and cost management. GAAP EPS was $1.14 for the quarter and GAAP EPS included acquisition related charges of $0.09, restructuring and other charges of $0.06 and income related to tax items of $0.31.","The tax item primarily stems from the effective settlement of essentially all pre-separation tax matters with the exception of the inner company debt issue. We're currently scheduled for litigation in February of 2016 if no settlement can be reached prior to that time.","For the full year 2015, I continue to expect approximately $50 million to $75 million of restructuring and other charges and reflecting $0.10 at midpoint of our guidance, up slightly versus last year.","We expect roughly $0.22 of charges associated with recent acquisitions, which we more than offset by gains from the settlement of tax liabilities.","Turning to Slide 13, I'll discuss the financial metrics that are tied to the TE operating advantage or TEOA. Our adjusted gross income in the quarter was 34.6%. This is an expansion of 100 basis points versus the prior year, driven primarily by productivity gains from TEOA initiatives and leverage on additional volume.","Adjusted operating margins expanded 140 basis points, driven by productivity and operating expense leverage. Total operating expenses were $643 million in the quarter with SG&A decreasing versus the prior year and R&D increasing to $184 million, mostly from acquisitions and the support growth primarily in transportation.","Total operating expenses were 18.6% of sales, down 40 basis points from the prior year. Cash from continuing operations was $295 million and our free cash flow in Q1 was $162 million. Free cash flow was impacted by the timing of tax payments and SubCom project activity.","Gross capital expenditures were up slightly year-over-year and net capital expenditures were up $16 million versus the prior year. I expect capital spending rate to be approximately 5% of sales for 2015. I note we added a balance sheet and cash flow summary in the appendix of this slide for additional details.","Now I'll turn it back to Tom\/","Tom Lynch","Thanks Bob. Please turn to Slide 14 and I'll cover our outlook at a high level with additional details provided in the slide.","We expect to deliver another solid quarter in Q2 with revenue of $3.55 billion to $3.6 billion, up 3% to 6% year-over-year and in line with our normal seasonal patterns. We expect adjusted earnings per share of $0.98 to $1.02, an increase of 3% to 7% year-over-year.","Our Q2 outlook does include a headwind from currency exchange rates which are negatively affecting our guidance by approximately $250 million in revenue and $0.10 per share versus the prior quarter, I am sorry, versus the prior year.","Our second quarter performance will be driven by the continued strong performance of our harsh environment businesses, the building momentum in SubCom and contributions from our sensor and oil and gas acquisition. This is more than offsetting the significant FX headwind.","Now if you'll turn to Slide 15, for the full year, we expect to deliver another year of double-digit adjusted EPS growth, despite these strong FX headwinds. We have a number of catalysts for growth. The strong secular trend is increasing electronic content, especially in harsh applications, our expansion into the high growth sensor market and the recovering SubCom business.","For the full year, we now expect revenue of $14.45 billion to $14.85 billion, up 5% versus the prior year and this reflects 6% organic growth. And note that the total impact of currency exchange rates is approximately $900 million versus the prior year.","Our new revenue guidance represents $150 million of incremental organic growth versus our October view with increases in transportation and industrial appliance and SubCom. And as I mentioned earlier we're maintaining our adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $4.05 to $4.35 per share, representing year-over-year growth of 11% at the midpoint.","Just for clarity, compared to our prior guidance last quarter, this represents a $0.20 operational improvement offsetting a $0.20 headwind from that foreign exchange.","To provide a baseline for the performance of our business organically, adjusted EPS would have grown in the neighborhood or 20% year-over-year and constant currencies and for one for the negative impact of a $1. But the good news is we're offsetting this with strong performance in the business.","I am now going to spend a few minutes talking about how we think about TE going forward post the BNS sale, so please turn to Slide 17. In the nine years I've been here, I've never felt better about the opportunities facing the company and our ability to seize them.","These mega trends of safe green, smart and connected represent a market opportunity of approximately $165 billion for connectivity and sensor solution and we are the leading provider of these solutions.","These markets are expected to grow at roughly 2X GDP over the long term driven by this increase in electronic content in virtually every industry.","Please turn to Slide 18 and I'll give you a few examples of the accelerating content story. In the automotive market, we're capitalizing on our leadership in connectivity to become a leader in sensors and our customers are very excited about the combination.","This combination of connectors and sensors represents a potential of approximately $400 of content for the average vehicle. Today we're the clear leader with content of slightly above $60 per vehicle. So there is a lot of opportunity and we're investing in the resources to capture more of it.","In the commercial aerospace market, there is going to be about 37,000 new planes expected to be delivered over the next 20 years and all have a significant increase in electronic content.","On top of that, TE content is increasing pretty significantly and in almost every platform as a result of the increased organic investments over the last several years, coupled with the very strategic Deutsche acquisition, which is going very well.","Our customers increasingly see us as a solutions provider, which is driving up our content per design opportunity that's very exciting. We're getting to do things we hadn\u2019t had the opportunity to do a few years ago. And in some cases, where we bring a broader solution, we can actually see our content go up eight to 10 times over prior model.","In the industrial equipment market, electronic content is also increasing due to a variety of reasons, but you can see the big increases in factory automations, robotics and the smart factory we see it all over the world and all of these require more sensors and more connectivity and we are very well positioned with these product lines.","Please turn to Slide 19, as you know, the core of our strategy over the past several years has been to strengthen our leadership and harsh environment application. Post the BNS transaction, this will represent approximately 80% of our business.","Harsh environments demand excellent, engineering and manufacturing and the typical application we're involved very early with our customers in the design phase and they're increasingly relying on us to provide the products, sensor pass more signal, operate in higher power environments and take less space and weight.","This is our specialty and what we see increasing system knowledge in these applications is very important and that is the strength of ours. These solutions typically have a lot of stickiness because the cost of change is high and our customers rely on the value we provide and continue to ask us to do more.","We are having a very positive reaction as I said earlier to the expansion of our sensor capabilities because that gives us more options to meet customer needs and these are customers that are typically looking to reduce the numbers of suppliers in order to get more strategic suppliers and simplify their own supply chain.","In the harsh environment markets, we've been steadily increasing inorganic and organic investments. We've expanded engineering and field resources at a faster rate and sales growth over the past several years and our performance in TEOA is consistently driving up quality performance and our margin performance.","Please turn to Slide 20 and I'll wrap things up before we go to Q&A. So really the summary of today is going forward TE will be more focused than ever on what we do best. 90% of our portfolio will be focused on sensors and connectors and almost 80% will be in harsh environment application.","We have the broadest and deepest censoring connectivity solutions on the market and we will continue to strengthen this portfolio to be our customer's best choice. We also feel this portfolio will enable us to accelerate our sales and profit growth and continue to make TE a top choice for investors.","So with that, let's open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Amit Daryanani","Thanks and congrats on a nice guide and asset sale guys. Maybe to start with the fiscal '15 guide, I am just curious how do you think commodities are playing out in the guide? My math is that it's a $0.08, $0.09 benefit for you guys, but I think your hedges could delay this.","So curious how commodities are playing out and any updated thoughts on potential looking to start hedging FX as we go forward given how severe the impact has been for you guys?","Tom Lynch","Hi Amit, thanks. I would say we're definitely seeing commodity cost come down as you know. With copper, our strategy has always been to hedge that to mach cost with price and the timing of the cycles out there.","So in particular, the big decline in copper prices that's happened recently will start to flow into us late in the year, which should provide a nice tailwind going into early next year.","Bob, you want to talk about\u2026","Bob Hau","Yes, so first starting from an impact, you're right. You're a little bit heavy given the timing of the hedges and how those play out around the metals, copper, gold and silver. It's probably $0.05, $0.06 benefit to 2015 and of course if metals continue where they're at, it will be a nice tailwind for us into 2016.","In terms of currency, as you know we are largely naturally hedged from a transactional standpoint. We have factories around the globe and we build locally for our local customers and so from a transactional standpoint, we don't have much exposure and where we do, we actually do hedge the remaining exposure.","From a translational standpoint, which is the impact that Tom talked about in his opening remarks, we do not hedge and I think you'll find a vast majority of the companies that have foreign currency exposure on a translational standpoint, don't hedge those currencies that would be taking a bet on where those currencies will be going and I don't want to take that bet.","Amit Daryanani","Fair enough. And then I was wondering if you could just may be touch on the Transportation Solutions business, that you guys had really impressive I think organic growth in the December quarter, your order book looks like it remains fairly robust.","The auto production environment I think has been fairly stable over the last 90 days, so I am curious, do you think content growth broadly is starting to pick up from the 5%, 6% threshold that you have in the past of do you guys think you see more market share wins, what's driving the strength on the transportation organic growth basis?","Tom Lynch","Content is drifting up, but the big thing in this time period is the share we won three and four years ago. It's the design ins, particularly that we won coming out of the crises when we kept investing in engineering and our auto business across the world.","And in two areas that we got -- that we weren\u2019t leaders, but we were the leader in the U.S., but with tremendous opportunity in China we made significant investments in those regions. We always had a large investment in Europe and it's really paid off.","So I would say more than anything it's the design ins that we won that take a few years to come to pass. We do see content continuing to drift up I don't think it's at the outside. It's probably that 4% to 6% range might be 4.5% to 6%, 4.5% to 6.5%, but a lot depends on in there mix and stuff like that, but for us it's been -- it's been more of the design wins of recent years.","Sujal Shah","Okay. Thank you, Amit. Can we have the next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Amitabh Passi from UBS. Please go ahead.","Amitabh Passi","Hi guys. Thank you. And congrats again from my end. I guess Tom, my first question for us is how are you thinking about the rest of the portfolio, particularly if we look at some of the underperforming segments and at your networks DataComm, consumer solutions, maybe if you can just give us an update in terms of the rest of the portfolio?","Tom Lynch","As Bob mentioned on DataComm and consumer, we actually decided to and we're announcing that real time that we're putting those businesses together into one business. The customers are all becoming the same. There was always customer overlap and now it's converging more and more especially in China.","The technology particularly the core connectivity technology that goes inside a box is very similar. So we see a much -- more opportunity to leverage that and this is going to help our scale and cost effectiveness, which we need to drive the profitability up.","So that's the plan there and I think it's important that people understand that DataComm and consumer are very, very core to the business. I view them as core as automotive because it's another range of products.","If you think of a company like ours, our specialty is connecting and we're building specialty in censors and those applications at knowledge, they go into a variety of different applications that happen to be stronger in some than others, but the core technology, the core science, the physics, the manufacturing practices, the supply chain, they're all very similar, they're all practically identical.","So those are core businesses and the strategy really is to be more selective because the profit pools have changed a lot more in consumer and DataComm than they had in the long cycle industrial, transportation type businesses.","With respect to energy; energy, I've used a very good solid business for us. It's been a little less of expectation for the last couple of years because it's Europe more than anything else, we're growing ahead of market in the U.S. we have a nice niche, a strong niche position because we're selective in China, but we expect as the energy grid has to be upgraded in Europe, that we're well positioned and it's a very focused well run business.","Amitabh Passi","Excellent, and then just as a follow-up Bob, on industrial\u2026","Excellent. And then, just as a follow-up, Bob. On industrial solutions can you may be remind us again what needs to occur to structurally drive margins potentially into the mid to upper-teens? And then may be just related, can you just clarify what the gross margin was for BNS?","Bob Hau","From industrial solutions standpoint, we've seen some nice margin lift in that business over the last couple of years. We've now got six consecutive quarters of growth. So we're seeing some volume leverage that will flow through.","As I mentioned, in the current quarter we're down just slightly on a year-over-year basis, really driven by some investments we're making in footprint optimization moving some product around to get it in the right factories, as well as some investments in go-to-market resources.","Our sales folks, product people that support our customers, as they develop their next generation products to make sure we're there with them. Both of those actions will continue to drive cost out to the footprint optimization as well as top line revenue growth. So the 13% slightly below company average right now, but we'll see that continue to expand in later part of this year and obviously into the future.","Tom Lynch","And what I'd add to that is that in our aerospace business is well above company average. And our industrial equipment business right at may be slightly below company average, but we expect it to be at or above company average in the next two quarters.","And it's the energy business which is more -- it's just really suffering from a very slow market right now that has pulled that down. But I'm pretty confident that with a slight uptick in sales, I mean when we're at 1% you don't get much operating leverage and the team has done a good job of holding their margin there.","But that will pick up. I mean it's only going to probably be at 3% to 4% grower, but when that happens we have a lot of operating leverage in that business. So, as we've said before, we view this business, we expect this business to be kind of a high-teens operating margin business and that's the moves we're making to ensure we get there.","Bob Hau","And in terms of BNS, we don't provide operating margin by segment, but we have said in the past and continue to be public with operating margin for broadband networks business is slightly above company average nicely into the double-digit level.","Amitabh Passi","Gross margin, right?","Bob Hau","It's operating margin.","Amitabh Passi","Okay.","Sujal Shah","All right. Thank you, Amitabh. Could we have next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Wood from Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Mike Wood","Hi. Congratulations. First question just on the upside that you called out in the quarter of Measurement Specialties, is that coming from end market growth or has there been any tweaks that you've put into the business so far.","Tom Lynch","Hi Mike. Thanks, by the way. I would say it's mostly the market right now. We haven't had a chance to let's say impact sales growth with most of our focus has been on the integration as to fully understand what we have so we can help set the priorities. Our biggest challenge which is a great challenge is more opportunities than we can deal with, so that's a big priority.","But getting out of the gate then leading the numbers they had signed up for Measurement was important. Our own internal sensor business continuing to be strong and just continuing to ride on that back of a very robust market, which is exciting -- which as exciting, maybe more exciting to me because it gets to the strategic part of it.","Now the reason we did it is we're seeing -- we're getting in a lot more request for proposals participating and having customers ask us to bid in some of these harsh businesses, the customers that we knew, but now bidding the MEAS technology. That doesn\u2019t result in revenue for few years, as you know, but we're happy to see that this is happening quickly.","And that's really the theory of why we did this in the power of the combination that our go-to-market resources and global supply chain with MEAS' very broad and deep engineering team and technology pipeline. And we're seeing it. We're only one quarter into it. One quarter obviously doesn't make a gain, but it's what we've seen in them some, so very pleased that it at least getting off to a good start.","Mike Wood","Great. And for my follow-up, and I understand if you can't provide detail on this, but given your new focus which is primarily on harsh, these critical use applications typically carry high margin. So do you have a longer term margin goal for the company given this new focus, or also just a new benchmarking peer set that you're measuring your performance on?","Tom Lynch","I'd say the way to think about it, Mike, is no, we have not set like we did years ago, the 15% margin goal. When we set that we felt that was really critical to prove that the company had reached the point of strong operating capability. Now, its drive a growth of 5% to 7% consistently, organic growth and we would expect to drive 50 basis point plus margin growth.","Of course, all of our businesses have aggressive targets for sales growth and margin growth with TEOA. It's how we decide what parts of the portfolio to go after. But we have not set a new sort of external margin threshold that we want to reach. Will we? May be.","We want to get through the divestiture of BNS and the integration of MEAS. But I think generally, if you listen to us we think we can maintain and continue to drive strong transportation margins. We think there's room in industrial margins. The BNS margin will be a net sale accretive to the company. And we have pretty much all upside in the consumer device margin and the DataComm margin because they are low.","So there's a lot of margin drivers in the company. And I think you see it in Q1 where we hit, and we had some nice mix in Q1 for sure. So maybe we got a few -- 20 or 30 basis points more than the typical, but we're knocking on the door of 16 and we feel good about that.","Mike Wood","Great. Thanks.","Sujal Shah","All right. Thank you, Mike. Could we have the next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Suva from Citi. Please go ahead. Jim Suva, your line is open. Okay. We'll move on. We'll go to your next question. That question comes from the line of Matt Sheerin from Stifel. Please go ahead.","Matt Sheerin","Yes. Thanks and good morning. Just another question regarding the sale of the networking business. It looks like a portion of the DataComm business has been carved out within the sale to CommScope. Is that the wireless part? And could you tell us what the run rate of your DataComm business is now.","Tom Lynch","None of the DataComm business has carved out. We -- wireless, to your point, is a broad term. So when we talk about wireless in our networks business, we're talking about distributed antenna systems, but any of the wireless product that DataComm has, has stayed with data comm.","Matt Sheerin","Okay. So you're keeping that. Okay. And, could\u2026","Tom Lynch","What is in BNS today.","Matt Sheerin","Got you. And just regarding the Measurement Specialties, I know the sensor business is sitting within your transportation business, but Measurement also sells into industrial and consumer markets. Will that business also be working with your other segments in terms of cross-selling and sales opportunities, or will these running on a standalone basis?","Tom Lynch","Now from the day one that\u2019s we did. And that's one of the things I'm most pleased about that in all of our relevant businesses, most relevant businesses where we want to broaden the sensor opportunity quickly, lot of activity in automotive, lot of activity in industrial transportation, lot of activity in medical, significant activity in aerospace even though that's much longer cycle.","To be able to bring sensor solution to the table to a big customer it enhances your standing with that customer, and significant activity in the appliance business.","So we've already mapped the people in the -- our traditional businesses into the sensor business with some ground rules that we don't overwhelm the new sensor team. But I am very pleased with the collaboration and the sensibility that everybody is using in how to pursue opportunities but not get out ahead of our headlights. And we've got a couple of design in already which frankly happened sooner than I thought.","Bob Hau","Matt, that's one the reasons you may have noticed in our Transportation Solutions slide in the presentation. We are now reporting three different business units within the Transportation Solutions segment; automotive, commercial transport and sensors to provide the visibility into the sensor business that is, as you point out, more than an automotive.","Matt Sheerin","Got it. Okay. Thanks very much.","Bob Hau","Yeah.","Sujal Shah","All right. Thank you, Matt. Could we have the next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Fox from Cross Research. Please go ahead.","Steven Fox","Thank you. Good morning. Just on the transaction, first of all, in terms of use of proceeds, I understand where investing in your stock could be a good way to neutralize EPS dilution, but can you just sort of give us a sense of where you stand versus pursuing other acquisitions and may be could be even more accretive use of funds.","Tom Lynch","First, Steve thanks. We have a pretty robust pipeline, as we've talked about before. That pipeline is very focused on harsh. And as always in these situations, you never know how and when things are going to break free.","So, we have priorities, how they would fit. And I think the nice thing is that as we showed last year, we could make significant moves like SEACON measurement in AST, significant investments in acquisitions and continue to have a very balanced return of capital in form of dividend increases and share repurchase. We will -- to us that's kind of an ideal year, may be not spent $2 billion in capital every year, but if the right opportunity was there, we will seize it if it's doable.","So we clearly view what's the strong operational performance we have now and there's still room for improvement that putting more on the top line is the top priority. We see our customers wanting us to do more because disability to integrate and package that we're very good at and we already do an automotive and industrial transportation and aerospace and defense and are starting to do an industrial really helps the customer.","So this idea of a broad range of connectivity and sensors is very potent from the customers' point of view. So we're always looking to add into that. So I would -- you would expect to see us continuing to do a nice mix of M&A and capital returns.","Steven Fox","Great. And then just to clarify a couple of comments, Tom, in terms of the Measurement Specialties business. You're saying that the revenues reported today are all basically from the company's acquired book of business.","But that you -- the teams have already gotten together, and I've pulled some sales synergies that we should start seeing over the next few quarters. And if you could talk about what that little hanging fruit sort of revolves around. Thanks.","Tom Lynch","As we've pointed out when we made the acquisitions, Steve, the sales -- the design in sale synergies like any design in sale synergies take a while, so that's kind of year two, year three. The short-term sale synergies are more out of two paths. One, we have more people selling to all these customers, so can we sell more existing solutions to a customer just because we're in front of more customers. So we expect to start to see some of that towards the end of the year.","And what in the products that can go through the channel. So our channel team, its lead by John Wainwright is working with our channel partners to identify what are the practical products that can be sold through the channel. And we view that as the shortest term revenue synergy.","But the longer ones are when we see that we can integrate a sensor into a wire and a certain application, whether it'd be an industrial or medical or whatever that takes a few years to turn into revenue, all consistent with our acquisition plan.","Steven Fox","Great. That's very helpful. Congratulations on the transaction.","Sujal Shah","Thank you, Steve. Could we have next question please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Shawn Harrison from Longbow Research. Please go ahead.","Shawn Harrison","Hi. Good morning and congratulations on the results. I just wanted to dig in on two things in terms of the broadband networks business being sold and also the buyback.","It looks like maybe the accretion this year from that business would have been or the earnings contribution -- excuse me-- would have been around $0.40 to $0.45 meaning that you pick up at least 50 basis points of margin consolidated once the business is sold. But maybe why not accelerate the buyback earlier? You guys don't have significant leverage to even fill that gap earlier than let's say 18 to 24 months out.","Tom Lynch","Yeah. Shawn, thanks for the question. In terms of their profitability, we're little bit higher than what you've suggested, but order of magnitude that's about right. In terms of the share buyback, as we noted in our opening comments, we anticipate the deal to close by the end of the calendar year, and so that $3 billion of cash isn't available until the deal closes at the end of the year.","It doesn't mean -- we are already and will continue to be active in our ongoing share buyback program. We bought back this most recently completed quarter and we'll continue to do that as part of our return to capital program. But the $3 billion when that becomes available we'll increase that activity.","Shawn Harrison","Okay. And then there's a follow-up, with the combination of DataComm and consumer devices, EBIT margin is probably best case scenario right now or maybe mid-single-digits other than revenue synergies. How do you see the margins for that business long-term? Can it be add a mid-teens EBIT margins and what steps need to be taken other than just bring yourselves of low margin business to get there.","Tom Lynch","Sure. And again, you've got peal back the onion a little bit. So, if you look at in both businesses, the core connector businesses, the EBIT margin is well above that. In DataComm we have been investing in high-speed solutions and those product lines, if you have measured them and as we do product line profitability, they are losing money because they are in investment stage and the designing is just starting.","So the core business where we miniaturize connectors, go into server, storage, smartphones, pretty decent business, not as high operating margin as industrial or industrial transportation that's there.","Then its can we be successful with these R&D initiatives we have what I call. I mean they're not pure R&D because we're selling the products, but they just haven't been adapted across the industries yet. And so that's really the question. How long will we pursue those?","We really believe in this insatiable data world that for datacenters and for other applications in our company, high speed, more than five, 10, 12 gigabit is going to be necessary. So we're developing fiber connectivity and copper connectivity for 25 gig plus. Those are strategic investments that happen to reside in the DataComm business.","And then we're looking at some other advanced technologies that are most naturally in the consumer business because that's where you get the initial application that may not be the most where we get the bang for the buck eventually.","Certain type of manufacturing that we're applying there because the miniaturization that's where the trend starts there. And by the way, over the years we have seen the ability to miniaturize their move quickly into our automotive business where it's been more and more important over the last five years.","So it's not -- the good news is it's not just that's you've got to cost reduce this thing. And if you keep cost reducing it, you make it an uncompetitive business. No, two-thirds of our business is solid and can get better, no questions.","That's the core connector business and one-third are investments we're making, and we have milestones that we hold ourselves to that are proof points that either yes we have the right technology, or the market is taking the technology. And when we see those not happen, and I'll give you good example of a product line Magnetic that we divested last year, that was one of those.","We felt like we had a better way to solve the Magnetic's issues and it turned out we didn't so we divested it. So that's how I think about those businesses. But they are very core-wise, they are core connectivity businesses. And how big they'll be in the portfolio is to be determined, but they will be in the portfolio.","Shawn Harrison","Right. And just quickly, Tom. I'm sorry. The follow-up on the 25, 40 gig move. In the last time on the call you thought may be toward the end of the year you would see some greater adoption. Do you still view that as potential dynamic exiting the fiscal year?","Tom Lynch","I do. It's not going to be big in the numbers because it takes time. But the good news is we won contracts. The program management is starting to plan the installation and all good signs. But the rate of winning needs to increase for this to look like it is the business we thought it would be.","We're not surprised it's kind of tracking to what we thought when we had a reset. And the industry, with all the change it went through, began to embrace these kind of things a little slower. But all the customers are saying they need to get there. It's just the rate at which they're going to get there.","Shawn Harrison","Thanks so much, and congrats again.","Tom Lynch","Thanks.","Sujal Shah","Thank you, Shawn. Could we have next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Craig Hettenbach","Yes. Thanks so much. Quite a ride, Tom, in terms of I think of since the split from Tyco, a lot of portfolio management, arguably much for the better at this point. So with that I'd love to get your thoughts in terms of oppose the latest sale, what that means in terms of that, the clarity of the strategy, the organization and as you execute to the harsh environment going forward.","Tom Lynch","Sure. From the strategy that we've had inside the company, has been pretty darn that we've had a strategy map that I think we modify a little bit every couple of years, but it's been fundamentally consistent around connectivity.","We got more granular when we acquired Deutsche around; become much more aggressive around harsh connectivity and what that meant was acquire. We were moving at a nice pace and we always had a strong harsh business. But then in a sense took the double down approach and we are fortunate Deutsche came on the market and we got it.","We were incubating the sensor business to see is that a place that we should go into or not. We didn't know. And we had some doubts. But when we kind of broke through a few years ago, then we decided logical place for us to be, not only because sensor is a good business and the skills we have are similar no exact, but the skills you need to be successful on sensors, but more importantly, because we see the conversions in the solutions.","And so, then -- as that moved from let's see if we want to be in sensors too, this needs to be a new platform for the company, that changed the focus on networks. That made networks an important part of the business, but not as critical.","And we also concluded that in that time to really have the kind of business in broadband networks that we have in harsh or could have in sensors, we needed to augment the product line pretty significantly a much broader wireless capability, which is not really something we could develop organically.","And that was going to be a bit of a challenge. And then, we weighed that against other opportunities. We decided we're going to have to optimize that business another way. Now we were fortunate enough to find a very strategic buyer.","Because, you may have a business you -- optimization may not mean selling because you're not going to get the value for it. But we got a very strategic buyer, perfect set. So we could get more value than we could by running it ourselves or spending it out or something like that. So I think our patience of pursuing an optimal solution in this case paid off.","So now you get to the point where 90% connectors and sensors, 80% harsh. A pretty consistent strategy, the manufacturing methods are the same pretty much in these businesses. How you go to market are very similar, the applications are slightly different.","The sharing of technology, you're sharing it across 90% of the business now. And it's very exciting, especially at a time when customers are asking us to come in earlier in the architecture. And that's why the solutions we're bringing in many cases today they're not sell support solutions.","There really are how do we optimize higher power, higher-speed and a smaller footprint on this manifold in this vehicle platform, what else can you do for us here? So that's pretty exciting to us because it starts to open up other new paths for growing the business. And we don't want to -- we want to completely focus around that.","Craig Hettenbach","Got it. Thanks for that. As a follow-up on MEAS and sensors specifically, when we talk about growing that above market, can you give any context in terms of are there certain niches where they play where they are very strong that are growing faster than the market relative to utilizing your larger sales force and distribution channel that should drive growth too. Can you give any context in terms of how that shapes out?","Tom Lynch","Yeah. The business grew up with a very customer-focus which is good, but not so much an industry-focus. So going in when a customer here or there and really do well with that customer because in the smaller company you often say that catch 22 well, where do I get the resources. I don't want to get out ahead of my headlights.","So we're bringing them into more; for example, appliance customers than they were in before. We're bringing them into more medical customers than they were in before. They weren't in automotive customers and we're bringing them in there.","And in industrial transportation where they have a very nice business, the combination of their sensor business and our connector business it's very attractive to our customers. So that's how I really think about it if I hit your question.","Craig Hettenbach","It does. Thanks.","Tom Lynch","Welcome.","Sujal Shah","All right. Thank you, Craig. Could we have next question please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Wamsi Mohan","Yes. Thank you, good morning. Tom, you commented about -- commented on lower energy prices as it pertains to the oil and gas portfolio. But I was wondering are you seeing any trends of change in purchasing behavior from a demand standpoint in the transportation business given where gas prices are, and I have a follow-up for Bob.","Tom Lynch","I would say that our customers, Wamsi, anticipate some of that. But it's probably still too early. When we talk to them, they will tell us that is a typical trend. Gas prices go down in the U.S. with the improving economy, trucks go up, we like that. We have a lot of content on trucks. But I think it's too early to say that we're seeing the trends yet; although, the mix of content, as I alluded to earlier, is still moving in a strong direction.","Wamsi Mohan","Right.","Tom Lynch","But if prices stay low that that will help demand.","Wamsi Mohan","Okay. Great. Thanks. And Bob, can you talk a little bit about any synergies that might come from this divestiture, particularly because of maybe shared facility usage or overhead absorption? And what sort of things you intend to do operationally to offset some of that? And do you anticipate anything like site consolidation, et cetera? Thanks.","Bob Hau","For the most part, from a factory standpoint, our BNS business had standalone facilities. So, those facilities will transact with the field. So we don't have a lot of work from a standpoint of factory remaining of X% for or having to find a way to manufacture something that is in a facility that is going, relatively segregated, so not a lot of work and worry there.","There are, of course, some shared services activities, some corporate functions. We've got a year before the deal closes; and of course, we have a transaction services agreement post deal closure. So we got some time to work through those issues. We don't anticipate it to be an issue one way or another.","Wamsi Mohan","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Sujal Shah","All right, Wamsi. Could we have the next question please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Mark Delaney","Yes. Good morning, and thanks very much for taking the questions. I was hoping you could elaborate a little bit more on some of your prior comments about potentially looking to make some additional investments with the proceeds from the BNS sale. I know you talked about some of the product lines and you are excited to be an IOT-type focus company now with industrial and automotive.","But maybe you could just touch on to how you are thinking about your end market diversification going forward? And just as you exit BNS, the exposure to auto and industrial would go up, and just if you could talk about your comfort levels with exposure to those markets. And as you're thinking about making investments, do want to try and increase your exposure into other areas?","Tom Lynch","Thanks Mark. So in terms of the first part of the question, increasing organic investments, we have seen over the last five years is pretty good correlation, particularly in the harsh businesses, which are strong suit that when we invest and increase the number of engineers and field engineers, field engineers in our industrial business because there's lots of customers in fragmented market and design engineers. And then in our more OEM kid of business like commercial air, automotive, industrial transportation, design engineers.","So wherever we have the opportunity to put -- find the right design engineers, put them close to the customer, we take it. It's kind of an open-ended charge to go get those folks because there is such a correlation.","And the more that we can be sitting with the customer and the architecture, the better job we can do for them and the more business we get. And you can see it best in the rate of growth in our commercial air businesses and our automotive and industrial transportation businesses.","More recently, we've been applying that to our industrial equipment business and our appliance business, high margin, high market share businesses where co-design and because we have a lot of systems knowledge, we can really help the customer to design their products, the insides of their products, the electrical system or the electronic systems function, much more effective.","So we make those investments were the customers are receptive to them and where we can get the engineers and the right engineers. It's much less about if are we going to hold off on investing in automotive until we bring industrial up, no. And the reason is because of the content growth.","Automotive grew 4.5%, vehicle production last year projected somewhere around 2.5% this year. We're still going to be mid to high single digits growth because of the designing wins we had and the vehicle content growth.","So, this content growth is probably as good and it's consistent as it's ever been at least in the nine years I've been here. So it provides an element of growth that, while the business itself might cycle, this should be a good business for us in most cycles.","On top of that, if you look at what our margins were five or six years ago, they are dramatically improved, because we've become much more effective at what we do and how we design. And by the way, our customers share in that improvement.","And even with that, the margins are up. So that, when the cycle maybe goes into a down cycle, our wherewithal is so much stronger. So now I don't look at it from hey I wouldn't want to get a bunch of new design wins or acquire some technology that is relevant to us. If it's automotive because it makes us bigger because I just think the underlying trend is so positive there.","But it's clear that when we look across the portfolio, sensors in general and the industrial markets we serve in particular are very, very high priorities for M&A. It plays through our strong suite. We've been making smaller acquisitions there to in some cases give us a portfolio like SEACON or broaden our portfolio like this company Sibas that we acquired in China in the last few months.","Not a big company, but a significant product line we didn't have that they only sold in China that will now take around the world. So, you will continue to see us make small technology acquisitions so that the solution strategy we can bring more and more to the customer.","And it's all relevant. It all has to do with collectivity or sensors. All right, does that carry your question?","Mark Delaney","Yes, that's very helpful. And then, for a follow-up, just on the SG&A, the dollars came down sequentially and I think the SG&A as a percentage of sales was at one of lowest levels in several years.","Maybe first just how much of that was some of the TEOA initiatives versus just FX causing SG&A to come down? And then maybe you can help us think about what the SG&A levels will run at going forward.","Tom Lynch","Mark, from a standpoint of the benefit, year-over-year, we've done about 40 basis points. There are certainly benefit in both areas of TEOA. As you know, last year, we expanded TEOA from what had been a factory productivity and a lean product development process in our DNE organization to really be as we call it TEOA everywhere in our G&A functions are now seeing the benefit of that.","There's also definitely some tailwind from an FX standpoint. So it's a combination of both. And, as we continue to see organic growth, we'd expect that percent of sales to generate some leverage throughout the course of the year.","Bob Hau","But just add to that, the area that we've been consistently investing in and happens to show up in this line, but it's really the digital effort to accelerate the digitization of the company better website, better product information, things like that.","So that's going to continue. We view that as essential to our value proposition. And so, we're not -- there are some areas we're not investing and we feel we're adequate in the back office. That's not an area. That's a strategic area that we're investing in the S portion of G&A.","And, we're not shy about putting field resources in the field, particularly in harsh environments where the solutions are more complex and the ability to help the customer through the design, from a field, applications, engineering perspective, it's important.","And then thirdly, we're going to be investing in field resources and sensors. We've started to take advantage of all of these opportunities. And they are growers. So, the multiplier to growth is very positive. It takes a few years. But I think with our margin improvement and the leverage across the balance of our SG&A that sums it out adequately and continues to put a lot of fuel into the growth pipeline.","Sujal Shah","Thank you, Mark. Can we have the next question please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of William Stein from SunTrust. Please go ahead.","William Stein","Great. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on a very strong operational outlook. First I am hoping to get a clarification. When asked about margins, I think you said you wouldn't disclose gross margin.","But operating margin on BNS was above company average, nicely double-digit that's surprising to me. Did I hear that right?","Bob Hau","Yes. I believe I said and should have said it is slightly below company average. ","William Stein","Got it. Okay. And then my kind of real question I guess is actually about SubCom. We spent a lot of time today talking about kind of what's core and in particular talking about harsh and then other things that you came to decide wanted course that you're divesting.","This is an area that certainly I think sits in the category of harsh, but you've also talked about it as in a way, very different and potentially not core to the company, but of course, it's difficult to find a buyer.","We're seeing your only real competitor I think in this space Alcatel-Lucent, looking like they're to IPO this business. Understanding that the timing might not be right given the toughing position of that revenue. Is there something you could consider?","Tom Lynch","We could yes. Are we? No. We've looked at this many times. The most important thing about the business is they're the best in the world at what they do. So, when you start out with that, at least my philosophy is you got to be careful that you don't run away from a business too fast.","And given the uniqueness of the business, it really is worth more inside the portfolio that the out. Sure there is a lot of people would love it but I know they either don't have the wherewithal to pay.","If you contrasted to BNS, BNS is another good business. We weren\u2019t sitting here with our finger on the red button, let's get rid of this thing was a strategic decision that it's not going to get as much priority as it did before sensors. It still can be a very good business.","We think there is a good cycle or a solid cycle coming. And, when we cross with the strategic buyer that could but it at a price where they could get their value and we could get our value, it made total sense. And, if you look at somebody else indicated earlier in the call, that's been kind of our approach to the businesses, you could call a niche business that are on the outside of the portfolio.","In this case, SubCom is a niche, but it's a world leader in what it does. So it has real value. And I think it's going to be with us for a long time.","William Stein","Great, thank you.","Tom Lynch","You're welcome.","Sujal Shah","Thank you, Will. Can we have the next question please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sherri Scribner from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Sherri Scribner","Hi, thanks. I was just hoping you could give us a little more detail on the pieces of the BNS businesses that you're just selling and what specifically those products are and how much of that came from the ADC acquisition?","Tom Lynch","Sure. There's really I would say three -- a lot of products, but if you wanted to break it down, what we call the telecom business was half of that came from ABC and half of that came from TE. And those are the fiber optic and copper connectivity solutions that are in the outside plant of a telecom or a cable network.","So they're connecting the fibers and the coppers and collect that go from the origination of the signal out of a cable head end or a central office for telecom through the network to your house or to a node close to your house. That's half of the business, a little over half of the business.","About 40% of the business are what we refer to enterprise. So that's sort of the conventional way to describe it as structured cable in the enterprise or in the data center. So that's where in your office you have the communication cable behind the wall that provide that come to the outlet that we used to plug our PCs in to get data and we now have wireless access point on the end of those cables.","And that's a business -- that's a lot of small transactions all around the world. And then, the remaining piece of the business for us is this relatively small niche digital antenna business.","All of the digital antenna business came from ADC. About 20% of the enterprise business came from ADC and a little over half of the telecom business came from ADC.","Sherri Scribner","Okay, thank you. That's helpful. And then just thinking about the consumer business that business has been declining for you in terms of revenue on a year-over-year basis since you broke it out. I am trying to understand what type of goals do have for that business? And what needs to happen there before you make a decision that maybe that's also a piece of business that you may want to divest?","Tom Lynch","Yes I have said before I hate to never say never. But, because you can imagine we study and think about this a lot. But I have not come up with any multitude of scenarios that we've played out where we would sell our consumer device connectivity business. It is what we do.","What we're doing differently, is coming at it much more as a product and a platform business. So, while we have it in a segment in a vertical market, it's optimize miniaturization. Optimize antennas things like that. Optimize high-speed cable assemblies that are needed with the capability that is needed all over the company. Some of the company has its own capability and some of it relies on consumer.","But to really come at it from much more of a platform basis, so that it's much less trying to pick a winner that you win which in this consumer business is very, very difficult to do. And because we've been trailing it for a few years, it makes it even more difficult when you're not the incumbent.","So the strategy there is to run it a little differently. And by combining it with the DataComm, it would be more cost-effective. It would be better with the customers. So we're not -- we collaborate nicely, but really one face with the customer.","And the focus is to put more emphasis and more investment which we will be able to, once we do this on a really critical technologies and get out of stuff that I know we've been in it for 15 years, but that's become a real commodity in the business and you're never going to make double-digit margins on it.","We expect these businesses over the next say 18 to 24 months things will get back to double-digit margins and I don't think that's a whim. There is a real plan to get there. That's based on some success that we've had already in platforms.","Sherri Scribner","Thanks Tom that's helpful. And then Bob, I just wanted to ask in terms of the cash balance. It looks like the cash balance now is relatively low after acquisitions. Can you just let us know what type of cash levers you need to run the business and I know there are some timing issues in there. If you can just tell us what brings that cash level backup. Thank you.","Bob Hau","Sure. Thanks. The cash balance is down a bit, obviously in the current quarter we paid for the measurement acquisitions. So we had built up quite a bit of cash in the preceding quarters. But, we're sitting at about $900 million of cash, a level that we're very comfortable with.","$0.5 billion to $1 billion, $0.75 billion is kind of what we need to operate and not an issue there whatsoever and of course we're very strong cash generating business. First quarter is traditionally our latest quarter and that will be the case for 2015 also.","So that will ramp as we get into Q2 and beyond.","Sherri Scribner","Thank you.","Sujal Shah","All right. Thank you, Sherri. Can we have the next question please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Suva from Citi. Please go ahead.","Jim Suva","Thank you very much. Could you first of all I have a question for each of you. Maybe if Bob could let us know little bit, just to be clear, the stock -- accelerated stock buyback announced today and I assume fiscal '15 EPS does not include anything from the accelerated portion of that?","And then Tom, on the consumer you mentioned that you're narrowing your focus. TE from the spin in 2007, the first few years was about narrowing the focus and now we haven't heard that for the past few years or at least maybe I don't remember it now.","It seems like you're talking about narrowing consumer focus little bit again, but that narrowing of the consumer be completed? Thank you.","Bob Hau","Soon I hope Jim. There are some chunks. The first phase of it, you have a good memory was we really outsourced a lot of products back in the day and resold it under our brand-name. And concluded back then that really didn't make much sense given the changing circumstances in the industry. At one time it did, but it didn't. And that had distracted us a bit.","Now it's really about -- it's really about platforming and getting out of these commodity applications where you're not really leveraging what we do best, precision engineering, high-speed, high power throughput.","So I think we were too fragmented and the first go-round wasn\u2019t good enough and as the market continue to be very dynamic, there has only been one consistent player on top and everybody else underneath has changed than I think for where we were in the order of our position and our part of the market, we suffered from that.","But I do feel like we have the team that's come in over the last couple of years and the product range that we're developing, that gives us the ability to not bet on customers, but provide core capability that you have to tailor or semi-customized for the customers.","It's a bit of a change. This business has never been if I would have ranked us from strongest to weakest, it's never been amongst our strongest I would say over the last five or six years.","I feel like we're rebuilding our strength because the fundamental knowhow is there and now we're much more focused. The results have to be produced. There's no question about it. But I would say over the last six to nine months I feel it taking shape that it's going to be a solid business.","And I keep saying to everyone who asks me, would you consider selling this business? Never say never, but I don't even think about it because these are the products we make. The billions of things we punch out a year, these are products and they go into other places.","So we're pretty confident we will move the performance of the business up that we move nicely with the Chinese OEMs. It's not enough to celebrate with. But it's through the key milestone of the last six month to change our position meaningfully there not just accidentally. And we've done that. It's not enough to declare victory.","But we have a pretty stringent milestone here that we hold ourselves to and we're making progress. But it's going to be a couple of years before this is the double-digit business. But there's a clear path to get there.","Tom Lynch","And then Jim, from the standpoint of the share repurchase, we did not announce an accelerated share repurchase program. What we've said was the majority of the proceeds will be used for share repurchase. The Board of Directors did authorize an increase in our repurchase program, adding $3 billion.","So we now have $3.7 billion of authorization and we will continue to buyback shares for our prior program, though the balance of this year, and then once the transaction closes, by the end of this calendar year, that $3 billion will be available for repurchase at that time.","Jim Suva","Great. Thanks for the clarification.","Sujal Shah","Thank you, Jim. Looks like there are no further questions. So if you do have question please contact Investor Relations at TE. Thank you for joining us this morning and have a great day.","A - Tom Lynch","Thanks everyone.","A - Bob Hau","Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be available for replay after 10:45 Eastern time today through February 4.","You may access the AT&T TeleConference Replay System at any time by dialing 1 (800) 475-6701, and entering the access code 346561.

Please go ahead.","Sujal Shah","Good morning, and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss TE Connectivity's third quarter results. With me today are Chief Executive Officer, Terrence Curtin; and Chief Financial Officer, Heath Mitts.","During this call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information, and we ask you to review the forward-looking cautionary statements included in today's press release. In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussion this morning, and we ask you to review the sections of our press release and the accompanying slide presentation that address the use of these items.

We are willing to take follow-up questions, but ask that you rejoin the queue if you have a second question.","Now, let me turn the call over to Terrence for opening comments.","Terrence Curtin","Thank you, Sujal. And also I appreciate everyone joining us today as we go through our third quarter results and our revised outlook for 2019.","Now, before I get into the slides, let me frame out a few key points that we\u2019re going to talk about in today\u2019s call. First off, I\u2019m very pleased with our execution in the third quarter. We delivered adjusted earnings per share $0.07 above the midpoint of guidance, despite sales being $60 million below the midpoint, in what continues to be an uncertain market backdrop that weakened since our call with you just 90 days ago.","Despite this weaker market backdrop, I want to stress that we continue to be focused on executing our strategy, and the multiple leverage in our business model. And as we\u2019ve been sharing with you and started at our Investor Day, there is three areas of key focus within our business model, which include top-line growth, number one; secondly, margin expansion; and thirdly, capital deployment.","And when we think about these three areas, and starting with the growth one, growth is around positioning our portfolio in markets with long-term secular trends that enable organic outperformance from content growth through the cycle, as well as expansion of our portfolio inorganically.","When we think about the second lever of margin, it is looking at structural cost improvement through both footprint rationalization, as well as selling, general and administrative expense initiatives that give us scale advantage.","And on the third, when we think about capital deployment, it starts with our strong cash flow generation model, and how we balance the capital return, as well as expanding our portfolio that I think we've been pretty clear on in our experience that you've had with us, it has been pretty consistent.","When we think about this year, and really driven by the market environment backdrop, the organic growth lever has been challenged after two years where it was the key pillar of our performance. And in 2019, we have been focused on executing on the other levers to protect margin and earnings performance.","Now, as we look forward, we are reducing our full-year guidance for both sales and adjusted earnings per share due entirely to the incremental market weakness that we're experiencing. During last quarter\u2019s earnings announcement, we indicated that we were seeing stabilization in key end markets, and that was reflected by sequential order growth that we were experiencing. Now, since that time, we have seen this trend reverse and have seen a sequential decline in orders.","Order patterns, when you take it into the two big buckets of this decline, the first one is a further drop in auto production in China and then, the second is broad inventory destocking of electronic components in the distribution channel. And both of these are really why we've adjusted our outlook.","The other thing that I want to stress before I get into slides is that, the proof on the execution against our leverage is our model in this challenging market. It\u2019s really illustrated not only by our third quarter performance where we grew earnings per share on a sales decline, but also the change in our guidance since the start of the year. Our original fiscal year guidance last November was for sales of $14.1 billion and adjusted earnings per share $5.70. Our current guide is for sales of $13.4 billion and adjusted earnings per share $5.50. Current guidance represents a $700 million drop in sales but only a $0.20 drop in adjusted earnings per share versus our guidance at the start of the year. And what I would tell you, I think this is proof of execution versus the levers in our model, as well as the improvement we've made in this portfolio to enable margin and earnings resiliency through a cycle.","So, let me now get into the slides, and Heath and I'll go through them and get into more details. And let's start with slide three. And I'll review the highlights in the quarter.","From a top-line perspective, sales were $3.4 billion, and this was down 5% year-over-year on a reported basis and down 3% organically. The difference between reported and organic is primarily due to a headwind of approximately $125 million, which is due to currency translation.","In our Transportation segment, our sales were down 4% organically due to a greater than expected decline in auto production that was at 10% globally, and this was driven by China. Our Industrial segment grew 2% organically, in line with our guidance, driven by strong performance and growth in our commercial aerospace, defense and medical markets. And our Communication segment declined 11% on an organic basis, which was lower than we expected, due to inventory destocking and the distribution channel.","From an earnings perspective, our third quarter adjusted operating margins were 17.6%, up 20 basis points year-over-year, as well as up 60 basis points sequentially. This is really due to our team\u2019s execution of the cost lever, as I mentioned earlier. And operating margins are up both year-over-year and sequentially, despite revenue declines. ","From an earnings per share perspective, our adjusted earnings per share was a $1.50 and exceeded the high end of the guidance, despite the lower sales and was driven by the strong operational execution that I mentioned. In addition to the earnings, our strong cash generation is key enabler of our business model. And our free cash flow was $515 million in the third quarter. Year-to-date, our free cash flow is $928 million and is up approximately 27% versus the prior year.","During the quarter, we returned $307 million to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. And in addition to return of capital, our capital deployment strategy continues to include building out our portfolio inorganically to further capitalize on the secular trends to drive future growth. In the quarter, we completed bolt-on acquisitions of the Kissling Group that will benefit our commercial transportation business as well as Alpha Technics, a provider of temperature sensing technology into the medical market. In addition, we also announced our intent to acquire First Sensor, which is a German public sensor company that serves auto, industrial and medical markets, and just how that process works that will be further out and won\u2019t close immediately.","So, now, let met talk more about the change in guidance. And as I mentioned earlier, it\u2019s based solely upon the weaker market conditions. And we\u2019re reducing the full sales outlook by $250 million to $13.4 billion, and the midpoint of adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.10 to $5.50.","Of the $250 million reduction from our prior view, approximately two-thirds is in transportation, which is primarily driven by China -- China auto and approximately one-third is in communications, which is primarily driven by lower demand in the distribution channel, as a result of destocking by our partners. As a result of market conditions, we are also further increasing the scope of our restructuring to $375 million this year, which is an increase of $125 million for our prior view, and Heath will get into more details later.","So, I appreciate if you could turn to slide four and let me get into the order trends by our segments.","In the third quarter, our organic orders were down 10% year-over-year, 4% sequentially, reflecting end markets and inventory trends that I mentioned. Our book to bill was 0.98 and our orders declined in each region and in each segment.","By segment, Transportation was down 10% organically year-over-year, reflecting further declines in auto production, primarily in China. The sequential order increases we saw in China in the second quarter, reversed in the third quarter as both auto sales and production figures weakened further. By region, we saw year-over-year declines in the double digits in China as well as in Europe and mid single digit decline in the Americas.","In the Industrial segment, industrial orders were down 5% organically, driven by industrial equipment, partially offset by growth in aerospace and defense, as well as in energy. I do want to highlight that in our Industrial Equipment business, it does have a high ratio of sales to the distribution channel.","In our Communications segment, orders were down 17% organically year-over-year, driven by broad-based weaknesses across all regions.","So, let me talk a little bit about what we're seeing in the distribution channel. And as I mentioned earlier, we are being impacted by destocking by our partners.","Now, at the total TE level, this fiscal year, approximately 20% of our sales are through our distribution partners. And we have higher levels of concentration in the Industrial and Communications segments. We've seen a large reduction in orders by our distributors as a result of broader inventory trends that go beyond our products, and it goes into other component areas. Based on the order patterns, we are expecting a substantial reduction in distribution revenue in our fourth quarter, which we have reflected in our guidance.","So, please turn to slide five and I'll discuss our segment results in the quarter. And as always, I'll start with Transportation.","Transportation sales were down 4% organically you-over-year. Our auto sales were down 4% organically versus auto production declines of 10% in the quarter that I mentioned earlier. Our outperformance versus auto production continues to be driven by content growth from the secular trends we\u2019ve positioned around, including electric vehicles and increased autonomous features. For the full-year, we continue to expect content growth to partially buffer auto production declines, consistent with the content growth targets we've laid out for you.","In commercial transportation, sales were down 5% organically, reflecting broad market weakness, both across markets and regions. And our sensors business grew 1% organically year-on-year with growth driven by industrial applications.","From an earnings perspective for the segment, adjusted operating margins were 18.6%, and they grew 110 basis points sequentially, as a result of the accelerated costs actions we\u2019ve talked to you about. In light of market conditions, we expect to take additional cost actions, which is reflected in the increased restructuring charges I mentioned earlier.","So, please turn to slide six, and I'll discuss our Industrial Solutions segment.","The segment sales grew 2% organically year-over-year, in line with our expectations with growth in aerospace, defense and medical really being the growth drivers. Our aerospace, defense and marine business delivered a very strong quarter of 17% organic growth, driven by both, new program ramps and commercial aerospace, as well as the defense side. In industrial equipment, sales were down 6% organically, driven by inventory destocking, partially offset by strength in medical applications. Also, our energy business was flat on an organic basis with growth in North America offsetting declines in Europe.","From an earnings perspective, Industrial Solutions\u2019 adjusted operating margins expanded 220 basis points over the prior year to 16.6%, driven by strong operational execution by our team. I am pleased that we can still generate strong performance in this quarter, despite a challenging market environment. And our plans remain on track to expand adjusted operating margins into the high teens over time for this segment.","So, let me turn to Communications Solutions and flip to page seven, please.","Communications sales were down 11% organically, well below our expectations, and it goes back to what I talked about earlier. This segment has the highest percentage of business going through the distribution channel. So, there is a greater impact from inventory destocking in this segment. Adjusted operating margins were 14.9%, they declined 70 basis points over the prior year due to volume.","So, with that, I will turn it over to Heath to cover the financials for quarter three, and I will come back and cover guidance.","Heath Mitts","Thank you, Terrence, and good morning, everyone.","Please turn to slide eight, where I\u2019ll provide more details on the Q3 financials.","Adjusted operating income was $596 million with an adjusted operating margin of 17.6%. GAAP operating income was $520 million and included $67 million of restructuring and other charges and $9 million of acquisition charges.","Last quarter, we mentioned that we were broadening the scope of our cost initiatives to better align the cost structure of the organization with the market environment. Given the market conditions, we are taking further advantage of the current low in demands to reduce our fixed costs and better align our footprint with our customer supply chain. Hence, we are increasing our estimate of restructuring charges to $375 million for the full year. This represents an increase of $125 million versus our prior view. The additional actions are primarily in our Transportation and Communication segments. And I\u2019m confident that the initiatives we've taken so far this year have enabled margin and EPS resiliency, despite weaker markets. We are now further accelerating cost actions to ensure that we can preserve margin and EPS performance during this part of the cycle. As we have shown in the past, this will enable us to realize improved margin as demand returns.","Adjusted EPS was a $1.50, up 6% year-over-year. We were able to grow adjusted EPS year-over-year, despite a reduction of revenue, which demonstrates our ability to execute on multiple levers to drive earnings performance. GAAP EPS was $2.24 for the quarter and included a $0.91 tax benefit, primarily related to Swiss tax reform. This benefit was partially offset by restructuring, acquisitions and other charges of $0.17.","The adjusted effective tax rate in Q3 was 13.6%; and for the full-year, we expect the adjusted effective tax rate to be roughly 16.5%. Swiss tax reform resulted in one-time tax benefit in Q3 but increases our effective tax rate going forward. So, you should continue to expect the tax for TE to be in the high teens as we move beyond this year. However, importantly, we expect our cash tax rate to stay well below our reported ETR.","Now, if I can get you to turn to slide nine.","Sales of $3.4 billion were down 5% year-over-year on a reported basis and down 3% organically. Currency exchange rates negatively impacted sales by $123 million versus the prior year. Adjusted operating margins were 17.6%. And our strong margin performance despite lower sales is a result of the benefits we're seeing from proactive cost actions we initiated earlier this year, as well as the progress we've made in profitability across all the segments, particularly the Industrial segment.","In the quarter, cash from continuing operations was $692 million and our free cash flows was $515 million with $166 million of net capital expenditures. We returned $307 million to shareholders through dividend and share repurchases in the quarter. And year-to-date 2019 free cash flow is $928 million, which is an increase of 27% versus the prior year. We expect that our free cash flow will exceed the prior year, even with the increased level of restructuring investment related to our cost initiatives, so powerful story there.","Our balance sheet is healthy, and we expect cash flow to remain strong, which provides us the flexibility to utilize cash for organic growth investments to drive long-term sustainable growth while also allowing us to return capital to shareholders and continue to pursue bolt-on acquisitions.","I'm pleased with our team reacting quickly to pull the levers in our business model earlier in the year to help mitigate the impacts of weaker sales on our margin and EPS performance. But as you should expect, we will continue to balance our structural cost actions with our long-term growth investments to ensure sustainability of our business model going forward.","So, with that, I'll turn it back over to Terrence to cover guidance before we get into questions. ","Terrence Curtin","Thanks, Heath.","And, let me get into guidance, and I'll start with the fourth quarter, which is on slide 10.","Now, based on what we laid out and we\u2019re seeing in the markets and the order trends, fourth quarter revenue is expected to be $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion with adjusted earnings per share of $1.27 to $1.33. At the midpoint, this represents lower year-over-year reported and organic sales of 7%. Even with the sales decline, we\u2019re only expecting year-over-year reduction of $0.05 in adjusted EPS on $250 million of lower revenue, which is evidence of the multiple levers we're pulling in our business model, including the accelerated cost actions Heath just talked about.","Looking at it by segments, we expect Transportation Solutions to be down mid single digits organically. And this is based upon a global auto production environment, which we expect to be down 6% in the quarter with our revenue being impacted by supply chain adjustments, in light of further weakening in production trends.","In Industrial Solutions, we expect to be down low single digits organically with declines in industrial equipment from the inventory destocking being partially offset [technical difficulty] growth momentum in aerospace and defense and medical applications.","And in Communications, we expect to be down approximately in the high teens, as the inventory destocking, we've mentioned, works its way through, and it will impact that segment more than the others.","Now, turn to slide 11, I'll get into the full year guidance for \u201819.","For the full year, we expect sales in the range of $13.35 billion to $13.45 billion. As I mentioned earlier, this is a reduction of $250 million from our prior view, due to lower auto production driven by China and inventory destocking in the distribution channel. Our guidance represents declines of 2% on an organic basis and 4% on a reported basis with currency translation headwinds of $400 million on a full year basis.","Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $5.47 to $5.53. And this is a $0.10 reduction from our prior view. On a year-over-year basis, we are expecting adjusted EPS to be up low single digits excluding currency exchange headwinds of $0.16.","Similar to quarter four, let me get into some color on the segments for the full year guide. We expect Transportation Solutions to be down low single digits organically. And we now expect global auto production to be down approximately 7% versus our prior view of being down 5% with the reduction primarily driven by China, and certainly this is all on our fiscal period. Year-to-date today, our revenue growth has exceeded auto production by the content growth range that we told you that in the range of 4% to 6%. So, our content position is very strong.","In Industrial Solutions, we continue to expect sales to be up low single digits organically with growth driven by aerospace, defense as well as medical applications.","And lastly in Communications, we do expect to be down high single digits organically, driven by the Asia market weakness that we've been talking about before this quarter as well as the inventory destocking in the distribution channel that we\u2019re seeing that\u2019s impacting us here late in the year.","So, with that, before we go into questions, let me just recap some key takeaways that I thought we convey during the call. First, we\u2019ve seen weakening in the market since the last call, and this is driving the reduction in our guidance. It\u2019s driven by two main areas, drop in auto production in China, as well as what we are experiencing through our distribution partners as they are destocking their inventories.","Secondly, we have positioned TE to benefit from secular trends such as electric vehicles, autonomous driving, next generation airframes as well as interventional medical applications and cloud infrastructure growth, which are enabling us to outperform weaker markets.","Thirdly, despite this market backdrop, we are successfully executing on our strategy, driving the multiple levers that we have in our business model to protect our margin and earnings performance through the cycle.","And lastly, goes without saying, I think we\u2019ve proven this, when we've seen markets that were weaker in the past, we're going to take advantage of these lows as an opportunity to aggressively go after cost reduction and footprint consolidation activities, and we're following the same approach and expect to emerge with increased earnings power when these markets return to growth.","So, before I close, I do want to also thank our employees across the world for their execution in quarter three and what continues to be a mixed market backdrop and as well as their commitment to our customers and a future that is safer, sustainable, productive and connected.","So, with that, Sujal, let's open it up for questions.","Sujal Shah","All right. Thank you, Lisa, can you please give the instructions for the Q&A session?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions] Your first question comes from Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. ","Craig Hettenbach","Yes. Thank you. Question to Terrance, just given the backdrop that we\u2019re in, just wanted to get your thoughts, kind of as you manage internally, you have a number of restructuring programs going on, but also externally you are still looking to kind of pursue and execute on M&A. And then, how you kind of balance those things in what's kind of a difficult cycle?","Terrence Curtin","I mean, couple of things. I think, first off, it goes back to we're very fortunate that we have a very strong cash generation model that you see it with the free cash flow we generated. So, I don't think, as we manage through both of these as well as we return capital to owners, I don't think it's one versus the other. I think, what's really nice about what we've done with our portfolio, you see how the content trends where we position ourselves well, you see it even how automotive content\u2019s buffering, recession and automotive production that we got a little bit of head take last quarter in China that made it a little bit worse here. But I do think, when we look at what sensors and medical which are platforms that we want to build on, as well as areas like Kissling that we talked about, that\u2019s an area where electric and how do we get into high power and commercial transportation. We're going to continue to look for M&A opportunities that continue to build on where we have a very strong position.","So, I don't think it\u2019s one versus the other. And I also believe when we get into our cost structure, I'm pretty pleased that we\u2019ve got after it early in the year. We've been sort of -- auto production has gotten worse. So, we had to expand some things to make sure we take the cost out during the low. And even with what Heath talked about, what we're talking about in some of the expanded is also making sure we're looking at maybe some opportunities in Communications at higher volumes we probably couldn't take advantage of.","The only other thing I would add is I'm also very pleased that when you think about the adjustments, we're making to market, there's also things we teed up last year and the year before that we talked about, about the Industrial segment. And you're really seeing how we continue to improve the performance of that segment, how it\u2019s contributing. And there's still things that aren't -- some of the investments we've made aren't having a payback yet. So, I think it provides future leverage as we fix the fixed cost structure TE, and get better aligned, and also a little bit more agile.","So, I think, you're going to continue to see us balancing both of them. And I think, this quarter is a great example of it.","Operator","The next question comes from David Leiker from Baird. Your line is open.","David Leiker","I wanted to dig through a little bit about some of these headwinds you're seeing in the channel. It seems to be impacting you a little bit later than some other people. I want to understand, if we can, how your business going through that channel is different than other people? And how long for your products -- as we go through those corrections in that channel, how long does it last for you to kind of work through that? Thanks. ","Terrence Curtin","Okay. So, David, I don't know what other products that you\u2019re talking about. When you think through us, of our $13.4 billion of revenue, there's a little bit over $2 billion that goes through channel partners. And it's really around the medium to small customers that we can't serve directly and we do leverage our channel partners for that. When you look at and you sort of take that $2 billion, our transportation business is a very direct business. So, the channel impact is pretty small when it deals with our Transportation segment. As you deal with the markets that have more fragmented customer basis, you get that in our industrial equipment area that's been impacted by it, you're also seeing it in our Communications segment.","And, what we were seeing was actually our business through our channel partners have been staying pretty stable at around -- the orders were running around $500 million per quarter, about the last six quarters. And this past quarter and the June quarter, it's stepped down, and we expect it to step down even further, and there's been some announcements out there. Typically, that's getting aligned more with the slowness of the market, as well as I think we're also being impacted that some of the channel partners due to lead times and other product categories and certain semi categories and passives probably got a little bit ahead of themselves in making sure they had enough supply.","That all being said, these types of supply chain adjustments, while a headwind now, typically take four to six months to sort of work through. Clearly, we're in the middle of it and I think they are temporary effects. So, they are something we're going to have to work through here over the next couple of quarters. And, that'll be a tailwind at some point, depending upon where markets are. And we're in the middle of it. So, while it may be later versus other categories, it is -- we start to see it in the orders from quarter three. It will be with us for a little bit. And then, it will be a tailwind at some point when it corrects and gets normalized.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Shawn Harrison from Longbow Research. Your line is open.","Shawn Harrison","The auto sector in terms of the step-down here, particularly lead by China, are there any leading indicators that you\u2019re looking to track the inventory, the other factors within China or globally that will tell you we\u2019ve reached the bottom? And I\u2019m now looking for you to guide the December quarter but just to speak about it in some sense of whether we could reach the bottom in the December quarter, and calendar \u201820 could represent a more positive environment.","Terrence Curtin","Sure. So, as everybody heard us talk last quarter, we sort of knew we were getting the stabilization in auto production. And I think I\u2019ve been said on this call or at some conversations, at conferences, we sort of thought we were running around 22 million units of cars being produced per quarter and we thought we were stabilizing. And to the comments I made on the call, what we actually saw in sort of after our earnings, you saw China car sales were down mid teens, and certainly that has impacted China auto production. And I would tell you right now, global automotives running around 21 million unites versus 22 million units. So, that's impacted us by about of 2 million units coming out.","That all being said, we are looking at inventories in China, inventory days on hand in China in addition to the sales. They are around 59 days on hand. That\u2019s a little heavy. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s horribly heavy. But, they are the types of things both on the car sales as well as the inventories we're looking at. And right now, I would tell you, we\u2019re sort of assuming that we\u2019re running around that 21 million unit rate. China typically has a step up in the first quarter in production. I guess, that\u2019s the real uncertainty. I would say, we have to continue to walk for the car sales and inventory levels are before we would tell you where we should be. But right now, our model is sort of thinking, they\u2019re saying how do we plan the business around 21 million units globally per quarter in automotives, how we're thinking about it and also how we're adjusting our cost structure and some of the things Heath talked about.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Wamsi Mohan","Terrance, you opened the call talking about revenue growth and sort of some of the headwinds here in 2019. As we think about adjusting to these lower organic growth levels in fiscal \u201819, can you maybe give us some sense of how we should think about heading into fiscal \u201820 first quarter, how we should think about seasonality and also these lower fiscal 4Q levels? And how do you view the odds of continued headwinds going into fiscal \u201820?","Terrence Curtin","Thank you for the question, Wamsi. There is part of this as you know, I\u2019m going to not answer because we're really not guiding to \u201820 here, and certainly, as we get more intelligence, we will. I think, there are some things that I would highlight though to your question. I think, there will be things like auto production that has been fluid. I think, we have to continue to keep fluid. But, I would also say, when you also think about that, of this point, actually we\u2019ve talked around 21 million units is, we're still positioning ourselves around that 4% to 6% content element. So, you've seen it this year, even at while the market\u2019s been worse. I think, you're going to continue to see that. So, as we pick production points and you do your analysis, I do think you're going to see those benefits around transportation. Certainly, you're going to see it in aerospace, you\u2019re seeing it in medical. So, I think that's, that's first up, I would say, as you work your analysis is important.","I'll go -- second thing is, probably going back to what David said. Channel destocking is a temporary item. And I think there's going to be a lot of data points, not only by us, but there's some out there. This will normalize. So, what is the headwind that we have in quarter four that will go into early next year, certainly that will turn like it typically does.","And the other thing I would just say, as we go into next year, and as well as revenue is, there's lots of levers that we're pulling. And where they hit in the year from a cost perspective will be at different points, depending upon we initiated. But I do think, as we try to manage through this, we have many cost levers that we're working that I think no different as we displayed in quarter three and quarter four. We're going to continue to be working from an earnings perspective.","Now, that being said, there is a sub point in your question around how do we see seasonality? Let's face it, this year, seasonality was not normal. Quarter three and quarter four typically are strongest quarters of the year, and quarter four is already going to be our weakest. So, I don't think you can take the normal seasonal patterns that we have and say, hey, quarter one is going to be down mid to high single digits in the quarter four. I think, you have to adjust for some of these facts, as you look at that. And certainly, we\u2019ll guide more as we talk to you in 90 days. But we just not say go blind seasonality, because these markets aren\u2019t typical either.","So, a longer answer than probably wanted, but hopefully that gives you some insights, as you think about things. And we\u2019ll give you more input in 90 days.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis from Melius Research. Your line is open.","Scott Davis","I know this might be hard to answer and I know you're not giving 2020 guidance. But, can you help us give a little granularity on the restructuring, as far as kind of payback is -- sometimes you do restructuring in Europe and it takes a few years to see an impact but you do in the U.S. and it\u2019s immediate. Could you just help us understand either directionally or an actual kind of tailwind for 2020 would be helpful, or at least some color around where the restructuring is?","Heath Mitts","Scott, I think, you're right on in terms of that some of non-U.S. restructuring does have a longer cash on cash return in addition to the just the length of time to when you're taking factories offline, to -- from the point of initiation until you when you realize the savings. I think, it's fair to say, of that 375, there's a blend that on average it\u2019s about three to four-year payback. So, that would kind of steer you towards a number of annualized savings as part of that and steer you towards jurisdictionally where all this activity is taking place.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Mark Delaney","I was hoping you could got a little bit more into China region specifically, with the decline in orders that you saw there and the reversal compared to what you\u2019ve been seen last quarter, is that all just macro and weakness or do you think any of this is due to the trade environment and potentially a more difficult region for U.S. companies to do business now? Thanks.","Terrence Curtin","So, a couple of things. Certainly, the global trade environment, I think, just creates an overlay around economic conditions period. I don't think it\u2019s only one or two countries, it impacts everything. So, I do think that has some impact on the slower economic conditions because places like Europe ships into China and so forth, and that impacts us in many places.","And, Mark, back to the question that you had, when we were sitting here last quarter, we saw nice increase in our China business totally. Our orders went up, almost 10% going from our first quarter to second quarter, and it was primarily driven by transportation and it did revert back. I would say, in our industrial businesses, it has stayed steady at a constant rate. I wouldn\u2019t say, it\u2019s accelerating, but it\u2019s sideways. So, in those, our Industrial businesses, it\u2019s staying steady. And it was flat year-over-year. But auto has been the bigger piece for us as that production has declined. I don\u2019t think when it comes to automotive and our position we have in automotive, I don\u2019t think it is impacted by our U.S. attachment.","The other thing I would say, the places that I would say have gotten little bit weaker is around the communication equipment. That\u2019s an area, and also in appliances and CS, we\u2019ve been talking about that all year, they\u2019ve been environments where they have been slow. So, in the industrial space, it\u2019s been more a stable and sideways. But really, the slowing we saw versus last quarter is really in our Transportation and Communications segments, not as much our Industrial space.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano from Cowen. Your line is open.","Joe Giordano","I know, it\u2019s hard to do for you guys, but is there any way to kind of at least triangulate how much you think on the Communications jam-up on the supply side is due to like very specific temporary issues, that like Huawei and restrictions on certain entities?","Terrence Curtin","I would tell you, when we think about the supply side of that, I don\u2019t think channel has anything to do with that. Our channel business, large customers, we service directly. So, when you sit there, and the portfolio set in our Communications segment is a portfolio set that goes into a lot of different applications, not just high speed, and it\u2019s why it does have a big part that goes to the channel. They are in both our appliance business and our D&D business. They are basic building blocks that can be used in a lot of different areas. So, when -- to try tie what's going on with the channel to telecom China, I think that would be a leap too far. We are also seeing it in Industrial -- our Industrial markets as well. I\u2019m sorry, Joe. ","Joe Giordano","Yes. So, obviously, it\u2019s like an indirect route. I was just curious if there was any way to kind of like close that loop there.","Terrence Curtin","No. I mean, I think, the other thing that you have, I don\u2019t think you can close that loop there. There has been some slowness by certain other telecom equipment makers and certainly cloud spending, which was very strong growth last year, so growing that at a lower rate. There's lots of those other factors that I would also say impact that. But I wouldn\u2019t tie it completely back to Huawei.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","Christopher Glynn","The headline China numbers are one story, but maybe electric vehicles little different story, I think it\u2019s up about 50% year to date. Just wondering if that aligns with your thinking. Do you expect that penetration to accelerate? What are your learnings along that curve from your kind of specification cycles with the customers there?","Terrence Curtin","Certainly, while China auto production is down, electrical vehicle penetration, you're exactly right. If you look at it, if you take full electric plus any hybrid, it continues to accelerate, even though China car production is down. So, that is not changing. Certainly, it's growing, while overall production is down. And our design wins around those electric vehicles continue to be very strong. And let's face, it is something when we think about electric vehicles. Electric vehicles are going to be driven in the world by both, China and Asia, as well as the CO2 requirements that you have in Europe as well. So, when we think about electric vehicles, the place you need to be positioned and we are positioned very strongly is in Europe, it is in China, as well as in Japan. And what's really good is, we're positioned well with our customers. And the one thing that we always watch in slow markets is where is our project momentum, do we see project momentum slowing? We are not seeing any change in the number of projects we have with our customers in any of our businesses. And certainly, in the automotive space, there continues to be the march between electric vehicles and autonomous features by all our customers that serve those markets.","So, we don't see any change in that. Certainly, the global production is impacted. That's more impacting combustion engines.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jim Suva from Citigroup Investment. Your line is open.","Jim Suva","Thank you very much. You\u2019ve been very clear on the automotive side, which is good, but the communications side, I have a few questions. And when we think about that, if my memory is correct, you're really not a smartphone supplier or component to smartphone. So, I assume this is more like on base stations, routers or switches, those type of bigger box figure devices. And with 5G buildout, I got a little surprised to see this type of slowdown. So, can you help us -- can we see an order build-up like last quarter and excess of end demand, or is it a trade war where people overstock, and now they're destocking or was it truly an end-market demand slowdown in the Communications segment? Thanks.","Terrence Curtin","Hey, Jim, twofold, and you're breaking up a little bit on yourself. So, first off, I would say, when you think about our Communications segments, there's a chunk of it, which is data and devices, and then there's another chunk that appliance. So, certainly, we need to look at, to your question at data and devices.","You're right. We do not plan smartphones. So, our products go into base station equipment, goes into traditional switches, like you mentioned. And when you look at it, what we've seen is, we have seen some of the cloud spending not growing as fast as rate as it grew last year. So, when you are talking about something that grew 20%, 30% of spending and as grows 10, you will have adjustments in supply chain. I do think that is working through. On 5G, 5G, when you think about it, certainly we\u2019re designed in. And China is granting licenses, and we're positioned very well there. But that is still early stages of how much does that contribute to TE\u2019s revenue. So, their typical growth drivers we're going to get the benefit from. So, those around cloud and 5G were in good shape.","The other thing I would just say around our D&D and it goes back to the channel comment I made. Typically, our products in D&D are very much next to semiconductors and passives. I do think some of our partners and also other tier 1s in the supply chain probably got a little bit ahead of themselves, as you said, and they are correcting to get to more normalized to end demand. This is not a content or share element, it\u2019s more of we're going to get hurt here a little bit with the inventory destocking but that will normalize. And I feel very good about where we're positioning cloud and 5G. But certainly we don\u2019t plan the cell phones.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Kelly from Jefferies. Your line is now open. ","David Kelly","I just have a quick follow-up on earlier comments on China vehicle inventory levels. If we were to see some hypothetical vehicle demand injection in China, can you talk about your ability to ramp back up to support production growth, given your presumably running leaner with ongoing cost actions? I think, clearly, no one is ready to call for rebound yet, but we're just trying to get a feel for it. There might be an operational lag and impact on short-term margins when production does ultimately rebound.","Terrence Curtin","Clearly, as we do the actions as Heath talked about, we are also being very-focused on how in those core areas that we keep production flexibility. And what we had was in some cases, we were playing catch-up as the volume was growing very strong, we talked about last year, we feel we have enough capacity if we do get a jump back in there. It might be a little bit of a lag but we feel very good with how not only what we do but also our extended supply chain can do. So, that is not something we worry about. And certainly, if it came back stronger than we thought, we would also have to look at how we time some of those restructuring actions that Heath talked about.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Deepa Raghavan from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. ","Deepa Raghavan","I think, it\u2019s a question for you, how do we think about contribution margins, given that weakness in end markets will be offset by some of the cost actions? You seem to be taking new actions every few quarters now. What should we expect the average contribution margin to net out on the corporate average line, broadly, and how does it compare across segments like above, below, corporate average? I think that will help us reset some of our expectations. Thank you.","Heath Mitts","Well, thanks for the question, Deepa. Let\u2019s take a bigger view of this first, right? We\u2019ve seen demand tick down pretty considerably throughout the year on auto production. And Terrence said, it kind of settles in around 21 million vehicles a quarter, which is a run rate that\u2019s pretty significantly less than what we\u2019ve been around prior years. That avails us the opportunity to get after some things on the cost structure for transportation, maybe in jurisdictions that we can better align with new locations, lower cost locations, and so forth, closer to where our customer supply chain exists. So, that's a real opportunity for us on that front.","And then, Communications is the other area that we have, again, to do some restructuring in. As you\u2019ll recall, Transportation for the first half of our fiscal year was running quite strong. We've seen, based on all the comments made earlier in this call, as that's ticked down, it\u2019s pulled forward some things that we would have done maybe in future years anyway. And so, as we're starting to look at those types of actions, you'll start to see margin flow through. Our normal margin flow through is between 25% and 30%. I will tell you that when you see the types of numbers, specifically within Communications drop at that rate, it's going to take a little while to get back to those types of contribution margins I just mentioned, because you are still having to cover fixed costs and so forth.","Having said that, I don't want to get too hung up on percentages here, because being CS being our smallest segment, we could be talking about a few million dollars can swing a percentage more dramatically than really the total -- what the real material impact is to TE. So, I think we\u2019ve got to be careful with that.","Now, Industrial is -- and we've talked pretty openly about Industrial being on a multiyear journey to come out of this, to work its way towards the high teens. I would tell you that we're probably a little ahead of plan than what we went into the year with. We went into the year assuming that our Industrial margins would be roughly flat while we execute on some footprint moves that have been announced, and we're actively working through. But the team has done a really good job of getting some of those savings out a little bit faster than planned, in addition to just kind of normal belt tightening. And so, I feel good about that. In terms of that, I\u2019d say, Industrial is still got -- still has a couple of years left of things, of activity that's doing based on the timing of footprint. And so, we're continuing on that on that journey, in terms of that.","So, I mean, if you kind of back up from all of that, we're really using this opportunity in this part of the cycle to get out fixed costs. That's why we\u2019ve lowered the overall restructuring, and come out of this when market demand does improve, we\u2019ll have a linear structure. And obviously, it's harder to do this when time -- when we\u2019re in periods of higher growth. So, hopefully that answers your questions, but happy to take any follow-up.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fox from Cross Research. Your line is open. ","Steven Fox","I'd like to follow-up. I guess, the confusion I have in terms of all the charges you've taken, say over the even year -- last year or two, last five years, it is trying to discern tactical from strategic. You made a good case for why Industrial is strategic. But, in the case of some of these latest charges, how do we know that you're not sort of cutting into the bone a little bit too much as opposed to fat? And how do we see an end to sort of the charges, if demand stays sort of at these levels? Thanks.","Terrence Curtin","I think, Steven, first of all, I think it's a fair question. And we have -- as the business has evolved, we have continued the journey on the footprint side of things. As you mentioned, I think Industrial\u2019s pretty clear in terms of what we laid out here in the last 18 to 24 months and where we are in that journey. You've seen those in the numbers. Certainly, there's some tactical things that we will be doing within the CS business, but again, it\u2019s the smaller segment. And I don\u2019t want to get too hung up on a margin rate there in terms of what the target is. We\u2019ve performed very well in that segment. But a couple of million dollars of can swing you from mid teens to low teens or the other direction to high teens. So, I want to be careful in terms of that.","What we're doing on the Transportation side, it more mirrors what we're looking at from Industrial, which is taking advantage of this. These are locations that on a clean piece of paper we would probably not have in those jurisdictions anyway. So, this is more of a couple of year journey in terms of that process to get the operating footprint where it needs to be.","I\u2019m not worried about cutting into the bone, and I say that because the long-term business model of all the trends that we enjoy, whether it's on the auto side with hybrid and electric or the overall factory automation side, with an industrial, and everything that -- all the great stuff that\u2019s going on in medical or aerospace and defense, there's nothing that we\u2019re going into in terms of cutting that we don\u2019t have redundant capabilities or opportunities to move into existing locations. We're not having to go do a bunch of Greenfield to do this, and we\u2019re not taken a lot of cost out of higher growth areas through a cycle, like places in Asia and so forth were we do expect, for instance hybrid and electric to be a more prominent piece there. So, as I look at it, I\u2019m not worried about cutting into that. I view this as more of an opportunity to get some things done that will be harder to do, if we are in a higher growth environment because in those cases you are just trying to keep up with customer demand.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of William Stein from SunTrust. Your line is now open. ","William Stein","If we think about the below seasonal trends that we\u2019re seeing guided for in Q3 overall, I wonder if we could hear your take on the trends, if you were to allocate them to the direct business versus the channel. How much of the weakness in the channel -- how much of the direct business might have been much closer to seasonal, if we were to look at it carved up that way? Thank you.","Terrence Curtin","Let me talk directionally. So, couple of things. I highlighted our book to bill overall of the Company was 0.98, and our channel was 0.85. So, I do think channel has been a steeper impact and we\u2019ve talked about it. But you do sit there, and there has been slowness, auto production slowness has nothing to do with channel. So, I think when we talk about how we frame the reduction in guidance, two-thirds was driven by Transportation and the slower China and certainly seasonal I do think that\u2019s normal that china would have weakened in the quarter we\u2019re in. But the other one third is truly the channel; that 250 decline. So, it\u2019s different by markets. But I would say, channel correction happens due to them adjusting to end markets that are happening. And clearly, they\u2019re seeing some slowness. So, it is deeper in the channel. Certainly that\u2019s an impact we're going to have here, like I said, not only into quarter four but probably can go into early next year. But, certainly we\u2019ve seen a slowness in our direct customers as well but not to the extent as channel. ","Operator","[Operator instructions] Our next comes from the line of Matt Sheerin from Stifel. Your line is open.","Matt Sheerin","Yes. Thank you. I had another question on the Industrial Solutions segment, specifically, the strong growth that you're seeing in the military, aerospace, marine sector, which has been up double digits. What are the drivers there, Terrence? And what's the outlook? I know, we've heard some other suppliers that the defense and aerospace market continues to be strong. I know, there's also some distribution exposure there too. It doesn't sound like there's inventory issues there. And then, just on the margins, Heath, you did talk about the drivers of that really strong margin expansion year-over-year, but given -- and so I guess one question is, the mix of business, the stronger MIL-Arrow, is that a contributor to margins, or is it mostly the cost cutting actions that you talked about?","Terrence Curtin","So, let me take the first half, and I'll let Heath take second half. So, one of the things that we talked to you all about for a long time is how we position ourselves very well from our commercial aerospace, and certainly the content opportunity we have there. And we've laid that out for you both on defense [ph] and dual aisle, single aisles and also regional jet. And, while airframe production has been pretty steady and up a little bit, I think you're really seeing the benefit in the commercial aerospace side from this content momentum that we've had, very broadly across the industry. And it's really credit to our team. That's really long cycle.","In addition, this year, we're getting the kicker about defense spend. And I think similarly, while defense -- and I think it's pretty obvious when you look at defense companies, they are in a good cycle. But, it's also an area that we do have a nice position, our position between commercial aerospace and defense is pretty balanced. And we're getting the benefit on both sides. And defense is also driven by government spending, and we're benefiting from that. But that is also a content play, as well. When you think about communications, you think about power distribution and all, the next generation hardware that's going on defense, we benefit from that as well. And that's a content play. So, those two are very important.","To your point, Matt, part of that business does go through the channel that is not saying destocking. That is a market that's still staying good there. And, there's one of the things that's buffering in the Industrial segment, the slowness that we have due to the destocking in our Industrial Equipment business in the channel. ","So, I\u2019ll let Heath talk about the margin side of it.","Heath Mitts","Yes. Matt, I appreciate the question. So, on the margin side, when I think about Industrial and when we're internally going through our processes, there's not a tremendous amount of mix that plays into it. There's certainly some pieces that have, a little bit better flow through in terms of particular product lines and so forth with any individual business unit. But, I think it's pretty well balanced in terms of we make a little bit more money in certain areas, a little bit less in others. But, it's not a wide swing there.","In terms of, as you can imagine, obviously, I think part of your question was, the aerospace and defense. We're obviously -- when you're growing the type of organic numbers that we're seeing out of our aerospace and defense business, you expect nice flow through, and we are certainly seeing that. And the businesses is converting the revenue into profits nicely, as you would expect, and as they blow past some of their fixed cost base. ","But there's other areas as well that are showing some resiliency on the margins, particularly our energy business as they have initiated and nearly concluded some facility restructuring. So, there's a lot of different moving parts there. It\u2019s a balance between where the growth is as well as some of the footprint consolidations.","We had talked some earlier in the year about this being a year where they\u2019re not going to be as much. I would say, we are little ahead of ourselves, as I mentioned earlier in the call. And we will still see some periods from time to time a quarter or two where you will see a jump down a little bit as you have duplicative costs meaning you are moving out of one facility into another and you might have duplicative cost for a period of a quarter or so during any particular facility rationalization. So, that will happen from time to time. But, we're very pleased with the progress that the team is doing and what their current outlook is as they move forward.","Sujal Shah","Okay. Thank you, Matt.

Please go ahead.","Keith Kolstrom","Good morning, and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss TE Connectivity's second quarter 2013 results. With me today are Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Lynch; and Chief Financial Officer, Bob Hau.","During the course of this call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information, and we ask you to review the forward-looking cautionary statements included in today's press release. In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussion this morning, and we ask you to review the sections of our press release and the accompanying slide presentation that address the use of these items. The press release and related tables, along with the slide presentation, can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at te.com. [Operator Instructions]","Now let me turn the call over to Tom for some opening comments.","Thomas J. Lynch","Thanks, Keith, and good morning, everyone.","Please turn to Slide 3. I'm pleased with our overall performance in this quarter. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.76 was a record for the second quarter and $0.06 above the midpoint of our guidance. Sales of $3.27 billion were in line with expectations. Adjusted OI margin of 13.6% was up 60 basis points versus the prior year and up 120 basis points sequentially.","We generated $353 million of free cash flow and during the quarter returned $319 million of capital to shareholders through dividends of $88 million and share repurchases of $231 million, giving us a total share repurchase of about $409 million in the first half. The strong OI performance -- OI margin performance is another step towards delivering 15% margins at the $15 billion revenue level.","Our favorable earnings performance was due to higher revenue and strong margin results in our Transportation segment and continued productivity and momentum across the company. Orders were $3.4 billion in the quarter, up 4% versus the prior year and up 9% sequentially. Book-to-bill, excluding SubCom, was 1.06 and was above 1 in all 4 of our segments. This is a reference point, book-to-bill in our first quarter was 1.02.","The economy does continue to send mixed signals, but based on our order trends, we continue to expect a strong second half due to the normal seasonal pickup, improvements in the industrial and telecom markets and strong productivity performance.","For the full year, we expect adjusted earnings per share of $3.10 to $3.22 on sales of $13.075 billion to $13.375 billion. Earnings per share was up slightly from our guidance last quarter. The outlook in our Transportation segment has strengthened. It's more than offsetting foreign exchange headwinds and a reduced outlook in our networks business in the second half compared to the prior forecast.","Please turn to Slide 4. Total company sales of $3.27 billion were in line with our expectations, as I previously mentioned. On a geographic basis, sales in the Americas were up 5%, excluding SubCom, due to another quarter of strong U.S. automotive demand and the Deutsche acquisition. This more than offset continued softness in networks and industrial.","In Europe, sales were up 2%, again due to the Deutsche acquisition, which more than offset the weakness in those markets in our industrial networks markets. Our automotive sales in Europe were down about 1% versus the prior year on a decline in European auto production. Asia sales were down slightly in the quarter. Growth in China and Korea was more than offset by weakness in Japan. Strong performance in our Transportation segment and the addition of Deutsche more than offset weaker networks revenue and foreign exchange headwind.","Please turn to Slide 5, and I'll provide some highlights of our segment performance. We had another very strong quarter in our Transportation segment. Sales were up 9% and adjusted operating income was up 31% due to increased organic revenue, the addition of Deutsche and very strong operating performance. The strong performance was in spite of a slight decline in global vehicle production around the world.","On a regional basis, vehicle production remained strong in North America and it's picking up again in China. This offset weakness in Europe and Japan. Another important development was an increase in demand for industrial and commercial vehicles, primarily driven by demand for heavy trucks in the U.S. and China. The Deutsche acquisition is serving us very well in these markets. We expect continued strong results in the second half, with quarterly results similar to the Q2 levels.","Please turn to Slide 6. Results on our network segment were down 11% versus the prior year, down 8% excluding the SubCom business, which is very soft right now. This resulted in about a $30 million decline in operating income. Demand across our networks businesses continues to be slower than we anticipated. We are seeing additional project activity in our telecom and SubCom businesses and feel we are well positioned to capitalize on these when these projects come into force. We have reduced our second half outlook in this segment, but do expect to improve our adjusted operating margin to the high single digit range exiting the year.","Please turn to Slide 7. Revenue in the industrial segment was up 4%, in line with expectations, as the addition of Deutsche and continued strength in commercial aerospace and oil and gas markets offset weak demand in the industrial equipment and energy market. Organically, sales were down 7%, as expected. Adjusted operating margins were up 170 basis points sequentially, but below prior levels due to the decline in organic sales. Orders were up 10% sequentially, and we continue to expect sequential sales and margin improvement over the balance of the year.","Now please turn to Slide 8. Sales on our consumer segment were down 7% from the prior year, largely in line with our outlook. Weakness in the PC market, still our largest devices market and a slow but gradually improving appliance market more than offset our improving position in tablets and smartphones. We do continue to be very selective about the projects we are going after in the consumer markets. In addition, we are seeing some delays in customer programs, and as result, we have reduced our second half outlook in this segment. Despite the sales decline, we continue to improve profitability in this segment and expect adjusted operating margins to be around 10% as we exit the fiscal year.","Now I'll turn it over to Bob, who will cover the financials in more detail.","Robert W. Hau","Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. Let me discuss earnings, which start on Slide 9. Our GAAP operating income for the quarter was $359 million, which includes restructuring charges of $78 million and Deutsche acquisition-related charges of $6 million. We now expect a total of approximately $275 million of restructuring charges for the full year, an increase of about $50 million versus prior guidance. We are increasing our restructuring spending in 2013 and expect a substantial reduction on our level of restructuring actions next year.","Our adjusted operating income was $443 million, with an adjusted operating margin of 13.6%, up 60 basis points from Q2 last year. Our adjusted EPS was $0.76 and GAAP EPS were $0.66 for the quarter. GAAP EPS included $0.13 of restructuring and other charges and $0.01 of acquisition-related charges, partially offset by $0.03 of income-related tax items. The tax income was primarily associated with the expiration of statutes of limitations related to non-U.S. tax audit periods.","Turning to Slide 10. Our adjusted gross margin for the quarter was 32.2%. This is an 80-basis-point increase versus the prior year on relatively flat sales as a result of continued progress on our TEOA programs that's driving increased productivity and cost reductions. As you know, TEOA is our version of lean and is delivering results across the business.","Total OpEx spending was $609 million in the quarter, up slightly versus the prior year. Increased expenses related to the addition of Deutsche were mostly offset by cost reduction and productivity initiatives. The right side of the slide details items on the P&L below the operating line. Net interest expense was $30 million in the second quarter, and I expect approximately $32 million of expense per quarter for the remainder of the year. Adjusted other income, which relates to our tax-sharing agreement, was $8 million, in line with guidance. The adjusted effective tax rate was 23%, which was at the low end of our guidance of 23% to 24%. And for the remainder of the year, I expect other income of about $8 million per quarter and the tax rate to be 23% to 24%.","Turning to Slide 11, I'll discuss our balance sheet and free cash flow. Cash flow from continuing operations was $446 million, and our free cash flow in Q2 was $353 million. We continue to expect free cash flow to approximate net income going forward. Capital spending during the quarter was $125 million or about 4% of sales. This is consistent with our anticipated spending rate of approximately 4% to 5% of sales going forward. Receivable days outstanding were 61 days and inventory days on hand were 71 days. We work to reduce working capital levels following the Deutsche acquisition, and they are now in line with our expectations.","Now let me discuss sources and uses of cash outside of free cash flow shown on the right side of the slide. We began the quarter with $1 billion of cash and ended the quarter with about $1.1 billion. During the quarter, we returned a total of $319 million to shareholders, we paid dividends of $88 million and repurchased about 5.7 million shares for $231 million. The cash flow statement shows a lower dollar amount for share repurchases due to a timing of difference on actual payment of funds. Beginning in the June quarter, dividend paid increased by approximately 19% to an annualized rate of $1 per share. We continue to expect additional share repurchases of $150 million to $250 million per quarter for the remainder of fiscal 2013. Outstanding debt was $3 billion at the end of the quarter, and we expect similar levels for the remainder of the fiscal year 2013.","Now I'll turn it back to Tom.","Thomas J. Lynch","Thanks, Bob. Please turn to Slide 12. Orders were up 9% versus the first quarter, and our book to bill was 1.06, excluding Subsea. All segments had a positive book to bill, as I mentioned earlier. And in the Transportation, industrial and network segments, orders were all up about 10% sequentially or more. Although, as I mentioned, networks -- the increase in networks was lower than expected. Orders were down slightly in Consumer.","Please turn to Slide 13. Based on our order trends, we expect revenue in Q3 to be in the $3.325 billion to $3.425 billion range, and adjusted EPS in the $0.80 to $0.84 range. We expect adjusted EPS to be up approximately 4% versus the prior year due to improved productivity, cost reduction and our share repurchase program. Revenue is expected to be up sequentially, with growth in all segments. Versus the prior year, revenue will be down about 4% as weaker demand in networks and Consumer, coupled with the weaker euro and yen more than offsets growth in our Transportation segment.","Please turn to Slide 14. For the full year, we expect sales in the range of $13.075 billion to $13.375 billion, and adjusted EPS of $3.10 to $3.22. As I mentioned earlier, our adjusted EPS outlook is up slightly at the midpoint compared to what we guided last quarter, primarily due to our strong Q2 performance. This, coupled with continued strong performance in our Transportation business, is more than offsetting foreign exchange headwinds to about $0.05 per share in the second half and a reduced outlook in our networks and Consumer businesses. This full year outlook represents a strong improvement sequentially in the second half, as adjusted EPS versus the first half will be up in the range of 28% -- 20% to 28%. This is driven due to the sales increase of 4% to 9%, improved productivity and reduced share count.","Let me make a few comments about the range and put it in perspective. The midpoint scenario assumes revenue about flat with the prior year, with a modest economic pickup beginning in the second half and adjusted EPS growth of approximately 10% overall. The high end of the range would be a 1% sales increase, driven largely by a stronger recovery in the second half, particularly in our industrial and networks business. Adjusted EPS growth would then be about 13%. At the low end, revenue would be down about 2%, and we would expect to generate about 8% adjusted EPS growth for the year as a result of productivity improvements and the benefit of share repurchases.","In summary, we had a strong Q2 and expect to deliver a strong second half, with second half adjusted operating margins above 14%. And for the year, we expect to deliver adjusted EPS up 10% versus the prior year. Our key assumptions for the second half: Global auto production expected to be up slightly in the second half, and Industrial Transportation demand increasing, particularly in the heavy truck area, the trend we're already seeing. Networks and Industrial demand -- Industrial Equipment demand is improving versus the first half level, but it still does remain slightly below last year's second half.","SubCom revenue is expected to be up about 100 -- up to $100 million in Q3, that's an absolute level of $100 million in Q3 and return to about $125 million in Q4. In Q2, we ran $80 million, which is a low point in many years. And we expect continued margin improvement to our -- due to our lean programs and the acceleration of our cost improvement actions. And as I mentioned, we expect to deliver 14% plus operating margin in the second half.","For the full year, we expect free cash flow of about $1.3 billion. And as we pointed out last quarter, we expect to return in excess of $1 billion of capital to shareholders.","So with that, can we please open it up for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll go to Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ruplu Bhattacharya","This is Ruplu filling in for Wamsi today. Just wanted to start by asking you about the Transportation segment margins, very good performance. Just wondering, was that more seasonal, maybe because of commercial vehicle market picking up? And how do you see that progressing as we go forward in the second half of the year?","Thomas J. Lynch","Thanks, Ruplu, a couple of things. Not so much seasonal, but I would say the pickup in commercial vehicles, that which, as you recall, really was soft last year, especially in the second half, has nice leverage on the margins. And the Deutsche business that we brought in has very strong margins. They're very highly engineered products that operate in very difficult environments, and they do command nice margins. So that's the biggest thing, as well as just continued strong execution. And with the 3% organic growth in the light vehicle, bringing that flow through to the bottom line.","Ruplu Bhattacharya","Okay. And just looking at the book-to-bill numbers, I mean, they're again very strong. How have they trended so far in this quarter, in the third quarter?","Thomas J. Lynch","The trend is continuing to be about that level through the first 3 weeks of April. So continuing what we saw build through the second quarter so far.","Ruplu Bhattacharya","And the last one for me, Bob, I think you mentioned the $50 million more in restructuring. I was just wondering if you could give some more details on which segments that this is targeting and when do you expect to see the benefits from that?","Robert W. Hau","Yes, the -- as far as the targeted segment, consistent with what we've seen really in the first half of the year, networks in particular, but also industrial and commercial -- or excuse me, Consumer, a little bit less obviously in our Transportation segment. In terms of benefit, we had indicated about $85 million of run rate benefit in 2015 from the $225 million. That number is now closer to about $100 million given the increased activity in that this year.","Operator","And we'll go to Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just 2 questions for me. One, maybe just from a back to the Transportation side, the margin performance you guys had this quarter was at an all-time high, I believe. Maybe could you just talk about how sustainable that level is if revenues remain flattish? And then in addition, if you look at the European production data, it's been a lot more robust or declining at least less than what the registration numbers have suggested. So do you think that, that could end up in resulting in a more severe back half than what you guys are forecasting, assumptions being there might be an inventory build there? So just any thoughts on that would be helpful as well.","Thomas J. Lynch","Sure. Regarding the Transportation margin, the Industrial and Commercial vehicle, because of the Deutsche acquisition, is a bigger part of that business now. So we basically doubled the size of our industrial commercial business with that acquisition, and those margins are higher than the segment average. So that's giving us nice leverage, which we expected. And we've improved those margins. We're actually running them slightly ahead on the cost synergies that were the goals that we set out when we did that acquisition. So that's helping. Regarding the European registration, a significant part of the Northern European auto production is exported. So the strength in the U.S. and China, you're going to look at those OEMs and their revenues aren't going to track exactly to the European registration for that reason. And most of the decline -- the severe decline is in the South. So we think we've got this all reflected in our outlook. And our second half is really -- I think I touched on, we continue to expect the U.S. market to be solid. China, after a slowdown last year, is picking up, we saw that in the first 2 quarters. And we continue to expect Europe to be soft.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Got it. That's really helpful. And then if I just look at the fiscal year guidance, I want to just make sure I understand this, you're basically lowering your full year revenues by $275 million or so, which you had 90 days ago. But it looks like about $165 million of that is really FX driven. Should we be talking about what the rest of that $110 million downtick is driven by? And then if my math is right, versus the 90-day guide that you had, that $165 million is a $0.04, $0.05 EPS hit, which means had you not had FX, you actually could have raised the midpoint by $0.06 rather than $0.01, is that accurate?","Thomas J. Lynch","Yes, yes and yes. I think you got the numbers right quickly. And as far as of the rest of the revenue decline, it's mostly in networks. SubCom continues to be slow. We are seeing -- we're seeing the seasonal pickup but we're not seeing it as much as we expected, I would say, in any of our networks businesses. So second half will be better than first half. Orders picked up, as I mentioned, in the second quarter versus the first quarter, but not as robust as we had originally. I think when you dig inside things, both SubCom and telecom have a lot of project activity, which is encouraging. I'd be a little more concerned if the project activity was light. But we are seeing activity, so we think that bodes well although it's been hard to call the timing.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Shawn Harrison with Longbow Research.","Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC","Just quick clarifications and 2 actual questions. First off, on the $100 million of savings, is that a '15 run rate as you said, or is that '14?","Thomas J. Lynch","That's a 2015 run rate.","Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC","Okay, perfect. And then the 2 questions. Just on distribution, I guess, are you seeing acceleration in that business? And is it accelerating at the same rate as kind of the overall orders or a little bit better? And then second on the networks business, typically when you see project activity build, how long does it take before you actually see that turn into actual revenues?","Thomas J. Lynch","Yes, so on the distribution, we are seeing the book-to-bill is pretty consistent with our overall book-to-bill of 1.06 in the quarter, so we've seen that pickup pretty broad based across the world, which is encouraging, knock on wood. On the networks project business, it is hard to call. In SubCom, it's really hard to call because you can -- especially in the last 1.5 years, we've been selected for projects. We haven't -- it's not in our backlog, because until you actually sign up and signed the contract, but we've been selected, but in many cases, the projects haven't started yet. So they can take longer. I'd say, typically in the telecom business, the majority of these are accelerated builds. There are some -- there are -- the encouraging thing as well is there's some new fiber-to-the-home builds throughout the world. So I'd expect those to start showing up in revenue early next year.","Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC","Is it broadly geographic or is it Euro-centric or U.S.-centric?","Thomas J. Lynch","I'd say, in the U.S., it's kind of continuation of fiber is pretty well established, although it's not -- still not that deep in the network other than one of the carriers. So it's, I'd say, add-on business in the U.S. In Latin America, Middle East and Asia, it's new projects. And in Europe, it's continuation of all projects. But it's pretty sporadic in Europe. I would say Europe is still soft. There's a few carriers that are accelerating, but overall, it's soft.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs.","Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I was hoping maybe you could start just more broadly on inventory levels across the supply chain. I know you touched a little bit on automotive and distribution, but just maybe holistically, how do you feel about customer inventory levels?","Thomas J. Lynch","Generally, pretty good. Again, I think after what happened 3 or 4 years ago to everybody in the supply chain, everybody has been more cautious and gotten better at this. I know we feel like we have. Our connections with the customer, our planning processes, our double checking, triple checking is much more rigorous than it was before. So in general, and I've spent a lot of time in the last quarter on the road with our customers and our distribution partners, and that's one of the first questions we talk about. I would say it doesn't feel like there's any kind of inventory issues.","Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. As a follow-up question, can you help us understand or remind us, what it was that you guys did that enabled you to increase your design win activity in the mobile segment as some of the larger OEMs, and then what the new outlook is on timing for some of those new programs to ramp?","Thomas J. Lynch","I would say a couple of things. One, we're starting from a low base, to be frank, so winning a few more awards is better than we were. The big thing is we put new focus and new leadership in the business about 18 months ago that had a lot of experience in that space. And that's helped us on our speed-to-market. I felt -- I feel like we've always had good products, but we haven't always been great in the speed side of it, so that's improved. As I mentioned, we are being selective there, we're trying to really focus where we bring some technology to the customer and not focusing on the more commoditized side of the business.","Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Maybe just to follow up a little bit on that. I mean, how much of the full year change to your revenue were some of these new programs outside of the FX part? And then do you guys have good visibility on when some of these new programs could ramp?","Thomas J. Lynch","It's a couple of programs. It's really no more than that and one that we didn't do and one that pushed out. So there's no -- there's not really a substantial change, it's not like a dramatic change in the number of programs in our pipeline. It's really a couple.","Robert W. Hau","Mark, we do get a typical seasonal lift into the second half of the year, particularly around the consumer devices element of the Consumer segment, which we have baked into our guidance.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Matt Sheerin with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just a question on the full year guidance. Looking at your guidance for the June quarter and then full year on a revenue basis, it looks like September is going to be sort of flattish to up a little bit sequentially, which is seasonal. Yet to get to your full year EPS guidance, it looks like you're going to see fairly significant margin expansion with strong EPS growth on a sequential basis. So where is that coming from? Is that a mix issue, do you expect cost to come out through this cost-cutting program. Just trying to reconcile the difference there.","Thomas J. Lynch","Sure. No, I think it's really 4 main areas. You could call it mix, I'd say it's strength of our Transportation business, particularly in this commercial vehicle, which is one of our strongest margin businesses, so that's one. It is continued productivity. And Bob mentioned the program that we call TEOA, which is our version of lean, is really, really starting to deliver results for us. You'll see it in the P&L and in productivity, but it's on-time delivery, it's quality. So that, our productivity levels are up nicely from where they were even 1 year ago. There are the benefits of the early stages of the restructuring just starting to kick in. And as Bob mentioned, we're doing it faster, we're trying to get it behind us and doing it faster. And then the benefits of the strong cash flow that we're primarily using for -- in return of capital to shareholders and shows up in the lower share count.","Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And what's the assumption on share count for the June quarter with your guidance?","Robert W. Hau","We're planning roughly $150 million to $250 million per quarter on share repurchase. We did a little more than that in Q2. We closed out the quarter on an average fully diluted at, what, about 4.25 million shares, it will go down 2 million or 3 million per quarter for the balance of the year.","Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And just lastly, we've seen gold come down and copper has been down in terms of pricing, when do you expect to see that favorably impact your margins?","Thomas J. Lynch","We'll see a little bit of a tailwind in the second half. But as you know, we hedge quite a bit, so we won't get the full benefit if it stays down until -- you really won't start to see that until next year. But year-over-year, we've got a little benefit. It's not a lot.","Operator","We have a question for the line of Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank.","Kevin LaBuz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","This is Kevin LaBuz on behalf of Sherri. Taking a step back and looking at last year, you're expecting to see demand improve in the back half of the year and it turns out that didn't materialize. Just now fast forwarding to this year, wondering what gives you more confidence in seeing that growth come about or the improved demand in the back half of the year?","Thomas J. Lynch","Sure. Well, we usually get a little bit of a lift sequentially. So we feel pretty confident about that. I'd say the main thing is the order rates in Q1 and Q2. So we're 4% year-over-year, and as I mentioned, that's continuing and even a little bit better than that in the first 3 weeks of April. So that gives us a lot of confidence around Q3 and early to Q4. I think the question, it's really a kind of a Q4 question in a way. If this order rate continues where we are, things will be good. And to your point, the economy, I think, in general, kind of plateau-ed and softened a little bit in the summer last year and that's affected our fourth quarter. So we feel more confident at this point because of the way the order rates are running year-over-year and what our channel partners are saying, what our customers are saying. But we've got to see it continue this way through this quarter. The order rates continue strong through this quarter and into the early -- the very beginning of the fourth quarter.","Kevin LaBuz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","All right, that's helpful. And just looking at the distribution channel, have you seen any signs of restocking there?","Thomas J. Lynch","I don't know but -- maybe a little bit. I think it's really tracking demand, though. Frankly, because I think everybody is being careful about restocking in advance in light of the last 2 or 3 years where strong Q2, early Q3 momentum and then things petered out a bit. So I would say a little bit of restocking, but nothing else significant. It just feels like responding to customer and demand more than anything else.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Jim Suva with Citi.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Can you just take a step back and think about, as you run the business, kind of longer-term, help us understand kind of the organic true company in a normal environment sales growth opportunities for TE Connectivity? Maybe break it down into some of the major material components, such as content growth, what we -- you think over the long term will happen, unit growth maybe from automobiles. And then are ASP declines embedded in your content growth or then do we kind of deduct some type of ASP declines? And really how we should think about organically growing the company and maybe hopefully someday we get back to a more normalized environment.","Thomas J. Lynch","Great question. Yes we think about this all the time. It's -- thinking ways in the last 5 years, it's hard to call any kind of trend, but if you look over the long historical trend around our connector business, which is about 75% of our business, you -- that's in the 5% to 6% range over a long trend, that hasn't been that high over the last 5 years. So of that -- so I would say 5% to 6% is probably the long-term trend when we look at the continued growth of electronics. And that really is about probably 8% volume, unit volume growth on average -- or maybe, yes, 6% unit volume growth rather, 2% price erosion, 2% to 3% content growth, in those ranges, plus or minus 1%. And it really is kind of market by market as well. That's the way we would build it up. So -- but historically, the industry has grown in that 5% to 6% range.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Amitabh Passi with UBS.","James F. Hillier - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","This is Jim Hillier for Amitabh. In the Network Solutions business, if I look at this on a sequential basis, it looks like the operating margin showed a sequential drop with only a modest change in revenues quarter-over-quarter. Could you discuss the factors behind the margin softness and what's giving you the confidence that operating margins can improve to the high single-digit range exiting the year?","Thomas J. Lynch","Yes, the slight margin erosion -- well, the margin is really low. I mean -- and it's primarily due to overall compared to where we've run in prior years, the volume being way down. SubCom is essentially breakeven right now, a little bit above that. So we believe that's at the low end of the cycle. So the improvement from the rate we're at, picking up 200 to 300 basis point over the next 2 quarters is first and foremost volume driven, most of which I would say is seasonal related, a little bit of project related. And secondly, the actions that Bob described, the actions we've been doing to -- in light of it being down longer than we thought, taking additional costs out to sure up sort of the baseline margin level. So it's a combination of those 2 things.","James F. Hillier - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, got it. And then as a follow-up on Networking Solutions, if you could talk about your broader expectations for telecom and IT spending in the back half of the fiscal year, that would be helpful as well.","Thomas J. Lynch","For the back half -- well, for the back half of our year, which would -- is the -- ends in September 30, I think we feel more -- a little bit of a pickup on SubCom because of projects coming into force. So $80 million in the second quarter and getting back to the $100 million to $125 million kind of run rate at the end of the year. Telecom picking up, mostly seasonal, but a few projects ticking in. And then I'd say our enterprise and datacomm business flattish over the next 2 quarters. So it's really driven more by telecom and SubCom. So spending in those areas.","Operator","And our final question comes from the line of Mike Wood with Macquarie Capital.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Research","You'd previously talked about the National Broadband Network contribution to the network segment growth this year. Has that also gotten pushed out or can you give us an update there?","Thomas J. Lynch","NBN ramped up in the quarter. In fact I was down there about 1.5 months ago and they're going aggressively. So I would say we're kind of at the run rate we expect to be over the next few quarters. So the big nice jump up in Q1 and Q2, and it's probably going to continue to run at that level for a couple of quarters as really just deploying the resources to accelerate that. So yes, we're well positioned there, we're shipping product, it's materializing. It's been -- it's taking a little longer than I think the original plan, but not unusual with a project of this magnitude. But it's real and we're shipping. It's one of the largest projects we have done.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Research","Okay. And of the roughly, I think you said $2.2 billion is China sales you had last year. Can you talk about how much of that is related to automotive and what you saw there in the quarter and what you're outlook is? I think China luxury vehicles are pretty strong in the first quarter.","Thomas J. Lynch","Yes, we had a 20% growth in our China automotive business in the first quarter. We have a real strong position across every level of the market in China. And automotive is about 1\/3 of our total revenue that we do in China, and we're pretty well spread out across our other businesses in China as well. It's the biggest local business per se, meaning that the products are all consumed in China, there's really no export in that. About 2\/3 of our other business ends up in products that get exported.","Well thanks, everyone, appreciate your time today. Just kind of just to reiterate, we really do feel good about this quarter. I think the operating leverage of the company continues to get better. The cash flow continues to be strong. The integration of Deutsche has gone very well. We're really pleased with the people mostly and the products. And I think we're adding a lot to the value proposition that Deutsch already had. We are looking for a nice pickup in the second half of the year, the current order rates are right in line with that. And I think importantly, at those revenue levels, expect to generate around 14%. And as I mentioned, we're definitely on track to do between dividend and share repurchase about $1 billion of capital return to shareholders. So thank you very much, and talk to in a quarter or if not before.","Operator","That does conclude our conference for today.

At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Sujal Shah. Please go ahead.","Sujal Shah","Good morning and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss TE Connectivity's first quarter 2020 results. With me today are Chief Executive Officer, Terrence Curtin; and Chief Financial Officer, Heath Mitts.","During this call, we will be providing certain forwarding information and we ask you to review the forward-looking cautionary statements included in today's press release. In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussion this morning and we ask you to review the sections of our press release and the accompanying slide presentation that address the use of these items.","The press release and related tables along with the slide presentation can be found on the Investor Relations' portion of our website at te.com. Also within the industrial segment we have broken out sales for our medical business separately from industrial equipment.","On slide 17 and on our website you will see eight quarters of historical revenue for the medical business and industrial equipment for your reference. There is no change to our segment reporting or those numbers.","Due to the large number of participants on the Q&A portion of today's call, we're asking everyone to limit themselves to one question to make sure we can give everyone an opportunity to ask questions, during the allotted time. We are willing to take follow-up questions, but ask that you rejoin the queue if you have a second question.","Now, let me turn the call over to Terrence for opening comments.","Terrence Curtin","Thank you, Sujal and thank you everyone for joining us today to cover our first quarter results as well as our increased outlook for fiscal 2020.","As I normally do before we get into the slides, I do want to frame out some of the key points that Heath and I bring out during today's call. First is that things are playing out as we expected when we provided our original guidance to you 90 days ago.","Our expectations of markets in fiscal 2020 is essentially unchanged. Our order patterns are indicating stability and the distribution [indiscernible] as we talked about for few quarters is trending as we expect.","In addition to the things playing out I am also very pleased with our execution in the first quarter. And this is against the continued challenging market backdrop. We delivered revenue above the guidance midpoint and adjusted earnings per share above the high end of guidance driven by strong operational execution across our segments.","Based upon our strong first quarter we are raising our full-year guidance to reflect the out performance in the first quarter and we're maintaining a view of the second half that is consistent with our guidance that we gave you 90 days ago.","And then finally there are two things that we talked about with you and we're focused on within this market backdrop that we're operating in. First is we're going to continue to focus on content growth that will enable out performance versus the underlying end markets that we position TE around and we are continuing to benefit from these secular trends across our businesses. The second key thing is that we continue to improve our earnings powered by executing on cost actions and footprint consolidation plans which we will expect to generate higher margins and earnings from the first half to the second half of our fiscal year.","So with that as a quick summary let's get into the slides and let me as you turn to Slide 3 and I'll get into some of the highlights from the first quarter. Sales of $3.2 billion exceeded the midpoint of our guidance representing 5% year-on-year decline on both reported and organic basis driven by market weakness.","While the number of our markets are challenging, we continue to demonstrate content growth across our business and this can be whether it's an electric vehicle or autonomous features and transportation, next-generation aircraft and non-evasive medical procedures in our industrial segment we're cloud computing and communications.","By segment transportation was down 6% organically as we expected driven by production declines in both the auto markets as well as commercial transportation market. Industrial solutions saw growth 1% organically which was ahead of our guidance driven by continued strength and ADNM medical and energy.","And our communication segment declined 14% organically as we expected driven by continued inventories of stocking in the distribution channel which we've been talking about for a few quarters. As we've highlighted to you supply chain adjustments take a few quarters to play out and this is happening as we expected supported by our orders increasing sequentially and our book to bill ending the quarter at 102 and I'll cover that when I cover the order slide in a few minutes.","From an earnings perspective adjusted operating margins were approximately 16% as we expected. Adjusted earnings per share was $1.21 which exceeded the high end of our guidance driven by higher sales and execution of our cost initiatives"," On a 5% sales decline adjusted earnings per share declined at a similar rate demonstrating strong operating performance and the benefit of pulling levers to reduce costs in an uncertain market environment to preserve earnings resiliency.","From a cash flow perspective our free cash flow is very strong during the quarter at approximately $245 million and approximately we\u2019ve returned approximately 300 million back to our owners through dividends and share repurchases.","I want to be clear that our capital strategy continues to include capital deployment to build out our portfolio inorganically and capitalize on secular trends to drive future growth.","Now let me turn over and talk about our full-year guidance briefly and I'll come back toward the end of the call and get into more details about it. For the full year this does reflect the upside in our first quarter and a view of the second half that is consistent with our prior view. We now expect sales of $13.05 billion. The sales guidance assumes organic declines for the year 1% to 3%. On a year-on-year basis our sales guidance reflects a decline of approximately $400 million. Half of this is due to currency exchange rates and the other half is driven by the market weakness and distribution inventory stocking which we discussed with you last quarter.","We are raising the low end of our adjusted EPS guidance to get to a midpoint of $5.10. This midpoint continues to include $0.30 of year-over-year headwinds from currency and tax impacts which is the same as our guide from last quarter. While we can't influence the market environment I am pleased that we continue to execute on leverage which we can control to driver our cost reduction and footprint consolidation plans while continuing to invest in the long term growth and our content opportunities. As we discussed last quarter we expect to generate improvements in both margin and earnings per share as we move from the first half to the second half of this fiscal year.","So with that as a backdrop of our first quarter results let me get into order trends and I would ask you to turn to slide four. For the first quarter for book to build with 1.02 and this exceeded 1 for the first time since the second quarter of 2019 and reflects an improving supply chain as well as stability in certain end markets.","Organic orders were down 2% year-over-year but we did see orders grow sequentially signaling stabilization in some of the key markets. When I talk about orders I'm going to talk about them on a sequential basis as this help lays out the foundation for our quarter two guidance and how we're thinking about the shape of our year.","In transportation, orders decline slightly sequentially as we expected driven by North America and this was offset by growth in China. In Europe, in transportation orders were essentially flat on a sequential basis and as we think about the market we continue to expect global auto production to be stable at a run rate of approximately 21 million units per quarter through fiscal 2020.","Turning to industrial. Our orders grew sequential across all regions and the growth was driven by ADNM as well as medical. In the communication segment we saw strong sequential order growth in both appliances and data devices reinforcing our expectation of growth in the second half and as we talked about the distribution channel from an overall basis and certainly the channel impacts our CS segment the most as well as our industrial equipment business and industrial. Our orders did decline 10% year-over-year as we expected but more importantly we saw order growth grow double digits sequentially and it reinforce our view of the inventory normalization that we expect by the end of quarter two and we will drive sequential growth as we get to the second half of the year.","So with that being a summary of orders let's get into the segment performance and I'll start with transportation that begins on slide 5. Transportation sales were down 6% organically year-over-year as we expected. Our auto sales were down 3% organically driven by global auto production declines. Once again we continue to outperform auto production due to content growth driven by the increase in electric vehicles as well as autonomous features in vehicles.","In our commercial transportation business sales were down 16% organically driven by weakness in North America and Europe and this was partially offset by growth in China as a result of China six emissions adoption as well as content gained by us.","In centers our sales were down 11% organically and this was driven by the weakness in the commercial transportation and industrial end markets. In auto our center revenue was flat year-over-year despite production decline that reflects the ramps of the new designs winds that we've been talking about for a number of years. From a marketing perspective adjusted operating margins were 17.4% as expected down year-over-year on lower volumes.","So let's return to industrial solution segments and that starts on slide six. For the segment sales grew 1% organically year-over-year and this was above our expectations. Three of our businesses in the segment saw very strong growth which was partially offset by ongoing weakness in the industrial equipment market.","Our aerospace, defense and marine business delivered another very strong quarter of 9% organic growth driven by content growth and new programs in both commercial airspace as well as defense. As Sujal mentioned earlier we are now breaking out our medical business from our industrial equipment business to give you greater visibility to another area of growth within TE. Now just as a reminder in medical we serve both the interventional and surgical imaging markets and a key area of focus from an application perspective are areas around minimally invasive medical products.","What's great here is we are a partner of choices to premier OEMs and our technology enables customers to build the medical devices at safe lives as well as a reduced cost. What's really nice about what we built here is that our engineering capability as well as track record quality, medical expertise and broad technical offering really differentiate TE in this market.","From a performance perspective in the quarter the medical business grew 7% and it was driven by growth entirely by interventional applications and this trend is one that's going to continue to drive growth quite some time for us.","And our energy business had very nice quarter. It was up 12% organically and this growth was being driven by investments in renewable energies as well as infrastructure upgrades in certain parts of the world.","In the industrial equipment business, our sales were down 15% organically driven by both weak market conditions and factory automation applications as well as this unit is being impacted by distribution inventory destocking.","From an earnings perspective adjusted operating margins were down as we expected due to the cost from footprint optimization activity and as we talked to you before we continue to remain on track with our multi-year margin expansion plans for the segment.","So with that I'd like to turn to slide 7 and let me get into communication solutions. Data devices sales were down 15% organically and our clients business sales were also down double-digit organically and these were in line with our expectations. We saw demand driven weakness across all regions along with ongoing inventory to stocking in the distribution channel.","As a reminder the segment has the highest percentage of our business going through distribution. So they will always have a greater impact from channel dynamics than the other two segments. As I mentioned earlier what's really nice is we did see sequential growth and orders for both of these businesses which gives us confidence of growth as we move into the second half of our fiscal year.","Margins in the segment were 12.1% and they were impacted by the volume driven sales decline and we expect to return to mid-teens target margins in the second half as distribution channel normalizes to be more in line with market conditions.","With that I am going to turn it over to Heath to go through the financials in some more detail and I will come back and cover guidance a little bit.","Heath Mitts","Thank you Terrence and good morning everyone. Please turn to slide 8 where I will provide more details on the Q1 financials. Adjusted operating income was $502 million with an adjusted operating margin of 15.8%. GAAP operating income was $471 million and included $24 million of restructuring and other charges and $7 million of acquisition charges.","We continue to expect fiscal 2020 restructuring charges to be similar to fiscal \u201819. ","Adjusted EPS was $1.21 down 6% year-over-year as Terrence mentioned on a 5% sales declined adjusted EPS declined at a similar rate demonstrating our ability to execute on multiple levels to drive earnings performance.","GAAP EPS was $0.07 for the quarter but that included a tax related charge of $1.05 which was related to the impact of the Swiss tax reform that we had talked to you about last summer. This was a non-cash charge. We also had restructuring acquisition and other charges of $0.09. The adjusted effective tax rate in Q1 was 18.6% and for the full year we continue to expect an adjusted effective tax rate around 18 to 18.5 that's unchanged from our prior review from 90 days ago. Importantly we expect our cash tax rate to stay well below our reported ECR for the full year.","Now if you turn to slide 9, sales of 3.2 billion we're down 5% year-over-year on both the reported and organic basis. Currency exchange rates negatively impacted sales by 43 million versus the prior year.","Adjusted operating margins were 15.8 as expected as Terrence mentioned we expect margin expansion from the first half to the second half of the year as we see benefits of sales growth and the cost actions we've initiated over the past year.","I continue to be pleased with the progress we are making and driving improvements to our cost structure. The team is executing well but we still have work to do on our footprint optimization plan as discussed in the past this is a multi-year journey but I feel like we're on the track.","In the quarter cash from continuing operations was $411 million, up 25% year-on-year. Free cash flow is $243 million and we returned $297 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in the quarter.","Our balance sheet remains strong and we expect cash flow to remain strong which provides us the flexibility to utilize cash to support organic growth investments to drive long-term sustainable growth while also allowing us to return capital to shareholders and continue to pursue bolt-on acquisitions.","We are seeing the benefits of the levers in our business model to help mitigate the impacts on weaker sales on our margin and EPS performance and as you should expect we will continue to balance our structural cost actions with our long-term growth investments to ensure sustainability in our business model.","So with that I'll turn back to Terrence to cover guidance.","Terrence Curtin","Thanks Heath, let me get into our guidance and I'll get into the second quarter which is on slide 10. As I mentioned earlier our markets are playing out as we expected we laid out for you 90 days ago driven by the order patterns that we\u2019ve see in quarter one that I covered earlier we do expect second quarter revenue $3.1 billion to $3.3 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $1.22 to $1.28 per share"," At the midpoint this represents declines on reported sales of 6% overall and organic sales of 5% year-over-year and reflects the weakness in the end markets and the ongoing effects of destocking in the distribution channel.","We do expect grow sequentially from the first quarter of the second in both sales and adjusted earnings per share and that is a view that gives confidence about stabilization. By segments, we do expect transportation solutions to be down low single-digit organically and it's mainly going to be driven by the weakness in the commercial transportation market and with mid-single digit declines in global auto production.","Industrial solution is expected to be down low single digits organically with continued market weakness and industrial equipment being partially offset by growth in medical, defense and energy. And in communications we expect to be down low teens organically driven by continued inventory destocking and the distribution channel.","So please turn to slide 11 and let me get into the full-year guidance. As I covered earlier we expect full year sales of $13.05 billion at midpoint and this will represent year-over-year declines in reported sales of 3% and on an organic basis 2%.","We are continuing to expect year-over-year headwinds of approximately $0.30 from currency exchange and tax rates and note that most of the year-over-year tax that will occur in the second half.","Let me get into some more color on our segments that are included in our guidance. In transportation we expect for the year to be down low single digits organically. We expect our organic auto sales to be flat to down slightly for the full year and as I mentioned earlier we continue to expect a global auto production run rate of approximately 21 million vehicles per quarter resulting in mid-single digit global production declines for fiscal 2020 which is consistent with our prior year view.","We expect content growth to enable us to continue to outperform declining auto production. We also expect our commercial transportation business to outperform high single-digit market declines in that market due to content growth and share gains this year. In our industrial segment we expect to grow low single digits organically with growth in defense, medical and energy partially offset by declines and industrial equipment.","And finally in communications we do expect to be down mid single-digit organically with both data and devices appliances being impacted by the continued broad market weakness and inventory destocking in the distribution channel.","Once we work through the inventory adjustments in the first half we do expect to move back to positive year-on-year organic growth for the second half of the year in our communication segment.","So before I get into questions let me just recap the key points that we made today and I'm sure we'll talk more about in Q&A.","First we have built a strong portfolio with leadership positions in the markets we serve. This portfolio that we built is performing significantly better than the last time we went through a market downturn. This is evident in our quarter one results where we delivered sales and adjusted earnings per share ahead of guidance and our operating execution enabled us to raise our guidance for fiscal 2020.","The second key point is the things are playing out as we expected when we provided our guidance 90 days ago. Our expectations of markets in fiscal 2020 is essentially unchanged. ","Our order patterns are indicating stability and distribution destocking is trending as we expected given us confidence in the sales and earnings growth sequentially in the second half.","The third key point is around content and content growth is enabling out performance even in declining markets and it's helping to buffer the market conditions we're seeing.","We're going to continue to benefit from secular trends whether it's electric vehicles of autonomy, next generation aircraft, minimally invasive medical applications, factory automation or cloud computing and these trends are going to be with us for a long time.","And finally, we are executing on what we can control through our restructuring plans across all of our segments and we're focused on this to ensure we get greater leverage and earnings power when markets return to growth.","So with that I do want to thank our employees around the world for their continued strong execution as well as their continued commitment towards our customers and a future that is safe for sustainable productive and connected.","So Sujal with that let's get to Q&A.","Sujal Shah","Thank you Amy, could you please give instructions for the Q&A session?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Wamsi, your line is open.","Wamsi Mohan","Thank you. Terrence nice performance in a pretty tough end market here. So can you maybe talk a little bit, in a little bit more detail what your assumptions are for the year for the various end markets with some color on geographic performance as well. Thank you.","Terrence Curtin","Sure. Thanks Wamsi and yes during the call I used the word stable a lot. I also said challenging. So your question is very fair. There's markets that have been strong and are going to continue to be strong. There are medical, certainly defense, energy and you heard that a lot and they're in our industrial segment but when I use the word stable it really says some of the supply chain things are working off like we saw in distribution but there are still markets that are challenging. Auto production we expect to be down mid single-digit. I talked about that around the 21 million units a quarter end and we reposition ourselves on content will help get us down to closer to flat on the year versus a negative production environment.","The industrial transportation space certainly that space is one where North America heavy truck rolled over and we're being impacted by that. But we do expect that margin to be down high single digits for the year because of also how we're positioned in China.","You got your six emissions, you also have strong content name we have in that market and that's going to buffer to us a nice separation there. The other area that I would say that I think is going to be continued to be challenging is the factory automation and industrial equipment market.","That's a market that clearly been impacted by capital spending on the planet. Our business both has the underlying market, it's going to continue to be challenged. And but we also have some inventory to stocking.","So, how I would frame and similar to how we framed it 90 days ago was we don\u2019t see a [indiscernible], our market really gets a lot better this year. We see some of the supply chain effects working through March, basically the end of our second quarter and we're going to get our normal seasonality.","So, I would say the market we're planning with, I'm glad we have the content opportunities, we have the buffer some of it and we'll start seeing some growth in some of the markets later in the year once the channel effects get along.","From a geographic perspective, so hopefully that helps. From a geographic perspective, Wamsi, it was an interesting environment and I'm probably going to talk much more around sequentially. We saw China was a little bit better in coming out of our first quarter sequentially.","Europe was a little bit worse and North America was relatively sideways. So, it's other thing that are very much around how do we see things from a stability perspective, our book-to-bill was above 1.0 in all regions, we were 1.02 overall, which as I said on the call was the first time we were above 1.0.","It gives us a view that things are working through and getting a little bit more back to parity. So, it means we built some backlog which is good as we get into the second half of the year.","Sujal Shah","Okay. Thank you, Wamsi. We have the next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Christopher, your line is open.","Christopher Glynn","Thank you, good morning. Just wondering if you're seeing any interesting changes in the cadence around design cycles in electric vehicles China and then you come to mine versus the baseline expectations for the development of that market?","Terrence Curtin","Now, thanks for your question. And when you look at it, what's intriguing is we've always talked to you about electric vehicles and electric vehicle production, how are we go from about a little bit over 6 million units, sorry. It's over 9 million units.","And this year's going to be a really one that's driven by Europe. China we sort of view in hybrid and electric vehicles many of you know I include plugin hybrids and hybrids in that number. It's not a pure NEV number just that it's the broader thing.","And really what we're seeing is we're seeing a year where China will be sideways. They had some of the Stimulus\/Formal from a production where Europe is going to be the real growth driver. And you've seen it with the CO2 regulations. We aren\u2019t seeing any changes in designs.","We are still over the opinion if you take the two mega trends that we have in automotive or around electric vehicles as well as autonomy features. Our customers are prioritizing electric vehicles ahead of our autonomy. We're going to benefit from both of those trends which I think is a unique proposition that we have.","But the electric vehicle trend is helping drive the content that's what I talked about and we are not seeing any change in design cycles at all. If anything, they are trying to get their designs done at quicker rates than traditional combustion engines.","Sujal Shah","Okay, thank you Chris. We have the next question, please.","Operator","Yes. Your next question comes from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Craig, your line is open.","Craig Hettenbach","Yes, thank you. Terrence, can you provide an update just on the automotive sensor design pipeline and any particular sensor types from that you're seeing traction within automotive?","Terrence Curtin","And so, a couple of things, Craig thanks for the question. First of all when you look at our centered results, you see really 75% of our sensors business from a revenue is still sort of pointed that heavy vehicle as well as the industrial markets and some of our growth we sold this quarter looks very much similar to what we saw in our industrial equipment and commercial transportation and our core connector products.","But our auto sensor revenue was flat. So, it's certainly getting our performance versus the mid-single digit declines we're talking about. And the ramps are continuing to happen as we thought. Would be an impact by a slower environment. But the traction we talked to you about in the pipeline we've talked to you about continues to remain intact.","And right now it's really all about production is impacting, why we're not seeing more growth other than flat in that market.","Sujal Shah","Okay. Thank you, Craig. We have the next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Leiker with Baird. David, your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning. This is Erin Welcenbach on for David. So, a follow-up question on the sort of the EV and autonomy discussion. There's been some talk in the industry about architectural changes.","What are you seeing with respect to EV and autonomy trends and how did these architectural changes impact content growth for TE?","Terrence Curtin","Thanks, Erin. And I will build on the question I talked about earlier. So, 1) is we feel very good about our content growth opportunities. And our content growth opportunity, you have to realize all starts where power need to go in the car, where does signaling need to be in the car as well as when you do for autonomy data and data's belong that is really the latecomer.","But when you deal with power and you go to an electric vehicle architecture, you're dealing with different power rhythm at 12 volt or a 48 volt system that we filled with or changing to. So, it's what gives us confidence around is 4% to 6% and as I said for us bigger driver will be electrification.","We also will benefit from autonomy as the data network in the car continues to evolve and architecture in a car always evolves. Our OEM customers are the ones that control the architecture. It's important to how they differentiate and it's something that you own and they typically don't let a tier 1 control lab.","But when you look at as those three building blocks go and what we see we continue to encourage how that architecture gets evolved and where we're positioned globally. If you think about my discussion earlier about electric vehicles, the trends and then the number of units made into world are going to be more in Asia and in Europe.","And we are leading position in those markets and we're working with the largest OEMs on those. So, nothing has changed around how we think about architecture, where do we play. And what's really nice about here, we benefit from both and electric vehicle is more in the front of the brand our OEM customers while autonomy has slipped back a little bit.","And feel very good about the 4% to 6% we talked to you about.","Sujal Shah","Okay. Thank you, Erin. We have the next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Suva with Citi Investment. Jim, your line is open.","Jim Suva","Thank you, very much. Can you talk a little bit about the trends that happened in your sensor business maybe on a year-over-year perspective? It looks like they may have taken a little bit of a stepdown compared to September year-over-year.","And then, maybe the content on automobiles that you're seeing now, I believe you typically viewed long-term content growth of kind of 4% to 6% range, kind of where we're sitting at kind of for this quarter in the outlook. Thank you.","Terrence Curtin","Sure Jim, thanks Jim. First off, on the sensory question, I'll probably repeat what I said a little bit earlier. In the quarter for sensors, we did have our growth was reflective about the 75% we have in industrial equipment and commercial vehicle.","What we saw on those markets are very similar than what we saw on our connector businesses which really drove the revenue being down double digit. In auto, we were flat and that shows the content and the ramps that we're getting.","And then secondly Jim, the separation around the content growth we saw in the quarter and as we're guiding for the year is pretty much right on top of the 4% to 6% and it's as these continue to get adopted and the other trends I could add to the vehicles, you're going to see we expect that automotive will be basically flat to slightly down in a minus single digit production environment and that's where our guide is.","Sujal Shah","Okay. Thank you, Jim. We have the next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Shawn Harrison with Longbow Research. Shawn, your line is open.","Shawn Harrison","Hi, good morning everyone and my congrats on the solid execution this quarter. I believe you already gave an idea of kind of the range of where you expect communications margins to kind of exit the year on a run rate. I was hoping we could get an update on where you would expect transportation and industrial margins to exit the fiscal year?","Heath Mitts","Shawn, this is Heath and I appreciate the question. As you mentioned, the CS margins we feel good about our ability to move into the mid-teens in terms of where we see those margins and that's reflective of a lot of the hard work the team is doing to mitigate pretty significant topline pressures in that business.","Within industrial, we'll see moderate nominal however you want to say it, margin expansion year-over-year -- that\u2019s a multiyear journey as we've talked about within the industrial business. On the footprint consolidation side, there are in this particular quarter we just finished.","Sometimes we do run into situations where we have to spin some money in advance or facility is coming offline to get those transitioned correctly and did not disrupt our customers. So, in a given quarter you can see some movement within those types of activities.","But we still expect industrial to see a nominal margin expansion for the year. I think if we look over a multiyear horizon as well as our trajectory into the next couple of years you'll continue to see that we're on plan.","Within transportation, we're dealing with a couple of different pieces on the topline pressures that Terrence mentioned earlier particularly on the commercial transportation side which is a very profitable business for us. That being down, certainly has a pinch point for us.","And then, but that offset was some of the activities within automotive and some of the footprint moves there. Now these moves as we talked about and prior quarters take a while particularly the ones outside the U.S. to get off line and so you will see more of those savings later in this year and more into FY'21 and '22.","But I would expect the transportation to be able to hold roughly where it is, maybe a little bit of expansion as we exit the year.","Sujal Shah","Okay. Thank you, Shawn. We have the next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Deepa Raghavan with Wells Fargo Securities. Deepa, your line is open.","Deepa Raghavan","Hey, good morning all.","Sujal Shah","Hi, Deepa.","Deepa Raghavan","Question is on automotive momentum especially in China. Can you help talk about some of maybe give us some examples or just gently just talk through the momentum there? Is there any fundamental recovery beyond just easy comps in that part of the region?","And also, how should we think about the plant closures in China just putting a wrench on your outlook if at all just given this corona virus scare. Thanks, very much.","Terrence Curtin","Now, a couple of things, so let me take the second part of your question first. Certainly on the corona virus. It's a very fluid situation, yes China is important and we're very much focused on dealing with the real time and making sure our employees are safe.","And that being said, first thing I want to highlight is that we don\u2019t have operations or factories in the Wuhan province or our operations are not in that area. And we are in the middle of the Lunar New Year celebration and that we are running lower shifts right now as we speak.","And we're going to continue to run those lower shifts. But the government has extended the Lunar New Year few days and in some of the industrial parts we serve, they are actually shutting in the next week. And we're going to be to everything in compliance with the government.","So, net-net it is an uncertainty that we have but we have those uncertainties in many parts of our business every day. On China momentum, we did see production improve in the first quarter. And like I said in some of my comments already, China was a little bit better, I would say that would say that was around automotive production.","Europe was a little worse, net-net getting to a neutral point for the year. I think the one thing that we're trying to keep our eyes on is not only what is production but what our end sales in China and end sales while they or not declining as they work, still or not accelerating.","So, we still have a view that China will play out as we talked before. But we did see increased momentum before the Lunar New Year celebration which would have got us down to a supply chain was getting better. But we got to continue to watch it and our guidance is sort of in change with where we were 90 days ago.","Sujal Shah","Okay. Thank you, Deepa. Can we have the next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Mark, your line is open.","Mark Delaney","Yes, good morning and thanks for taking the question. I was hoping the company could quantify where inventory in the channel is relative to historical levels on either at hours or days basis. And when you talk about the restock in distribution or sorry let me rephrase that one.","When we talk about better trend into the distribution channel in the second half of the year, or are you assuming restock or just that your shipment to catch up to what the distribution on a sell through basis. Thanks.","Terrence Curtin","Now, thanks. So, first of all we assume there is not restock, we assume it's a parity with demand. So, that's the key point and a very good question. When we sit there and what we've looked at, our major channel partners will get book-to-bills above 1.0 again. We talked to them about where it is inventory burn through in their December quarter to get back more in parity.","And as we told you at last quarter we thought the first half impact was around a $100 million, we were about halfway through that also the destocking was going to be across in that work. So, what's nice is we're seeing it work out as we thought in the first quarter, it needs to work through in the second quarter.","The trend is right on track and we're actually starting to see a pick-up in booking sequentially as I said by 10%. So, it feels like things are moving as expected and the second half if all about getting to parity with demand, not restocking.","Sujal Shah","Okay. Thank you, Mark. We have the next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen. Joe, your line is open.","Joe Giordano","Hey guys, good morning.","Terrence Curtin","Hi, Joe.","Joe Giordano","Just curious, given you\u2019re like broad breadth in auto and who you work with and who you compete against. If you had any, what is the BorgWarner Delphi transaction do or not do to the competitive environment in that space?","Terrence Curtin","For us it doesn't really does nothing for us. When you look at those two mergers, you're really dealing with more people dealing with the mechanical side of things. And our customers certainly in some areas there are customers but they would not be major customers.","So, for us that's a net-net nothing.","Sujal Shah","Okay. Thank you, Joe. We have the next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Kelly with Jeffries. David, your line is open.","David Kelly","Good morning, thanks for taking my question. You referenced continued strength in defense. Just wondering if you've seen any incremental softness in aerospace and any impact from the Boeing grounding that we should be think about per modeling?","Terrence Curtin","Yes. So, a couple of things and thanks for the question. Certainly, we do have commercial aerospace business and when we talk about aerospace and defense submarine, that business in our industrial segment, about half of its commercial aerospace and it covers all the commercial aero frame manufacturers, including Boeing.","So, the Boeing situation has impact us on that aero frame specifically. It's probably about a half a point headwind to overall TE growth that we're absorbing with the diversity of our portfolio but certainly that market has got weaker due to the production schedule Boeing has laid out.","The key I think for us is that's a nice content driver. That it sort of transitory and in my mind and it will impact us this year but when Boeing works through its issues and those planes start get delivered, we'll get a reacceleration on the other side.","So, near-term headwind that we would absorb into our guidance probably become a tailwind once they work through the issue with they would be.","Sujal Shah","Okay. Thank you, David. Go ahead with the next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JP Morgan. Samik, your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi good morning, thanks for taking my question. This is Bharat on for Samik. So, my question is in the communication segment. The expectations heading into 2020 remain for a pickup in hyper scale spending and higher service provider CapEx towards 5G as well.","So, can you walk us through expectations for spending from these two verticals, how is that tracking and can there be an upside in outlook for 2020 in the segment overall if the spending ramps through the year. Thank you.","Terrence Curtin","Well for 2020, thank you for the question. We certainly have seen or that segment has been impacted by the distribution channel. I would say cloud spending we have seen an improvement on our orders on the cloud side and certainly that's across many of the cloud providers.","And one of the things our team has done a nice job is continue to penetrate and broaden our cloud customer breadth. So, that is an important growth drive for that segment and we continue to improve our positioning there.","5G is a little bit of a different story. 5G is one where in places like Korea you have very dense networks that and laid out and you get more then the use cases that they're developing. In the U.S. 5G is not moving as quick mainly due to the merger between T-Mobile that's out there have sort of delayed how this 5G get invested.","And so, I would say we've seen a pause in 5G investment here in the United States that we hope that once that merger's down, the operators will invest and then we'll benefit from those deployments. We do play in 5G though on the infrastructure side, we don\u2019t play on the handset side but it is something that's a good content opportunity as that spending accelerates.","Sujal Shah","Okay. Thank you, Bharat. Can we have the next question, please?","Operator","Yes. Your next question comes from the line of William Stein with SunTrust. William, your line is open.","William Stein","Great. Thanks for taking my question. An earlier question addressed automotive networks and one of the things that seemed more prominent this year at CES was the emerging changes in network architecture and cars specifically ECU consolidation and automotive networks transitioning to more sort of hierarchical one with domain controllers. Can you comment on how this might affect revenue and margins and maybe mix of cabling versus connectors? Thank you.","Terrence Curtin","No, certainly. So first of all it's important that when you say cabling and connectors. We are not a harness maker and so as harnesses get rationalized certainly there are people that are on the large side are going to get more impact than us because as you even get into more consolidated ECU zonal architectures the interconnects get absolutely more complicated which play to the strengths of which we have.","So these architectures have continued to evolve whether you go to zonal or you go to centralized compute in a car. These are things that how do you continue to get the connection points, the sensing points around or things that are part of our 4% to 6%. This will continue to evolve our OEM customers will be the ones that make those architectural decisions of what you see at CES and what's really nice is how we engage with our OEM customers on our design we know as those architectural changes are occurring. So when we think about the 4% to 6% that does assume how the architecture will evolve and what's really nice is I remember when we talk about architecture and people just want to talk about [indiscernible] it's really nice that the content trend whether it be electric vehicle or autonomy and compute architecture in the car or things that people are really talking about and that's what we do and that's what's driving some of the growth trends for TE.","Sujal Shah","Okay. Thank you. We will have the next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Sheerin with Stifel. Matt, your line is open.","Matt Sheerin","Yes, thanks and good morning regarding your positive commentary Terrence on the medical market in the nice growth there how much of that is adoption of newer technologies and an upgrade cycle if you will versus share gains and I know or assume most of these products came from the Creganna acquisition from 2016. So any commentary on how that acquisition has been going for you. Thanks.","Terrence Curtin","I think when you look at the growth it's a combination of things that we required but also how we continue to bring the capabilities at TE and Creganna has. If you look at that that business that business is approaching $800 million and Creganna was a little bit over $300 million when we bought it and we continue to put the capabilities of TE and Creganna together and we've also have the design center set up where the innovation occurs around interventional devices.","What is nice is it is a mix, Matt to your question and also what's nice is it's not just the therapies that were used to today that we all benefit from but it's also about the therapies of the future of other areas in the heart where they want to take interventional procedures where they still can't take them today and that's the innovation that we continue to work on with the largest customers in the world that are focused on this. So it is a combination of new programs, existing programs and what's nice is with what we built we really have the door open with our customers and bringing our engineers and to work on the next-generation therapies that the largest companies medical device companies in the world are working on. So it's really nice it's going to drive the high single digit growth that we talked about today and it's been driving.","Sujal Shah","Okay. Thank you Matt. Can we have the next question please?","Operator","Gentlemen your final question comes from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Joseph your line is open.","Joseph Spak","Hi, thanks for taking the question. Terrence just a bigger picture yesterday we heard a company talk about how as automakers move to new and electric platforms, the connector catalog so to speak is opening up for them because they require these new types of interconnect products and I think you've hinted that the motor could widen as you move towards electrification these new platforms. So just really want to better understand how you think that business evolves as platform shift and maybe an example or two of what you're doing to retain and enhance your competitive positioning with customers.","Terrence Curtin","Well, I think one thing that's important when you deal with electric vehicles and the penetration we have is one of the things around electric vehicles. We have to be honest you're still at even if we get to the 9 million units we have this year it's still a small part of an 84 million market and one of the things both from the relationships that we have you also have to get the global scale to continue to bring the cost points of the electric vehicles down and we knew we were part of that equation.","So how do you get to standardization and while certainly different people are driving different technologies over time we still have to get to a vehicle that people can afford but that subsidies won't turn. And when I think about what we have done historically through our global customer range as well the breadth of technology we bring I think we are one of the ones that are best positioned to capitalize on that and also making sure we scale it and that's one of the things that OEM customers and certainly other people still have some challenges how do they scale electric vehicle and we basically view we get to help them do that.","So that's the breadth we have. You see it in some of the global OEMs that are calling more platform versus individual model and they are some of the customers that we have very good relationships with and design wings with that we are going to help them solve that problem. And then we can also take it like we do with the rest of our connector portfolio into other areas to make sure that we bring productivity to the electric vehicle as well and getting our margin.","Sujal Shah","Okay.

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. I will turn the conference now to Mr. Sujal Shah, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Sujal Shah","Good morning and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss TE Connectivity\u2019s second quarter results. With me today are Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Lynch and Chief Financial Officer, Bob Hau.","During the course of this call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information. We ask you to review the forward-looking cautionary statements included in today\u2019s press release. In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussion this morning. We ask you to review the sections of our press release and the accompanying slide presentation that address the use of these items. The press release and related tables, along with the slide presentation, can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at te.com.","To effectively set a baseline for today\u2019s call, please keep in mind that we announced the sale of our broadband networks business last quarter and continue to expect the transaction to close by the end of the calendar year. BNS is reflected as discontinued operations and is not included in our Q2 results or guidance going forward. Note that all prepared remarks on today\u2019s call will reflect TE continuing operations unless otherwise noted.","We have provided additional slides number 13 through 17 in our earnings presentation to help reconcile the difference between previously reported results and guidance against assumptions for continuing operations. You will find this information to be helpful as we go through the call today.","Finally, for participants on the Q&A portion of today\u2019s call, I would like to remind everyone to limit themselves to one follow-up question to make sure we are able to cover all questions during the allotted time.","Now, let me turn the call over to Tom for opening remarks.","Tom Lynch","Thanks and good morning everyone. Here are the key takeaways from today\u2019s call. In Q2, we continued to deliver strong results with organic revenue growth of 6%, adjusted earnings per share of $0.02 above implied guidance for continued operations and adjusted operating margins of 16.4%.","For the full year, our prior adjusted EPS guidance of $4.20 assumes $0.53 from BNS and $3.67 from continuing operations. We are holding our guidance at the $3.67 level as continued strong performance of our harsh businesses coupled with SubCom improvement is offsetting additional FX headwind. Our EPS guidance reflects 11%, adjusted EPS growth year-over-year. And as Sujal mentioned, there is a detailed reconciliation of guidance found on Page 16 of our earnings presentation.","I would also like \u2013 few other points we are very well-positioned and continue to benefit from the secular trend of electronic content growth, with 80% of our revenue derived from products serving harsh environment application. This is a theme you heard before and you will continue to hear throughout today\u2019s call. And it\u2019s a very important part of our strategy.","Our recovering SubCom business continues to gain momentum, with over $1 billion of contracts now enforced and over $700 million of revenue expected this year. Our sensor business continues to build momentum as well with the growing design win pipeline across several market verticals. And overall, the integration of the acquisition is going well.","And then just a comment on market conditions, I would say they continue to be mixed compared to 90 days ago when we last spoke, Europe up a little bit, of course off a low base, China has slowed a little bit and the end markets in the U.S. are mixed although growth is continuing. I would say overall similar trends this last quarter.","I would now like to provide some additional color on the performance of our business. As I mentioned, Q2 was another good quarter for the company operationally and we made four important moves to strengthen the company strategically during the quarter. We announced the sale of our broadband networks business for $3 billion in January and continue to expect the transaction to close by the end of this calendar year. As a result of this transaction, 90% of our revenue is now focused on the attractive and growing connectivity and sensor markets. These markets have solid underlying growth trends due to the increasing demand for more electronics as the world becomes safer, greener and more connected. And with our unmatched portfolio of connectivity and sensors, TE is well-positioned in providing the key building blocks for the connected world.","As I mentioned, 80% of our revenue is focused on providing solutions for harsh environment applications that demand the highest quality and reliability performance, which has long been our strong suit. This capability is not easily replicated and we believe that TE\u2019s ability to provide solutions for harsh environment will remain a strong differentiator and growth driver as we move forward.","In February, we announced the purchase of AdvancedCath, a company focused on applications serving the medical and healthcare markets. The combination of AdvancedCath and our broad range of sensor and connectivity technologies puts us in a very good position to capitalize on opportunities in the high growth, high margin interventional applications in this market. This acquisition is accretive to our industrial segment growth rate and operating margins. This is a good example of where having a broad range of connectivity in sensors, with fine wire capability, molding and stamping, manufacturing capability enables us to provide a broader set of solutions for our customers.","In March, along with the planned divestiture of BNS, we organized into three segments: Transportation, Industrial and Communications. The Transportation and Industrial segments remain exactly the same in terms of business composition and Communications is now made up of appliances, SubCom and Data and Devices. Data and Devices reflects the combination of consumer devices and DataComm into a single business. The combination improves our ability to win in these dynamic markets. These markets are converging and combining the unique strengths of each business will strengthen our competitive position and profitability and potential for growth in these markets.","In March, we also announced the appointment of Terrence Curtin to the newly created position of company President. Terrence has been an important leader in our transformation and CFO and most recently President of our Industrial Solutions segment. In his expanded role as President of TE, Terrence will focus on accelerating our performance across our harsh connectivity and sensor businesses by driving growth in TEOA across the business.","Please turn to Slide 3 for summary of Q2 results and our guidance. As I mentioned, we delivered strong results for Q2 with adjusted EPS of $0.91, $0.02 above the midpoint of guidance and sales of $3.1 billion, growing 4% year-over-year and up 6% organically. Currency translation rates impacted Q2 by $246 million in revenue and $0.09 in EPS year-over-year. That\u2019s negatively impacted Q2. The continued strong performance of our harsh environment business is coupled with improvements in SubCom more than offset the FX headwind compared to the prior year. Excluding the impact of currency exchange rates, adjusted EPS would have improved by 16%.","During the quarter, we returned $261 million to shareholders. Total company orders were $3 billion flat year-over-year, excluding SubCom orders, were up 1%. Book-to-bill excluding SubCom was 1.03%. As I mentioned earlier, I am pleased with the momentum in our sensor business. We expect strong growth this year and are adding resources to support the significant increase in customer RFPs. We see an increasing number of opportunities to integrate sensors with our other products and provide our customers with innovative, highly reliable and cost effective solutions. We intend to aggressively build this business with inorganic and organic investment and we believe our unmatched customer facing and engineering resources are significant assets for TE. Our TEOA program continues to enhance margin and drive higher profitability. Adjusted gross margins were up 70 basis points year-over-year and adjusted operating margins expanded to 16.4%, up 50 basis points versus the prior year.","Please turn to Slide 4. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to hold our full year guidance despite increasing FX headwinds. Our full year EPS outlook is unchanged from our prior guidance for continuing operations, with harsh environment business strength, contribution from strategic acquisitions and a leading position in the recovering SubCom market offsetting additional FX headwinds versus our previous yield. For the full year, we are projecting sales of $12.5 billion, up 4% from the prior year and 6% organically. We expect adjusted operating margins to exceed 16%, with adjusted EPS in the range of $3.60 to $3.74, up 11% at the midpoint.","With the cumulative move of the dollar versus world currencies during the last six months or so, 2015 FX headwinds are now approximately $1 billion in revenue and $0.38 in EPS versus last year for our full year, where now for the impact of FX, we would be generating 13% revenue growth and 22% adjusted EPS growth year-over-year, a strong financial performance by any measure.","Now, I will turn it over to Bob to cover segment results and then I will wrap it up in a little while.","Bob Hau","Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 5 for Transportation Solutions. Our revenue grew 3% organically in the quarter in line with our expectations. Our automotive business grew 4% organically, while global vehicle production was up about 1%. We continue to outgrow auto production volumes due to content growth trends and share gains. Our Commercial Transportation business declined slightly in Q2 as expected driven by slowing growth in the heavy truck market and continued weakness in the off-road equipment market.","In sensors, we continue to gain momentum with an expanding design win funnel across transportation in other market verticals. We continue to expect strong growth in sensors due to our unique combination of technology, resources and broad, deep customer engagements. Our total transportation adjusted operating income was $333 million in Q2, down 1% year-over-year as expected, the strong operational performance offset by FX. We continue to invest in sensors and support a growing pipeline of opportunities.","In automotive and commercial transportation, adjusted operating margin expanded 60 basis points year-over-year in Q2 driven by additional volume and operational execution. Looking forward, we expect another good quarter in Q3, with actual sales growth in the low single-digits and organic growth in the mid single-digits.","Please turn to Slide 6. Our Industrial Solutions segment performed well in Q2, growing 5% organically, representing the seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth for this segment. Industrial equipment was up 6% organically, with strong growth in all regions. In our Aerospace, Defense, Oil and Gas business, 6% organic growth was driven by continued strength in commercial aerospace, which more than offset declines in oil and gas. Going forward, we would expect continued strength in commercial aerospace to offset weakness in our oil and gas business.","In our energy business, we saw 4% organic growth, with growth in Asia and North America partially offset by declines in Europe. We also completed the acquisition of AdvancedCath, increasing our opportunities in the high growth medical interventional market. AdvancedCath is now part of our industrial equipment business. Adjusted operating income was $112 million in Q2, up 5% year-over-year, with the 50 basis points expansion in adjusted operating margins due to organic growth and TEOA initiatives. For Q3, we expect low single-digit organic growth with similar market trends as in Q2.","Please turn to Slide 7. A newly created Communications Solutions segment grew 16% year-over-year on an organic basis driven by our strong position in the recovering SubCom market and a continued strong performance in our market leading appliances business. This more than offset the planned declines in our data and devices business, where we continue our strategy of exiting low margin products in this business.","Adjusted operating income was $61 million, up 126% year-over-year and operating margin doubled to 9% from 4.5% a year ago. We expect to continue to drive further operating margin improvement in this segment. And heading into Q3, we expect the actual revenue to grow mid-teens and high-teens in an organic basis driven by a new SubCom program coming into force. The new AE Connect program, which is scheduled to be ready for service in December 2015 is the latest Transatlantic subsea fiber optic cable system connecting North America to Europe.","Please turn to Slide 8, where I will provide more details on earnings. Adjusted operating income was $506 million, up 7% versus the prior year despite the significant FX headwinds. The growth versus the prior year is driven by our TE operating advantage efforts to improve safety, quality, cost and delivery as well as volume leverage. GAAP operating income was $448 million and included $36 million of restructuring and other charges, most of which were in the data and devices and oil and gas units and $22 million of restructuring related charges in the quarter as expected.","Adjusted EPS was $0.91 for the quarter, $0.02 above the implied midpoint of guidance, driven by strong productivity, mix and cost management. GAAP EPS was $0.77 for the quarter and GAAP EPS included acquisition-related charges of $0.04 and restructuring and other charges of $0.11. For the full year 2015, I expect approximately $75 million of restructuring and other charges, reflecting an $0.18 at midpoint, up slightly versus our prior guidance. We expect roughly $0.22 of charges associated with our recent acquisitions, which will more than offset by reserve reversals from tax liabilities.","Turning to Slide 9, our adjusted gross income for the quarter was 34.3%. This is an expansion of 70 basis points versus the prior year driven primarily by a growth in harsh environment businesses in SubCom and productivity gains from our TEOA initiatives. Adjusted operating margins expanded 50 basis points driven by productivity and volume leverage. Total operating expenses were $551 million in the quarter, with increases from acquisitions and R&D to support growth in transportation.","Cash from continuing operations was $350 million and our free cash flow in Q2 was $217 million. Free cash flow was impacted by the timing of payments and SubCom project activity. Gross capital expenditures were essentially flat year-over-year and net capital expenditures were up $9 million year-over-year. I expect capital spending rate to be approximately 5% of sales in 2015. And you will notice we have added a balance sheet and free cash flow summary in the appendix for additional details.","And now, I will turn it back to Tom.","Tom Lynch","Thanks Bob. Please turn to Slide 10 and I will cover our outlook and then go through the outlook in more details in the following slides. We expect to deliver another solid quarter in Q3, with revenue of $3.13 billion to $3.23 billion, up 3% on an actual basis and 7% organically year-over-year at midpoint. We expect adjusted EPS of $0.85 to $0.89, an increase of flat to 5% year-over-year.","As Bob and I have been mentioning throughout this call, our Q3 outlook does include a significant headwind from currency exchange rates, which are negatively affecting our guidance by approximately $330 million in revenue and $0.13 per share in EPS versus the prior year and just on a constant currency basis would be up about 18% in EPS year-over-year. Our third quarter performance will continue to be driven by the strong performance of our harsh environment businesses and building momentum in SubCom and contributions from our recent acquisitions in sensors and industrial. This is more than offsetting the FX headwind.","Please turn to Slide 11. For the full year, we now expect revenue of $12.3 billion to $12.7 billion, up 4% versus the prior year and reflecting 6% organic growth. Our adjusted EPS guidance range is $3.60 to $3.74, representing year-over-year growth of 11% at midpoint. Note that the total impact of currency exchange rates is now approximately $1 billion versus the prior year and $0.38 in EPS. We have a number of catalysts for growth: strong secular trend of increasing electronic content, especially in harsh applications; our expansion into the high growth sensor market; and the growing SubCom business. To provide a baseline for the performance of our business, adjusted EPS would be growing by 22% year-over-year would not for the negative impact of the stronger dollar relative to other currencies.","Now a few final comments before we open it up for Q&A. The company is performing well in a relatively still slow growth world and we are extremely well positioned in a world of increasing connectivity, which demands more sensors and more connectors. Our harsh environment strategy is paying off. 80% of our revenues is derived from products designed in harsh environment applications. This requires innovation and the highest quality and reliability. These applications are sticky. This collection of business has generated margin above our current 16% adjusted operating margin run rate. We have now grown harsh environment revenue to 80% from about 50% of our portfolio 5 years ago. And our inorganic and organic growth investments will continue to focus on harsh applications.","Our sensor business is building momentum and we are adding resources to support the significant increase in customer RFPs. We see an increasing number of opportunities to integrate sensors with our other products and provide our customers with innovative, highly reliable, cost effective solutions. And we really feel our unmatched customer-facing and engineering resources are a significant asset for the company. We intend to aggressively build this business with inorganic and organic investments. The BNS divestiture is going well and we will return the majority of the proceeds to shareholders.","Bob mentioned we have restructured our data and devices business to improve our focus on competitive position and reduce costs. I expect this business to be a contributor to EPS growth in fiscal 2016. Our SubCom business is continuing to build momentum. The market appears to be in the early stages of an up-cycle and we continue to win a majority of the key awards. We now have pretty good visibility through fiscal 2016 and expect SubCom to improve our performance at least this year and next. And our strong cash flow and balance sheet enables us to consistently return two-thirds of our free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases and to pursue strategic acquisition to strengthen our leadership position.","TE has a strong portfolio of business, it\u2019s probably the strongest we have ever had with the strong secular growth drivers that should enable us to grow 6% plus organically and to 3% plus GDP world. Continue to grow our adjusted operating margins building on the 16% level we would deliver this year and continue to generate free cash flow at the 10% of revenue level. In summary, we have a lot of leverage to grow profitability and cash flow and I have never felt better about the company.","Now let\u2019s open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And first we will go to William Stein with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","William Stein","Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. So I think the prior EPS guidance midpoint was $4.20, the new guidance is $3.67, I think it\u2019s clear the biggest driver of that reset is the BNS divestiture, but can you walk us through the components that are driving this change in the discontinued \u2013 or rather in the continuing operations EPS guidance?","Bob Hau","Yes. Well, good morning. Thanks. This is Bob. So the prior guidance that we gave many days ago, $4.20 included the broadband networks business. As you recall, the morning of our earnings release, we closed that agreement to sell the business, the business is not yet \u2013 the transaction is not yet closed. But with that announcement that business now moves into discontinued operations. At the end of March, that will be March 23 or so, we issued an 8-K to recast prior periods\u2019 earnings and actually going back nine quarters. We went a little bit further than required to make sure to give the full color to investor base. And what you saw in that 8-K release was last year, 2014 on a full year basis, broadband networks contributed about $0.48 to our earnings. So adjusting last year\u2019s results previously reported would have been $3.79, backing up the $0.48 of broadband networks the re-casted 2014 actual is now $3.31 cents. When you compare that to the $4.20, the prior guidance, BNS had $0.53 of earnings embedded or part of that $4.20. So you take the $4.20, you back out the $0.53, you get the $3.67. So the change in the number is completely BNS. Essentially, $3.67 is the new $4.20 and a like sort of number on a continuing operations basis. That growth, $0.48 to $0.53 really is comprised of a couple of things.","Number one, as you may recall, we did a number of restructuring actions last year to take costs out of the business. A good portion of that was directed at the broadband networks organization and so we expected to see operating income, operating margin improve nicely in that business, 2014 and 2015. Additionally, we did have some modest organic growth on a year-over-year basis. So net-net, the BNS contribution was going about 10% on an EPS basis, roughly in line with what the total company was and it\u2019s going to be driven by low double-digits \u2013 I mean single-digits modest organic growth as well as the benefits of restructuring and general productivity.","William Stein","Okay. That helps. So we are now through this earnings reset, of course we are expecting earnings to grow again to on an all-in basis if you will, contemplating the buyback that we would expect following the close of the BNS sale. I guess, despite the fact that you didn\u2019t guide to it, I would have expected to see the buyback accelerated at least a little in the quarter and I wonder if perhaps you are planning more acquisitions to replace the divested BNS or to replace part of it anyway, you have talked about looking both organically and inorganically in the sensor area. And I am wondering how prominent this is in your plans from now till the end of the year and on an ongoing basis?","Bob Hau","Yes. So \u2013 I will cover the buyback and then Tom to touch a little bit about the M&A plans. In terms of the buyback, again 90 days ago when we announced the transaction we indicated that we expect we will be getting $3 billion in the proceeds from the transaction, the majority of that will be used to buyback shares. But that we would not be doing that in advance of closing the transaction. So we have not accelerated share buyback in the current quarter nor do expect to and tell that transaction closes which currently has been and remains expected to close by the end of the calendar year. Once we receive that cash, we will buy \u2013 begin the buyback. And as we indicated, in the past and continue to expect that share buyback will help to largely offset the $0.53 of dilution once that buyback is completed and net-net the transaction will be neutral approximately 1 year after closing. And that\u2019s the benefit of the share buyback being fully implemented as well as working through some shared costs. If you think about the TE business model, we have things like our IT procurement, HR finance type organizations, working through a shared services model. So essentially, organized organization around some of those functions and those costs are shared across our business.","With the BNS divestiture, we obviously see some de-scaling of those shared services. Once the deal closes, we do have a transition services agreement with CommScope, which will absorb some of the shared service and once those TSAs start to unwind, we will work to offset the costs eliminate the impact 1 year after closing and rough order magnitude that shared services type costs is about $0.07 of the $0.53. So you get the benefit of reduced share count on the $3 billion of the share buyback and the benefit of working through those shared services costs post TSA is unwinding and you can get to a net neutral position on the $0.53.","Tom Lynch","And we will on the acquisition comment or question I should say, while we are always \u2013 our strategy as you can see is around harsh environment connectivity and sensors. And as we did in the last quarter, we had the AdvancedCath and another small technology acquisition. So we have a robust pipeline. It has to fit within our strategy and similar to the sensor logic it has to able to leverage our scale. So, take advantage of all the thousands of people we have in front of the customers, the thousands of engineers we have in the supply chain footprint around the world close to our customers. So, our goal is to continue to identify the best fits and if we can get them at a price that works to make acquisitions.","William Stein","If I can fit in one more please. On the sensors side, you talked quite a bit about having success in that market. You report that business in transportation, but as I recall, measurement and the other \u2013 that you did another sensor acquisition, they are not exclusively transportation as I recall. Maybe you could talk about where you are seeing success in terms of combining sensors and connectors from an end market perspective. Where do you see the bigger opportunities? Thank you.","Tom Lynch","Sure. And right now, they are all \u2013 there are a couple of design wins and a lot of customer activity to prove out the concept. But I think the most important thing is the businesses that we bought are growing slightly ahead of our assumption in the acquisition plan. So, the core organic growth of those businesses has been very good and the technology breadth and depth is even better than we thought, which is now what is the catalyst for being able to walk into customers and medical would be a good example on the same gauge wire that we provided to the customer now putting a very small sensor on the end of it to dramatically improve the capability and we can do it all. So, we can optimize the functionality. That\u2019s a good example. And in early discussions in the industrial industry, the appliance industry and of course automotive and in the industrial transportation industry, so the good challenge we have right now is there is a lot of opportunity and prioritizing them, but it\u2019s the kind of challenge we want to have and that\u2019s why I mentioned and Bob mentioned that we are going to continue to add organic resources into these businesses. So far the hypothesis for bringing sensors together with connectors is playing out. We know it\u2019s still the early part of the game, but we are very optimistic and we are excited about the capabilities we have.","William Stein","Thank you.","Sujal Shah","Alright, thank you. Can we have the next question please?","Operator","And that\u2019s from Amit Daryanani with RBC. Please go ahead.","Amit Daryanani","Thanks a lot. Good morning guys. I guess to start off could you just talk about the transportation segment a little bit. I think the organic growth 3% was a little below what you have seen the last few quarters. I am curious what are you seeing in China and Asia that you talked about that\u2019s leading to the softness? And do you think it\u2019s a one quarter phenomena? Are those headwinds are going to sustain for the next few quarters as well?","Tom Lynch","Yes Amit. I guess couple of comments there. One was in pretty much in line with what we expected based on what the industry was projecting as vehicle production. So, last year, vehicle production was just under 5. This year, we have been predicting anywhere from 2 to 3 depending on when the estimates are coming out. So, no surprise there. In our case, our auto business grew 4% on 1% vehicle production. 3 or 4 years ago, on 1% vehicle production, we would have grown 2% to 2.5%. So, we have had a tremendous run of design wins over the last actually 3 to 5 years coming out of the downturn and including the downturn. So, no surprise there. And generally, I would say the auto business is still pretty healthy. China continued to be strong for us. We have a tremendous position in China and continue to grow solid double-digits there. We expect that to slow down a little bit, but not dramatically. So overall, still feel in line with what we expected in automotive and the production rates like I said kind of in line, a little bit below the historical average, but they were above the historical average last year. And if you look over time, they tend to balance out over 2 or 3 years, but we are generating a lot more revenue for $1 or 1% growth in production than we have in the past.","Amit Daryanani","Got it. And if I just go back to the BNS divestiture impact, if I just get this right, $0.53 impact from discontinued ops, $0.07 of that is shared services that goes away once the deal closes or do you have to do some restructuring to negate that? And then $0.45 will be offset through buybacks, is that kind of the right way to characterize those two buckets?","Tom Lynch","Yes, that\u2019s essentially correct, Amit. The $0.07, some of that will be absorbed by the transaction services agreement that will kick in once the deal closes. So, you will see some quick absorption of that. And then over time as we unwind those transaction services \u2013 transition services agreements, we will work the cost down so that once those are unwound, it\u2019s a net neutral.","Amit Daryanani","Yes, I guess could you just talk about how does the buyback mechanism works once the deal closes? I mean, would you have to do an ASR or something fairly quick to ensure that the neutrality holds up from the divestiture or would you elongate that over a 12-month process?","Tom Lynch","Yes, it \u2013 what we have indicated is it will be one year after closing. And so that will encompass some time to actually execute the share buyback over a period of time.","Amit Daryanani","Perfect, thanks a lot for your time.","Tom Lynch","Thank you.","Sujal Shah","Thank you, Amit. Can we have the next question please?","Operator","And we will go to Amitabh Passi with UBS. Please go ahead.","Amitabh Passi","Hi, guys. Good morning. I had a question and a follow up. Tom, maybe I will focus on the industrial solutions segment. I think you are expecting full year growth of low single-digits. Just wanted to get a sense when can expect to see a slightly better sort of top line growth for this segment? And profitability seems to be doing better than expected can you sustain it at the levels you just reported, so both sort of the demand environment as well as profitability? And then I have a follow-up.","Tom Lynch","Sure. Thanks, Amitabh. I would say like a lot of these businesses, particularly industrial, you kind of have to disaggregate it to make it meaningful. So, commercial air growing very nicely, the market is solid with new aircraft builds and leasing over the last 5 to 6 years significantly increased our content. So, that\u2019s a nice high single-digit growth story. Industrial equipment has been growing for the last six or seven quarters now, which is nice and you kind of mid \u2013 occasionally drifting a little bit above mid single-digits, which is a healthy growth rate for that business. Oil and gas is declining now. It\u2019s about a little under 10% of that segment. So, it\u2019s not massive, but a couple of quarters ago, it was a nice growth for us, and of course, with energy, with oil prices where they are that\u2019s slowed the growth down in that business.","And then the other big piece within there is our energy business, which has gone back to \u2013 and it\u2019s kind of a low single-digit growth business, very steady, close to company average margins, good cash flow generator, but getting really hit hard by the strong dollar, because about 45% of our business is in Europe. So, when you disaggregate it, we would expect normalized \u2013 let\u2019s say oil and gas is flat where it is now, let\u2019s say it doesn\u2019t get worse that we would expect that business is going to grow in the 5% to 6% range for us, because there is a lot of content growth in aircraft, military starting to grow slightly again and that had been a negative for a while. And there is content growth on the factory floor with things like Industrial 4.0 really starting to pick up momentum.","In terms of the margins, the margins are moving up that this is a business that has undergone a lot of shifting of the supply chain to get us more efficient over the last 2 or 3 years under Terrence\u2019s leadership. And that was an important thing that we needed to get done as we went into vertical market several years ago and we feel good about that. We feel this is \u2013 this should be a high-teens margin business. About 65% of the business is there now. And there is still more room in the third of the business it isn\u2019t in other parts of the business. So, there is a lot of natural levers, not miraculous levers, I would say, just in a 5% to 6% growth market, a lot of operating leverage should come with that business. And we are starting to see it as whenever we get \u2013 has that 3% growth rate into the 5%, we really start to see the operating leverage kick in.","Amitabh Passi","Thanks, Tom. That was helpful. And then maybe just real quick follow-up either for you or Bob, at $700 million for your subsea business, can you maybe just update us on how we should be thinking about profitability for the segment? And also what profitability was for subsea in the March quarter?","Bob Hau","Yes, Amitabh, it\u2019s Bob. Our current outlook for 2014 is about $720 million from revenue. And we will do low double-digit operating margin at that level. As we have indicated in the past, as we approach $1 billion in volume or in revenue on an annual basis, we have to expect that to increase to the company average margins. But right now, part of it is we are still doing ramp up, so we are restarting factories and hiring folks and getting our assets fully utilized. But this year at $720 million we will do low double-digit operating margin.","Amitabh Passi","And in the March quarter?","Bob Hau","It\u2019s about similar.","Amitabh Passi","Okay, alright. Thank you both.","Bob Hau","Thank you.","Sujal Shah","Thanks Amitabh. Can we have the next question please?","Operator","And we will go to Matt Sheerin with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Matt Sheerin","Thanks. Just a couple of quick follow-up questions, regarding the transportation business, in the commercial area you talked about weakness in heavy trucking and related to oil and gas, do you see that bottoming in the next couple of quarters or so. And in terms of how it impacts your margins, my understanding that margins in that business were perhaps better than your automotive margins, so does that impact things at all. And could \u2013 if that does get worse, could you shift resources into your \u2013 the passenger vehicles side or are they separate operations?","Tom Lynch","Thanks, Matt. Yes, a couple of things there. I would say, what we saw in the heavy truck market is the slowdown in the growth rate in heavy truck market and continued weakness in the off-road market. So as you know mining and agriculture, those markets have been soft. And as the growth rates slow down, what you typically see is supply chain slows down a little faster. So we saw that tail end in the last quarter and this quarter. We are not seeing anything that says it\u2019s going to get any worse. I think that there are good drivers in there such as the emission standards and in China for example, while truck production is down, the content for truck in China now that they are really adopting and enforcing Euro IV standards, is up more than the truck volume is down. So I would say we would see this business to stay for the next quarter or two about the level of that now. The margins are above company average. Definitely, it\u2019s a nice margin business. There is not enough change in the business to really be thinking about redeploying. It\u2019s kind of staying at the level it\u2019s been. We do share within the business, so we share factories, we \u2013 as Bob talked about, our shared costs infrastructure for support services, we certainly share that. So we do optimize within the transportation segment as a whole, a lot of our assets. So we have for example, it slowed in \u2013 trucks slowed in one part of the world, but cars picked up, we can take advantage of that with basically in the same facility for the most part. So there is that kind of flexibility.","Matt Sheerin","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And just regarding the subsea business, you guided to $700 million plus for the year and you are looking at I think it\u2019s called the growth year-over-year in communications overall, so should be \u2013 there be a step up this quarter in subsea revenue in sort of the mid-teens sequentially?","Bob Hau","On a sequential basis for SubCom, I would expect some modest improvement, the new AE Connect program kind of immediately ramps up. We are actually doing some juggling within our factories to manage that program. So we will complete that program this calendar year and we will probably offset some other programs. So it\u2019s a net-net, not full increase of what it is growth from our prior guidance up to that $720 million level, about a $70 million increase from prior guidance. So you do see some incremental into Q3 and into Q4 from that new program.","Matt Sheerin","Okay, alright. Thanks a lot.","Sujal Shah","Thank you. Okay. Thanks Matt. Can we have the next question please?","Operator","And that\u2019s from Mike Wood with Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Mike Wood","Hi, good morning. Thanks for providing a lot of these bridges. My first question is just on the operational performance line on Slide 4, the $65 million lower sales and the $0.07 increased EPS, I know you had mentioned SubCom is up more than $50 million versus your expectation, can you just provide what was dragging or what was offsetting that and on the lower sales how you are able to get to $0.07, is that commodity deflation or operational improvement?","Tom Lynch","And you are talking to full year, Mike? I think I am correct.","Mike Wood","Yes.","Tom Lynch","Some of that is subsea, some of that is accelerated restructuring. And for example, related to data and devices, as we told you last quarter, we are doing some significant combination there that\u2019s driving costs out and continuing to drive the productivity side. We get a little bit of lift from metals being lower in the year as our hedges roll off versus last year, but we are going to see most of that next year. But it\u2019s a combination of things and just tightening up.","Bob Hau","Mike, the revenue decline of about, I think on that page is $55 million operationally. We get the lift from SubCom, but we have, as we talked about continuing to work through, refocusing our data and device business as well as some of that weakness in ICT offsetting that.","Mike Wood","Okay, great. And then just a question in terms of recent European Western vehicle registrations have been pretty strong, it seems like the industry and yourselves are still looking for auto production that seems to remain pretty tepid. I am just curious what you are expecting there from the cadence, I mean eventually does the \u2013 is there an offset to that strong Western European vehicle registrations in other European regions that you are seeing or is this just a timing issue eventually the production will ramp back up?","Tom Lynch","Yes. Well, I mean it\u2019s \u2013 I would say if you take Europe in total, it\u2019s gradually improving. And to kind of put it in perspective, it\u2019s still \u2013 if it stays on its current track, which would be a little under 2% total production growth. It will get back to slightly above 2012 level. So I think, yes there is more new registrations, but you \u2013 in certain countries, you also have the impact of Russia uncertainty on Eastern European and the Russian market itself, not huge, but that\u2019s down 50%. But net-net, I think the industry estimates now are is the Europe production growth, so that\u2019s the way we think about it. It\u2019s all the production of the European OEMs is going to be up high 1% and 1.5%, 1.6% range, which is a little better than it\u2019s been. But still, we believe, there is pent up demand there. It\u2019s better than it's been, but it\u2019s not robust yet.","Mike Wood","Great. Thank you.","Tom Lynch","You\u2019re welcome.","Sujal Shah","Thank you, Mike. Can we have the next question please?","Operator","That\u2019s Shawn Harrison with Longbow Research. Please go ahead.","Shawn Harrison","Good morning. Two questions, first to open the bridge, the increase in revenue guidance sequentially with EPS going down sequentially. On that typical type of volume increase, I would have expected that to mitigate the sequential FX headwinds, so if you can maybe help me out on why EPS is going down sequentially on higher revenues, it doesn\u2019t look essentially like you are getting any volume leverage?","Tom Lynch","Yes. Shawn, it\u2019s not unusual in this set of businesses in Q3, particularly our transportation business for margin to drift down a little bit in Q3 and we aren\u2019t expecting it to kick off. We are also seeing very low production in Q3 with a pick up because of a lot of new model launches in Q4, which means towards the end of Q3 and in Q4 we will be shipping higher content vehicles. So we have got a little bit of that. There is a more significant FX hit and that FX hit is on our European businesses. And those are \u2013 if you look at our energy, industrial equipment and particularly our very strong European auto businesses those are nice margin businesses. So you get a little bit of mix effect. And you have the ICT business slowing down a bit. So it\u2019s more of a mix factor than anything else. Margins will stay in the ballpark let\u2019s say within 50 basis points of Q2, but we are solidly in the 16% range for 16% plus for the year. So, $0.09 \u2013 $0.08 to $0.09 EPS impact in Q2, $0.13 in Q3, so it\u2019s a variety of things depressing the earnings growth.","Shawn Harrison","Got it. Thanks. I guess to add, is there any tax rate dynamics because I know it ticked down a bit sequentially, does \u2013 do taxes rise?","Bob Hau","Yes, the tax rate for the quarter was down nicely from first quarter. Overall, we still expect the full year to be above 23%. The first half of the year, if you put the two quarters together was 22.5%. So net-net all are in line with about 23%. Largely the difference is the timing of ability to release some reserves or statute limitations expiring that we have planned just a matter of when those actually expire and when we are able to report those impacts.","Shawn Harrison","Okay. And then as my follow up, I understand, I guess, the concept of waiting until we have the $3 billion in hand for accelerating the buyback. But at the same time, if everything goes as planned, your stock price should be higher exiting the year than it is now and you have access to cheap capital if you want to borrow it. I think the euro debt issuance was at 1%. So, I guess more of the question is on the rationale on why not accelerating the buyback if you could borrow some short-term money and do it now before the stock price rises if everything goes as planned?","Tom Lynch","Yes, I would say while we have been pretty consistent we are not changing our answer on this, because we don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea obviously or else we would be doing it. But fundamentally, until the deal is closed, I mean it\u2019s on track. All government approvals are not received yet. We are getting through them. I am optimistic, but it\u2019s not that far off. So, rather than go through and change the capital structure from which work for us extremely well for the last 7 years, I just don\u2019t want to do it. So, it\u2019s really the answer.","Shawn Harrison","Okay, that\u2019s fair. Thanks, Tom.","Tom Lynch","Thank you.","Sujal Shah","Okay. Can we have the next question please?","Operator","Thank you. And we will go to Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Craig Hettenbach","Yes, thanks. On the DataComm side of the business, can you provide an update on the 25-gig product cycle in terms of what your visibility is there and then also as you start to see revenue kind of the implications for the margins in that business?","Tom Lynch","Sure, thanks Craig. I feel good about our win rate and frustrated about the actual rate of adoption. So, I think that\u2019s sort of been our sad story in a way for the last year. We have a nice product, customers seem to like it. They are selecting it. They are designing it in, but I think the tremendous amount of change that\u2019s going on in that industry is just delaying the impact of new technology. We remain committed to the product line and it\u2019s not quite the drag it had been because for so long, heavy R&D we are starting to see the light at the end of that tunnel. Hopefully, we expect next year with shipping some of this product. But part of the nature of what\u2019s going on in that industry, the convergence of customers, the white box effect, software defined network, all those things that are just continuing to squeeze the industry is why we combine the two businesses and we need to run it differently than we have in the past. I like our product line. It\u2019s a much more focused product line and there is still more focusing to do, but our core connectivity product line is very good. We have been investing in high-speed and we think that\u2019s essentially going to payoff for us, but it\u2019s certainly taking longer for the market to adopt this, the higher speed solutions in any significant way than we thought.","Craig Hettenbach","Okay, thanks for the color there. As a follow-up on the automotive side particularly within sensors, understanding it\u2019s a time process in terms of longer cycle business, the design in, but you did have an organic development underway. Now, you have some incremental technology from the MEAS side. Can you just talk about the engagements you are seeing in the automotive side and what that means kind of mid to longer term in terms of the growth opportunity?","Tom Lynch","Yes. We are very pleased with the engagement. Of course, we are not generating any sales in our financials yet from measurement products that are capitalizing on our market presence, but there is a lot of customer engagement. And it will be a couple of years before we can turn the engagements into revenue but its happening. The number of engagements are happening faster than we expected. We just \u2013 it\u2019s a really, really good product line that Measurement Specialties had, and of course, we are the established customer supplier for connectivity and our own sensor base. So, we have the credibility and the wherewithal to support the cost business. The auto customers have very, very strict requirements and that was a key part of our hypothesis that our ability to capitalize on that and bring in products that otherwise might not get there is good. So, it\u2019s activity right now. So, the activity level is high. We are excited about it. A couple of small victories that will turn into revenue, but on or ahead of track I would say. But it\u2019s a couple of years out before revenue synergies start to kick in. But importantly, the organic revenue of the acquisitions is tracking slightly ahead of plan. So, that\u2019s also nice. Okay?","Craig Hettenbach","Got it. Thank you.","Sujal Shah","Thank you, Craig. Can we have the next question please?","Operator","And we will go to Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Sherri Scribner","Hi, thanks. Just looking at your Transportation Solutions margins, they are starting to get near the sort of 21% level and they have been in the 21% level last year, how much more upside do you have to the Transportation Solutions margin and how much more do you think you can do with restructuring \u2013 not necessarily restructuring, but with better cost alignment? Thanks.","Tom Lynch","Sure. The transportation margins are very healthy at above 20%. Our primary focus is to drive higher revenue and that\u2019s what\u2019s starting to happen. As I mentioned earlier, if you look at our auto sale rate versus production rate, the sensor business is growing in the 8% to 10% rate. So, that\u2019s our big opportunity. I would say within the portfolio, sensors, as we mentioned when we acquired the business, significant opportunities move the margin up with our scale. It won\u2019t happen overnight, but we expect the margins up steadily towards the core automotive connectivity margins. So, you might see \u2013 it might look like our total margin is moving a little bit, but within that holding the margins we have in growing the sensor margins. At 3%, 3.5% production, I would expect to deliver 30 to 50 basis points of margin improvement, everything else being equal. So, we have been pretty consistently moving the margins up. But again, our focus is to make \u2013 to drive the revenue growth, they continue to drive above mid single-digit revenue growth into the high single-digit revenue growth in this business. That should have some natural margin flow with it.","Sherri Scribner","And then just following up on the growth rates, I think in the past, you have talked about a 6% to 8% growth rate for this business. Is that number higher with the sensor acquisition that you have done in the sensor business or is it still sort of 6% to 8%? Thanks.","Tom Lynch","We are in that range, but I think it starts to move towards the higher end of the range. Now, sensors right now is still a little more than 10% of the business. So, it doesn\u2019t have that much leverage, but that\u2019s going to change. I mean, that\u2019s our goal is to change it. So, it definitely sort of solidifies the middle of that range in our mind and starts to take it towards the higher end.","Sherri Scribner","Thank you.","Sujal Shah","Okay, thank you Sherri. Can we have the next question please?","Operator","And we will go to Steven Fox with Cross Research. Please go ahead.","Steven Fox","Thanks. Good morning. Just a few clarifications on Measurement Specialties first, are you providing sort of the EPS accretion you are getting from it in the most recent quarter and how it looks for the rest of the year? And then secondly, I think what I heard, Tom, is that you are saying that you are seeing a pickup in wins on and around sensors, but it\u2019s more longer term mainly related to auto still. Is that the right characterization? And then I had a quick follow-up. Thanks.","Tom Lynch","Yes, what my point really on the second part of the question and I will turn it to Bob for the first part is that designing process takes a while. So, you guys have the design in where you convinced the customer to let you bid on a quote and we are having a lot of that activity, then if you win, you have got to get designed in. And for these applications, even in things like appliances and on the industrial floor, it\u2019s a couple of years typically before between design in and revenue. It\u2019s shorter in the consumer space of course, but we are really very targeted in that space with our sensor business. Most of our sensor business, even the way it\u2019s spread today just to make up by end market today is in harsh environment. So, that\u2019s what I mean. There is this kind of the three elements. There is the organic growth that\u2019s kind of the normal MEAS and AST growth that they would have had whether we acquired them or not, we probably helped that a little bit. That\u2019s growing at a little better rate than we thought and we bought the assumption then there is the take the sensors and leverage our channel strength for standard products. We expect to start to see that next year. And then new design wins that we enable because we are sitting with a customer that MEAS or AST would not have had access to \u2013 that\u2019s a couple of years out. So, that\u2019s the way I think about it.","Bob Hau","Steve, in terms of the impact of Measurement, on a full year basis, we expect about $0.10 in terms of EPS in the current quarter, call it $0.02 to $0.03 was what we saw in the second fiscal quarter. One important point to note between your questions and Sherri\u2019s previously around the operating margin. Overall, our automotive and ICT margins actually grew year-over-year. We talked about that in our opening comments. With the acquisition of Measurement that\u2019s slightly less of the sensors business, is up nicely on a year-over-year kind of on a pro forma basis. So seeing operating performance is that actually takes the overall transportation margins down to slightly, some of that is acquisition accounting, some of that is on the beginning of sensors adding into our business. But overall, we are seeing nice margin benefits in auto and ICT.","Steven Fox","That\u2019s really helpful. And then just really quickly on the book to bill, the 103 ex-SubCom that seems like a pretty positive number despite all the mix trends you pointed to, can you just isolate what the drivers are and I guess that\u2019s part of why the fourth quarter should be so strong?","Tom Lynch","It\u2019s in the harsh businesses. So those businesses continue to perform well, both from I think the markets are holding up and we are performing well and our design-ins continued to get a little bit bigger each year. So it\u2019s really across those businesses and it\u2019s we had a pretty good order \u2013 a very good order month for example in Automotive in Q2. And that\u2019s starting to line up for the model that we will start shipping into in Q4 to your point.","Steven Fox","Great. Thank you very much, congratulations.","Sujal Shah","Thank you, Steve. Can we have the next question please?","Operator","And we will go to Amitabh Passi with UBS. Please go ahead.","Amitabh Passi","Hey guys. Sorry, just a quick follow-up on my end. Bob, I apologize if you touched on this, but can you help us understand how we go from the $0.87 to the implied $1 for fiscal 4Q \u2013 the 3Q to 4Q jump on essentially flattish sales?","Bob Hau","Yes. There is a couple of things driving that. Number 1, we are seeing some growth in our aerospace business, so we are getting some additional leverage in that. Obviously, FX continues to be a headwind. So there is some organic growth. Productivity, the benefits of restructuring in particular, in the opening comments, I have talked about the restructuring charges that we will be taking actually in Q3, but also \u2013 excuse me in Q2, but also in the first half of the year. We have taken about $64 million worth of charges. We expect the full year to be now about $75 million of charges. The majority of those charges are associated with data and devices and oil and gas. Particularly in the data and devices business that\u2019s OpEx, so you get very quick payback and we will start seeing the benefits of that in the fourth quarter. And that helps to bring some nice leverage on the organic growth with lower OpEx spending.","Amitabh Passi","Okay.","Tom Lynch","The other thing, Amitabh, just if you look at our auto business, because of the changeover when we start shipping into the new models, our production is actually going to be higher in Q4 than it was last year. So, we are going to get it as the benefit as lower cost per unit. So we are getting a little bit of that, and there is a lot of new models being launched that we will be \u2013 they will actually come on the market calendar Q4, but we will be shipping for them to be built and in our late Q3, but mostly through our fiscal Q4, which ends in September and we have more content on that. And that helps our margin as well.","Amitabh Passi","Which is contrary to normal seasonality, right, because typically I thought...","Tom Lynch","It\u2019s not that super seasonal anymore because China has become such a bigger part of the auto story. Now it used to be more pronounced, but \u2013 and they are introducing more cars quicker. So that thing is starting to get tamped down. But in this quarter, you have got new [indiscernible] all the German OEMs are launching a bunch of new cars and so there is a little bit of an unusual impact there because we wouldn\u2019t typically see that Q3 \u2013 Q4 to Q4.","Amitabh Passi","Got it. Thank you.","Sujal Shah","Thanks Amitabh. Can we have the next question please?","Operator","And we will go to Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Mark Delaney","Thanks very much. Two questions, first one for me is actually following up on the implied outlook for the fiscal fourth quarter into September, if I am doing my math right, you get to the $1 of EPS in 4Q on that flattish revenue, I mean, it seems to me like the EBIT margin is to be something in the mid-17% range and that your OpEx has to be stepping down pretty materially in the September quarter, I guess the question is around is my math right. And then the OpEx is coming down that much in the fiscal fourth quarter, what does that imply for the OpEx trends into fiscal \u201916, is it \u2013 are you getting the full restructuring benefits and can you hold those levels or are there going to be changes as we think about fiscal '16 OpEx?","Bob Hau","Mark, your numbers are certainly in the ballpark. And we have indicated, we expect to close the full year out well north of 16% and that implies a nice uptick into the fourth quarter. Some of that is certainly the OpEx spending, it\u2019s the data and devices restructuring as well as the restructuring that we are doing in the oil and gas business to a much smaller level than what we are seeing in the data and devices plus the refocusing of that data and devices business by exiting some unprofitable product lines you see we are actually reducing revenue. But not only raising operating margin, but raising operating income dollars. And so that gives you a nice lift. So it\u2019s not all OpEx, it\u2019s some gross margin lift also, but definitely a nice lift into the fourth quarter.","Tom Lynch","And \u2013 I mean do you have the year-over-year the transportation business up more than usual because of what I said and the SubCom relative to last year especially. So you have two, those are the three big levers, but Bob talked about costs and then the margin effect of transportation and SubCom.","Mark Delaney","Okay. And then for a follow-up question on the industrial segment, I understand you are seeing some weakness in the oil and gas end markets specifically, some of the bigger industrial companies have seen weakness outside of oil and gas and just traditional industrial and appliance type end markets, and I missed the 1Q numbers, have you guys seen anything either in your recent order patterns or just the conversations with your customers that would indicate any broader weakness in industrial outside of oil and gas?","Tom Lynch","I wouldn\u2019t say broad and I think just all the shocks to the system between oil prices, dollars strengthening and Russia \u2013 lingering Russia situation as people kind of concerned. But if you look at the core pieces of our industrial business, we are not seeing it in aerospace and defense. We are seeing it in the oil and gas to your point. We are seeing it in industrial equipment. We are keeping an eye on China. I mean what happened in our quarter is China softened and Europe was strong in industrial equipment in the second quarter from both the sales and order rates. So it\u2019s kind of mixed for sure. In the appliance business, it\u2019s mixed, U.S., solid, China, slowing a bit. So I think it\u2019s not a kind of \u2013 there is not a lot a momentum in the growth rate is the way I would say it. I thought 90 days ago there would be more momentum in the world from a growth point of view, and it\u2019s kind of going just sideways. So it is \u2013 there is pockets of \u2013 there is industries like auto that overall are continuing to have a very positive outlook and do well, particularly auto in a couple parts of the world. But it\u2019s a real mix bag, it\u2019s not a circumstance that has one comfortable, I would say.","Mark Delaney","Thank you very much.","Sujal Shah","Thank you, Mark. Can we have the next question please?","Operator","And that\u2019s from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks. This is [indiscernible] filling in for Wamsi today. Thanks for taking the question. Tom, you have talked about in the data and devices segment exiting some low margin products, just wanted to clarify how much of that is left and what kind of margin improvement can that translate to?","Tom Lynch","Sure. We are getting through it. It\u2019s on the other side I would say. So most of the heavy exits, a little bit left to do, the way we think about that business with the combination of a more focused product line and the cross actions we are taking as, one, it should contribute to EPS growth next year. And as you start going out to the next year, we would expect it to start closing in on double-digit margins.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, alright. Thank you.","Sujal Shah","Thanks [indiscernible]. Can we have the next question please?","Operator","And we will go to Jim Suva with Citi. Please go ahead.","Jim Suva","Thanks very much. And the bridge to the financials was greatly appreciated. I have a question regarding Slide 5. So if you take a look at Slide 5 on the transportation side, I see that you show auto up 4% and then you have a little note on 1% unit growth. So if I do math correctly, that shows about 3% content growth net of ASP erosion. So I am just kind of scratching my head here, is there a content growth supposed to be about net 4% to 6% driven by about 6% to 8% content growth plus ASP erosion of 2% long-term, so was pricing more aggressive or content a little bit that less or was this more of a rounding error or is my memory and math wrong, because I thought kind of the general rule of thumb was global auto\u2019s long-term 1% to 3%, which is 1% this quarter, which is fine, and so then you have got 6% to 8% content less ASP erosion of 2%, so kind of a long-term growth rate of adding 4% to 6%. So, if you could just kind of help me out a little bit about what\u2019s going on there, maybe it\u2019s just rounding error?","Bob Hau","The model we always refer to is production is what it is. This quarter was 1% content, it\u2019s 4% to 6% and price is 2%. So, we don\u2019t net price in that scenario against content. 4% to 6%, so it\u2019s not 6% to 8%. If we netted price, it will be 2% to 4%.","Jim Suva","Got it. Okay, great. And then regarding content growth for cars, is it being relatively stable growth, acceleration or with oil prices going down, has there been a deceleration or can you talk a little bit about content growth of what you are seeing?","Tom Lynch","It\u2019s pretty stable. I mean, it really hasn\u2019t changed that much. I mean what we see is in every part of the world, content growth is going up. So, some parts of the world, the European cars have the highest content, but everybody continues to move up. And the biggest \u2013 the three big drivers, right, safe, green and connected, so you have just more safety, everything from more airbags to better breaking system, stability control, things like that. You have the connectivity, which is really increasing. And then you have emissions or green, which is driving a lot more electronics around the engine in the powertrain in general, which of course, operating margin connectivity and more sensing to optimize the performance of the engine so that you can hit the emission target. So \u2013 but I would say it\u2019s pretty steady, because with I think if you go back years ago we would have thought hybrid electric would be a higher percentage of the market than it is today. And that as you know has significantly more content. That really has a move, I think as much as anybody thought. And one of the reasons is gas prices are down. And if you look at the latest numbers in the U.S., SUV and pickup trucks are way up. So, the high gas consumption vehicles are way up and actually hybrids are not. So, it\u2019s kind of a mixed bag, but generally we have not seen any significant shift in the trends.","Jim Suva","Great, okay. Thanks so much, guys.","Sujal Shah","Alright, thank you Jim.

Welcome to the TE Connectivity Quarter One Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded.","And I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Keith Kolstrom. Please go ahead, sir.","Keith Kolstrom","Thanks. Good morning and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss TE Connectivity\u2019s first quarter 2013 results. With me today are Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Lynch; and Chief Financial Officer, Bob Hau.","During the course of this call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information and we ask you to review the forward-looking cautionary statements included in today\u2019s press release. In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussion this morning, and we ask you to review the sections of our press release and the accompanying slide presentation that address the use of these items. The press release and related tables, along with the slide presentation, can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at te.com.","Finally, for participants on the Q&A portion of today\u2019s call, I would like to remind everyone to please limit themselves to one follow-up question.","Now, let me turn the call over to Tom for some opening comments.","Tom Lynch","Thanks, Keith, and good morning, everyone. If you could please turn to slide three and we\u2019ll get started. First quarter results were in line with our expectations, as strong margin performance offset slightly weaker than expected sales, particularly in our Network segment.","Orders were up 3% versus prior year to $3.1 billion and strengthened through the quarter in most of our businesses, primarily due to improved economic conditions in the U.S. and China. And excluding SubCom, our book-to-bill for the quarter was 1.02, which compares to about a 0.98 last year.","We also had another strong free cash flow quarter generating $304 million. And of that, returned $267 million to shareholders through dividends and the repurchase of approximately 5 million shares. We expect to return over 1 billion to shareholders for the full year as we also indicated on our prior call.","I\u2019m encouraged by the order trends, also encouraged by our strong execution on productivity and the traction we\u2019re making on the cost reduction programs we announced last quarter. And as a result, we do expect increased sales and earnings in the second quarter and we expect to deliver a strong second half.","Please turn to slide four. Total company sales of $3.13 billion were down 1% versus the prior year and down 4% on an organic basis. Currency translation negatively impacted year-on-year growth by $43 million and the Deutsch acquisition contributed $148 million in revenue.","Versus the prior-year, revenue in our Transportation and Industrial segments were up low single-digits due to the addition of Deutsch. The Network and Consumer segment declined in the quarter. The Network decline represents a continuation of weak CapEx spending and many segments of the broadband network. Consumer was down slightly due to weak PC demand, more than offsetting our improving position in tablets and smartphones.","By region, compared to the prior year, revenues were up 4% in the Americas, down 2% in Europe, and down 5% in Asia. Within Asia, China was up about 4%. However, the rest of Asia was down primarily due to weakness in Japan.","Please turn to slide five and I\u2019ll provide some highlights of our segment performance. Transportation had another strong quarter of performance with sales up 3% and adjusted operating income up 10%. Overall, global light vehicle production was up slightly versus the prior year with growth in the U.S. and China offsetting declines in Europe and Japan. Commercial vehicle production continued to be soft in Q1, but orders have strengthened early in the current quarter, and we expect sales in this segment to continue to grow in Q2.","Please turn to slide six. Revenues and adjusted operating income in our Network business were down 8% versus the prior year. As I mentioned earlier, the market for broadband network equipment, particularly in the wireline portion of the market, continues to be soft. And we don\u2019t expect to see this improvement till late in the second half.","Project activity in the SubCom business remains robust, but the funding continues to be slow. And we actually expect this business to bottom in the second quarter. So we have a strong pipeline, but projects coming into force have been slow.","With respect to the Network segment overall, I still continue to be bullish despite the fact that we\u2019re in this pretty extended lull in demand on the wireline side. The underlying trends would say that the network has to continue to be built out with small base stations coming and the need to drive fiber close to the home to get the data rate that consumers and businesses demand. We think the market will be coming back. It\u2019s been hard to call the timing, but we\u2019ll still remain bullish on the underlying market trends.","Now during this lull, we\u2019ve been pretty aggressive, as we mentioned last quarter, in taking costs out. So much like we did in automotive in the downturn, we\u2019re positioned in this business for a really strong rebound in sales and earnings growth as demand picks up.","Please turn to slide seven. Revenue in the Industrial segment was up 2% as the Deutsch acquisition offset continued weak demand in the industrial equipment and solar markets. Adjusted operating margins up 12%, were down as expected due to the low sales level. Based on normal seasonality and improving order trends, we expect steady sales and margin improvement over the balance of the year. And we expect our margin in this segment to be up several points by the end of the year.","Please turn to slide eight. Sales in our Consumer segment were down 4% versus the prior year, with adjusted operating margins up 300 basis points and adjusted operating income up 32%. We\u2019re finally beginning to see the results of our efforts in tablets and smartphones, and getting increased number of designing with the important customers in this segment.","However, this growth was offset by general weakness in the PC market, which is still a large portion of our Consumer Devices business. Adjusted margins improved in this segment over the prior year, primarily as a result of improved productivity and cost reduction actions.","Now, let me turn it over to Bob, who\u2019s to going to cover the financials in more detail.","Bob Hau","Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Let me discuss earnings, which start on slide nine. Our GAAP operating income for the quarter was $293 million, which includes restructuring charges of $92 million and Deutsch acquisition-related charges of $5 million. Adjusted operating income was $390 million with an adjusted operating margin of 12.4%, up 30 basis points from Q1 last year.","GAAP and adjusted EPS were $0.65 for the quarter. GAAP EPS included $0.15 of restructuring and other charges, and $0.01 of acquisition-related charges, offset by $0.16 of income related to tax items. The tax income was primarily related to the settlement of an audit of prior year tax returns as we continue to make progress on resolving our pre separation shared tax liabilities.","Please turn to slide 10. Our adjusted gross margin in the quarter was 31.6%. Despite sales that were slightly lower than expected, both gross and operating margins were above our outlook for the quarter as a result of increased productivity and rigorous cost and spending controls. Total OpEx spending was $599 million in the quarter. And this was up about 7% versus the prior year largely due to the addition of Deutsch.","The right side of the slide details items in the P&L below the operating line. Net interest expense was $33 million for the first quarter, about flat versus the prior year. I expect approximately $32 million of expense per quarter for the remainder of the year. Adjusted other income, which relates to our tax-sharing agreement, was $5 million versus our outlook of $9 million.","On a GAAP basis, taxes were a benefit in the quarter, due primarily to the settlement of an audit of prior year tax returns as I mentioned earlier. The adjusted effective tax rate was 23%, slightly lower than the 24% to 25% guidance. Both adjusted other income and adjusted tax expense were lower, and the net effect was no impact to EPS compared to guidance. For the remainder of the year, I expect other income of about $8 million per quarter and tax rate of 23% to 24%, which is slightly lower than what we guided last quarter.","Please turn to slide 11. Cash from continuing operations was $393 million. Our free cash flow in Q1 was a very strong $304 million. This was a very good start to the fiscal year as free cash flow is typically the lowest in the first quarter. We continue to expect free cash flow to approximate net income going forward.","Capital spending during the quarter was $124 million or about 4% of sales. This is consistent with historic levels of approximately 4% to 5% of sales. Working capital levels are in line with our expectations. Receivable days outstanding were 63 days and inventory days on hand were 74 days, both up slightly versus the prior year primarily due to the addition of Deutsch. Our businesses continue to do a very good job managing working capital.","Now, let me discuss the sources and uses of cash outside of free cash flow shown on the right side of the slide. We began the quarter with $1.6 billion of cash and ended the quarter with about $1 billion. During the quarter, we returned a total of $267 million to shareholders. We paid dividends of $89 million and repurchased 5 million shares for $178 million.","The cash flow statement shows a slightly lower dollar amount for share repurchases due to the timing difference on actual payment of funds. We continue to expect additional share repurchases of $150 million to $250 million per quarter in fiscal 2013.","Outstanding debt was $3 billion at the end of the quarter. As I have discussed on last quarter\u2019s earnings call, debt was reduced by approximately $700 million in early October with the pay off of notes that had matured. We expect debt levels to remain at approximately $3 billion for fiscal 2013. And finally, on December 26, Standard & Poor\u2019s raised the credit rating on TE from BBB to BBB+ with a stable outlook based on our stronger performance.","Now, I\u2019ll turn it back to Tom.","Tom Lynch","Thanks, Bob. Please turn to slide 12. We are beginning to see some positive signs in the U.S. and China as order strengthened during the quarter. I mentioned this earlier. And this momentum has continued into January, the first three weeks of January. All segments except Network had a positive book-to-bill in the quarter. And our overall book-to-bill was 1.02 excluding SubCom. As a result, we are a little more optimistic that we will see continued demand improvement as the year progresses.","Please turn to slide 13. Based on the order trends, we expect revenue in Q2 to be in the $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion range and adjusted EPS in the $0.68 to $0.72 range. At the midpoint, revenue would be about flat versus the prior year with EPS up 3% and adjusted operating margins would be between 12.5% and 13%.","We expect approximately $100 million of restructuring charges in the second quarter as we are accelerating our cost improvement actions. On a year-over-year basis, revenues in the Transportation segment would be up about 5% primarily due to the addition of Deutsch, as growth in automotive is offset by a weaker demand for industrial and commercial vehicles. Networks will be down about 8% primarily due to weakness in SubCom.","Please turn to slide 14. For the full year, we expect sales in the range of $13.3 billion to $13.7 billion and adjusted EPS of $3.05 to $3.25. And the midpoint of $3.15 is consistent with our prior guidance on lower sales of about $200 million. At the midpoint of this guidance, adjusted EPS would be up about 10% on revenue growth of about 2%.","We expect the total of approximately $225 million of restructuring charges for the full year. And this is an increase of $25 million versus prior guidance as we plan to accelerate several actions in response to the current slow environment. We do expect stronger than normal earnings improvement in the second half and I\u2019ll highlight the key reasons for that.","Global auto production is expected to improve slightly in the second half compared to the first half. We are expecting a modest pickup in Network and Industrial Solutions demand relative to the first half of the year, and slightly up versus the second half of last year, which is not very strong. We do expect SubCom revenues to return to the $125 million per quarter in the second half. And we have won the awards and now they need to go into force. And as I mentioned, the key there is getting the funding, but we believe we\u2019re getting closer.","Momentum in our Consumer Device business continues. We have a number of new products we\u2019re launching that will go into the market in the second half. So that\u2019s another key milestone for us in this business contributing to the sales growth. And then we\u2019re expecting a continuation of a slow but steady recovery in the industrial vehicle market. As I mentioned earlier, the orders in that market segment have been very strong over the last four to five weeks.","And then last but certainly not least, we expect to continue the margin improvement due to our Lean programs and the accelerated cost improvement action. So, about half the revenue increase in the second half is seasonally related. The other third is we\u2019re expecting stronger markets for automotive, commercial, aerospace, industrial.","And then another third is we have some significant new product launches, particularly in our Consumer and Fiber businesses, Network businesses. And I think the key point is at the margin rate we\u2019re delivering now, we\u2019ve continued to improve operating leverage.","So please turn to slide 15. Before we move to Q&A, I wanted to review the three scenarios I laid out for fiscal 2013 on the last call. And these scenarios really summarize how expect to perform at different sales levels, which I think is important to understand. To recap, at the low end scenario, revenue would be flat year-over-year and we expected to generate about 5% adjusted EPS growth as a result of productivity improvements and the benefit of share repurchases.","The midpoint scenario assumed 3% sales growth with a modest economic pickup beginning in second half and adjusted EPS growth of approximately 10%. And at the high end of the range, a stronger recovery in the second half was assumed with sales growth of 5% and EPS growth of 15%.","So, what happened in the first three months of the year, sales in the first quarter were slightly lower than expected. Margins were stronger due to the increasing impact of our productivity programs and cost and spending controls. Free cash flow continued to be very strong and it was in fact stronger than anticipated. And order rates did improve through the quarter in the vast majority of our businesses.","So when we take that all in and all the data points in the macro world, these results in current order trends lead us to a view for the remainder of the year that anticipates revenue at the low to midpoint of prior guidance, and adjusted EPS at the midpoint.","Revenue levels remains tough to predict in this environment. But on the positive side, we\u2019ve got off to a great start with our productivity and cost reduction initiatives. And we expect to carry this through the balance of the year. We expect another strong year of cash flow and expect to return over $1 billion in capital to our shareholders this year.","As Bob mentioned earlier, we continue to expect $150 million to $250 million of share repurchase a quarter in fiscal 2013. And in addition, our board has recommended a 19% increase in the dividend to $1 per year. This increase would be effective with the June quarter and is subject to shareholder approval at the March annual meeting.","So again, I think the bottom line for us is our strong cash flow and improving operating leverage should enable us to deliver very attractive earnings growth even at a low sales growth rate. So with that, let\u2019s open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Of course. (Operator Instructions) Our first question today comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Amit Daryanani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Good morning, guys. Just a question, I guess, on the Automotive segment. If you could maybe talk about the softness that you saw in the December quarter, specifically in EMEA. This was more demand driven or do you think there\u2019s an inventory correction that\u2019s occurring over there that could persist over the next couple of quarters especially related to dealer registered vehicles, if you may? Maybe if you could just talk about that part of the business and the inventory correction, that\u2019ll be helpful.","Tom Lynch","Sure. I think in the Automotive piece, it\u2019s more demand-driven, Amit, to your point about the low new registrations. That\u2019s offset a little bit by the fact that the high end, half the cars there are being exported to other parts of world. Where in China and the U.S. where the economies are picking up again, we didn\u2019t see too much inventory.","I think inventory in auto chain, value chain or supply chain is in good shape. We did see some inventory corrections the last couple quarters in the industrial vehicle market. But now, we\u2019re starting to see that turn around. So I\u2019d say that\u2019s how I would summarize it.","Amit Daryanani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Got it. And so the expectation would be that that segment or that automotive in general should improve as you go forward through fiscal 2013, right, on a revenue basis?","Tom Lynch","Yes.","Amit Daryanani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","And then as a follow up, if we\u2019re just talking about the Industrial segment, can you just touch on the margin declines? You said it was fairly severe on a sequential and year-over-year basis. Maybe you could just talk about what happened there. And more importantly, the path to go back to 15% margin in that segment, is that going to be more revenue driven or do you think some of these cost takeout initiatives you have could help out that segment, especially in the back half of fiscal 2013? Thank you.","Tom Lynch","Okay. To answer the second part of your question first, it\u2019ll be both revenue and cost, which the cost piece is well underway. The drop-off, that\u2019s in high margin items. I mean that\u2019s a business that\u2019s over 50% through the channel into the industrial equipment portion of our Industrial Solution segment. So that tends to be very high margin.","But we are seeing signs that the channel\u2019s starting to replenish. We need to see a little more of that before we\u2019ll move from cautiously optimistic to bullish. But it has a, I guess you could use the word mix to describe it. It\u2019s just high margin business that dropped off.","And then coupled with the solar business that was twice the size it is today a year ago because of everything that went on with the shift to China and then the ultimate significant collapse of the business. But I\u2019m pretty confident of our ability to drive the margins back up to near company average or company goal over the next four or five quarters.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Shawn Harrison with Longbow Research. Please go ahead.","Shawn Harrison \u2013 Longbow Research","Hi. I wanted to focus in on, I guess, the cost profile, both the savings generated this quarter from raw materials and efficiency gains and kind of what you have left there. And then also, the accelerated restructuring program at $225 million this year, what does that mean for restructuring savings for fiscal 2013?","Tom Lynch","Shawn, I guess the second question, the $225 million restructuring, we begin to get a little bit at the end of the year. But most of this doesn\u2019t start to hit until next year, given the nature of plant realignment and shut down and things like that. So for example, we\u2019ve announced about half of them already, which is where we spent the $100 million.","Now, once you announce, we need to move equipment, transition it to the receiving plant. Then that will typically take some time of the year. So as we said last quarter, we didn\u2019t really expect to see too much benefit, maybe a little. I mean, we\u2019re pushing and accelerating very hard and maybe get a little bit at the very tail end of the year.","Bob Hau","Shawn, the other aspect, you heard Tom say the restructuring charge for fiscal 2013 prior guidance was $200 million, now $225 million. So not only are we accelerating the actions we had already kind of laid out, but there\u2019s a slight increase in the restructuring charge and the actions we\u2019re taking.","That will translate into about $85 million worth of annual savings. We had previously said we\u2019d see $75 million of annual savings as we exited 2014, so full year benefit in 2015. That $75 million is now $85 million. So there\u2019s a higher return from the increased spending.","Shawn Harrison \u2013 Longbow Research","In the raw material savings you saw this quarter, I mean, do you think you\u2019ve eked out as much as you can from that or will you see more benefits as the year goes?","Tom Lynch","I think we\u2019ll see more benefit. That was a nice contribution to our gross margin. It\u2019s a program that\u2019s been \u2013 we call the war on material. It\u2019s been driven hard for several years here and it includes everything from upgrading the capabilities of the organization to how we design products to faster localizing of material sources.","And over the last couple of quarters, all that have heavy lifting really started to come into fruition. So I would expect to continue to see this level of productivity through the balance of the year. And it\u2019s one of the reasons why we\u2019re optimistic about the ability to improve margins over the balance of the year.","Shawn Harrison \u2013 Longbow Research","And then just as a follow up, Network Solutions, taking maybe a little more bearish view. If I exclude the Subsea business coming back in the second half and the broadband project, what gives you confidence that the business bounces back over the next 12 months to 18 months? I know you\u2019re taking more restructuring charges, but I just didn\u2019t get a good sense today that you have maybe a lot of confidence in that bouncing back.","Tom Lynch","I thought we\u2019d have more confidence by now. But it\u2019s not quite where I\u2019d like to be to your point, Shawn. We\u2019re seeing signs. You need to go around the world. So in the emerging markets, there\u2019s still double-digit growth. Pockets of growth in Europe. I think the U.S. finally had a little bit of growth in the first quarter in our revenue, which says that some of the investment is moving back into the wireline.","Really, a lot of spending has been around expanding capacity on existing towers and then just deploying LTE, of which we don\u2019t participate that much in our Network business. I think the next phase, which we thought would happen a little faster, I think is taking a little longer, which is pushing small base stations out and further near the home or the office because they\u2019re not going to be building that many more towers.","And those base stations, there\u2019s going to be a lot of fiber connectivity to that. And then, we believe \u2013 you see what some of the carriers around the world are doing. They\u2019re upping the bandwidth. They\u2019re providing to the home and it is a way to raise the price. So, we haven\u2019t changed our view on the underlying thesis of this business, which is you got to have the bandwidth.","And over time, that fiber is going to continue to get closer to home. But it has taken longer than we thought. So, we think a little bit of an uptick by late this year, but we\u2019re not counting on anything. Not about, I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s about. It\u2019s just sort of a gradual pickup. That\u2019s our current projection.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Sherri Scribner \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Hi. Thank you. I don\u2019t know if I missed it. But did you give the number of orders this quarter?","Bob Hau","I think we did.","Tom Lynch","We said that our book-to-bill was 1.02 for the quarter excluding SubCom.","Sherri Scribner \u2013 Deutsche Bank","But you didn\u2019t...","Bob Hau","And $3.1 billion.","Sherri Scribner \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. And then just looking at the order rates, it seems like everything is improving with the exception of networking. Just wanted to get a sense of where you seeing improvements throughout the quarter and do you think you\u2019ll see consistent improvements in orders as we move through the year in all the segments? Maybe a little more detail on the segment areas. Thanks.","Tom Lynch","Yes. That is our current view that starting with Transportation, I mean, not big increases, because it\u2019s running pretty strong right now, but a pickup. I think the industry is forecasting 1 million more cars queued first half, second half. So that\u2019s a little lift in the business first half and second half. We are seeing signs talking to our big OEM customers in the Industrial business and the distributors.","We\u2019re seeing orders for distribution pickup. But I think once everybody got through sort of the first wave of January uncertainty in D.C., we did see orders pickup. So four out of our last six weeks, you take the two holiday weeks out, orders had a lot of \u2013 were pretty robust, which was more than in prior years at that time of the year because it\u2019s going to be a pretty soft time. And often at times, it\u2019s very hard to call.","So then you go into the Consumer business. We definitely have nice momentum albeit we\u2019re still small in tablets and smartphones. But we have more designs than we did last year at this time. We\u2019re executing them well. So those orders are picking up. PC is going down, but I would expect Consumer business will gradually ramp. The second half should be higher than the first half that we have some significant new products we\u2019re launching there.","The balance of industrial energy expected to be steady. It\u2019s been a little slow particularly in Europe, but staring to see signs that that\u2019s loosening up a little bit. And that\u2019s a very seasonal business. So as we go into \u2013 coming out of the second quarter and go into third quarter, our Telecom and Energy businesses pick up because they\u2019re outside businesses. So there is a typical kick to that.","So there\u2019s nothing that\u2019s probably the biggest jump from first half to second half at SubCom. We have all the awards. It\u2019s just those awards working through the funding. And of course, that\u2019s the business where we can jump the most. So I think it\u2019s pretty balanced. With Networks showing the lowest growth, I think we\u2019re not bearish, but we\u2019re conservative, I hope.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Steven Fox with Cross Research. Please go ahead.","Steven Fox \u2013 Cross Research","Thank you. Good morning. Two questions. First of all on the Consumer segment. I believe you just did 9% margins in that segment, which is a nice recovery. Tom, given all the product shifts that you mentioned for the next few quarters, what does that imply for the Consumer margins going forward and where could they go, maybe longer term? And then secondly, you mentioned one-third of the second half recovery would be around new products. I was wondering if we could get some key examples of what you\u2019re referring to there. Thanks.","Tom Lynch","Sure. We would expect Consumer had a nice pickup from, of course nowhere to go but up you could say, from this time last year to 9%. And really, well-run to get there launching new products and we mentioned before new team. Our expectation is to pick up another point or two in the operating margin through the year. So the target is at the end of the year in double-digits in this business.","We believe when we model it \u2013 and it is in many ways the hardest to predict business because the cycles are the shortest. We do have a nice infrastructure in Asia to support this business. So it\u2019s low cost infrastructure. Most of our leadership team is there. So we\u2019re on the ground close to the customer.","We believe this can be low double-digits, nice return on capital, nice earnings growth model. We would expect this business to grow, core organic growth to be higher than the other businesses, part of that because of the share and part of it the nature of the growth of smartphones and tablets, et cetera. So I\u2019d say the important thing for us in this business is to get double-digit margin by the end of the year.","Steven Fox \u2013 Cross Research","And then just on the new products?","Tom Lynch","The second part of your question was new products?","Steven Fox \u2013 Cross Research","Yes, just sort of examples of what you were referring to in terms of helping the second half?","Tom Lynch","You can imagine we can\u2019t get into too much. But look, we\u2019re really focused on miniaturization in the connector space. So high speed, really high speed, high performing, high reliable cables and then flexible antennas, so that they\u2019re design friendly for the device designer.","So those are the three big things and we have new products coming in all those. We\u2019ve launched some new products in the first half as well. But we have another round of that coming in the second half that has some potentially higher revenue associated with it if we execute and the demand for the end products are there.","Steven Fox \u2013 Cross Research","Great, that\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.","Tom Lynch","Sure.","Operator","We do have a question from the line of Amitabh Passi with UBS. Please go ahead.","Amitabh Passi \u2013 UBS","Hi. Thank you. Bob, just a clarification. It looks like the implied EPS for the back half of the year is about $0.90 a quarter versus the $0.65 and $0.70 in the first half. You may have touched on this. Just curious how do you see that ramp in the back half and that seems like implied operating margins would be almost kind of in the mid 30%s?","Bob Hau","See, you\u2019re correct, about $0.90 per quarter in the back half. And that\u2019s really driven by a combination of the seasonal growth that we typically see an outsized portion of our earnings in the second half of the year, given the sales growth that we see driven by seasonality plus the new products that Tom talked about.","The other benefit we have is in our cost reduction programs whether it\u2019s our Lean efforts with the TEOA, TE Operating Advantage, our war on material that we talked about earlier in getting both raw and component, material costs down on a year-over-year basis. We continue to accelerate that. And of course, the accelerated restructuring as well as a slight increase in restructuring all benefit us as we enter the second half of the year.","Amitabh Passi \u2013 UBS","Got it. And then just a follow up for you Tom, you touched on Network Solutions. You talked about the potential small cell opportunity. We\u2019ve also heard some updates from AT&T, Deutsche Telekom. Just wondering, what kind of visibility do you have into any sort of potential bills with these two large operators? And any sense of timing? Do you think they\u2019re more a 2014 type event? Do you think you could see some benefit this year? Just some thoughts around at least some of the more publicly announced updates from some of the larger carriers.","Tom Lynch","Well, there\u2019s been definitely big announcements of total amounts of spending. And then you got at the doubles in the details where it\u2019s going to be spent.","Amitabh Passi \u2013 UBS","Correct.","Tom Lynch","I think for us, we would expect a slight increase in spending in the U.S. in our section of the network. And probably a little more than that in Germany, but it is a carrier by carrier. We really have to go carrier by carrier. I\u2019d say in the greenfield, building fiber quickly.","In the U.S., it went through a significant investment in the sort of three to five years ago, pushing for the traditional telcos, pushing fiber and video on that fiber close to the home or to the home depending on the operator and then a lull there. But now, we see the pickup. And the carriers in the U.S. are talking about significantly increasing speeds. I think that\u2019s the best news for us because that puts the pressure on everybody else.","And as you get to 200 megabits, 300 megabits, that people are talking about and even in some of these experimental systems, they\u2019re being built at a gigabit, you really got to bring fiber right to the home. So I mean, we\u2019re very bullish. We\u2019ve been off on the timing. We\u2019re adjusting the cost structure accordingly, but we continue to be bullish on that.","It only takes a couple of these operators to really drive it deep because then they begin to deliver quite a different experience for the consumer. And it enabled a lot different experience. And so, that typically, based on my history in the cable industry, that typically will lead to everybody getting more aggressive. But all of our customer have to figure out their business model. And I think...","Amitabh Passi \u2013 UBS","Are there any regulatory hurdles that you think need to be cleared, both in Germany and the U.S., for deployments to accelerate?","Tom Lynch","I don\u2019t think anything significant now, not that I\u2019m aware of.","Amitabh Passi \u2013 UBS","Okay. Thank you.","Tom Lynch","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Matt Sheerin with Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead.","Matt Sheerin \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Yes, thanks. Good morning. Just a question regarding the accelerated restructuring program, could you be more specific about the areas? I know you talked about Networking, Industrial, Consumer. Could you parse that out? And on the Networking business, is that where you taking the biggest cut? Because with the pressed revenue, even ex-Subsea, trying to figure out what revenue run rate you need to get to get back to double-digit operating margin?","Tom Lynch","As we laid out last time, Matt, it hasn\u2019t changed that much. We just found more. Let\u2019s say that\u2019s really the \u2013 we\u2019re digging for every opportunity. And three more months went by and we identified another $25 million investment with a pretty good payback. And it\u2019s going to be primarily in the Networks and Consumer.","I think it\u2019s fine-tuning in Industrial. There\u2019s some difficult work there to get the footprint in order and rebalance. But fundamentally, those businesses are pretty healthy. And we\u2019re pretty confident as the revenue comes back, we have significant operating leverage. But when you look at the margin levels of Consumer and Network, we needed to take a lot of cost out. And we found it and we think we can do it without really mortgaging the upside of revenue.","So I think we\u2019ll run in, I believe, around 3.4% annual somewhere for that segment. We probably need to get, let\u2019s say, into the \u2013 3.2% rather. We\u2019re running about 3.2%. We probably need to get to 3.4%, 3.5% to get to the double-digit. I would expect at 3.6%, we should be somewhere in the 12% to 13% range.","There\u2019s a lot of leverage in the \u2013 it\u2019s high gross margin business in Network. And it\u2019ll be higher with the costs we\u2019re taking out and the synergies that we continue to extract across all the businesses. And one of the reasons we put those four businesses together because they all basically are in the same industry and in many cases touching the same customers. So the goal was to become much more efficient than they were grouped in other segments.","Matt Sheerin \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Got it. And on the use of cash, you talked about the dividend and buybacks, not much mentioned on acquisitions. I know in the last couple of quarters, you\u2019ve talked about doing niche sort of tuck-in deals, nothing really big. Is that still part of the strategy and any specific areas where you\u2019re looking to fill voids?","Tom Lynch","We really haven\u2019t changed our strategy. If you could find the right opportunity at the right price, we would like to be bigger in energy and industrial. They\u2019re really good businesses. They play to our strength, highly engineered, high quality, reliability, got to last the life of the piece of equipment. I mean that\u2019s what we do best.","So we have a number of opportunities that we\u2019re looking at. But there\u2019s nothing really even warm, I would say. And also to ourselves, we want to make sure we fully capitalize on Deutsch. I feel very good about the integration on that. So we\u2019re careful. Let\u2019s get that under our belt and running well before we would do anything else. I mean, we\u2019re looking and knocking though.","Matt Sheerin \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Jim Suva with Citi. Please go ahead.","Jim Suva \u2013 Citi","Thank you very much and congratulations to you and your team there at TE Connectivity. I have two questions. The first one is on the Networking. Can you talk to us a little bit more about your confidence in that? Like are there carriers giving you roadmaps for the small base stations? Because it just seems like the whole LTE upgrade cycle so far, you guys are not positioned to capture that.","So are you actually getting firm orders from that or is that hypothetical which you foresee happening? It just seems like this segment continues to disappoint. And so, I\u2019m just trying to get the disconnect about why it\u2019s not coming to fruition.","Tom Lynch","I wouldn\u2019t use the work hypothetical, Jim. But I would say it\u2019s still at the architecture stage. And so there isn\u2019t really much. What\u2019s being deployed that\u2019s called small base stations today are these digital antenna systems. But that\u2019s not really what the carriers and the equipment providers are really thinking when they say small base stations. So, small base stations are on the drawing board, in test pilots in the field. But it\u2019s not being deployed, I would say, yet.","Jim Suva \u2013 Citi","And what\u2019s typical timeline for deployment of that?","Tom Lynch","Well, I think when it starts, it\u2019s going to be a long drawn out deployment because you\u2019re talking about really taking these base stations almost like cable amplifiers today. Now, you see, for every so many houses you have a green or brown box that has a cable amplifier in it. I mean that\u2019s almost what a small base station is. It\u2019s getting something to repower the \u2013 boost the signal close to your house.","Today, the only thing you really have are the towers. And they\u2019re running out of capacity with all the data that\u2019s going through them. And as you know that it\u2019s not very easy to get a new tower built. But I would expect it to be a long deployment as small base stations get rolled out. I mean, as I said, what we\u2019re selling right now and we\u2019re seeing a little pickup is more the traditional backhaul, more up the \u2013 there\u2019s more fiber going up.","The current towers and antennas, they\u2019re switching off slowly from coax. So, there\u2019s changes in the network that way that we\u2019re benefiting from. But I mean, the big one for us is when fiber to the home continues to pick up. And it is in different pockets around the world. It\u2019s just not broadly deployed and small base stations get deployed. That\u2019s when we would expect to see a nice pop in our demand.","Jim Suva \u2013 Citi","Great. And then my follow-up question is on the operating margin. I believe you had kind of a goal of 15% and there were certain revenue metrics of when you thought you\u2019d hit that as well as the timeline of hitting that 15%. Can you just refresh my memory on that?","Tom Lynch","Sure, Jim. I think right now, we feel in the $15 billion revenue range down a little bit from what we\u2019ve said. That part of the goal or the restructuring to accelerate that. And if we can do it faster, we will without upsetting the apple cart. But think about it as 15% in the $15 billion range. Six months ago, we were talking about $15 billion to $16 billion range. So we\u2019re pulling that in.","Jim Suva \u2013 Citi","And then the timeline?","Tom Lynch","Well, if you to take our forecast, let\u2019s say, it would probably be sometime late next year you\u2019d start getting at a $15-million run rate.","Jim Suva \u2013 Citi","Thank you and congratulations to you and your team at TE Connectivity.","Tom Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","We do have a question from line Anthony Kure with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Anthony Kure \u2013 KeyBanc","Thanks. Good morning, guys. Just a couple of quick questions. First, on the book-to-bill as it relates to the different segments specifically on the Consumer side. Can you just speak to \u2013 given the shorter cycle nature of Consumer products, does the first quarter book-to-bill reflect second quarter revenue only or is the order book here have a long review than the shorter cycle nature of Consumer products?","Tom Lynch","I would say, Anthony, generally it would reflect \u2013 it\u2019s a good indicator of the quarter to come. We did see in Q1. And part of the reason we were a little down on sales because with this kind of book-to-bill, we would have expected to be in the sales range for Q1. So, what we did see was a little more scheduling out of orders.","And it was almost a phenomenon of, look, I want to get in line. The customer is saying I want to get in line for the order, but I don\u2019t really necessarily want to take it in early January depending \u2013 could something, the fiscal cliff, et cetera. I think just that extra uncertainty and so trying to protect themselves. So that would explain to me a little bit of the book-to-bill.","So the encouraging thing is in January, we\u2019ve seen the book-to-bill get even stronger. So I think if it would\u2019ve turned down, that would have said that would just a pushing out of orders. We\u2019re really at a different order rate and we\u2019re not seeing that much for the second quarter. So Consumer itself, I would say, generally is indicative of the next quarter generally.","Anthony Kure \u2013 KeyBanc","Okay. So it doesn\u2019t reflect then the new products that are coming online in the second half?","Tom Lynch","Only the new \u2013 yes, not the new products in the second half, no. There\u2019s no orders in for that.","Anthony Kure \u2013 KeyBanc","Okay. And then my follow-up is just on a little bit more on the Consumer. You mentioned obviously the puts and takes within the business itself, PC being weaker. Can you just remind us what the weighting is PC versus smartphone and tablets for that business?","Tom Lynch","Bob, take that out real quick here.","Bob Hau","PC is about 35% of the business. Mobile and tablet is about 45%. And then the remainder would be business equipment, those types of things.","Tom Lynch","And in business equipment, it\u2019s everything from cameras to copiers to Nintendo and things like that.","Bob Hau","And those will be the percentages for the Consumer Devices business within the Consumer Solutions segment.","Anthony Kure \u2013 KeyBanc","Okay, great. Thank you.","Bob Hau","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","We do have a question from the line of Mike Wood with Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Mike Wood \u2013 Macquarie","Hi. Good morning.","Tom Lynch","Good morning.","Mike Wood \u2013 Macquarie","The outperformance to global vehicle production that you\u2019re expecting for 2013, can you provide some color on your visibility to that and the main drivers whether it\u2019s luxury vehicle outperformance or content growth?","Tom Lynch","I\u2019ll make sure I understand your question, Mike. Our outperformance of the vehicles, you mean us growing faster than...","Mike Wood \u2013 Macquarie","Global auto production, correct?","Tom Lynch","Yes. Well, I think there\u2019s a couple of things there. There is the electronic content. So if production is growing 1% or 2%, you\u2019re going to have anywhere depending on the mix of cars in the world anywhere from 3% to 5% of content. Then you\u2019re going to have a couple percent of price erosion. And it is different region by region. So if production is going up, you would expect our revenue to go up a little more than the production numbers.","And then I think we have had a strong performance, continuing to gain share in places like China and the U.S. where we really invested in both places in the downturn. And because of the fragile nature, a lot of supply chains at those times we\u2019re able to garner a little more business. So that\u2019s why we\u2019ve been tracking \u2013 those three things have been why we\u2019re tracking slightly ahead.","Mike Wood \u2013 Macquarie","Okay. And does the $125 million SubCom quarterly sales pace that you\u2019re expecting in the second half, is that more of a chunky drawdown of some of this shadow pipeline or is that more of a sustainable pace that we should expect heading into your next fiscal year?","Tom Lynch","Right now, we would say that\u2019s more of a sustainable pace. In the past when we\u2019ve seen this kind of pipeline, it\u2019s usually a signal that we\u2019re going back into an up-cycle. But we need to see that start to happen. So I think that some of these projects break loose in the next two quarters.","That\u2019s going to tell us a lot that this cycle really is starting to recover or is it going to stay on the bottom. I think we have enough signs that we\u2019re starting to see recovery. And then what will the slope be. Will we go back into another boom or will we go into a more steady build cycle? And that\u2019s really the call.","Mike Wood \u2013 Macquarie","Got it. Thank you.","Tom Lynch","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","And we do have no further questions in queue at this time. Please continue.","Keith Kolstrom","Thanks everybody. We appreciate the questions as always and have a good week.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I'd now like to turn the conference over to our host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Sujal Shah. Please go ahead, sir.","Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Good morning, and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss TE Connectivity's second quarter 2018 results. With me today are Chief Executive Officer, Terrence Curtin; and Chief Financial Officer, Heath Mitts. During this call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information, and we ask you to review the forward-looking cautionary statements included in today's press release.","In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussion this morning. We ask you to review the sections of our press release and the accompanying slide presentation that address the use of these items. The press release and related tables, along with the slide presentation, can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at te.com.","Finally, due to the increasing number of participants on the Q&A portion of today's call, we're asking everyone to limit themselves to one question to make sure we can give everyone an opportunity to ask questions during the allotted time. We're happy to take follow-up questions, but ask that you rejoin the queue and ask second question.","Now, let me turn the call over to Terrence, for opening comments.","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Thank you, Sujal, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today to cover our second quarter results. Before I get into the earnings slides that we posted, I'd like to briefly recap our performance and our guidance against the elements of our business model that we shared at our Investor Day this past December. Our Q1 results in the quarter and our guidance demonstrate both our execution of our business model as well as the trends to drive above-market growth.","On the top line, we delivered 7% organic growth in the second quarter and are raising the midpoint of our full-year organic revenue guidance to 6%. And this is at the upper end of our 4% to 6% long-term organic growth target. Our revenue growth continues to be driven by the secular trends, enabling TE to consistently outgrow the markets that we serve. Also in the middle of the P&L, we're executing on the levers to drive operating margin expansion.","Our SG&A expenses were down year-over-year as a percentage of sales, and we do expect that trend to continue for the full year. On the bottom-line, we expanded adjusted earnings per share by 19% and we're raising the midpoint of our full-year EPS guidance to reflect 15% growth. This is also in line with the annual double-digit earnings growth target in our business model. We also continue to maintain a balanced capital strategy through share buybacks, dividends; and a disciplined approach on acquisitions. At the same time, we continue to focus on our top priority which is to invest in the organic growth of our businesses, while maintaining ROIC levels in the mid-teens.","Now if you can please turn to the slides. I'll start with slide 3, and I'm going to review the highlights from the second quarter. We delivered performance above our guidance with double-digit growth in revenues and adjusted earnings per share. Sales were $3.7 billion representing 16% reported growth and 7% organic growth year-over-year. In Transportation, we grew 10% organically with growth in each of our three businesses and across all regions.","Industrial Solutions grew 6% organically, driven primarily by industrial equipment, commercial aerospace and defense. Our Communications segment grew 1% organically, with 10% combined organic growth in data and devices and appliances, more than offsetting expected declines in our SubCom business.","In the second quarter, we delivered 17% adjusted operating margins with strong margin expansion of 80 basis points in Transportation and 100 basis points in the Industrial segment. Our adjusted EPS grew a very strong 19% to $1.42 per share, another quarterly record for our company. Based upon the continued momentum across our businesses as well as the positive effects in currency exchange rate, we are raising our full year sales and adjusted earnings per share guidance.","Organic growth expectations are being raised from 5% to 6% for the year, reflecting the second quarter strength and some additional organic growth in the second half versus our prior year. We are raising our outlook for reported sales from 8% to 11%, reflecting the increase of the 100 basis points of increase in organic growth and the balance from the effects of currency translation.","Adjusted earnings per share expectations were raising from $5.45 at the midpoint to $5.55 at the midpoint, which will be 15% growth year-over-year. And when I think about putting this year's progress in perspective, our original fiscal 2018 guidance provided in November assumes 4% organic growth and $5.23 of adjusted EPS. And the increase we are announcing today reflects operational execution, as we move through the year.","So if you could, please turn to slide 4, and I'll cover our order trends that we're seeing in detail. As you can see from the slide, we continue to see broad-based strength in orders across our three segments and this reinforces the growth outlook that we're announcing today. Total orders excluding SubCom exceeded $3.6 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.03. Orders were up 16% year-over-year on a reported basis and up 6% organically. Geographically, excluding SubCom, our organic orders growth was driven by strength in Europe and the Americas, with 6% and 14% growth, respectively.","Turning to orders by segment. In Transportation, orders increased 7% organically with growth in all businesses and strength in Europe and the Americas. Industrial orders grew 5% organically year-over-year, with growth across all regions and strength in our aerospace, defense and industrial equipment businesses. In Communications, excluding SubCom, we saw year-over-year organic order growth of 6% with growth across all regions and businesses.","In our SubCom business, we continued to see an elongated cycle as we booked over $200 million of orders for new projects in the second quarter. And this brings our year-to-date bookings over $600 million and total backlog above $1 billion.","So, let me get into the segment results and we'll start on slide 5 with Transportation. Transportation sales grew 10% organically year-over-year with strong growth in each of our three businesses. Adjusted operating margins were 20% as we expected, up 80 basis points year-over-year. Our auto sales were up 7% organically. In the second quarter, global auto production was essentially flat, which was weaker than we anticipated due to the reported production declines that occurred in Korea.","Our strong growth above the market in the quarter continues to illustrate the positive impact of content growth in our auto business, along with the benefits of our global leadership position. We had a 11% organic growth in auto, both in Europe and in the Americas, where we're benefiting from new product cycle launches as well as share gains. We saw a low-single-digit organic growth in Asia. In China, our organic growth was 9% in the quarter, reflecting our continued strength and leadership in this market and this was partially offset by the softness in Korea that I just mentioned.","Our performance continues to reflect content growth from secular trends in the auto market, and we expect the benefit as the adoption of increases for connected cars as well as electric vehicles increase. TE is extremely well positioned with leading-edge solutions and wins across all global OEMs. In our commercial transportation business, we continue to outperform the market with organic revenue growth of 24% year-over-year, with balanced growth across all regions and strong growth within each submarket. We continue to see momentum in heavy trucks as well as growth in the agriculture, mining and construction markets.","In sensors, our business grew 8% organically year-over-year, with growth across auto, commercial transportation and industrial applications. This growth is driven by the design wins we've been discussing with you over the past two years and we continue to see strong design win momentum, particularly in auto applications. Since the beginning of 2016, we've generated over $1.5 billion of new auto design wins which include $300 million this year alone across a large spectrum of auto sensor applications.","So let me turn to Industrial Solutions, so if you could please turn to slide 6 please. The segment sales grew 14% on a reported basis and 6% organically. Adjusted operating margins were 13.9% and expanded 100 basis points year-over-year from operating leverage on higher revenue. As we discussed at our recent Investor Day, we're on a multi-year journey to reduce our factory footprint and lower expenses to expand operating margins in the high teens in this segment.","So, please let me highlight some performance by business in this segment. In industrial equipment, organic growth was 9% with growth across all regions and strength in factory automation. Our strong position in high-growth applications such as robotics and turbo drives coupled with the acquisitions in these areas, are driving strong growth ahead of our market.","In our aerospace, defense and marine business, we saw 5% organic growth driven by both commercial aerospace and defense. We also saw double-digit growth in commercial air orders, positioning us for growth in this business going forward. And lastly, our energy business declined slightly on an organic basis, driven primarily by weakness in Europe and partially offset by strength in the Americas.","So if you could please turn to slide 7 and let me cover Communications. As I said earlier, the segment grew 1% organically which was in line with our expectations. Our data and devices, and appliance businesses had very strong growth in the quarter with above-company average organic growth of 10% on a combined basis.","Data and devices grew 7% organically with growth across all regions driven by high-speed connectivity in data center applications, as we continue to benefit from our position with hyper-scale customers. Appliances continued its strong performance with 14% organic growth and double-digit growth in all regions. We continue to benefit from secular trends including safety, efficiency and miniaturization, as well as our leading global position driving share gains.","Adjusted segment operating margins were 11.3% in the quarter. And as we discussed last quarter, we expect the segment to continue to run below our expected mid-teens operating margin due to the delayed SubCom program ramp and the project accounting nature of this business.","So with that, let me turn it over to Heath, who'll get into the financials in more detail.","Heath Mitts - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Thank you, Terrence, and good morning everyone. Please turn to slide 8, where I will provide more details on the Q2 financials. Adjusted operating income was $635 million with an adjusted operating margin of 17%, leveraging the strong organic growth of 7%. GAAP operating income was $624 million and included $6 million of restructuring and other charges and $5 million of acquisition charges.","For the full year, I continue to expect restructuring charges of approximately $150 million, driven primarily by activity in our Industrial Solutions segment, as we optimize the footprint and make structural improvements in SG&A across the company.","Adjusted EPS was $1.42, up a very strong 19% year-over-year, driven by sales growth as well as the benefit from currency translation. GAAP EPS was $1.39 for the quarter and included restructuring and other charges of $0.02 and acquisition-related charges of $0.01. The adjusted effective tax rate in Q2 was 17.7%. We still expect the full year adjusted tax rate at the lower end of the 19% to 20% range, consistent with our expectations last quarter.","However, the year-over-year impacts are more pronounced in the second half versus the first half. While the year-over-year impact of tax is only $0.01 in the first half of this fiscal year, we expect a more significant headwind of $0.07 in the second half due to the difference in the adjusted effective tax rates. Page 15 of our slide deck contains a bridge that provides these details.","Turning to slide 9. Adjusted gross margin in the quarter was 33.2% with the year-over-year decline driven primarily by the SubCom program delay that we discussed earlier. Despite the gross margin decline, adjusted operating margins expanded 20 basis points to 17% in the quarter. We reduced operating expenses by 130 basis points as a percentage of sales in the quarter, primarily driven by reductions in SG&A. Expense reduction is one of the levers we appoint to expand operating margins.","In the quarter, cash from operations was $377 million and free cash flow was $234 million. In the quarter, we returned $309 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We expect second half cash flow to accelerate significantly in line with typical seasonality, primarily due to working capital requirements.","Also, the pipeline organic growth opportunities continues to be very attractive use of our cash. We have modestly increased our capital investments to be approximately 6% of sales this year to support these growth opportunities. As you know, organic growth has the highest return on investment for the company. We have included the balance sheet and cash flow summary in the Appendix for additional details.","And with that, I will now turn it back to Terrence.","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Thanks, Heath. Let me get into guidance, and I'll start with the third quarter on slide 10. For the third quarter, we expect revenue of $3.65 billion to $3.7 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $1.35 to $1.37. At the mid-point, this represents reported sales growth of 9% and organic sales growth of 5%, with adjusted earnings per share growth of 10%.","If you bridge between the 9% total growth and the 5% organic growth, we expect 300 basis points of that growth is driven by currency translation with M&A contributing the rest, which is about 100 basis points. On the dollars basis, year-over-year currency exchange rates are a tailwind of $120 million in the quarter and $0.05, and the tax rate is a headwind in the third quarter of $0.03 that Heath just talked about.","By segment, we expect Transportation Solutions to grow mid-teens on a reported basis, which includes the acquisition of Hirschmann, a leading provider of antenna technology and products that we acquired late in 2017. On an organic basis, we expect high-single-digit growth in Transportation. We expect auto to be up high-single digits organically with outperformance, once again, versus market due to content growth. We also expect continued strong growth in commercial transportation and sensors.","In Industrial Solutions, we expect to grow mid-single digits organically with growth driven by continued strength in industrial equipment as well as growth in commercial air and defense. And in Communications, we expect Communications to be down mid-single digits with continued above-market growth in both D&D and appliances, being more than offset by declines in SubCom. I do want to highlight, SubCom had a very strong quarter over last quarter three so some of it is due to the comp.","Now turn to slide 11, so I can cover the full year guidance for 2018. We expect full year revenue of $14.5 billion or $14.7 billion, representing nearly $1.5 billion of increased revenue year-over-year. Let me break that down a little bit. The components of the $1.5 billion of our growth is: $800 million of organic growth, $200 million from M&A, as well as a $500 million benefit from currency translation. Versus our prior guidance, revenue is up $400 million at our mid-point and adjusted earnings per share is up $0.10 to $5.55.","At the mid-point, our guidance represents reported sales growth of 11% and organic sales growth of 6%. Adjusted earnings per share growth is expected to be 15% at the mid-point, driven by flow through in our sales growth as well as the benefit of currency translation. And similar to what Heath just mentioned, I do want to highlight that a higher year-over-year tax rate does negatively impact adjusted earnings per share by $0.08 for the year.","Let me provide some more color on the segments in the full year guidance. We expect Transportation Solutions to be up in the high-teens on a reported basis and up high-single digits organically on an assumption of approximately 2% global auto production growth. Our outperformance reflects continued content growth and share gains in auto. We also expect commercial transportation to continue outperformance end market and we expect continued growth in our sensors business.","Industrial Solutions is now expected to be up high-single-digits and organic growth of mid-single-digits is unchanged from our prior guide. The primary growth drivers that we're seeing for the year will be in the industrial equipment area as well as defense.","And in Communications, we expect to be down low-single-digits on both the reported and organic basis, with growth in data and devices and appliances being more than offset by declines in SubCom. We now expect SubCom revenue to be in the range of $700 million to $715 million due to the ripple effect of the program delay that we highlighted last quarter. We do expect high-single-digit growth combined for data and devices and appliances for the year.","In summary, I continue to feel very good about our performance and ability to drive results in line with the business model we shared with you in December. The 6% organic growth and strong double-digit earnings growth of 15% expected this year, we feel, demonstrates it. We have built a portfolio with clear competitive advantages and you're seeing the benefit of our leading positions and content driving growth above market that we play in.","We are well-positioned in large markets with favorable secular trends, and our updated guidance for 2018 indicates further growth above those markets and earnings per share expansion, driven by multiple levers. And, finally, I do want to thank our employees across the world for their execution in this past quarter, as well as their continued commitment to our customers and the future that is safer, sustainable, productive and more connective.","Now, let's open it up for questions, Sujal.","Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.","All right. Thanks, Brad. Could you give the instructions for Q&A session?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we'll go to the first line, and question will come from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.","Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes. Thanks. Just wanted to start with SubCom and you guys had talked about expected weakness there. But just from a visibility standpoint and accounting standpoint, when do you expect to see some improvement both in revenue and in margins in the SubCom piece?","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Hey, Craig. Thanks for the question. When you think of SubCom, we highlighted last quarter about the program ramp delay we have. We still feel we're an elongated cycle and I think we'll show that. At the company level \u2013 and I think you've seen in the Communications segment margins, if we didn't have the program ramp delay, the segment margin would probably be about 200 basis points higher and overall operating margin of the company would probably be about 50 basis points higher. So, that sort of firepower is what we're working through.","As we all know in SubCom, SubCom has anywhere from four to six projects going on and this is one of them. So, we do expect that this will be the program just due to how a project accounting will work through as the project completes, so we do expect that for the rest of the year. But the backlog makes us feel very good about the cycle and we just have to work through this one program issue. So, market feels good. Programs we're winning feels good. We just have on the margin side this pressure from this ramp delay and we're dealing with it.","Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks for the color on the margins, in particular. And then just on the automotive sensor side, in terms of some of those design wins, can you talk about when you've seen inflection in the revenue, like from a timing perspective when these wins will start to ramp?","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","As we all know, in automotive what's great about automotive is, as you win these they layer in, and we're starting to see that. As we said, later this year, we expect it to be growing double-digits and our automotive sensor piece, a part of our sensors business. We are still committed to that. You're going to continue to see strong growth as these design wins come into revenue.","So, I think it's really creating a good backbone. I think you're seeing broad growth in the sensors business. And I feel very good that our automotive sensors business, actually in the quarter, grew higher than our automotive connector business, which is a real for us. So, I think those indicators that we've put out there for you, starting second half, growing double-digit we feel very good about and then we'll continue to layer in over time, and get some return on the investments we will make.","Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.","All right. Thank you, Craig. Can we have the next question, please?","Operator","It will come from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.","Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes. Thank you. Good morning. So Terrence, when you net everything out there is an implied $0.05 \u2013 is a $0.10 increase in your guide for the full year, but a $0.05 lower operational performance relative to prior expectations. Can you clarify how much of this is the SubCom shortfall? And is your view on SubCom doesn't sound like it's really changed longer-term, given the strong backlog, but just wanted to get some color on that.","And Heath, could you comment on the weaker gross margins and free cash flow, if you could bridge those on a year-on-year basis? Should we expect a substantial jump-up in the second half, both half-over-half and year-over-year? Thank you.","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Hey, Wamsi. I'm going to take \u2013 I'll add on to what I said to Craig about SubCom. I'm going to ask Heath to talk about the EPS comment as well as conversion of free cash flow. So when you look at the order momentum, it's the trends we talk about and the $1 billion of backlog that we had and the $600 million we book. So long-term trends, I do not see. It's really around the backbone really that supports the video demand that continues to get pulled. And certainly, our customers are \u2013 the hyper-scalers feel good about the momentum there. And then, Heath, why don't you take the second piece?","Heath Mitts - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Yes. Wamsi, the year-over-year decline in gross margin is primarily due to SubCom, and some of the pressures that we're working through relative to that project. As you know, in the project accounting world, it's not a one period impact, it spreads through the entire timeframe of the overall project which will take us into the early part of 2019. Having said that, we would expect to start to see some improvement in the overall margins both at that segment level as well as at SubCom itself, as we work our way through that into the early parts of next year.","On the cash flow side, cash flows in the year were \u2013 year-to-date about $400 million in \u2013 a little over $300 million in cash. I would tell you that we have built up some inventory to support the growth in the second half of the year, and we would expect that working capital would move from a use of cash to a source of cash, as we move our way through the second half of the year. We've got a pretty good line of sight to that.","Operator","And we'll go to next question which comes from David Leiker with Baird. Please go ahead.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Hi, David.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","On the Transportation business, you clearly have a lot of secular trends there that \u2013 you have these tailwinds for your business there in terms of driving bookings. I mean, if we look at the business that you're seeing coming in right now for new contract awards, are there any particular things there you call out that show either higher take rates or increased technology, different technologies that are coming to market? Anything in particular that seems to be gaining more strength relative to \u2013 over the last year or two?","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","David, great question. And what I would say is, you really see every OEM really focused on anything connected as well as the powertrain on the electric side. So I would say, those trends are not new. I would say, there continues to be an acceleration on the powertrain side. I would say, that side is one that we continue to see increased demand.","Now, as you know, what we win today doesn't turn into revenue for four years. But I would tell you, our TERP or our revenue pipeline that we had that I quoted in sensors, we continue to see increased TERP momentum built around connected and electric powertrains, whatever piece it is, whether it's plug-in, whether it's hybrid.","So, those are things we continue to see in all regions of the world. And when you think about where we're positioned, we feel very good that we get the benefit of both of those. So I wouldn't say, it's not something significantly different; we'll just continue to see that strong acceleration across both of them.","Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Okay. Thank you, David. Can we have the next question, please?","Operator","Sure. That will come from Shawn Harrison with Longbow Research. Please go ahead.","Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC","Hi. I'm going to beat the SubCom issue to death if I can. If we look into 2019, is there an expectation that you would see kind of a rebound into the $800 million to $900 million of annual revenue range? Or is it more trending toward kind of this lower level for the next 18 months?","Heath Mitts - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Shawn, I think we're \u2013 well, first of all, for 2019 it's too early to tell as the project stack result is up. The backlog is good and our visibility out is good. I don't want to quantify that. I think staying in that range that we talked about at our Analyst Day in December which was $600 million to $1 billion, we're comfortably inside that range.","Certainly, this year we'll be somewhere between $700 million to $750 million. I think as important that we're going to see margin momentum as we go into next year, as we win ourselves off of this particular project \u2013 the single project delay. So, I'm going to cite that part of your question in terms of quantifying it, but I would say that the backlog is setting up nicely.","Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Okay.","Operator","Our next question will come from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks a lot, guys. I guess, maybe to start with Industrial segment. Could you just maybe help me understand how much cost are you taking out of the model right now from all these cost containment initiatives? And should revenues remain stable to where they are today? What could fiscal 2019 margins look like on the Industrial? So I just want to get a sense of what the cost containment benefits would be?","And then secondly, just on the Subsea thing, I understand all the issues you guys are outlining right now, but these are all the same issues. It sounds like you knew about 90 days ago when you initially talked about this push out. So, what really changed in the last 90 days for margins to take a hiccup and for you to lower your full year revenue expectation from Subsea?","Heath Mitts - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Go ahead.","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Yeah. So let me take the second part now and I'll let Heath do the Industrial. Number one is, it's just slightly less than where we were on SubCom. And it really relates to the program delay we knew about, but it is creating some ripple effect because realize we have one factory, one engineering team and that's creating a bump effect on other projects and we're working through that. So when you look at it, revenues down slightly and margins down slightly due to that revenue. So, that's really all that's changed.","And then on the Industrial segment, Health, go ahead.","Heath Mitts - TE Connectivity Ltd.","We're still \u2013 we've talked pretty openly about the footprint consolidation activity that is taking place in our Industrial business. We are still the programmatic element of that, some of the bigger moves. We are still in fairly early days of that. As we talked about last couple of quarters, that's something that's going to transpire over the next several quarters, over the next couple of years. So, I would tell you that the margin improvement that you're seeing is both good operational execution by the team, some moderate restructuring as well as good leverage on the organic revenue growth.","If you think about 2019 \u2013 we're getting a lot of 2019 questions today already with two quarters left in our 2018 fiscal year. But I would tell you that whatever organic revenue growth that you want to model for Industrial using a normalized flow through of 25% to 30%, I think is probably a good modeling. And we'll have more clarity as we progress through the end of the year, how much of the impact of the restructuring the larger projects that will layer into next year, both on the cost side as well as the savings side.","Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.","All right. Thank you, Amit. Can we have the next question, please?","Operator","Sure. That will come from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yes. Good morning and thanks very much for taking the question. I was hoping if you could help better contextualize the revenue guidance for the June quarter on a sequential basis. Certainly, we appreciate the much higher base in March, and you mentioned some Subsea issues. But even putting Subsea aside, it seems like the low seasonal sequential guidance for June. So, is it just conservatism or are there any markets we're expecting deceleration in June on a quarter-to-quarter basis?","Heath Mitts - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Yeah. This is Heath. We're expecting the second half of the year to be about 3% organically higher than the first half of the year. How it calendarizes between our third and our fourth quarter is, there's always puts and takes in terms of what activity is going on. But in terms of where our orders stacked up towards the end of our second quarter, as we lean into the third quarter \u2013 our 5% organic growth guidance, we feel pretty good about that number. And we'll update you in 90 days in terms of where we ended up.","Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Okay. Thank you, Mark. Can we have the next question, please?","Operator","Sure. It will come from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. So for the current year, Transportation group got a great test case to really see the content growth and the outperformance versus the cycle. At Industrial, it's a less clear test case because it's a good industrial cycle there. But just wondering if you could speak to the kind of long-term qualitative visibility of that segment for outgrowth with the factory automation, et cetera. In relation to the much established understanding of how Transportation should perform long term.","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Thanks, Chris, for the question and let me take that. So first off, when I think through Transportation before I get to Industrial, I think it's more than just this year is proved outperformance. Last year at a 3% production environment, we grew 10%; and this year with the 2%, we're growing high-single digits. So I think we continue to show that in a production cycle that is decelerating in automotive, and I think you see that.","In Industrial, I think it will always be a little bit mark here because you don't have one index. You really have industrial production. And I think you're seeing at that 6%, good performance. And I think the drivers of it, as we talked at our Investor Day, are really three elements. Number one is the commercial air platforms that we've talked to you about, where we have significant content increases with both major airframe suppliers. And while we had a bump in our bookings for the past six months or so, you're starting to see that reacceleration on those take rates.","Secondly is, where we've positioned ourselves in factory automation, you mentioned robotics. There is increased content. And when you're looking at the connectedness and the factory, the digitization of the factory, that clearly plays where we are. And then the third area that I would say long term will drive it is also our medical business. Our medical business is in there. That's long-term high-single-digit with where we don't figure out therapies that are our (35:10) structural part. So, those are the three major drivers long term.","The other thing that we're benefiting from near-term is defense. Defense, we have seen a tick up over the past six months. We've highlighted it this year. But that is something we sort of view is \u2013 as we ramp budget cycles. But that's the way we think about Industrial, and that's why we feel in an industrial production environment that typically is below GDP, we can grow that mid-single-digit like we're showing this year.","Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Okay. Thank you, Chris. Can we have the next question, please?","Operator","Sure. And our next question will come from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen. Please go ahead.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question.","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Hey, Joe.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","So kind of related questions here. You mentioned robotics. I don't remember you mentioning that recently. Can you kind of talk about where you're seeing strength there? Is it a particular application or particular market within that? And then kind of related, curious for some \u2013 an update on how you're seeing the integrated solutions between connectors and sensors together? Are you making that combined sale like on an engineer kind of level?","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Yeah. So let me take both of them. They're very different questions. On robotics, we did talk about it at Investor Day. And what we see there, number one is, it leverages not only what we do, but also our whole position. So we benefit from both the robotics manufacturers in Japan as well as increasingly in China, as well as the traditional robotics manufacturers that you have in Germany and Europe.","So we're very well-positioned at all of those, and it's really across broad application. We see it in automotive, as you still get a program ramp up. We're also seeing increasingly everywhere globally, as people deal with labor and how do they get better quality and productivity. So we continue to see that and that is we're benefiting from.","On the solutions side, your second part of your question, on the solutions side, we continue to see it. The strongest we see it is more around our automotive, where we have a very strong position. Elsewhere I would say it's more spotty, but we continue to have momentum in the TERP and the revenue pipeline we have. But, clearly, we do get those benefits similar to the examples we've shown everybody.","But those not only give us sensor opportunity and interconnect opportunity, it also takes content upper role because there is other things that we do when we provide more of that solution. So, that is part of the content story when you look at automotive and you see that separation. And we also have that in our industrial transportation business. You see it.","In our commercial transportation business, you see tremendous growth. That is not only rebound in the market. That is also on those solutions that we're doing. Everywhere in the world, not just in one region \u2013 yeah, it's benefiting in China, it's benefiting here, and you really see it in the outperformance that we had that's now been well over a year and a half in that business.","Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Okay. Thanks for the question, Joe. Can we have the next question, please?","Operator","Sure. That will come from Deepa Raghavan with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Deepa B. N. Raghavan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. A couple for me. Could you please talk about China momentum across your product lines, especially where you see some strength and some weakness? It looks like auto story is accelerating there. You mentioned robotics, what else? And secondarily, Heath, could you comment on the inventory in the channel? Mixed REITs there, but sales have increased. Thank you.","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Thank you, Deepa. So let me take the China piece. Heath will take the inventory piece. So in China, our performance was very strong in the quarter and our sales growth overall was basically 10%. And when you see that, in Transportation, not just auto across, we were up 12%; in our Industrial business unit where we have robotics, we had 10% growth; as well as in our Communications Solutions which is both data, devices and appliances, on excluding SubCom, we were up 8%. So very strong growth across the China verticals, not just in one application. So, we feel very good about the momentum we had in China. And certainly, that's higher than company organic growth. So, I'll hand it over to Heath here, and he'll talk about inventory channel.","Heath Mitts - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Yeah. The channel inventory actually is \u2013 as you can imagine, you've seen the numbers in our Industrial Solutions segment, that is benefiting greatly from that. If you look at it there is \u2013 we feel very good that there's not a buildup in that channel inventory. Our channel partners have confirmed that. We've got pretty good line of sight to our major channel partners in terms of what they're stocking right now. And that continues to be pretty strong and a good indicator for us in terms of the broader industrial economy. So in general, in good shape.","Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.","All right. Thank you, Deepa. Can we have the next question, please?","Operator","And that will come from Jim Suva with Citi. Please go ahead.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks very much. On the SubCom, it sounds like has the push-outs been elongated even further than what you'd have thought say 90 days ago? And are you losing any business to customers or competitors who maybe want solutions or contracts completed sooner? Thank you.","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","No. Hey, Jim. With the orders we see, we don't believe we're losing contracts. And in fact, the $600 million we feel very good about where we are year-to-date from a backlog perspective. It's just the one project, a program delay. It's a little bit. So it's about $50 million, as we highlighted in our guide. But from that viewpoint, something we'll work through. We have to remember this is a construction business, so it does create some ripple effect. And these are typically long-term projects to begin with. Typically, these projects get worked on, get won. They don't start construction right away.","So, I don't feel we're hurting any customer on other projects. It's just how we're planning through it and how we have to run the cable through the factory and integrate it through the deployment, because this is a complete system realized. We do the design work of the system. We do the manufacturing of the equipment that goes into the system and we deploy it. So it's a turnkey solution. And guess what? When we give a turnkey solution, we're going to give a solution that works to the expectations our customers have at it. And really in this case, we're making sure we're going to keep our customers happy.","Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Okay. Thank you, Jim. Can we have the next question, please?","Operator","And that will come from Steve Fox with Cross Research. Please go ahead.","Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC","Hi, good morning. Just one on capital spending. So Heath, you explained the cash flow dynamics for the second half. But with the increase in capital spending through the year, can you just give us a sense for what the spending is directed at, and whether this is a change in your long-term expectations for CapEx ratios? Thanks.","Heath Mitts - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Sure. And Steve, I appreciate the question. Regarding CapEx, we are running higher this year than we had in the past. And I will tell you that as we evaluate our opportunity set there, it's really very strong and it's all tied to growth. It's in the areas that you would expect us, in the areas we've highlighted around auto wins, things in the sensors world, things in the medical world, selectively across the industrial, where we have won projects and we're in the process of tooling up for those. And in this business, sometimes you're spending money to get tooled up and so forth; sometimes one to two years in advance of when you'll actually see the revenue.","And we talk a lot about something called the TERP, which is the TE Revenue Pipeline. And in these businesses that I mentioned today, the opportunity set is very strong. These are largely things that have been committed by customers that will fuel organic revenue growth, outsized organic revenue growth for time to come. So, we look at it \u2013 and the use of our cash flows, this is a really good opportunity to step that up because the return on invested capital from these investments is quite good.","Now, we'll always be good shepherds of the cash and disciplined with where we do it; no different than our M&A activity, but we feel like this is a pretty good step up. If you are modeling it, we're going to run about 6% this year. I'd say, it's harder to know because as the markets correct or move around, we might adjust our thinking there. But we probably pivoted \u2013 if you're modeling between 5% and 6%, we probably pivoted a little bit closer to the higher end of that range. And we'll continue to update everyone as things come around, but this is really exciting opportunity to invest.","And I would say our cash flow, your first part of your question, the cash flow in our second half of fiscal year will be significantly higher than what you saw in the first half. Most of that is not tied to a reduction in CapEx. Most of that is, you'll see a reduction in working capital as it turns into a source of cash. I would expect our second half free cash flow to be at or higher than what our second half free cash flow was a year ago.","Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Okay. Thank you, Steve. Can we have the next question, please?","Operator","Sure. That will come from William Stein with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hey. Thanks. One clarification and then one question. Clarification is again on SubCom. I understand there is a lot of leverage in that business, but there is also this unusual project accounting. If revenue were to not rebound from these levels, would margins increase regardless because of the accounting treatment?","And then I had a question about supply chain. You had some issues here that hurt profitability, I think, last year. I don't think those are happening now, but there are broader issues in the supply chain with regard to passives and discrete semis. And I wonder if you're seeing any impact of that on the business? Thank you.","Heath Mitts - TE Connectivity Ltd.","I'll take the first part of the question, and Terrence will chime in for the second half. Relative to the percentage of completion accounting that is handled by the SubCom team for this project, it is very specific project-by-project. So, not all projects are created equal in terms of size of project or implied margin of those projects. So when you have hiccups, whether it's in the factory or when you have any kind of a ramp up otherwise because of technology or requirements, those tend to believe through a particular project through the end of that contract as it gets revalued.","I would say, if you are looking at it versus raw total topline number for the business, there can't be a mix in projects can swing that profitability pretty dramatically. So, I wouldn't assume that the business stays at low levels if the revenue does not rebound, because there are things coming in. And obviously, we're very conscious of the billion plus dollars of backlog that we have in the business, what the makeup of the implied margin is in that business. And we would tell you that runs higher than where we are today, but largely because we've had some inefficiencies with this particular project delay ramp up that we're waiting our way through now. Terrence?","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Yeah. And, Will, on the supply chain, first off, I would say, when we look at the supply chain in our world we're not a semiconductor, we aren't passive. There are some extended lead times, very much in those product categories. When we look in our world, there are some pockets where lead times extended. What I'd like, and Heath talked about a little bit is, our sell-in the distribution and their sell out is imparity.","So, we do not see distributors getting ahead of themselves, so the sell-in and sell-through is an alignment. Certainly, there are some areas you can see in our growth rates. In some areas, you're growing 20%. When you have that type of growth, we have extended lead times as we catch up but I would not say it's broad-based like some other product categories that you may follow.","Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Okay. Thank you, Will. Can we have the next question, please?","Operator","That will come from Shawn Harrison with Longbow Research. Please go ahead.","Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC","Hi. Just follow up a little bit on Will's question. The margin impacts from SubCom, I think it was 50 basis points corporate overall. Once we get into the middle of the next year, you would expect that to not be a 50 basis point drive from kind of the SubCom, is that the best way to think about modeling it in the 2019?","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","I think that's fair way of thinking about it, Shawn.","Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And then as a brief follow up just on the data and devices business, the hyper-scale strength. Are you seeing any change in the composition of the hyper-scale guys that are driving your business, maybe more customers or less customers kind of a slowing growth rate in terms of underlying spend or an accelerated growth rate?","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","So, Shawn, on that this is the same customers, I would say. I don't see more players and I would say it's been pretty constant. So what's really great is, as you're aware, when you take our data and devices business, there is hyper-scale customers, there is legacy telecom customers, and then there are sort of the lower-tier below that. Hyper-scale continues a very accelerated growth rate and they have the growth rates that we've talked about; really proud of the team of what the solutions are bringing on a high-speed area.","We do expect, outside SubCom, high-single-digit organic growth really shows a traction we have in those customers and stay in front because they do have high expectations; and I think we're doing a good job.","Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Thank you, Shawn. Can we have the next question, please?","Operator","It will come from Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Thank you. Terrence, I'd be curious to get your thoughts on the trade war discussions that are going on about the U.S. and China. I know you guys aren't incorporated in the U.S. and so maybe this has less of an impact on you. But I'm curious, given your exposure to China and the Chinese auto market, how do you see potential trade war potentially affecting your business? I assume it might have some negative impact and what have your customers said about this? Thanks.","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","So Sherri, one of the things is, I think you have to take it back to what our business model is and it's really staying close to our customers and we try to localize both engineering as well as manufacturing close to our customers, so we can co-create. So we are firmly a believer in global free trade and we're staying close to our customers, because we have to stay to them to what decisions they make; where they want to design and also where they want their supply chains to be.","So, that's the way we focus on it, to really make sure how do we win with our customers and also how do we support them. So we have not had a lot of feedback from our customers yet. I think there is a lot of \u2013 clearly, a lot of words being said and our customers are trying to digest it and we're staying close to them. So, that's really always our strategies in these situations to really stay close to our customers and we'll continue to update for our owners and everybody else as we do more. But right now, there's really no update.","Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Okay. Thank you, Sherri. Can we have the next question, please?","Operator","Sure. That will come from Joe Giordano with Cowen. Please go ahead.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Heath, just given all the questions on SubCom, how much thought have you guys given to just reporting that as a separate segment so that it doesn't kind of obscure the positive trends we're seeing in the rest of the Communications business?","Heath Mitts - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Well, candidly, not a lot of thought. I mean, we obviously \u2013 our organizational structure is set up in such a way that it adheres to segment accounting rules and so forth, and the SubCom team is managed by the same team that manages the rest of the organization, so \u2013 rest of CS business.","So, no, it's not frontend center for us. We try to provide as much visibility as we can to explain due to the lumpiness of the business both from an order as well a revenue perspective. That certainly is something we try to highlight there. But pulling it out as a separate segment, I don't see in the near future.","Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Okay. Thank you, Joe. It looks like we don't have any further questions. So anyone does have questions, please contact Investor Relations at TE. Thank you for joining us this morning and have a nice day.","Operator","Thank you.

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Sujal Shah. Please go ahead.","Sujal Shah - Vice President-Investor Relations","Good morning and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss TE Connectivity's third quarter results. With me today are: Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Lynch; President, Terrence Curtin; and acting Chief Financial Officer, Mario Calastri.","During the course of this call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information. We ask you to review the forward-looking cautionary statements included in today's press release. In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussion this morning. We ask you to review the sections of our press release and accompanying slide presentation that address the use of these items. Press release and related tables, along with the slide presentation, can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at te.com.","Finally, for participants on the Q&A portion of today's call, I would like to remind everyone to limit themselves to one follow-up question to make sure we are able to cover all questions during the allotted time.","Now, let me turn the call over to Tom for opening comments.","Thomas J. Lynch - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks for joining us today. Please turn to Slide 3, and we will cover the highlights from today's call. Q3 was another quarter of solid execution in what continues to remain a challenging global economic environment. Our adjusted EPS of $1.08 represents a new company record, and was up 20% on a year-over-year basis. Sales of $3.12 billion were essentially flat last year and in line with our guidance midpoint. Sales and orders were up sequentially, with sales up 6% and orders up 7%, excluding SubCom. Adjusted operating margins were strong at 16%, with adjusted EBITDA margins of 21% in the quarter.","For the fourth quarter, we expect the midpoint of our revenue and earnings per share to be $3.35 billion and a $1.20, respectively. Note that these figures include the benefit of approximately $200 million in revenue and $0.10 in EPS from the extra week in Q4 that we've been communicating all year. If we exclude the extra week, we would expect revenue to be up about 3% organically year-over-year and adjusted EPS growth to be 22% year-over-year. Also, if you exclude the extra week, we expect our Transportation business to have its best growth quarter in Q4 and our Industrial segment to grow slightly for the first time this year.","For the full year, we are reiterating our adjusted EPS midpoint of $4.00, representing an 11% increase over the prior year. Continued growth in most of our harsh businesses, cost controls, share buyback and a lower tax rate are more than offsetting the first half currency headwinds and supply chain correction. This has enabled us to reiterate our original guidance that we provided in October 2015, delivering double digit earnings growth in a slower economy. As I mentioned earlier, we expect to return to year-over-year organic growth in Q4, excluding the extra week.","During the quarter, we continued to strengthen our harsh portfolio through acquisition. In April, we announced the acquisition of Jaquet, which bolstered our portfolio of sensors for the auto market. This morning, we announced an agreement to acquire the Intercontec Group, a German-based manufacturer of high quality industrial metric circular connectors. This acquisition strengthens TE's position in harsh connectivity applications for factory automation, and will be reported in the Industrial segment.","In addition, I'm pleased to say our recent acquisition of Creganna is performing very well and ahead of expectations and positions TE as a leader in the high growth minimally invasive medical market.","We had a very strong cash generation quarter, with free cash flow of almost $600 million, which brings our year-to-date free cash flow to just about $1 billion. During the quarter, we returned approximately $230 million to shareholders, including about $100 million in share buybacks. Year-to-date, we have returned nearly $2.9 billion to shareholders, including $2.5 billion in share buybacks.","We expect to continue to take a balanced approach with our capital strategy, returning approximately two-thirds of our free cash flow to shareholders over time, with one-third free cash flow being used for acquisition.","I'll turn it over to Terrence Curtin, who will cover our performance in more detail.","Terrence R. Curtin - President & Director","Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. Before we get to the segment updates, I'd like to cover our orders for the quarter, which will help provide the foundation for our results and expectations, so if you could please turn to Slide 4. And this shows our order trends, excluding our SubCom business.","Overall orders were essentially flat year-over-year and improved again sequentially by 7%, as the supply chain corrections that impact us in the first half are behind us. Our book-to-bill was 1.01 and we also had slight growth year-over-year, reflecting the recovery and stability of our end markets.","In Transportation, orders remain solid, with 7% sequential growth. Industrial orders grew 15% sequentially. And I do want to highlight about 60% of the industrial order growth was due to the acquisition of Creganna, with the remainder of the growth being broad based across our Industrial businesses. In Industrial, we saw order growth in each region, as the inventory supply chain is now back in line. And we expect sales growth in the second half over the first half across each of our Industrial businesses.","In Communications, excluding the impact of the sale of our Circuit Protection business last quarter, we saw sequential growth of 3%, driven by both our Appliances and Data & Devices business. Now, to talk to SubCom, now, the business continues its strong momentum.","We were recently named as a supplier of the new MAREA transatlantic program. And with this award, we have approximately $1 billion of programs in force in our SubCom business.","Please turn to Slide 5, so I can discuss our Transportation Solutions segment results. Segment sales grew 2% organically in the quarter, with growth in Auto and in Commercial Transportation, offset by weakness in Sensors that we highlighted last quarter. Our Auto sales growth in the quarter was in line with our expectations. And growth was driven by strength in Europe and China, partially offset by a year-over-year decline in North America.","For fiscal 2016, we continue to expect mid-single-digit organic revenue growth in Auto on a 2% to 2.5% global auto production growth environment. While we are maintaining our view of global auto production, the regional profile is slightly different versus our prior view. We now expect slightly higher growth in Europe and China, offset by slower growth in North America. We do remain confident that our Auto business will continue to grow ahead of auto production, driven by the electronic content growth, as well as a rich pipeline of platform ramps from the design wins generated over the past several years.","In the fourth quarter, we expect our Auto business to have mid-teen organic growth, including the extra week. If you exclude the extra week, we expect our growth to be about half of that mid-teen growth in the mid-single digits.","We are also very pleased with our Commercial Transportation organic growth of 3% year-over-year in what continues to be a challenging backdrop. The growth we experienced was driven by the heavy truck sector in China and Europe, while in North America, heavy truck market continues to remain weak, as well as weakness in the global construction and ag markets.","Turning to Sensors, we saw a 2% organic decline, as we continue to be impacted by the weakness in industrial-related markets, which make up more than half of our sensor sales. We continue to see strong design momentum, especially in the automotive space, that we expect to fuel future growth. For the segment, adjusted operating margins were 19.4% and were in line with our expectations. And we saw sequential expansion of 40 basis points.","Now, let me turn to Industrial Solutions, if you could please turn to Slide 6. Overall segment sales were up 5% year-over-year, due to the acquisition of Creganna. If you remove the impact of Creganna, organic sales declined 4%. About half the organic decline is driven by the impact of the oil and gas downturn, which has resulted in our Oil and Gas sales being down 31%. On a geographic basis, we continue to see trends across the segment that are consistent. Europe is stable and growing in many markets. North America continues to be weak, and China remains sluggish. When we started the year, we expected further market improvement in China and North America than what we're actually seeing currently.","Now, turning to the markets within the segment, in the Industrial Equipment area, we saw 14% growth driven by the Creganna acquisition, which, as Tom mentioned, is performing ahead of our expectations. We are very excited about the growth potential in the minimally invasive medical market. If you exclude Creganna, the Industrial Equipment area, we did see a decline of 7% organically, due to softness in North America and in China, but we did see a sequential growth of 4% on an organic basis as we see markets coming back in line.","In the Aerospace & Defense area, our sales grew 4% organically, with strong performance both in the Commercial air and in the Defense markets. And in Energy, our business was flat organically, with growth in the Americas and Europe offset by declines in Asia.","As we look forward, we expect first half to second half growth of approximately 12%, with growth in each of the business units, now that the inventory corrections are behind us.","From a margin perspective, adjusted operating margins were slightly down year-over-year, driven entirely by the declines in our higher margin Oil and Gas business, which impacted segment operating margin by approximately 100 basis points year-over-year. Segment operating margins expanded 180 basis points sequentially, as we expected, driven by both the benefit of increased volumes and cost management.","Now, let me turn over to Communications Solutions, and if you could please turn to page seven of the slides. During the quarter, the Communications Solutions segment revenue was down 4% organically year-over-year, but grew 8% sequentially on an organic basis if you exclude of the impact of the Circuit Protection divestiture.","Our SubCom business saw 10% year-over-year growth, driven by strong execution from the multiple projects it has in force. And as I stated earlier, the value of the programs in force with the new program we just won is approximately $1 billion. And we continue to expect SubCom to grow approximately 20% year-over-year in 2016.","Our Appliance business sales grew 2% organically, while our Data & Devices business declined 7% (sic) [17%] (13:00) organically, due to both the Circuit Protection sale as well as product exits. We did experience sequential sales growth in the Data & Devices area if you exclude the Circuit Protection divestiture. For the segment, adjusted operating margins expanded 80 basis points year-over-year, as well as 270 basis points sequentially.","And with that, I'll turn it back over to Mario to cover the financials.","Mario Calastri - Chief Financial Officer (Interim) & Treasurer","Thanks, Terrence, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 8, where I will provide more details on earnings. Adjusted operating income of $501 million was essentially flat to prior year on flat sales, with adjusted operating margin of 16.1%. GAAP operating income was $452 million and included $18 million of acquisition-related charges and net restructuring and other charges of $31 million. Adjusted EPS was $1.08 for the quarter, up 20% from the prior year, with benefits from share buybacks and a lower tax rate of 17%.","The tax rate was lower than we expected, resulting in an incremental benefit of $0.04 in the quarter. We expect the fourth quarter tax rate to be at a similar level as Q3. Note that the Q3 and Q4 tax rates are lower than our run rate. We now expect the full-year 2016 tax rate to be approximately 20%.","GAAP EPS was $2.19 for the quarter, driven by a $1.21 benefit, primarily from the settlement of all pre-separation tax disputes with Internal Revenue Service. As we previously disclosed, Tyco International entered into an agreement with the IRS to resolve all disputes related to the previously-disclosed intercompany tax issues.","As a result, we recognized a reduction of tax reserves of $1.1 billion, as well as an expense of $604 million, representing a reduction in receivables from our tax sharing agreement with Tyco International and Covidien. We're happy to report that all of our IRS legacy tax disputes are now closed.","As a result of the IRS settlement, want to give you some color on our tax rate and other income going forward. The IRS settlement benefits our tax rate. However, this benefit is essentially offset by the reduction of other income generated by the tax sharing agreement with Tyco and Covidien.","We now assume that the long-term adjusted tax rate declines to approximately 20%, just as our previously-communicated range of 23% to 24%. At the same time going forward, should assume that the IRS settlement will be essentially neutral to EPS.","Now, expect approximately $110 million of restructuring charges for the full year, $10 million increase from the prior guidance as we accelerate certain actions due to slightly weaker overall economic conditions.","Now, turning to Slide 9, our business is executing well in an uncertain micro environment. We are pleased to report sequential improvements in a lot of the operating metrics from the prior quarter. Our adjusted gross margin in the quarter was 33%, in line with our expectations. Adjusted operating margins expanded 20 basis points year-over-year, with a strong focus on spending control and (17:10) improvement of certain declines in higher-margin businesses.","Total operating expenses were $528 million in the quarter, down 4% from the prior year. We continue to tightly manage discretionary spending, while balancing our continuing investment in our harsh businesses.","Moving to cash flow, in the quarter, cash from continuing operations was $715 million. And our free cash flow was $589 million, up from prior year levels, due to strong working capital improvement. We saw year-over-year improvement in DSOs and inventory days on hand came down as well.","We have generated nearly $1 billion in free cash flow for the year to-date, reinforcing the health of our business. And we continue to expect full year free cash flow to approximate net income.","Adjusted EBITDA margins help explain the (18:12) performance of our businesses, including acquisitions. And adjusted EBITDA margins in Q3 were 20.7%, 460 basis points above adjusted operating margins and flat to prior year. Continue to be pleased with operating performance of our business, especially given the challenging market backdrops.","As Tom mentioned earlier, we announced an agreement to acquire Intercontec, expanding our harsh connectivity portfolio in the Industrial segment. We are expecting Intercontec to add approximately $75 million of sales and $32 million of EBITDA on an annual basis. The transaction is a cash deal of $340 million that is expected to close in September 2016 and be accretive to adjusted EPS next year. We have added a balance sheet and cash flow summary in the Appendix for additional details.","And now, I will turn it back to Tom.","Thomas J. Lynch - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Mario. I'll now cover our guidance, so please turn to Slide 10 for the Q4 outlook. We expect Q4 revenue of $3.25 billion to $3.45 billion and adjusted EPS of $1.17 to $1.23. This guidance includes the extra week we have discussed throughout the year, which adds approximately $200 million of revenue and $0.10 of EPS. Excluding this extra week, we expect revenue to be up about 3% organically at the midpoint and adjusted EPS to be up 22%, a very good finish to our year.","Slide 10 provides details on actual and organic growth by segment. The extra week results in total growth of 11% in the quarter. We expect strong performance in our harsh businesses, including Automotive, Commercial Transportation, Commercial Aerospace, Medical and Appliances.","In addition, the Creganna acquisition adds revenue from the high growth interventional medical market, and SubCom continues to remain robust with multiple programs in force. Communications continues to be impacted year-on-year by the sale of the Circuit Protection business and product exits in Data & Devices.","Now, please turn to Slide 11. For the full year, we expect revenue of $12.25 billion and are reiterating our full year adjusted EPS guidance of $4.00 at the midpoint, up 11% year-on-year. This adjusted EPS outlook is the same guidance we provided back in October. I feel very good about our ability to drive this performance in a slow economy.","In Transportation, we continue to expect Auto to grow in the mid-single digits organically on a 2% to 2.5% vehicle production growth.","In Industrial, while organic growth is expected to be down year-over-year for the full year due to the impact of the oil and gas downturn and supply chain corrections in the first half, we do expect strong growth from the first half to the second half across all of our business units in the Industrial segment.","In Communications, our SubCom business continues to be the primary driver of growth, but we do expect both our Appliances and Data & Devices businesses to grow in the second half. This is especially important for our Data & Devices segment.","This past quarter was an important threshold for TE and reflects the strength of our model, namely: focus our investments in harsh environment applications; relentlessly drive TEOA through the organization to delivers strong productivity and, as you can see, strong working capital and cash flow results; and consistently execute our capital allocation plan.","On a normalized 13-week per quarter basis in a low growth world, we are delivering second half revenue growth, 16% adjusted operating margins, strong double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth and outstanding cash flow.","And with that, let's open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And today, our first question comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","The industrial market, nice to see a little recovery there, but just kind of big picture, how you manage the near-term profitability, which is weak in the current backdrop versus longer term growth expectations, I know you guys have been investing for Industrial, but just help us with kind of the longer-term path and what you see is the appropriate margins for that business longer term?","Thomas J. Lynch - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'll take this. It's Tom. I'll ask Terrence to add on when I'm done here. Industrial is an important, obviously, incredibly important segment for us. We're well positioned and, as you can see with the Intercontec acquisition, it's an important area to add in organically as well. It has been a pretty sluggish environment, with the exception of commercial aerospace for the last several years. But it's fundamentally very good business. We still believe this is a business with high teen operating margins, if you get kind of normalized growth over time. And you saw the leverage with a little bit of growth sequentially on our operating margin.","So, it fits right into the sweet spot of harsh environment, highly engineered products. We have a tremendous range of products. We've expanded that product range, not only in connectors with the recent acquisition, but with our sensor acquisition of a couple years ago. All while those markets are a little soft right now, we continue to be very bullish. So, important market, well-positioned in the market, in every market, so wherever the industrial leaders of the world are, we're there close to them. Terrence, you want to add to that?","Terrence R. Curtin - President & Director","Yeah. The only thing I would add, Craig, is we're pretty proud of where we've gotten the margin. And, no, it's not where we want it to be in long-term, but when you think about the oil and gas effect we've had, it's slightly more than 100 basis that we, in a market that is flattish at best, being able to get back and cover that headwind we have. So, clearly that is something that when you look at the margin, has impacted us and that has come down.","I think also we still have an industrial equipment space that I talked about in the fall, that still, I would say, was probably the other sluggish area that's trying to get momentum. I do think as the volume comes in, you saw the great improvement we have of about 100 basis points sequentially, you see the volume flow through. So, I do think we're doing a good job balancing it. We saw good growth in relationship to Comm air and Defense. 4%, I think we're performing very well there. So, overall, I think we continue to have the same margin expectation we've had, which is higher teen, but clearly, I think we battled through the oil and gas downturn pretty well from a margin perspective.","Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. And then, if I could, on my follow-up for the medical space, you guys have talked about kind of a system solutions approach, if you will. Can you just talk about the go-to-market there, how it might be different versus the traditional sales approach you have, and then also as it relates to that, what you're able to wring out in terms of value in medical?","Terrence R. Curtin - President & Director","I think there's a couple of things to that. When you talk about the go-to-market in medical, it is probably more akin to what we do in automotive. It's a much more direct sale, Craig. So, when you sit there, what's great with Creganna, Creganna not only helped balance out some holes we had geographically, but also with the 200 engineers, they came in to help service that model as well as the footprint that keeps them (26:31) behind. So, I think when you think through that space, it is much more direct.","Now, when you're deal with more integration, it really is how do we bring the portfolio we had and what they did so well together? And we're early stages on that. But I think that's where you'll get some of the value creation on the grow side is how we'll be able to do further integration and get to a higher content per unit opportunity than either company's had, together.","So, I think it's much more around bringing the product set together. The go-to-market is how do you make sure you cover the large players in that space. And with what we've had and with Creganna, we cover all the major players and have a nice position with them to get to that leading position.","Thomas J. Lynch - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'd add, Craig, that the customer feedback of us being the acquirer has been very positive. Customers knew us peripherally from other things we do, but important to them that somebody with our strength and commitment to the market is there. So, that's been pretty unanimous as we've been out to all the big customers.","Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. Thanks for all the color.","Terrence R. Curtin - President & Director","Thanks, Craig.","Sujal Shah - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Craig. Could we have the next question, please?","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yes. Good morning. And thanks very much for taking the questions. First question is on the Transportation segment. Can you talk about what the reason is that you think you're seeing an improvement in the year-over-year growth rates, excluding the extra week in the Transportation segment, in the fiscal fourth quarter, and if you can offer any views you have about the sustainability of the auto cycle as you move going forward after the September quarter?","Thomas J. Lynch - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Thanks, Mark. A couple of points, I would say, the fundamental point is the design wins over many years coming into play, so that's been great for us for a long time and continue to expect that to be, so just momentum in design-in share. I think, also last year's fourth quarter wasn't a strong quarter, particularly in China. It was in Europe and in the U.S., but China was in the midst of kind of a three quarter decline. We've seen that recovery in our third quarter this year and expect to see year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter. But the bottom line is it's a pretty solid market. We're well-positioned in it. Terrence, you want to add anything to that?","Terrence R. Curtin - President & Director","Yeah. No, the only other thing is, I think, when you look at the fourth quarter, fourth quarter, we had some blips earlier in the year around how production was, like Tom said, in China. I think when you look at production, production's been pretty stable and we're at that 2%, 2.5% production rate. And I think that's really just proving our model that we can grow that mid-single digit in a 2% to 2.5% production rate. And while we're not guiding for next year yet, I do think thinking about next year and about a 2% production environment is how we're thinking about it right now, and we'll update you in the fall when we give 2017 guidance.","Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Very helpful. And for follow-up question on gross margins, they're down year-over-year in each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2016. I know you talked about the mix issues that have been impacting margin. Is there anything else going on with gross margins being down or is it entirely mix?","Terrence R. Curtin - President & Director","You're talking, Mark, about Transportation, right?","Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co.","For the whole company?","Terrence R. Curtin - President & Director","Oh, the whole thing. It's a little bit of the volume in the first half and the mix. But now you can see you get back to this 13-week quarter, $3.1 billion run rate, the margins are back 33%, gross margins. The operating margins are back to 16%. So, no. I mean, our productivity has been good this year.","The health of the portfolio, I mean, you look at the dramatic improvement in the gross margin over the last several years and the operating margins because of the transformation of the portfolio. So, no, I'd say we're getting back to sort of where we expect to be. And, of course, we expect to continue to improve as long as markets have some growth in them.","Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Sujal Shah - Vice President-Investor Relations","All right. Thank you, Mark. Could we have the next question, please?","Operator","And our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes. Thank you. Good morning. So, Tom, organic growth in Transport, you've noted some strength in China, also EMEA. Can you comment a little bit on the state of the North American market? I think you alluded to it being a little bit softer. How do you see that progressing? And are you accounting for any softness in your outlook in European autos, particularly post-Brexit? And I have a follow up.","Thomas J. Lynch - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Wamsi. Yeah. Just to kind of reiterate the regional view of Transportation: China improving in Q3, and expect to see that continue in Q4; Europe, sort of been on a steady track for a couple years now, steady, reasonable growth; and the U.S. falling a bit, but at a high level, I mean, so you get near this 18 million per unit level, I do think it slowed down a little bit as you see what the OEMs are saying. So, we have factored that in to our outlook for sure in Q4. We haven't really factored in any Brexit. Of course, we are so close to the auto OEMs and talk with them all the time and right now, I mean, even if you look at our first three weeks, order rates in Transportation in July, they're very, very robust.","So, not crazy hot, but up over last year, as we expected, nicely and continuing to where they've been in the, as Terrence laid out in his comments earlier, a strong third quarter. And just to reiterate, I think the industry and what we see, listening to our customers, and it's still early, and we'll get more specific next quarter, but kind of feels like a 2% production rate if we had to put the gauntlet down right now for next year globally.","Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. Thanks for the incremental color. And then, thanks for calling out the impact of that actually so clearly in fiscal 4Q. I was wondering how should we think about seasonality going into the first quarter of next year. If you ex-out the $200 million, consensus is roughly down 3%. It was down 5% last year. But you obviously have made a lot of portfolio changes here and some other M&A here as well. So how should we really be thinking about the seasonality going into first quarter of next year? Thanks.","Terrence R. Curtin - President & Director","Okay, Wamsi, I'll take that. It's Terrence. I think when you think about the seasonality, last year, we had some inventory corrections that started fourth quarter of the fiscal year, well into the first quarter. I think when we look at those corrections being behind us, I think you can expect taking our quarter four, backing out the extra week and then assuming anywhere from a 3% to 5% normal seasonal step-down. So, I do think you get into on a top-line perspective much more of normal seasonal quarter four to quarter one. As you're thinking about it, but you highlighted it well, you do have to pull the extra week out of our fourth quarter.","Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Makes sense.","Sujal Shah - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you. All right, thanks, Wamsi. Could we have the next question, please?","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Good morning, guys. I have two questions as well. So, just looking at the guide for September maybe within Transportation, you guys are looking for, I think, 7%, 8% growth, excluding the extra week in the Transportation segment in September. Your orders, though, I think, are up 2% based on the June quarter number. So, can you just maybe help me understand the delta between orders up 2% and the guide that you have? What else could drive the upside there?","Thomas J. Lynch - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We, you have the ongoing backlog, Amit. And as I said a minute ago, the orders continue into July to be really, really solid. And you have to think of there was inventory correction last year that especially affected China. So, you have some of that normalizing, so you don't have the normal just linear quarter-to-quarter, my Q3 orders equals my Q4 sales. But when you look at our backlog right now and the way it's scheduled out and the rate of orders, it's a solid Q4. Terrence, you want to add to that?","Terrence R. Curtin - President & Director","No. I think what you see is you will see a little bit of a seasonal step-down like we normally get around Europe, so I actually think we're getting back to a more normal pattern, Amit, and feel very good with the backlog, as you said, Tom, that the backlog's there to deliver on that 7%, 8% growth (35:20).","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. And I guess if I could just follow-up, Terrence, on the Industrial side, you had some nice margin improvement in the quarter, but you have always talked about Industrial getting in line to corporate average margins, 16%, 17%, let's just say. How do you think the path is there for the next 300 basis points of margin expansion? Is there an absolute revenue number that you need to achieve? And are there incremental cost take out that you would call out that should help you out as well?","Thomas J. Lynch - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think number one, Amit, we have been doing cost take-out as we've been in a slow environment to really get to where we've been, to keep it flat even with the higher margin oil and gas impact we've had.","I do think what's nice about the Industrial business, and you saw it sequentially, is how strong the follow-through can be in that business across the segment. So, when you sit there it is much around volume as we continue to march up because a lot of the cost actions have already been effectuated, so it will be much more volume dependent as we go from there.","Terrence R. Curtin - President & Director","I think with that, Amit, is when you disaggregate a bit: you've got Commercial air and Defense above; you've got Energy a little bit below; Medical moving up with the acquisitions because that's accretive to the margin; and then, you have the Industrial Equipment business that's really been the factory floor has been a flat market for a couple years, but it's fundamentally a really tight business and the business we just added in, which is a nice add to the product line and into the revenue as well, is accretive to the margin. So, we feel pretty confident that with reasonable industrial production, we'll follow that, and also embedded in there is significant piece of the business that goes through the channel, which is attractive business.","Sujal Shah - Vice President-Investor Relations","Okay, thank you, Amit. Can we have the next question, please?","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Shawn Harrison with Longbow Research Company. Please go ahead.","Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC","Hi. Good morning, everybody.","Thomas J. Lynch - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Morning.","Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC","What I wanted to drill in on, I guess, was the restructuring, looking I guess now for $110 million this year. What would be the savings that you'll see in fiscal 2016? And how much of that spills into 2017? And I guess any comment there in terms of how you would think about incremental restructuring actions in 2017. Are you finished or there are other things that need to be tidied up?","Mario Calastri - Chief Financial Officer (Interim) & Treasurer","Yes, Shawn. Hi, this is Mario. We have increased slightly the restructuring for this year up to $110 million. The way you should read it is normally the payback is around 18 months, two years. So, you should think about the benefits in 2017 to see on that basis.","And as far as pipeline of restructuring activity into 2017, we're going to be much more clear in next quarter with the guidance, but you should expect some level of obligation for (38:26) 2017 as well.","Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. Thank you. As a follow-up maybe for you, Tom or Terrence, M&A activity, I don't know if it's just timing, but it's stepped up now, three acquisitions over the past two quarters. Is the environment for M&A freeing up? I know valuations aren't cheap or is there just, given the shift in the portfolio to harsh environment just more resources being put toward M&A, so we should expect maybe a more consistent cadence of M&A over the next few years?","Thomas J. Lynch - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Shawn, thanks. Good question. I think this, three in this short period of time, is more coincidence than anything else honestly, because just to give you a little of the history. Intercontec, we've been, like we often do and is often the case with a really nice privately held company, it takes a while to work through it. And in this case, we actually did some market experiments, I would say, over a couple years to prove to both of us, both parties, that there was synergy and it was great. So, that's been in the works for awhile.","Jaquet, the sensor is a fragmented market. And there's always small sensor companies, most of which we're not interested in. That was a much shorter train. (39:46)","And I would say Creganna was shorter than normal, but part of the plan once we had done advanced cast (39:53), so they happened to come in to these three months. Would have had our druthers, Intercontec would have been a couple of years ago. But sometimes, that's how they work out. So, I don't think the universe of properties or the availability has changed that much. Terrence, if you want to add some color to that...?","Terrence R. Curtin - President & Director","No, Tom, I think you said it right. I think it is some of these things, when something gets auctioned like a Creganna, we don't control that top box (40:20). And then Intercontec, it was a journey with the owner about also when's he comfortable selling and making sure he sees how his company's going to do well. (40:32) I think that takes time. So, I do think it's a little bit of three things at once. So, it's just that, Shawn.","I think when you look at the environment, I think the environment \u2013 you said it very well. I think things are still \u2013 you have to pay for good assets. And I think we have three good assets here. And that's along our harsh strategy. I think the harsh strategy, we've talked about interventional a lot over the past six months, but I think when you also look here, Jaquet and the sensors, how it strengthens us in automotive, especially in turbo sensor applications.","And I think when you look at Intercontec, what's great about Intercontec, is it gets us closer to the factory floor. They're a leader in that space that really relates to the how do you hook up servo motors on the factory floor, which is a very harsh application, and you make sure your power and your signal into the application is controlled now (41:25) to make sure you never have downtime. And the company has an exceptional product line and technology that we're bringing in that was a gap for TE.","So, I think each one of these show how our thought about the portfolio continues to evolve around harshness as well as how do we serve our customers better with a more complete portfolio. So, I think that's what really the three of these being together at the same time. You get to see how we're thinking. So, hopefully, that helps.","Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC","It does. Thanks, Terrence.","Sujal Shah - Vice President-Investor Relations","All right. Thank you, Shawn. Can we have the next question, please?","Operator","And our next comes from the line of Steven Fox with Cross Research. Please go ahead.","Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Just a couple of specific questions on some of the results, first of all, the Appliance business, it sounded like it's experienced some decent growth. Can you just talk about what's driving some of that growth in a little bit more specific? And then secondly, you talked about organic growth ex-Creganna. I was just curious what kind of growth you've seen from Creganna out of the box with that business. And then I had a quick follow-up.","Terrence R. Curtin - President & Director","Sure, Steve. It's Terrence. Thanks for the questions. First off, on Appliance, what we've seen in Appliance, Appliance has been \u2013 they got impacted a little bit around the inventory correction with our channel partners, because they do have part of their business goes through there but if you really look at what we've been experiencing, we've been experiencing a very robust U.S. and Europe production environment. So, I think we're seeing nice growth there that's been the backdrop. What we have had in Appliance is that the China OEMs have slowed in China.","So, the appliance production in China has come off a little bit. So, while we were growing 2%, it's really been driven by the U.S. and Europe. We see it again here in the quarter we just guided to, and going into next year, we probably expect a similar picture.","On Creganna, certainly, we didn't own it a year ago, but in this first quarter, if we did own it, it would have grown about 11%. So, when we look at that interventional market, as we've talked to you, we see a market that we like it very much because of the trend that supports about mid to higher single digit market environment in that interventional space, that $3 billion market, that Creganna helps us get a leadership position in, but really a good first quarter that, on a pro forma, we owned them a year ago, would have been up about 11%.","Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC","Great. It's helpful. And then, just real quick on the SubCom business, given the growth you're seeing, where are we versus prior cycle margins? And can you talk to how margins have improved recently and how they may improve in the next couple quarters? Thanks.","Terrence R. Curtin - President & Director","The margins are similar and we're seeing margins gradually move up. So, it's following the same general pattern. None of the patterns are exactly the same, but, yes, we are seeing margins now are higher than they were on a one year run rate than they were a year ago. So, we are seeing that happen.","Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC","Thanks very much.","Terrence R. Curtin - President & Director","Thank you.","Sujal Shah - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Steve. Can we have the next question, please?","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Jim Suva with Citi. Please go ahead.","James Dickey Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you and congratulations to you and your team.","Thomas J. Lynch - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","James Dickey Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Could you briefly \u2013 you mentioned about, I believe it was automotive from Brexit did not have a impact. Can you just make sure? Did I get that right? And then, what about your other segments? Did you see any impact post the quarter close from Brexit? And then, my follow-up just to kind of throw it in at the same time is on the tax rate. It ended up this year, I think, lower than everyone expected, so it helped out your earnings as you're reiterating guidance. So, was it the industrial market that kind of the profitability came in softer or what was the cause that even though earnings reiterated guidance and you have more M&A, the tax rate really helped out this year? And longer term, are we looking at a lower tax rate? How should we plan tax rate longer term? Thank you.","Thomas J. Lynch - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, let me start with your Brexit question, Jim. Thanks for the comments, by the way. Yeah, it's hard to feel any impact right now. I mean, as I said, you can look at our orders right up to last week, they're running what we based this guidance on and slightly ahead of the run rate last quarter and nicely ahead of the run rate last year. And Europe continues to be really solid kind of across most of our businesses. So we haven't really seen any impact yet. So, like I guess like everybody else in the planet, we're waiting to see if there's really going to be an impact or not.","On the tax rate, Mario, you want to?","Mario Calastri - Chief Financial Officer (Interim) & Treasurer","Yeah. Just begin with (46:20) a comment around our long-term tax rate view is now around 20%, down from where we communicated previously, which we were around 23% to 24%. Currently, the settlement, the IRS settlement, is the biggest moving piece here. As you think about that, you need to combine it with the SG, (46:46) the other income going away. So that is why we characterize it as a kind of an EPS neutral movement.","Now, for 2016 in the second half, we are experiencing a lower than run rate tax rate. So, in Q3, we had the 17% tax rate. We expect Q4 to be similar","James Dickey Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thanks for the details and especially for pointing out the other income line fluctuates with the tax rate. I think some people often (47:23) struggle with that. Thank you. And, again, congratulations to you and your team at TE Connectivity.","Terrence R. Curtin - President & Director","Thanks, Jim.","Sujal Shah - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Jim. Can we have the next question, please?","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of William Stein with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great. Thanks for taking my question. Gentlemen, I think, Terrence, you mentioned sort of a preview on auto production for next year. And, Tom, you might have reiterated that view. I'm curious whether the China stimulus that's been in place since last September, and it's so therefore about to annualize, how that factors in to your view of global production, if at all, and why shouldn't that drag global unit growth more?","Thomas J. Lynch - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Will. Yeah. Well, I think what we certainly saw as the stimulus helped reverse the decline that was happening early in the year. So, we returned to growth in \u2013 nice solid growth in Q3 and we'll see that again in Q4 in Auto. And all the numbers from the industry are, of course, very preliminary for next year, but they're assuming a reasonable China market next year, not a booming market, not a bearish market. That's kind of how we see it and what our leadership over there sees. So, I don't think \u2013 we don't expect an unusually positive catalyst from it because it's really already into the base is the way I would think about it.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Tom, to clarify, what I'm asking is the stimulus for consumers for taxes in automotive, that's been in place since last September. So as that annualizes, is there not an expectation that China is going to be a more difficult market next year?","Thomas J. Lynch - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No. Okay. Well, it's hard to say. But, again, if you think of this year being 2% to 2.5%, next year being in the 2% range, other markets were kind of weak. Some of the Asian markets were inconsistent. It really depends. Is China is going to come off? I mean, if you look at macro China, where the weakness has been is in industrial China, not consumer China. The consumer markets in China and the consumer in China continues to be pretty healthy. And the growth in the China economy is in the consumer market, which is a good thing in general because that's what fuels economic growth and then eventually feeds the industrial part of the economy. So, I think we don't have a crystal ball, for sure, Will.","But right now, what we're seeing is \u2013 we would expect reasonable growth in China, definitely down from what it's run over \u2013 take our fiscal 2016 out of it because growth in fiscal 2016 is pretty modest. I think we kind of see another modest growth in fiscal 2017. It's below the historical growth rates. And that's how you get to this 1.5%, 2% production growth in 2017. But I think this will play out. But generally, we're not hearing or seeing anything from our customers and from our patterns that would say differently right now. It was better in the third quarter than we thought; probably a little better in the third quarter and a little less in fourth quarter. We saw the curve being a little bit different in the second half, but, overall, it's about where we expect.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay.","Terrence R. Curtin - President & Director","Just to add one thing, when we look to the 2% next year, we'll guide more next quarter. It does assume a slower China production environment versus this year's China production environment. So, we do anticipate it'll be a little slower environment in China from a production perspective due to the 1.6-liter engine that you talked about.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Yeah.","Terrence R. Curtin - President & Director","But we still expect the China production environment to grow next year based upon what we're seeing today.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","That perspective is very helpful. I appreciate it. If I can squeeze one more in, your military and aerospace end markets seem to have done well in the quarter. I'm wondering if the DoD budget and the end of sequestration, is that helping or is this more sort of unrelated to that? And then in aerospace, I think we've had some negative data points from Boeing and Airbus on the wide-body jets. And I'm wondering if whether your results and outlook are doing well despite that because of growth elsewhere or are you just not seeing that weakness yet? Thank you.","Thomas J. Lynch - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Will, thanks for the question. A couple of things, on Commercial Aerospace, feel very good with the program wins and even if you have some of the wide-body adjustment, we do view that our Commercial Aerospace business would grow that mid-single digit with the platforms we have won; not only with the big carriers, also the regional carriers like Embraer and Bombardier (52:46), and so forth. And so, I actually feel very good even with those data points you mentioned about.","I think in Defense, it's been nice that as we've seen some of the budgetary things happen, we're starting to see some pick-up in Defense. I think you saw that in our quarterly results where we grew 4%. And I think that's creating a little bit more of a constructive backdrop in Defense than we've had in quite some time when the whole sequester started. So, it's actually nice to see it burning (53:14) into revenue on the Defense side. And I think the momentum we have there is strong as well. So, those are areas that I view you're going to continue to see growth out of (53:20).","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks very much.","Terrence R. Curtin - President & Director","Thank you.","Sujal Shah - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you. Can we have the next question, please?","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Matt Sheerin with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yes. Thanks and good morning. Just a couple from me here, regarding the Sensor business and the fact that it hasn't been growing here, and I understand the industrial weakness that you've seen. It sounds like you're talking about some increase in bookings. So could you update us on when you expect that to grow? And on the automotive side, the cross-selling, I know it takes two to three years in terms of these design cycles, but when do you expect, Tom, to see the payoff on the automotive side of things?","Thomas J. Lynch - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think, Matt, automotive, as you know, the cycle is a little bit longer, not as long as it used to be because everybody's designing faster these days, but I would say 2018. That's when these nice wins are going to really start to come in. And you'll see it in the Auto revenue line.","In the Industrial line, I think it will follow kind of industrial production. The design win nature there is very different. It's like the industrial market in general, much more fragmented, smaller revenue per design. So, in there, it'll continue to build scale in the non-auto products and make sure that they we're growing with or slightly better than the market.","But auto is where you can get significant chunks of business per design. So, we really feel good about that. Now, we're a little disappointed in the industrial market side of it. But still very, very excited about the prospects of having sensors in the portfolio and what it does for us at every customer, every big OEM, we've always had a nice seat at the table, but it's like you get a bigger seat and sometimes a bigger table because it brings in the integrated solution opportunity.","You've heard us talk about that. We've had some tremendous design wins in Automotive with that. And it's starting to lend itself, I think, to the aerospace market. Terrence has talked before about the medical market when you pull together our interventional capability along with our core connector healing and protect, (55:45) and, wow, miniaturized sensors. So, it's a pretty robust portfolio that we have that should bolster our growth rates in Industrial.","Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And just on the follow-up, could you update us on the CFO search?","Thomas J. Lynch - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Well into it, as you would expect, and I expect in the not too distant future, we'll be making a choice. Always not over till it's over, but pleased with how things are running in the interim, very pleased, so haven't really skipped a beat.","Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Sujal Shah - Vice President-Investor Relations","All right. Thank you, Matt. Could we have the next question, please?","Operator","We do have a question from the line of Mike Wood with Macquarie Group. Please go ahead.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Your acquisition strategy clearly has been focused on the harsh environment side, in Industrial and Auto. Curious if can you comment about if there's anything in the consumer area that you're looking in your pipeline or if there's further opportunities to divest pieces of that and just an update on your strategy with product exits, has that been working in terms of the margin improvement?","Thomas J. Lynch - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Thanks. Well, you're absolutely right that the acquisition strategy is focused on harsh environments. And there's a lot of opportunity there. It's our wheelhouse, and it's where we can bring the most value to customers. So, that's where we're exclusively focused on our M&A at this point in time.","I would say that shifting over to the Data & Devices business to add on to what Terrence said, feeling good about the progress and the fact that we're going to see sequential growth in the fourth quarter for the first time in a long time. Restructuring getting behind us, the margins moving up, we definitely see this business is getting on the improvement path, so encouraged about that.","We have to earn that one quarter at a time, so we're not getting carried away here, but the team's done a lot of hard work to reposition the business around our core connector capability, which is still very good, and very good products with attractive margins.","And as far as your point on the product exits, it'll probably blend in a little bit early next year. (58:15) Terrence, you want to comment on that?","Terrence R. Curtin - President & Director","Yeah. I think on the exits, Mario talked about it earlier to a question. Certainly, they've been a drag for the past two years. We see those probably through mid-2017 still being a little drag. But when you look at it, it's really allowed the business to get focused, as Tom said, around the interconnect and connectivity strength that we have, as well as we're much more selective in the consumer space. So, a lot of those exits have related to the consumer space, and making sure we're still consuming (58:45) our resources where we create value for our customers, as well as our shareholders.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. And as a follow-up, has there been any slippage or impact from the recent move up in commodity prices like copper and gold? Thank you.","Mario Calastri - Chief Financial Officer (Interim) & Treasurer","This is Mario. Not really, I mean, we have a hedging program that basically dilutes the volatility around the battles (59:12). Consistently, we are about 50% hedged. And we have higher hedges on the near term, so you're not going to see much of an impact on copper. (59:22)","Mike Wood - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thank you.","Sujal Shah - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Mike. Could we have the next question, please?","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Tom, I wanted to ask, you guys have been switching some of the business around with acquisitions and divestitures over the past couple of years. How do you feel about the portfolio right now? Do you think you have the right mix of business? Is there any opportunity to do additional divestitures at this point?","Thomas J. Lynch - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sherri, thanks. No, I feel really, really good about the portfolio. As you know, it had quite a bit in it at one point in time and now we're up to the, say, 90% is connectivity and sensors. We often get asked about SubCom. It's an unusual business, for sure. There really isn't that much of a market. There's no market really that we've seen in 10 years to sell it, but it's an exceptionally well-run business that's a clear world leader in what it does.","And it's especially interesting these days, because the customer base is different. And with cloud computing and mega data centers and fiber security and all those things driving what we think fit the needs for more trans-continental connectivity, SubCom can hold its own in our portfolio. But when you get past that, everything else is related. So, more of what you'd see is tweaking the product lines, which you always have in a business as you try, hey, (1:00:56) here's a product line that maybe is commoditized, that we don't have any unique value. Let's price ourselves out of it or maybe sell it. But for the most part, the most recent one being Circuit Protection, was kind of the big chunks that are available.","Never say never, but really like the portfolio, I think you can see it in the margins. The harsh businesses, if you look at those business, above company average margins, nicely, very dependable, highly engineered, really play to our strength as an engineering and manufacturing company. And, as Terrence pointed out, with the acquisitions we just made, we just added $0.5 billion of harsh revenue into the portfolio over the last 90 days and at EBITDA margins well above the company average. And this is what we know best and do best, so it's what we're going to continue to emphasize.","Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. And then, just in terms of an update on the buybacks, I think you're mostly done with the buybacks related to the BNS divestiture. Can you give us an update on your thoughts on buybacks? I think you have about $1.2 billion left at this point? Thanks.","Thomas J. Lynch - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Mario, you want to comment on that?","Mario Calastri - Chief Financial Officer (Interim) & Treasurer","Sure. Long-term, it's consistent with what we have communicated always. We expect to basically return two-thirds of our free cash flow through buybacks and dividends. So, you can do the math clearly, but the long-term expectation there should be some volatility around the quarters.","As far as Q4 specifically, you should expect it to be similar to Q3.","Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Thomas J. Lynch - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Sherri.","Mario Calastri - Chief Financial Officer (Interim) & Treasurer","Thank you, Sherri.","Sujal Shah - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Sherri.

Welcome to the TE Connectivity F2Q Earnings Call. (Operator instructions.) As a reminder this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Keith Kolstrom, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Keith Kolstrom","Good morning and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss TE Connectivity\u2019s F2Q 2014 results. With me today are Chairman and CEO Tom Lynch and CFO Bob Hau.","During the course of this call we will be providing certain forward-looking information and we ask you to review the forward-looking cautionary statements included in today\u2019s press release. In addition we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussion this morning and we ask you to review the section of our press release and the accompanying slide presentation that address the use of these items.","The press release and related tables along with the slide presentation can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.te.com. Finally I would like to remind everyone to please try to limit themselves to one follow-up question to make sure we\u2019re able to cover all questions during the allotted time.","Now let me turn the call over to Tom for some opening comments.","Tom Lynch","Thanks, Keith, and good morning everyone. This was another good quarter for TE Connectivity on many fronts. The majority of the markets we serve are exhibiting solid growth trends and this growth is fairly broad-based across most of the regions of the world. There are still some uncertain spots but overall I am encouraged by the trend. It\u2019s good to see other markets in addition to automotive picking up some steam.","We\u2019re very well positioned in about 90% of the markets we serve, and virtually all of them have attractive underlying drivers which require more of our highly-engineered connectivity products. The concept of the Internet of Things is real and we are seeing it across almost all of our customers. I feel we are in an excellent position to be able to capitalize on these trends because of the range of our technology and the extensive resources we have close to the customer around the globe.","Our operational performance also continues to improve. This quarter we delivered adjusted operating margin of 15.5%, up 190 basis points from last year; and we\u2019re on track to deliver 15.0% + adjusted operating margins for the full year. Strong productivity driven by our TEOA program, and this is our business system that encompasses Lean Six Sigma and engineering design productivity coupled with a much more balanced footprint has resulted in very good operating leverage in most of our businesses. We\u2019re also benefiting from our strategic focus of building our harsh environment product portfolio. ","The company continues to generate strong cash flow, with six straight years of free cash flow yield at or above 10% of revenue. This gives us the flexibility to execute important strategic acquisitions such as SEACON which I\u2019ll discuss a bit more further on while still returning two-thirds of our cash flow to shareholders over time. Our philosophy is a balanced approach which emphasizes organic investment, strategic acquisitions, and returning cash to shareholders through consistent dividend growth and share repurchase.","Overall the world feels more solid economically than it has in a while and we are well positioned to capitalize on this. Now let\u2019s go to the slides.","Please turn to Slide 3. Revenues in F2Q were in line with expectation and adjusted earnings per share was above out guidance range. We continued to see improvement in many of our end markets and the fall through to operating income on the year-over-year sales increases was strong. ","Here are some highlights of the quarter: organically sales were up 6% overall and up 7% excluding Sub Commp. The automotive, aerospace, oil & gas, industrial and telecom businesses drove this growth. This more than offset expected declines in the consumer devices and Data Comm businesses and continued project delays in our Sub Comm business.","Adjusted earnings per share of $0.95 was up 25% versus last year and $0.05 better than the midpoint of our guidance. As I mentioned earlier adjusted operating margins were 15.5%, up 190 basis points over the prior year, and we remain on track to exceed 15.0% for the full year as we continue to deliver strong operational performance across the majority of our businesses.","Free cash flow was $273 million and we returned $281 million to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases. The annual dividend was increased 16% to $1.16 per share by our shareholders last month at our annual general meeting. This increase will be effective with the June dividend payment. This represents the fourth consecutive year of double-digit dividend increases.","Our orders increased 4% organically in the quarter and our book-to-bill was 1.03, excluding Sub Commp. Orders growth was broad based with growth in all regions and in line with our expectations.","For the full year we are raising the midpoint of our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.03 to $3.78. This is an increase of $0.17 versus our prior year performance. In the second half we expect solid growth in the transportation markets and continued steady improvement in most of our industrial markets. This, coupled with our strong F2Q performance, will more than offset continued delays in Sub Comm projects.","The $3.78 compares to our original guidance six months ago of $3.65, a 13% increase. We entered this fiscal year expecting to deliver strong results and are on track to beat those original expectations. ","Please turn to Slide 4. We announced the planned acquisition of the SEACON Group on April 2nd. This transaction is another step in strengthening our leadership in higher growth harsh environment applications. SEACON has a 50-year history of supplying connectivity solutions for underwater applications, one of the harshest environments where superior quality and performance are required. Their leading portfolio of products and technologies is a very complimentary fit with our existing solutions for the underwater oil & gas markets.","We currently have a nice business of about $150 million in revenue that has had solid double-digit growth over the last five years. The addition of SEACON will add over $115 million of revenue and bring our total business to $250 million. We\u2019ll also double our served market to over 1 billion. We expect to continue to generate double-digit revenue growth in this market going forward as this acquisition positions us with the leading product offering.","I first had the opportunity to meet the owners of SEACON several years ago. They have built a great business and an outstanding team. The acquisition is expected to be accretive in year one excluding one-time costs and will be reported in the Aerospace, Defense, Oil & Gas business within our Industrial Solutions segment. ","We\u2019re very excited to welcome the SEACON group to TE. As we mentioned in our press release we expect the acquisition to be finalized in the current fiscal year. Terrence Curtin, who is the President of our Industrial Solutions segment is here and available for questions on this subject in the Q&A section.","I\u2019ll now provide some detail by business within each segment in the next four slides. Unless I indicate otherwise all changes are on an organic basis which excludes the effects of currencies, acquisitions, and divestitures. Please turn to Slide 5.","Transportation had another great quarter. Sales of $1.57 billion were up 13% over the prior year and orders were up 7% with a booked to bill of 1.0. Global auto demand continues to be solid and auto production in Europe was up both sequentially and versus the prior year driven by exports and importantly improving global demand.","Global vehicle production in the quarter was about 21.5 million units, up 5% from last year. Revenue from the industrial transportation business was again very strong in the quarter due to overall strength in the truck market and the impact of emissions standards changes in Europe and China. And just a comment, our TE and Deutsche Industrial Transportation businesses are now fully integrated and performing very, very well.","Transportation revenues grew double digits in all regions this quarter. Europe was up 12% as I mentioned earlier due to strong exports and improvement in local demand, and in Europe new car registrations were up in the March quarter.","In the Americas revenues were up 10% due to continued solid demand and share gain. Asia revenues were up 18%, with a 34% increase in our business in China and 12% in Japan. We\u2019re the leader in China and continue to grow faster than the market. We continue to invest aggressively in talent and capacity there to further strengthen this position.","Our margin improvement was due to a combination of favorable mix with heavy trucks in the industrial transportation market, the operating leverage that came with our volume increases and productivity improvements driven by our TEOA program.","As I mentioned last quarter we expect revenue growth in mid- to high-single digits in the second half as we do expect some moderation in the year-over-year auto production growth rates, which is typical. We expect adjusted margins to remain at or above the 20% level.","Please turn to Page 6. Market demand in the Industrial Solutions segment was in line with our expectations in F2Q. Revenues were up 4% and orders were up 2% versus the prior year. We are seeing a continued recovery in the industrial equipment business, with revenues up 8% driven by demand in the factory automation and high-speed rail markets. The commercial aerospace and oil & gas markets were up 5% and continue to have strong demand. We expect this to continue for the balance of the year.","As expected, our energy business was down slightly in the quarter as demand softened, particularly with emerging market customers in Europe. Adjusted operating margins continue to improve and were up 70 basis points versus the prior year as a result of the increased volumes, the benefits of accelerated restructuring and productivity increases. Looking forward we expect another good quarter in F3Q with sales up mid-single digits versus the prior year and continuing margin improvement.","Please turn to Page 7. Sales in the Network segment were down about 1% versus the prior year. This was mostly in line with our guidance except further weakness in the Sub Comm business caused by additional project delays. Excluding Sub Comm sales were up 2% organically.","The Telecom Networks business grew 6% in the quarter driven by increased investment in fiber optic networks particularly in Europe. The Enterprise business was up 5% due primarily to strength in the Americas. Our Data Comm business was down 7% in line with our expectations.","The Sub Comm business is very slow as the timing of awarded projects coming into force continues to delay. We now project second half revenue of $150 million with full-year expectations down about $100 million from our prior guidance and from prior year. And due to these delays in the current quarter we are anticipating a loss in Sub Comm in F3Q.","On a positive note, the AAE1 project which was announced yesterday, and this is a major project that connects Asia with Europe worth more than $500 million, came into force last week and we expect to begin the project late in the quarter. And when we say \u201ccame into force\u201d that means we\u2019ve got a sizable down payment. ","This has been a very tough year in the Sub Comm market but we are very well positioned with our wins over the last two years, and I remain confident that demand for bandwidth will drive another build cycle.","Adjusted operating margins in the segment were down slightly versus the prior year driven by the sales decline in Sub Comm and Data Comm. We do expect seasonal second half pickup in the Telecom and Data Comm businesses. Overall segment revenue should be up about 10% versus the first half.","So to digest the Networks business, the Telecom, Wireless and Enterprise businesses which comprise about $2 billion annual revenue are growing again this year after a couple years\u2019 of decline and margins for the year will be double digits. Sub Comm is we believe at the very bottom now and the Data Comm business is starting to level out. And on a positive note there are investments in high-speed solutions that are starting to take hold.","Please turn to Slide 8. Revenue in our Consumer Solutions business was down 3% versus the prior year. This was in line with our expectations as lower customer demand in the consumer devices business more than offset growth of 5% in the appliances business. We continue to see improving trends in the appliance market where we have the leading market share and very attractive operating margins.","Adjusted operating margins in the segment were similar to the prior year despite the revenue decline due to the restructuring savings and metals tailwinds. In F3Q we expect revenues to be up slightly versus the prior year.","Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Bob to cover the financials in more detail.","Bob Hau","Thanks, Tom, and good morning everyone. Let me discuss earnings which start on Slide 9.","Adjusted operating income was $532 million, up 20% versus the prior year. GAAP operating income was $510 million and included $21 million of restructuring charges, 35% of which was in the Networks segment, and $1 million of acquisition-related charges in the quarter. We continue to anticipate full-year restructuring charges of approximately $50 million for the full year.","Adjusted operating margin was 15.5%, up 190 basis points from F2Q last year. The improvement versus the prior year is driven by the 6% organic sales growth, productivity from TEOA, cost savings from restructuring actions taken the last couple of years, and favorable metals costs.","Adjusted EPS was $0.95 and GAAP EPS was $0.87 for the quarter. GAAP EPS included $0.03 of restructuring and other charges and $0.05 of charges related to the legacy shared tax liabilities. These tax charges are consistent with our overall expectations of settlement of these pre-separation tax issues.","Turning to Slide 10, our gross margin in the quarter was 34.2%. This is a 200 basis point increase versus the prior year due to volume increases, increased productivity from our TEOA Lean programs, and a cost savings from restructuring and metals. ","Total OPEX spending was $641 million in the quarter, which was up 5% versus the prior year. The increase resulted primarily from increased investments in sales and marketing and increased variable compensation costs, partially offset by cost savings attributed to restructuring actions.","On the right side of this slide, net interest expense was $26 million in the quarter and I expect $26 million to $27 million of expense in both F3Q and F4Q going forward. Adjusted other income, which primarily relates to our tax sharing agreement, was $2 million. In F3Q I expect other income of about $8 million.","The adjusted effective tax rate was 21.7% which was lower than expected. This is partially offset by the lower other income and gave us a net benefit of about $0.02 to earnings per share. Overall the adjusted tax rate for the first half of the year was 23.8% and I expect the adjusted tax rate to be in the 24.0% range through the remainder of the fiscal year.","Turning to Slide 11 I\u2019ll discuss our balance sheet and free cash flow. Cash from continuing operations was $453 million and our free cash flow in F2Q was $273 million. Net capital spending during the quarter was $159 million or 4.6% of sales and I continue to expect the capital spending rate to be approximately 4.0% to 5.0% of sales for the full year.","Receivable days outstanding were 63 days and inventory days on hand were 73 days, each up two days versus the prior year. Inventory levels were slightly elevated as we expect increased revenues in a number of our businesses in the second half.","Now let me discuss sources and uses of cash outside of free cash flow, shown on the right side of this slide. We began and ended the quarter with $1.4 billion of cash. During the quarter we returned a total of $281 million to shareholders. We paid dividends of $102 million and repurchased about 3.1 million shares for $179 million. As Tom mentioned earlier we expect the SEACON acquisition of $490 million to close in the current fiscal year. Outstanding debt remained at $3 billion at the end of the quarter. ","Now I\u2019ll turn it back to Tom.","Tom Lynch","Thanks, Bob. Please turn to Slide 12 and I\u2019ll cover our outlook. Based on the trends I discussed earlier we expect F3Q revenue of $3.54 billion to $3.64 billion, up 3% to 6%. The project delays in Sub Comm are negatively impacting our growth rates by approximately 1%. We expect adjusted EPS of $0.96 to $1.00 which is an increase of 9% to 14% over the prior year.","In F3Q we expect continued strong results from both the Transportation and Industrial segment. The Consumer segment is expected to be up slightly, and Networks excluding Sub Comm is expected to be about flat versus the prior year.","Please turn to Slide 13. For the full year we expect revenue of $13.8 billion to $14.1 billion, up 4% to 6% versus the prior year. We expect adjusted EPS of $3.72 to $3.84, an increase of 15% to 19%. Relative to prior guidance the story is Transportation is stronger and Sub Comm is weaker.","We expect to have another very strong year of cash flow and we\u2019re using that cash in a manner that is consistent with the plan we have discussed over the last several years, namely investing to grow the business organically with investments in manufacturing capability and capacity in emerging markets as well as increased investments in R&D and sales and marketing, strategic acquisitions like the SEACON Group that accelerate growth in attractive markets and returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase. ","Just to close I\u2019m encouraged by the positive signs in most of our markets we serve and feel very good about our overall execution. I really believe we\u2019re well positioned for future growth and expect to deliver strong performance for the remainder of the fiscal year and beyond. So now let\u2019s open it up for questions.","","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator instructions.) And our first question comes from the line of Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Mark Delaney \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thanks very much for taking the question. Tom, I was hoping if first you could elaborate a little bit more on the outlook for the Sub Comm business. I understand it\u2019s weaker in the near term but you also mentioned a new award coming into force, and maybe you can help us understand with the order pipeline what that implies for revenue potential in the subsea business as you start to think into F2015.","Tom Lynch","Thanks, Mark. As you know we\u2019re not really going to talk about F2015 until the end of the year but in the Sub Comm business, there\u2019s really three components of the business. The biggest part is building the communications systems and that\u2019s the piece that\u2019s really down right now because of the project push-outs. The smaller pieces are maintenance and our oil & gas business which is fairly steady. And this AAE1 award which we were awarded many months ago but it took a while to come into force is good news but it\u2019s happening a lot later than we thought, which means that we\u2019re underutilizing our assets right now.","As that comes into force late this quarter, early next quarter, we believe that\u2019ll start to ramp. There\u2019s several other projects that we\u2019ve been awarded that are close to coming into force but they\u2019ve also been taking longer. So I think once we get two to three projects to complement sort of the ongoing business, then we\u2019ll start to ride up the upswing of the cycle.","Mark Delaney \u2013 Goldman Sachs","That makes sense, thank you for that. And then for my follow-up question I\u2019m hoping we can get a little more detail on the recently proposed acquisition of SEACON. I mean what are the expectations there in terms of margins and if you plan to do any restructuring in that business, or if it\u2019s already having a cost structure that you expect it to have longer term.","Tom Lynch","I\u2019ll say a few things and then I\u2019ll ask Terrence to elaborate. I\u2019d say this isn\u2019t really a cost synergy play; this is an expanded market play. So we\u2019re really doubling the size of our served market and bringing a full system now to the customer. So that\u2019s the attractive part and it\u2019s higher than company margins for sure because of the very highly engineered and extreme harsh environment nature of the business. Terrence, do you want to elaborate on that?","Terrence Curtin","Sure, Tom. Hello everyone. When you look at SEACON, I think a couple of things maybe to paint a picture of where we play today in the underwater space from an interconnect perspective and what SEACON brings to us. First off, when you look at our position today we\u2019re exposed to about a $400 million market which is very focused on high-performance cable as well as connections around the power element.","SEACON very nicely has about $115 million of revenue. It is extremely profitable; about 30% plus EBITDA, and when you look at it it really opens up our market from $400 million to over $1 billion as Tom said. So what they bring is really along the optical and fiber side, connections that happen underwater \u2013 they\u2019re very wet-matable. And when we look at this market overall we\u2019ve been able to basically grow our small position from $70 million to over $150 million today. ","What it really does is give us a rounded out portfolio in some of the harshest environments, and we believe with the combined portfolio, with the trends we see in underwater and oil & gas, we\u2019ll be able to continue to grow the combined well north of double-digit growth going forward. So we\u2019re happy with the acquisition and what it brings.","To Tom\u2019s point it is very much around growth and really making sure we capitalize on this market that is a very fast-growing market, and one of the fastest in the industrial space from a segment perspective.","Mark Delaney \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Next we\u2019ll go to the line of Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Wamsi Mohan \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes, thank you, good morning. Tom, in Networks you\u2019ve been divesting $20 million or so of revenues each quarter over the last two quarters. Can you tell us what these underperforming assets are and how much more there is to go? And I have a follow-up.","Tom Lynch","Sure, thanks Wamsi. In Data Comm we did that last year and we\u2019re coming to the end of the compare, but we were in for a long time the magnetics business \u2013 basically coils that are used to help set frequencies in these products, really a commodity product that had a number of competitors. So it just didn\u2019t fit the kind of highly engineered criteria that we have for our business.","You take that out, the business is down single digits. Some of that is market; some of that is clearly we\u2019re kind of a mid-tier player in the current 15 GB speeds, but that\u2019s pretty much behind us, the exit of product lines in that business.","Wamsi Mohan \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay great, thanks. And in the Networks business clearly Sub Comm has a large negative impact on margins, but can you give us some sense how the ex-Sub Comm margins trended in the segment in the current quarter and how much restructuring benefits flowed into this quarter? Thanks.","Tom Lynch","Yeah, I\u2019d say just generally commenting on the comments, the Telecom, Enterprise and Wireless piece, which we would think of together as our broadband business, which is about a $2 billion annual business, margins trended up in the quarter and they\u2019re trending up in the year. And that business as I said was down 4% last year; it\u2019s up 4% this year and that\u2019s two thirds of the segment.","In Data Comm margins are still down. That\u2019s really two components: our core connector business is improving and we\u2019re making a sizable investment in high-speed copper and fiber because that\u2019s where the world is going. And we want to lead there, and early wins position us well but that\u2019s not going to become serious revenue for a few years. And the Sub Comm margins are way down because the volume\u2019s way down.","Wamsi Mohan \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it, thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Next we\u2019ll go to the line of Mike Wood with Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Mike Wood \u2013 Macquarie Capital","Hi, thank you. In Automotive, your view for 1% to 2% EMEA growth for next quarter, I\u2019m curious how that floats with the kind of mid-single digit growth we\u2019re seeing in vehicle registrations in Western Europe exiting the quarter roughly at a 10% growth rate. I\u2019m curious what the production versus demand trends are you\u2019re seeing there.","Tom Lynch","Yeah, you\u2019re talking about the production growth in Europe.","Mike Wood \u2013 Macquarie Capital","Yes.","Tom Lynch","Yeah, I mean that\u2019s what the industry\u2019s projecting right now and it\u2019s corroborated by what our customers are guiding us on to produce relative to local production. But remember we have consistently grown in Europe as well as some of the higher-end vehicle makers there because so much of their product is exported. ","I think what\u2019s really positive about this is there\u2019s absolutely overall growth in Europe locally, so that says that the economy\u2019s, you know, it\u2019s not robust by any stretch but it\u2019s improving and that\u2019s broadening the base of car sales over there; whereas we\u2019ve really benefitted up until the last two quarters by the export market which is a high content market. This is putting a broader base on it.","Mike Wood \u2013 Macquarie Capital","Okay, and can you also comment on there was a large telco carrier in the US that just announced plans to roll out fiber in the US in a number of cities \u2013 what trends just that you\u2019re seeing overall in terms of the fiber deployment and whether or not you\u2019re seeing any pricing pressure in that segment as those carriers increase CAPEX in that area.","Tom Lynch","Mike, it\u2019s really a carrier-by-carrier thing around the world. So that particular carrier you\u2019re talking about, well we do well with all the carriers in the US and we\u2019re benefitting from that. A little more pricing pressure than normal, which with the fiber volume up\u2026 This is the second year in a row where the fiber portion in the Networks, our revenue is up double digits. ","And one interesting thing that\u2019s happening in that market is the copper piece is finally getting to a small enough piece where the decline in copper isn\u2019t directly offsetting fiber, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re starting to see the growth because carriers are investing in the fiber portion of the business. And that 4% I talked about, that 4% to 5% that we expect to grow this year, that\u2019s closer to high-single digits in fiber. So we are definitely seeing it.","There\u2019s a lot of positive trends I would say \u2013 new players announcing they\u2019re going to build fiber networks, net neutrality kind of wearing down in the US, of course just the tremendous requirement for more bandwidth. So the trends look better right now, feel better, are better I would say \u2013 those underlying trends \u2013 than they have been for a long time as drivers for our part of the business, so we\u2019re optimistic but we need to see it turn into a higher revenue growth rate for sure.","Mike Wood \u2013 Macquarie Capital","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And now we\u2019ll go to the line of Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Amit Daryanani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Perfect, thanks, good morning guys. Two questions from me, one just on capital allocation \u2013 can you just touch on your capital allocation thought process as you get through the back of the year, or given the fact that you have to have a cash outlay of $490 million for SEACON does that change the buyback process on a go forward basis at all?","Bob Hau","Thanks, Amit, this is Bob. Overall as you know our capital strategy is broadly set around continuing strong free cash flow which we anticipate will approximate net income out into the future; and that allows us to fund the capital requirements of the business. In order of priority we\u2019ll continue to fund organically \u2013 that\u2019s capital investments as well as R&D that we spend 4% to 5% of sales and capital. We spend about 5% in R&D and we anticipate that continuing out into the future.","After the organic investments we\u2019re certainly looking for value-creating strategic acquisitions. And then long-term over a period of time we expect two thirds of our cash to go back to shareholders through dividends which we\u2019ve been increasing as earnings increase \u2013 a s Tom pointed out in the upfront comments four years in a row of double-digit increases, and as recently as last month a 16% increase for the annual dividend. And we also do share buyback.","And the SEACON acquisition perfectly aligned with that strategy. It\u2019s a $500 million, $490 million of cash outflow, we\u2019ll pay with cash on the balance sheet.","Amit Daryanani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Got it. And I guess, Tom, I was wondering if you could maybe spend some time talking about how do you think about divestures broadly on a go-forward basis or when to deemphasize parts of your business? I recall that when you guys had actually spun out a telco divesture is actually a very big part of the story of how you guys were able to improve margins. I\u2019m curious, as you look at your portfolio, especially the networking piece of your business or parts of it, how do you evaluate divestures on a go-forward basis?","Tom Lynch","Well, a couple ways, Amit. I think first and foremost when we came out and looked at the portfolio and shored up the strategy around connectivity there had to be a couple criteria, right? It had to be related to the strengths we had. So we weren\u2019t interested if the most part of the business had no relation to the rest of the businesses and we couldn\u2019t leverage our strengths, so that\u2019s why we did quite a bit. I\u2019d say the portfolio we have now is all related to connectivity, and when you think of the internet of things there\u2019s the network that enables that and there\u2019s everything that\u2019s connected to it, and we\u2019re right in the middle of both of those.","So we like that position very much. Networks has been a slow business for sure the last couple years but I\u2019m still very bullish on the underlying dynamics, all the things I mentioned on the last question, that say they\u2019re going to drive it. So if you look at the telecom, enterprise, wireless, you\u2019ve got to push fiber more into the network. And even if you don\u2019t believe in fiber to the home, high bandwidth to the home with a small cell network requires a lot more fiber than you have today.","G.fast, you know, what\u2019s coming in the next generation, call it very, very, very, very fast DSL in the next couple years, needs to be much closer to the home which needs to have a fiber connection to upload it. And then as you just get LTE all over the place you need a much more robust fiber backhaul to take advantage of it.","So when we look at all those qualities we say there\u2019s going to be investment. We\u2019re starting to see signs of it picking up. We\u2019re seeing a much more broad base of that around the world. So we haven\u2019t changed our fundamental strategic view of the business, so we haven\u2019t changed how we see it fitting in the portfolio.","Amit Daryanani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Got it. I guess, Tom, initially you made a comment saying you guys are very well positioned in about 90% of the markets you serve. I guess I was curious of what are the 10% you think you\u2019re not well positioned in and is that the divesture potential for you guys?","Tom Lynch","Well those two are consumer devices, so that\u2019s about $700 million of revenue where we\u2019re not a lead player there and we don\u2019t have the best sockets. But that\u2019s such a, it\u2019s a core business to us. I mean we do everything there we do every place else, so it\u2019s the same capital, same material, etc. And I\u2019ll say Data Comm but in Data Comm we have tremendous momentum around the next generation of high speed, with the product and the product\u2019s in the market, the product\u2019s been selected by a variety of customers. ","Now the transition from the current speeds that are out there in datacenters and in the wireless network higher speed takes time, but what I\u2019m really excited about there is the decisions we made over four or five years to develop high speed, they have some proof points now. I\u2019d say both of those businesses are core connector businesses, right? They are part of the h$10.5 billion of what you\u2019d refer to as the Connector business, and that business end-to-end\u2026 Some businesses are stronger than others but overall it\u2019s an incredibly strong business.","Amit Daryanani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Perfect, thanks a lot.","Tom Lynch","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Thank you. And next we\u2019ll go to the line of Matt Sheerin with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Matt Sheerin \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co.","Yes, thanks and good morning. Just a couple of questions from me: on the Industrial Solutions business you had nice year-over-year improvement in operating margin. As you look forward through the rest of the fiscal year do you think you can get those margins to the company average around 15%? And is that coming mostly from leverage on volume or is there more restructuring benefits from that?","Tom Lynch","I\u2019d say it\u2019s a combination of things. Clearly the most important thing is volume, but we feel as I mentioned in my earlier comments, we feel good about the momentum and the order rates we\u2019ve seen for the last three quarters continuing into this quarter, support continuing, revenue growth \u2013 we\u2019re in that kind of 4% to 6% revenue growth. That business has very nice operating leverage with the improvements over the last couple of years. ","So yeah, we expect the margin to continue to march up and I think as we said at Investor Day we see that as a business that over the next couple of years is well over the 15% company average that we have today. So we\u2019re very bullish on that business both from a growth aspect and the markets that we play in and the products we have as well as the improvements in operating leverage that\u2019ll deliver higher margins.","Matt Sheerin \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co.","Okay, thanks. And Bob, you mentioned in your commentary about metals, lower metals costs having a benefit on your gross margin. Can you help quantify that either year-over-year or sequentially and how does that impact your model going forward?","Bob Hau","Yeah, year-over-year it was about $17 million, $18 million in the current quarter, F2Q. And we expect about $15 million to $20 million per quarter in the second half of the year, consistent with prior guidance.","Matt Sheerin \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co.","And you\u2019re not seeing any impact on pricing as customers see the benefit of those, the Euro benefits where they\u2019re asking for lower pricing in pass through? ","Tom Lynch","Hi Matt, this is Tom. I would say price erosion is up a little bit so it\u2019s hard, you can\u2019t completely look at those two disconnected. The business doesn\u2019t work with kind of across the board increases or decreases; it tends to be negotiation by negotiation. But net of the two it\u2019s a net benefit I\u2019d say because the price erosion increase is less than the benefit we\u2019re getting. If you were to just simply say they take out all the metal tailwinds benefit, how are we doing? We\u2019re still slightly above 15%.","Matt Sheerin \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co.","Okay, thanks a lot.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Shawn Harrison from Longbow Research. Please go ahead.","Shawn Harrison \u2013 Longbow Research","Good morning, Tom. Back of the envelope is it about maybe a $0.03 earnings headwind versus kind of your expectations? And then just also if you could maybe size the total programs, I guess the one that came into force and the ones that could potentially come into force in the next couple quarters?","Tom Lynch","Are you talking about Sub Comm, Shawn?","Shawn Harrison \u2013 Longbow Research","Yes.","Tom Lynch","It\u2019s in that range, yeah \u2013 it\u2019s $0.03 to $0.04 from where [we were] in the quarter.","Shawn Harrison \u2013 Longbow Research","Okay, and just the size of the program that came into force as well as the ones coming into force as far as the opportunity.","Tom Lynch","The one that came into force is the biggest one we had in the backlog, about $0.5 billion and the others are less than that \u2013 they\u2019re more in the $150 million to $200 million range and coming into force soon. We\u2019ve been awarded and we work closely with the customers, so if they come into force in the next couple of months that will shore up next year and that\u2019ll be better than next year.","Bob Hau","And Shawn, the AAE contract that just came into force, we\u2019ll start that later this quarter and that\u2019ll take us through 2016 to complete that program.","Shawn Harrison \u2013 Longbow Research","Okay. And then just as a follow-up on networks I see where I guess the telecom, the wireless aspect, even the enterprise coming back \u2013 and you have visibility now into a double-digit EBIT margin in the back half of the year. But if I add everything up it looks as if in terms of over the next two years it\u2019s going to be tough to get to a mid-teens EBIT margin without further restructuring. Do you think further restructuring within Networks is possible or is needed to get to let\u2019s say a 15% EBIT margin?","Tom Lynch","I\u2019d answer it this way. If the growth that we expect, seeing signs in Sub Comm, seeing nice signs in broadband and believe that we\u2019re, with the discontinued products and the new products that are coming we should be back into growth in Data Comm. With the restructuring that we\u2019ve done in the last year which is pretty significant, we\u2019ll start to see the benefit with revenues in the segment growing 5% to 6%. ","If for some reason we\u2019re wrong on that growth rate, again, and it\u2019s a smaller business there is the propensity that we won\u2019t need as much infrastructure. But I don\u2019t believe that, but as we\u2019ve done in the past you\u2019ll see we\u2019ll adjust accordingly. We could march it back up to near that mid-15%. It depends on how fast the growth comes back.","Shawn Harrison \u2013 Longbow Research","How much restructuring is left in terms of I guess savings to come into the business over the next let\u2019s say 12 to 18 months, in terms of dollar amount?","Bob Hau","Overall Shawn, we took obviously a significant amount of restructuring last year across the company and spent a little over $300 million. That\u2019s tailing off dramatically, this year about $50 million. Last year if I recall Networks was about 40% of that spend across the organization. As I indicated in my opening comments we took some restructuring charges of about $21 million in the most recently completed quarter, F2Q. About 75% of that was related to Networks.","So as Tom pointed out heavy restructuring is behind us. We expect kind of a net benefit of $115 million of run rate savings in 2015 from those restructuring actions. We\u2019re getting about $70 million to $80 million this year, so an incremental $40 million next year.","Shawn Harrison \u2013 Longbow Research","And the spend would be equivalent to the saves in terms of just ballparking a percentage.","Bob Hau","Correct, that\u2019s probably fair.","Shawn Harrison \u2013 Longbow Research","Gotcha, thanks so much, Bob, and congrats guys on the progress in the quarter.","Bob Hau","Thanks, Shawn.","Operator","Thank you. And next we\u2019ll go to the line of Amitabh Passi from UBS. Please go ahead.","Amitabh Passi \u2013 UBS ","Hi, thank you. Tom, I wanted to try the portfolio question from a slightly different vantage point. If I look at Network solutions and I look at energy networks along with Consumer, these have been segments that have been quite challenging. You did talk about Network solutions improving. But I\u2019m curious, as you think about M&A is there opportunity to further bolster these segments or do you think this is largely a volume-related weakness, that as business and demand trends improve these segments do better? Or do you see M&A potential as well in telecom networks and energy networks?","Tom Lynch","Let me take each of those real quick individually. Energy I would say we\u2019ve always looked at and been interested in M&A in that business. Really it\u2019s been slow; it really follows the economy and we expect its growth to resume. It\u2019s been especially slow in Europe but it\u2019s a good business, it\u2019s a good cash generation business, a business that\u2019s right around the company average margin and that margin has been improving. Whenever we grow 3% to 4% we see a nice margin lift, so I\u2019d consider that a nice solid business that\u2019s steady contribution.","Consumer, I don\u2019t see M&A in Consumer. I think that\u2019s really we have to win more sockets as we would say and more strategic sockets. I think we\u2019ve really upgraded some areas where we were very weak in that business which was operationally. We have what I consider a crackerjack operational team there now and we just have to persevere with the designs and get some design wins there, and that\u2019s revenue related. You\u2019re absolutely right \u2013 we need to grow more revenue there.","And the third one was Networks in general, telecom, wireless. I don\u2019t see anything significant in M&A there because in our push to the network, I mean we made the move to take leadership in fiber when we acquired ADC. And while the revenue hasn\u2019t materialized like we thought, the insurance policy, the cost side, we\u2019ve taken a ton of costs out. So we feel that business, we\u2019re well positioned in our portion of the network. ","We really do have the best fiber, the best connectivity product line across the world. We see it in the high win rate we have \u2013 that\u2019s a volume play. That\u2019s a very nice gross margin business that\u2019s higher than the company average gross margins so that\u2019s a leverage play and we\u2019re starting to see signs of this 4% growth range this year. So they\u2019re all kind of in a little bit different perspective but that\u2019s at a high level way to think about it.","Amitabh Passi \u2013 UBS ","Got it. And then just as a quick follow-up, I was intrigued by your comment where you\u2019d said even if you\u2019re not a believer in fiber to the home. And I just wanted to get a sense from you, are you seeing a preference for wireless alternatives or next-gen copper alternatives which seems counter to some of the gigabit Ethernet movement that we\u2019re seeing the industry, or I thought we were seeing maybe the industry pivot back to where it\u2019s fiber to the home. So I would love to get your thoughts there.","Tom Lynch","It\u2019s mixed. I mean when we look at our business we know we need to be able to support multiple different network architectures, and they range from kind of HFC, the cable side going deeper, you know, the normal cable networks going deeper with more fiber \u2013 we\u2019re benefitting from that. Some carriers really believe in fiber deep and fiber to the home. I\u2019d say they\u2019re benefitting from that.","DSL is really not sufficient anymore but it takes time to change it, and that\u2019s what you\u2019re hearing from one of the carriers, that they\u2019re going to get very aggressive in response to another new carrier\/search company. Around the world it\u2019s different. There\u2019s parts of Europe where they\u2019re aggressively building fiber to the home, and there\u2019s other parts that are waiting for G.fast which is the super-fast VDSL, but that requires more fiber. There\u2019s Australia\/New Zealand building fiber to the home and even with the changing government, while that\u2019s slowed down a bit it\u2019s probably going to be more selective with fiber to the home but fiber deep.","But if you\u2019re going to deliver, if content providers \u2013 like they\u2019re negotiating now for dedicated bandwidth for the carriers, you\u2019re going to have to push fiber deeper into the network to get that because LTE does have some limitations. So I think it\u2019s kind of timing of investments but we are starting to see a little more positive signs, and we\u2019re optimistic that maybe this cycle on our end of the network \u2013 which I\u2019d call the bandwidth-rich portion of the network \u2013 is starting to come back. But we need to see that consistently before I\u2019m comfortable that it\u2019s actually here.","Amitabh Passi \u2013 UBS ","Excellent, thank you.","Tom Lynch","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Thank you, and next we\u2019ll go to the line of Jim Suva from Ciri. Please go ahead. ","Jim Suva \u2013 Citigroup ","Thanks very much. A stickler clarification point and then my two questions: on the clarification, I assume or maybe let me know if I\u2019m right or wrong that the pending acquisition of SEACON is not in your sales and EPS outlook because it\u2019s still pending? Or maybe I\u2019m wrong with that. ","And then along with that questioning, can you help us understand the margin profile of this businesses? It seems like it would be accretive to your margins but I\u2019m just not sure on that. And do you have to do any cost realignments with them? Like are they located physically where some of your plants are and you can integrate the two plants together? Are we looking at another round of restructuring or is it sound, everyone\u2019s quite happy with how you have it? ","And then my second question is on a different topic about the consumer side, is you\u2019ve kind of been talking about trying to get some wins for quite some time organically. It seems like either it\u2019s not happening or you\u2019ve got the wins and they\u2019re going to come. But can you help us understand is your confidence there a lot higher or is there still just a lot of wood to chop or a lot more effort still to turn around the Consumer business which has been underperforming for multiple years?","Bob Hau","Yeah, Jim, it\u2019s Bob. On SEACON you are correct \u2013 we do not have an impact from the acquisition in our outlook. We expect that deal to close still later this year and it will close late enough in the year that it will have zero to negligible impact on the overall results for F2014. Obviously we expect it to close this fiscal year and so there\u2019ll be an impact in F2015.","In terms of margin profile and our plans for restructuring sort of thing, I\u2019ll turn it back to Terrence to address that one.","Terrence Curtin","Thanks, Bob and Jim, it\u2019s Terrence. In relation to your question, yes, SEACON as Tom covered on the slide is about $115 million in revenue and has above 30% EBITDA. So from your viewpoint yes, it will be above company average margins of both the segment and the company in that regard.","When we look at what they do, this is not a cost play. So when you look at restructuring there is no big restructuring or plant consolidations in relation to this acquisition. It\u2019s really around growth but certainly I\u2019m sure there\u2019ll be some acquisition costs that Bob and Keith will call out to you just due to typical acquisition things but not restructuring.","Tom Lynch","And Jim, on the Consumer side I would say we\u2019re performing better in the newer parts of the market but it\u2019s not enough to move the needle yet. So let me elaborate a bit on that. The PC and feature phone business part of Consumer is still bigger than the tablet and smartphone business, and the PC and feature phone business which is where we still have a little better position in a market that\u2019s shrinking \u2013 but that\u2019s going to cross over sometime in the next year.","But we\u2019re growing almost at the market in tablets and smartphones but it\u2019s just not enough to move the meter. So we have won some significant awards but it\u2019s still not big enough yet to grow the business. So I\u2019d say we\u2019re better in terms of our talent, our engineering, the products we\u2019re bringing out but it\u2019s going to still take us a while to move the performance up.","Jim Suva \u2013 Citigroup ","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And next we\u2019ll go to the line of William Stein with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","William Stein \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey ","Great, thank you for taking my question. I\u2019m wondering if you can talk about in the Automotive segment any effect from the EURO 6 implementation regarding particulate emissions that comes into force later this year? Is that having any effect on the business today?","Tom Lynch","We see it for sure and especially in the truck market, so in a couple areas. It\u2019s more content. We said earlier in the year we saw some pull forward as is typically what happens when there\u2019s a change in standard if a customer has the ability to pull some spending forward that costs them less they\u2019ll do that. So we saw a benefit from that. ","What we\u2019ve been pleasantly surprised by is that it\u2019s still, the demand is still strong \u2013 stronger than what we would have expected at this time of year six months ago, which reflects I think more economics underlying that meaning things are picking up and people are investing. And the fundamental benefit of the emissions standard is it\u2019s more electronics and it\u2019s more content for us, so yes, we\u2019re starting to see the benefit of that.","William Stein \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey ","Great. And then the follow-up is again on the subsea business, not wanting to beat a dead horse but this business has surprised you to the downside this year. You obviously have a better view into your business than we do so you have ways to look at it and forecast it that should be superior to ours, but what can we look at when we understand that your position is very strong in this market, you\u2019re doing very well in terms of winning mandates but the projects aren\u2019t coming into force. Is that an interest rate related thing, a credit related thing, a network bandwidth related issue? How can we think about the likelihood of more of these projects coming into force?","Tom Lynch","Well, there\u2019s multiple factors. The interesting thing, on one hand it\u2019s a finite number of projects but on the other hand each project could be affected by different things. So pre financial crisis till now, one of the things in a project that has to happen for a project to get funded, if it\u2019s a consortium or a group of entrepreneurs as we would call it, the bandwidth has to be presold. It used to be you could presell 60%, 70% and get the project funded. Now you have to sell 100% to 120%. It\u2019s taking longer for that.","I think in general what you see, the carriers who were really drivers four or five years ago are less so today. It\u2019s a function of where they\u2019re putting their investment so that\u2019s the [landscape]. So it\u2019s been a variety of things. Where some of these big jobs are coming from \u2013 this last one, its two destination points are Hong Kong I think and France, and 30 branches in between, which the good news is it\u2019s a big job. The challenging news is that\u2019s an awful lot of approvals and permitting, so even if you have your money together you\u2019ve got to make sure you have all that. So that takes a while.","So I\u2019d say there\u2019s a lot of things. When we kick the tires on modeling the bandwidth and making sure something hasn\u2019t happened I think we conclude that you\u2019ve got to build, the next build cycle is coming. Just to put it in perspective, the last cycle from trough to trough was twelve years. If you look at the trough of the last cycle to where we are right now, 2014, it was actually a twelve-year cycle; and trough to peak can typically be seven to eight years. ","And in that twelve years you typically have three or four what I\u2019d call tough years and three or four good years and three or four great years, and over the cycle it\u2019s a good business that really is a nice contributor to the company, well above cost of capital. We believe that this 2014 is that next real trough, and it\u2019s higher than the last trough because there\u2019s just more building and we have this oil & gas adjacency that we didn\u2019t have early in the last cycle. So it\u2019s been a little tough to forecast for us for sure.","I think the last point I\u2019d make about putting it in perspective, if you look at last year the business contributed $0.06 to $0.07 a share, roughly 2% of our total earnings per share. This year it\u2019s going to be a negative 1% earnings per share because of F3Q. So I think it\u2019s down. The volatility is still high but the impact is low, and if things start to ramp up again we should see steady contributions. ","If the AAE1 deal had not signed I\u2019d be a lot more nervous. That\u2019s a big deal. That\u2019ll get us going and then what we\u2019ve also seen in the up-cycles, it\u2019s not a perfect predictor but when a big job like this goes it tends to mobilize the other ones because there is a limited amount of [shipped] capacity. So this was, getting this job\u2026 We\u2019ve got to go through the valley in F3Q in this business but getting this job is a big, big step up; and then we\u2019ve got to get a couple other, two of these to come into force and we work hard to help our customers do that.","William Stein \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey ","That\u2019s helpful, thanks Tom.","Tom Lynch","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Next we\u2019ll go to the line of Steven Fox from Cross Research. Please go ahead.","Steven Fox \u2013 Cross Research","Thanks, good morning. Just a couple quick questions, first on the Auto side: Tom, you mentioned some market share gains. I was wondering if you could elaborate on that as well as some more aggressive investments in China for Auto and whether that\u2019s also driving market share gains? And then secondly with regard to the acquisition, I was just curious if you could just discuss a little bit how well positioned or not well positioned they are from a distribution standpoint and whether there could be some sales synergies there like you\u2019ve seen with Deutsche. Thanks.","Tom Lynch","On the Auto side as you know we are strong in every region. If you go back in time four or five years really our weakest region was the US, and the downturn was extremely painful but it gave us the opportunity because in this part of the value chain we\u2019re the leader. We invested in the US when it was down. We did things like adjust our cost of sales cost structure, but we invested in engineering and we went after programs. And our estimation is we\u2019ve moved our US share up about four points over that time, so that was positive.","In China we provide a very broad range of services and products to our customers. We\u2019ve been expanding our engineering there. Our entire China Automotive team is local. It\u2019s a very seasoned, experienced team. We are expanding our capacity there not only because the market is expanding but because we\u2019re doing more and more there for that market. If you go back in time it was a lot of things imported into the market and we\u2019re reducing that quickly, and that\u2019s part of the footprint adjustment we were doing in Western Europe during the downturn. ","So those two things plus we continue to add engineers across the world in Automotive. It\u2019s a business that\u2019s very\u2026 You know, it\u2019s a lot of projects that you have to work on with the customer and when we\u2019re so strong in all these customers and we keep pouring engineers in, that\u2019s how we\u2019re able to build the 200 million sensor business from nothing when we weren\u2019t in the sensor business. So it is our sweet spot and we keep investing in it aggressively. Terrence, do you want to comment on SEACON again?","Terrence Curtin","Yes, sure. When you look at SEACON, and to your question, Steve, in relationship to channel and distribution \u2013 when you look at this market it is a much more direct market. So where we\u2019re going to sell into and where we sell into today with our current portfolio as well as where SEACON sells into, you\u2019re selling into the manufacturers of the drilling systems, certainly the ROV systems, all the instruments and lights as well as the equipment that goes on the ocean floor. So when you look at it, it\u2019s a much more direct relationship than channel serve.","I think what\u2019s very nice about both our go-to-market position as well as SEACON\u2019s, they have bases in Norway, UK, US, Mexico as well as they also have a nice field service support around the world that supports their product too with people working in the oil & gas industry. So it is a much more direct model than what we saw in Deutsche where we were able to leverage our channel scale. So it\u2019s much more direct than a channel play.","Steven Fox \u2013 Cross Research","Great, thanks very much. I appreciate the color.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question goes to the line of Sherri Scribner from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Sheri Scribner \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Hi, this is (Inaudible) here calling on behalf of Sherri Scribner. Tom, I just had a question for you, actually. In your opening comments you mentioned a majority of the markets are exhibiting solid growth trends. I just wanted to understand what demand trends you\u2019re seeing or do you still see customers as being cautious? Are you seeing any reductions in customer forecasts? Thanks.","Tom Lynch","Thank you. Yeah, let me go through that. So clearly Auto and Industrial Transportation continue to grow, there\u2019s robust growth there. We really haven\u2019t seen that change much. As I mentioned we\u2019ll see that the second half growth year-over-year in those markets will be less than the first half growth \u2013 some of that\u2019s seasonal, some of that is it\u2019s just been hotter than normal in the first half. Industrial equipment is growing with 8% quarter growth, that\u2019s another third or fourth. ","So that\u2019s a sign and you see it in a lot of the industrials reporting that capital spending is starting to break loose. We see that, that seems to be a pretty steady sign right now. I\u2019m not seeing any warning signs that that would change. Commercial aerospace, a lot of new planes being built, the whole fleet being rebuilt and that\u2019s another area where we gain share and our content is up significantly, so we see that. And then the appliance business.","So new home sales in the US and appliance picking up in Asia, particularly China which is a good sign because that\u2019s consumer spending in China. And by the way, I talked about our China business being up 34% in Automotive. It was up 20% plus overall with four of five of our markets up double digits. So it\u2019s fairly broad based.","What\u2019s not growing? I\u2019d say the Data Comm market is not really growing right now and you can see that in other folks who provide that equipment \u2013 it\u2019s certainly not growing for us. Consumer is growing but I talked about the trends, that we\u2019re not fully participating in the trends. And of course the one that\u2019s challenging right now is Sub Comm but that\u2019s just timing in our view and we have a good position there.","So if I compare it to last quarter, if I compare it to this time last year it definitely feels more robust, broader based. If you look at the number of countries that we ship to around the world there\u2019s more where we have higher sales growth this quarter than we did last quarter and last year \u2013 all good signs. I\u2019d say nobody\u2019s celebrating. We\u2019re still very mindful that the last five years have been unpredictable if anything so we keep running the business accordingly.","Sheri Scribner \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay great, thanks, that was helpful. I just also wanted to just follow up on that, just to get an idea on the long-term growth target if you maintain what you have previously provided \u2013 for example, 6% to 8% in Transportation and 4% to 7% in Network, 4% to 6% in Industrial and 3% to 5% in Consumer. Do you still maintain that or do you see a change in that long-term target?","Tom Lynch","That\u2019s still how we see the long term.","","Sheri Scribner \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay great, thank you.","Tom Lynch","You\u2019re welcome. Okay, well thank you everybody. I appreciate you listening. Again, I think this was a real good quarter for us with progress on a number of fronts. I look forward to talking to you soon.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Teleconference.

And thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Before I get into our first quarter results and our guidance for the year, I want to spend a little time recapping the key messages from the Investor Day we held last month in New York. And I really want to thank those of you that joined us. ","As you know, during that investor day, we laid out the strategic direction of TE, as well as our position as an industrial technology leader. ","And in that sense, the key messages we highlighted during investor day, which are shown on slide three of the slide deck we posted this morning really were around, first, we built a portfolio with clear competitive advantages and we are positioned to deliver above-market growth.","Secondly, the markets we serve have attractive secular trends and are benefitting from the content growth across all of our segments. ","Thirdly, when we create value, it's through the work we do with our customers through strong differentiation, very much engineering intimacy through where we design with them in their architecture, and the scale and our leading global presence. ","And lastly, we have a strong business model that has not only the growth levers about the three I just talked about, but also leverage to expand profitability, while when we use the cash from our attractive business model how we maintain an attractive return on capital.","And when we talked about the strong business model, we also laid out targets for you. Targets where we believe the annual organic growth of our business model can be 4% to 6%. We can continue to drive annual margin expansion of 30 to 80 basis points per year as well as double-digit EPS growth.","We also highlighted for you our M&A strategy, which indicated that we can add over 100 basis points per year, which adds to our organic growth through acquisition because of the breadth of the markets we play in.","And as Heath and I, I think, are going to highlight over the next 20 minutes or so, what I'm very pleased about, not only with our strong results in the quarter and updated guidance for the fiscal year, I believe the performance you're seeing demonstrates the key messages that we laid out at investor day and strong execution by our teams that are consistent with the business model we laid out.","So, if you could, let's please turn to slide four and let's get into the results for the quarter.","We again delivered performance above guidance with double-digit growth in revenue and adjusted earnings per share. Sales, during the quarter, were $3.5 billion and this represented 14% reported growth and 8% organic growth year-over-year.","In our Transportation segment, we grew 13% organically with double-digit growth across all three of our businesses.","Industrial Solutions grew 6% organically, driven primarily by continued strength in our industrial equipment applications.","And our Communications segment declined 6% organically year-over-year due to a decline in SubCom, but we did see 10% combined organic growth in our data and devices and appliances businesses in the quarter.","And when I think about last year, we talked about performance across our portfolios, with operating margin expansion across all three segments.","In our first quarter, we delivered record profitability with adjusted operating margins of 17.9%, driven by margin expansion in the Industrial segment, which was one of the key levers we laid out for you at investor day.","Adjusted earnings per share grew a very strong 22% to $1.40, and this is a record on a quarterly basis for our company.","Based upon this very strong start for the full year, we are raising our annual sales and adjusted earnings per share guidance. Our organic growth expectations, we are raising from 4% to 5% for the year, reflecting stronger first half momentum and the second half of the fiscal year that is in line with our prior view.","We are raising our outlook for reported sales from 6% to 8%, reflecting 100 basis points of the organic growth increase and the remaining 100 basis points from the impact of currency exchange rates.","On an adjusted EPS perspective, our expectations, we are raising $0.22 to $5.45 per share, and that represents 13% growth year-over-year, and I'll add more color towards the end of the call around our guidance.","The other thing I want to highlight that we are excited to see is the continued strong momentum in our orders, with organic orders, we're up 22% year-over-year. Excluding SubCom, which had a very strong order quarter, orders were up 11% with growth across all regions.","So, if you can please turn to slide five and let me get into orders in more detail and the trends that we're seeing across orders. We continue to see broad-based strength in orders across all three of our segments, which reinforces our growth outlook.","Total orders, excluding SubCom exceeded $3.5 billion with a book to bill of 1.06. Orders were up 17% year-over-year on a reported basis and up 11% organically.","We also continue to see broad-based strength globally. And once again, excluding SubCom, our orders organically grew 16% in Europe, 15% in the Americas and 3% in Asia.","Turning to segment \u2013 orders by segment. In Transportation, orders increased 13% organically, with growth in all regions and strength especially in Europe, where we saw order growth of 17%. We also saw the year-over-year order growth in each of our three businesses in Transportation.","Industrial orders grew 8% organically year-over-year, with growth across all regions and continued strength in our industrial equipment business.","In Communications, excluding SubCom, we saw year-over-year organic growth of 7% in orders, with growth across all regions.","And then, for SubCom, which we had carved out up till now, we had a very strong booking quarter. Year-to-date, we booked project orders of $400 million, and this has raised our total backlog above $1 billion in SubCom and reinforces the health of the current SubCom market cycle.","So, if you could, let me turn from orders and start getting into our segment results. And as always, we'll start with Transportation.","Transportation sales grew 13% organically year-over-year. Segment revenue exceeded expectations due to strong auto sales across regions. Growth across all submarkets and commercial transportation and 11% organic growth in sensors.","Operating margins were 21%, and this was above our expectations and up 330 basis points sequentially and back to our normalized margin levels of 20% plus or minus midpoint.","In auto specifically, our sales were up 10% organically, significantly above auto production trends that are in the low-single-digits. We are not only benefiting from content growth, but are also benefiting from our leading global position. We had growth in the teens in Europe as well as in the Americas and mid-single growth in Asia.","We also continue to benefit from new program ramps, which contribute to our outperformance versus vehicle production levels.","And also, as we highlighted during investor day, while the hybrid electric and EV market is still a small percentage of overall vehicle production, we continue to be extremely well-positioned with leading-edge solution and wins across all major OEMs across that technology.","Turning to our commercial transportation business, we continue to outperform the market with organic revenue growth of 34% year-over-year, with balanced growth across all regions and growth within each submarket.","While last year, we got the benefit of the trends we saw in heavy trucks, this year, we're seeing continued momentum in heavy truck, as well as we are experiencing growth in agriculture, mining and construction markets globally.","In our sensors business, we grew 11% organically year-on-year with growth across all markets, including auto, commercial transportation and industrial end markets.","As we highlighted for you on investor day, we continue to see strong design win momentum, particularly in auto applications where we've generated $1.2 billion of new design wins over the past two years across many different sensor applications as well as technologies.","So, now, let me turn to the industrial segment, and if you can please turn to slide seven, we'll get into it by business.","On an overall segment basis, sales grew 11% on a reported basis and 6% organically. Operating margins were 14% and expanded 270 basis points year-over-year, driven by strong operating leverage on higher volume.","By business in the segment, in industrial equipment, organic order growth was 17%, with growth across all regions and strength in factory automation and medical applications.","As we mentioned last month, we are focused on high-growth applications such as robotics and interventional medicine. Our strong position in high-growth markets coupled with the acquisitions in these areas are driving strong growth ahead of market.","In our aerospace, defense and marine business, we saw slight organic decline of 2%, which was driven by commercial aerospace. While sales have been impacted by us by project timing over the past couple of quarters, we do expect this business to grow this year with the strong content wins that we highlighted to you during investor day.","And in our energy business, it declined 6% organically, and this is really driven by the weakness in the overall European power market.","So, if you can please turn to slide eight and let me cover Communications Solutions. The segment declined 6% organically due to the ramp up delays in the new SubCom program that I mentioned.","This impact more than offset continued growth momentum in our data and devices and appliance businesses, which had a 10% combined organic growth in the quarter.","In data and devices, we grew 2% organically, driven by strength in Asia and continued growth in high-speed connectivity and data center applications.","As we highlighted to you during investor day, we shifted our portfolio to growing high-speed applications that have complex and technological challenges to meet the high-speed requirements.","We continue also to benefit from our position with our hyperscale customers and we continue to drive margin growth through optimized operations in this business.","In our appliance business, we had another strong quarter with 22% organic growth and double-digit growth in all regions as we continue to benefit from the trends in this area, including safety, efficiency and miniaturization.","Over the past several quarters, our performance in appliances was given by share gains and product cycles in China. What was really nice about the first quarter and our guidance for the year is it's really been driven by our leading global position and we're seeing higher demands in the Americas and Europe contributing to the growth of our solutions. So, the growth is becoming much more balanced in appliances for this year.","And then lastly, in SubCom, revenue and margins were impacted by the ramp up delay in the new program, which we have resolved. We do expect a couple of quarters of margin impact due to the project accounting nature of this business, but the SubCom market cycle remains very healthy. And these programs we just announced were with Google and Facebook and it brought our backlog to over $1 billion, as I previously mentioned.","From a margin perspective, segment adjusted operating margins declined to 11.8% in the quarter, reflecting the SubCom ramp up delay. We expect this segment to run below our expected mid-teen operating margins for the next couple of quarters and then expand as we close the year.","Now, let me turn it over to Heath who will cover the financials.","Heath Mitts","Thank you, Terrence. And good morning, everyone. Please turn to slide nine where I will provide more details on Q1 financials.","Adjusted operating income was $623 million, with an adjusted operating margin of 17.9%, leveraging the strong organic growth of 8%.","GAAP operating income was $581 million and included $35 million of restructuring charges and $7 million of acquisition charges.","For the full year, I continue to expect restructuring charges of approximately $150 million, driven primarily by activity in our Industrial Solutions segment as we optimize the footprint and makes structural improvements across our TE cost structure.","Adjusted EPS was $1.40, up a very strong 22% year-over-year, primarily driven by sales growth and operating margin improvement. For the quarter, our adjusted EPS performance was $0.15 above our prior guidance midpoint due to the strong revenue performance and operating income follow-through.","GAAP EPS was a loss of $0.11 for the quarter and included a one-time tax-related charge of $1.42 of EPS, primarily due to the recently passed US tax legislation and restructuring and acquisition-related charges of $0.09.","Because of the reduction in the US corporate tax rate, we recorded a charge to income tax expense of approximately $500 million to write-down our US deferred income tax assets.","In Q1, our adjusted effective tax rate was 17.3%. As we said on our last call, we expect a full year tax rate in the 19% to 20% range and we now expect taxes to come in at the lower end of that range.","For Q2, we expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 19%.","Now, if you turn to slide ten please. As a reminder, the first quarter of 2017 was exceptionally strong, so we have some tough compares on a year-over-year basis. ","However, if you look at our performance sequentially, we continue to demonstrate the consistent progress we're making as a company. Our strong Q1 results demonstrate that we're performing well against our business model and executing upon multiple levers to drive earnings growth, including organic growth, consistent capital deployment strategy of M&A and return of capital to our owners, and margin expansion through TE OA and cost reduction efforts.","Adjusted gross margin in the quarter was 34%, down from prior year, but up 100 basis points sequentially. Adjusted operating margins were up 10 basis points year-over-year to 17.9%, a record for the company.","Adjusted operating margins were up 160 basis points sequentially, with organic growth driving leverage in the operating structure of the company. Adjusted EBITDA margin in Q1 were 22.7%, down slightly from prior year, up 150 basis points sequentially.","During our investor day last month, I discussed return on invested capital and our focus on balancing between growth and returns. We're targeting mid-teens adjusted ROIC through focused investing to support organic growth, while enabling long-term growth opportunities through acquisitions.","Our business continues to generate solid free cash flow. In the quarter, cash from operations was $350 million and free cash flow was $127 million, in line with our expectations.","We've returned $355 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in the quarter. We also increased our investments in the business to capitalize on growth opportunities where we consistently demonstrate high returns.","We've included a balance sheet and cash flow summary in the appendix for the additional details.","With that, I will turn the call back over to Terrence.","Terrence Curtin","Thanks, Heath. And let me get into guidance. And let's start with the second quarter that is on slide 11 of your deck.","So, for the second quarter, we expect revenue of $3.55 billion to $3.65 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $1.33 to $1.37. At the midpoint, this represents reported sales growth of 12%, organic sales growth of 6% and adjusted earnings per share growth of 13%.","By segment, we expect Transportation Solutions to grow mid-teens on a reported basis, which includes the acquisition of Hirschmann, which is a leading provider of antenna technology and products, that we acquired late in fiscal 2017.","On an organic basis, we expect high-single-digit growth in Transportation. We expect auto to be up high-single-digits in a global auto production environment we estimate to be up 2% year-over-year in the quarter, once again demonstrating outperformance due to content growth.","We also expect, in Transportation, strong growth in commercial transportation and continued growth in sensors.","In the Industrial Solutions segment, we expect growth of mid-single digits organically and that growth will be driven by the continued strength of industrial equipment and medical applications.","And in Communication Solutions, we expect low-single-digit growth, driven by continued momentum in data and devices and appliances.","Now, let's turn to slide 12 and I'll cover the full-year guidance for 2018. We expect full-year revenue of $14.1 billion to $14.3 billion. This is up $300 million from our prior guidance at midpoint and we expect adjusted earnings per share of $5.40 to $5.50, and this is a $0.22 increase versus our prior guidance.","At the midpoint, this represents reported sales growth of 8% and organic sales growth of 5%. You should think about the $300 million increase in revenue guidance as $200 million due to organic growth increase in the first half of our fiscal year and the remaining increase due to currency translation.","In bridging between our total growth and our organic growth between that 8% and that 5% of our new guidance, we expect acquisitions to add about 100 basis points and currency exchange effects to add the remainder about 200 basis points to the growth in 2018 above organic.","Adjusted earnings per share growth is expected to be 13% at midpoint, driven by our growth in operating income expansion. While we have a positive impact from EPS, currency exchange effects of $0.11, this is offset entirely by the negative year-over-year impact of $0.12 from a higher adjusted tax rate when we compare to last year. So, really, the 13% is driven by operations.","So, let me provide more color on our segments and our full-year guidance. We expect Transportation Solutions to be up in the low-teens on a reported basis and up high-single-digits organically, representing an improvement from our prior guidance.","We expect our auto business to be up high-single-digits organically on 2% auto production growth, reflecting continued content growth and share gains.","Commercial transportation is expected to continue to outperform its end market, benefiting from content expansion and share gains and we expect continued growth momentum in sensors.","In Industrial Solutions, our guidance is essentially unchanged from our prior guidance from last quarter and is expected to grow mid-single digits on both a reported and organic basis, with the primary growth drivers being industrial equipment and medical applications.","And in the Communications segment, we expect to be flat on both a reported and an organic basis, with our growth in data and devices and appliances being offset by the declines in SubCom that we highlighted to you already.","In data and devices, we expect to benefit from high-speed ramps to cloud infrastructure customers as well as new design ramps for server OEMs. In appliances, we expect strong growth above market due to the share gains in all regions.","And in SubCom, we expect revenue to be towards the lower end of our $800 million to $900 million range that we told you about last quarter.","So, in summary, I continue to feel very good about our performance and execution, especially when I think about what we highlighted to you at investor day and it really came through during our results in the quarter as well as in this guidance.","We have built a portfolio with clear competitive advantages and you're seeing the benefit of our leading positions and content growth driving growth above market as well as driving margin expansion.","We continue to perform well against our business model as demonstrated by our strong quarter one results, which included 14% sales growth, record 17.9% operating margins and 22% EPS growth.","And lastly, we are well-positioned in large markets with favorable secular trends and our guidance for 2018 indicates further growth above those markets and EPS expansion driven by the levers that we highlighted to you around expanding profitability.","So, lastly, before we open it up for questions, I do want to thank our global teams for their strong performance in the quarter and ensuring that we bring our technology to our customers to further our leading positions around the world.","So, now, let's open up for questions. So, Sujal, I'll hand it back over to you.","Sujal Shah","Thank you. Could you please give the instructions for the Q&A session?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And we'll go to Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital. Please go ahead.","Amit Daryanani","Perfect. Thanks a lot, guys. I guess two questions for me. Maybe to start off with \u2013 can you just talk about the Industrial segment. Operating margins were fairly strong over here in the quarter. Just trying to understand, if you're already starting to see some benefits from the cost optimization initiatives that you guys have laid out in the past or the improvement you are seeing are more organic and those benefits from cost takeout are more ahead of you? Because I think, historically, Q1 tends to be a trough for op margins in Industrial and then you see a nice steady ramp-up throughout the year. Just trying to get a sense of if that still transpires.","Terrence Curtin","Amit, thank you for the question. I would say this. The industrial team has been hyper focused on not just their organic growth opportunities, but also improving their market structure here. That didn't just start when we started talking about it a little bit more publicly during the investor day and some of our pre-calls. ","However, I would tell you that the benefit that you saw in the quarter was largely around the leverage from that organic revenue growth. We have, as we've talked pretty extensively about, some significant footprint optimization, things that we're working on. ","We'll see more of the benefit of that either later this year, but more pointedly into 2019 as that's a multiyear journey to get to those numbers. So, the 14%, we're proud of. And I think the teams have worked hard to get there. But did not receive a huge benefit from some of the footprint pieces that we've talked about that will be forthcoming. And we'll continue to keep you posted over the next several quarters and couple of years.","Amit Daryanani","That's really helpful. And if I can just follow-up. I guess, Terrence, for you maybe. I want to maybe better understand the back half expectations that you guys have right now for your fiscal year. You clearly have a very strong beat in Q1. Looks like there is some upside to Q2. But is it fair to \u2013 you're really not raising your back half expectations a whole lot right now. And if that's fair, I'm curious, what gives you the pause for back half or is it just being conservative to hopefully enable performance like Q1 sustaining throughout the year?","Terrence Curtin","As I said in my comments \u2013 thank you for the question, Amit. If you look at the guide, when we think about the year, certainly, we had a strong first quarter. We are teed up for a strong second quarter. And we did leave our back half unchanged.","I think when you look at the markets, and let's start with the markets, first of all, we see an auto environment that we think production has gotten a little stronger than we guided last quarter. Last quarter, we talked about 1% production growth through the year. We view the year is going to be more 2%. But we do think that production growth is first half loaded and is mainly around Asia and Europe. North America has not changed.","The industry markets are sort of as we saw them, so we didn't really change our guidance on the year. And then communications, what's really nice in communications, the growth that we had, I think communications, while the year is going to be flat, is really driven by appliances and D&D. We thought SubCom would cycle down and cycling down a little bit more due to this ramp program.","So, the second half is unchanged. It's really our view of the markets. And we updated you for what we believe we see in front of us and we'll continue to update you as we go forward. But I think it is fair to say, it's the same guidance we gave you three months ago on the second half.","Amit Daryanani","Fair enough. Thanks. And congrats on the quarter, guys.","Terrence Curtin","Thank you.","Sujal Shah","Thank you, Amit. Can we have the next question please?","Operator","We'll go to Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Wamsi Mohan","Yes, thank you. Terrence, great to see the overall results and Transport margins have come back so strongly. Your Transport segment is really decoupling pretty strongly from global production. You know they had a few things, content, market position and new wins. I was wondering, can you give us some sense on how much of this growth is coming from new wins? And regionally, where do you expect the biggest outperformance relative to production over the next few quarters? And I have a follow-up for Heath.","Terrence Curtin","Well, thank you for the question. And let me take the second half of your question first, Wamsi, and it's one of the things that I think \u2013 our auto position, we've always talked about how proud we are of that position and what we've accomplished there.","But I do believe, when you think about our global position, you're really seeing it this year. So, last year, when we talked \u2013 we grew double digits on a 3% production environment. And a lot of that growth last year was we had a very strong China cycle. We had a nice European production environment. And North America was flat.","When you look at this year, North America is going to continue to be flat. Production is going to be down a little bit. And like I said in my guidance, it's going to be high-single-digits. So, you're still seeing that content. And that content is broad-based of all the things that we talked about during investor day to you, whether that be electric vehicle, whether that be the connected car. And also, just the core qualification of the car as well. We can't lose sight of that; how electronics just in other applications, like safety, play a big part. ","When you look at this year, though, geographically, Europe is going to have the strongest production growth this year. So, it is going to be probably the largest driver from a rate perspective of production growth, followed by Asia. North America, flat.","And with our very strong European position and our engagements we have with our customers, we're going to continue to be talking about Europe, I think, for the rest of the year, which it's going to be a little bit different than last year where we talked a lot about China and Asia.","And so, this proves our great global position. And the content growth is global. I mentioned in my comments, we grew double-digit in North America and a flat environment. We feel pretty comfortable we can grow mid-single digit in North America. And that market has been flat for multiple years now. And it just shows what we're bringing to our customers.","Wamsi Mohan","Thanks, Terrence. Thanks for the color. Heath, can you comment on how you're thinking about potentially any changes to capital allocation in light of the tax changes? And do you anticipate making any changes operationally in terms of site relocations, et cetera, in view of these changes? Thanks.","Heath Mitts","It's, obviously, a timely question, Wamsi. I appreciate it. The change in the US tax regulations that went into effect first part of this year, signed into legislation late calendar 2017, don't have a tremendous impact in terms of how we think about capital allocation. ","At the end, a Swiss-based company, we don't have a repatriation issue in terms of where our cash is located. And the most important thing is, although some of the changes in the tax regulations, both here as well as some of the things that are going on in other parts of the world, probably put a little bit of pressure on our tax rate, our effective tax rate, over the next couple of, three or four years. I could see us moving up 100, 200 basis points, maybe to that 21%, 22% range, if you look out over the next three or four years.","The most important thing to go back to, though, on that is our cash tax rate, which is the true economics, is still in the mid to high-teens. And that doesn't get dramatically impacted by the change in the policy.","So, as we think about payback and returns and return on invested capital in terms of operational decisions and capital allocation, it doesn't have a tremendous impact on us. And, obviously, we'll plan around this. And while the US is an important piece, North America is only a third of our business. We have two-thirds of our business outside the US and we need to pay attention to those things as well.","Wamsi Mohan","Thanks, Heath.","Sujal Shah","Okay, thank you, Wamsi. Can we have the next question please?","Operator","We'll go to Joe Giordano with Cowen. Please go ahead.","Joseph Giordano","Hey, guys. How are you doing?","Terrence Curtin","Hey, Joe.","Joseph Giordano","Just a question on \u2013 kind of a specific question, I guess, on EV. And there's been talk from some of the sensor guys about trying to adapt like a lot more wireless sensing into some of the bigger applications on the electric powertrain. And there is debate whether or not that's the right choice of technology or not, but just curious as to how \u2013 what are you seeing in that kind of market? Is that something you're trying to even look at on your own sensor portfolio? But more like, what does that mean for connectors in EV powertrains if something like that is to kind of move forward?","Terrence Curtin","It's a great question. And it's just one of those things, when you look at electric vehicles, everybody is looking because it is so new. It is only about 4 million units when you take EV and plug-in hybrids. It's still a small part of the market. And you're seeing a lot of experimentation around what's the best way not only to get connection and power, but also in the most affordable way into the system.","So, I think when you look at things like you talked about, there's lots of things that are happening around EV architecture [indiscernible]. What is great for us, we wouldn't only play in that, but as I think those of you that joined us on investor day, the breadth of our portfolio isn't just about one thing. It's about many things. It's about the inlets. It's about what happens around the battery as well as the sensors around it.","So, when you look at something like that, that's both an opportunity for us, as well as things that may influence our product [indiscernible]. But when we think about content per vehicle in an EV, because of the breadth not just in sensors, but what we do as we shared with you, we have some programs that are up to $500 a vehicle. 2x content. And what's great is we're exposed to those trends and our product breadth is so broad, we're going to benefit whether it's a wireless or a connected solution.","Joseph Giordano","Sorry, I just jumped on late with a couple of companies here today. But relative to data and devices, I feel like every day I come in and you're seeing articles about who is spending more on data centers this year and it seems like a universally good story. And I was just curious of how your discussions, particularly with some of the hyperscale guys, when you talk about, like Facebook and what they're planning on doing. Are you starting to see initial indications of a real acceleration in that market?","Terrence Curtin","I would say twofold. We get benefits from two areas from those trends. You heard us highlight the wins we have in SubCom, which clearly are the high-speed backbone to really make those data centers work from that data traffic, and especially with video. We are seeing that in our \u2013 certainly in our SubCom order book that we highlighted.","The other thing I would say, no different than last year, the amount of growth momentum we have around the cloud in our D&D business is almost entirely our growth driver in our data and devices business.","So, while we'll talk about growth rate that might be low-single-digits, that cloud activity [indiscernible]. Where there is some slower activity in sort of telco spending and things like that and wireless is still sort of slow, but net-net, the cloud activity we have in our data and device businesses drove the growth last year that you saw, off repositioning of the portfolio. And it's also the primary driver of growth today in the business when we look at the guidance we gave you for the year and some of our excitement about it is all around the cloud and the hyperscale engagements we have.","Joseph Giordano","How big is that part of your D&D right now?","Terrence Curtin","From a rate perspective, it's about 30%.","Joseph Giordano","Okay, great.","Terrence Curtin","Of D&D revenue, roughly, Joe, off the top of our heads here.","Joseph Giordano","Thanks, guys.","Terrence Curtin","Thank you.","Sujal Shah","Thank you, Joe. Can we have the next question please?","Operator","We'll go to Shawn Harrison with Longbow Research. Please go ahead.","Shawn Harrison","Morning. And my congrats on the results as well. Two questions, if I may. The Transportation margins rebounded nicely in the quarter. Are there any lingering issues within that business in terms of getting lead times normalized or getting sub components in the door or anything like that that could affect the remainder of the fiscal year that you see at this point in time?","Terrence Curtin","Shawn, I think that's a fair question given how the last couple of quarters of our fiscal 2017 we were down in the 18 percentish range for transportation and we had talked some about some of the supply chain issues.","Largely, those issues are behind us. The team has done a nice job working through even at these higher volumes some of those issues. And I think, as we guided, we would be up in to 19% range for that Transportation segment numbers and we certainly exceeded our own expectations and the team executed very well in the quarter.","I would tell you, as you think about the remaining three quarters of the year, given the volume that we foresee and so forth, you should probably expect that to be more back at its normalized margins, around that 20 percentish range. ","But you've got to know that, in a given quarter, a 90-day period, you could have a mix within a quarter that can swing it around a little bit too.","But we're proud of the team working through a lot of the operational matters that kind of plagued us a little bit in the final part of 2017 and feel good about our position as we work our way through 2018.","Shawn Harrison","Got you. Good to hear. And as my follow-up, just thinking about the margin impact on SubCom and maybe what happens in a couple of quarters out, looks like, year-over-year, it maybe cost you 150, 200 basis points given the program delays.","Do you get an outsized margin benefit because of program completion accounting, maybe, say, in the fourth fiscal quarter and does it just normalize out by whatever drag you saw this quarter, trying to think of how you maybe remodel it late 2018, early 2019 in terms of the benefit if the accounting works in your favor?","Heath Mitts","Listen, we don't have enough time on this call to take everyone to purchase price accounting \u2013 project accounting in terms of percentage of completion. And it has its own levels of complexity that we can certainly take offline.","What I would tell you is that you should expect the next couple of quarters to look somewhat like this last quarter from a margin perspective, having that low double digits as the issue, albeit behind us operationally, does bleed over, the elements of the contract. ","It won't surprise us, as we get towards the end of some of the things, as well as new contracts that kick in, that you would see a quarter that would be in the other side of that. That would be higher than what we would expect. Sometimes, Terrence will refer to the SubCom margins as EKG machine [ph] because they can move [ph] around relative to how the percentage of completion accounting works.","Having said that, the true economics of the business are still quite solid. Cash flow coming out of the SubCom this year is quite good. We had a great Q1, had a cash flow for SubCom and we expect the remainder of the year. So, we could take some of the dynamics of the project accounting offline. But I would tell you that you could see some swings late this year or into the early part of next year, for sure.","Shawn Harrison","Very fair. Thanks, again. ","Sujal Shah","Okay, thank you, Shawn. Can we have the next question please?","Operator","And we'll go to David Leiker with Baird. Please go ahead.","David Leiker","Hi, good morning, everyone.","Terrence Curtin","Hi, David.","Shawn Harrison","So, if we take a look at the orders, the 11% increase in orders, 13% organically, 13% in Transportation, it seems like there are a couple of things at play here. Because of the portfolio and the global nature, you're getting more opportunities to bid on things. I'm guessing, your win rate is probably a little bit better and the programs are a bit larger. Are there any some examples that you can give us that help flesh that out a little bit?","Terrence Curtin","David, certainly. When you take our business, it's a lot of small projects. So, there isn't any one big program. I think when you look at, to some of your comment, we're seeing, like I think a lot of companies, you have synchronous global growth, which is benefiting the orders. But it's really our global position. I wouldn't say there was any big one order outside of SubCom [indiscernible].","When you look at it, what's nice is, it's across all the trends and the bets we've been making on the portfolio, where to position this portfolio. So, the wins that we are seeing are along those applications that we laid out at investor day.","So, whether they are auto, whether it is commercial transportation, what we're doing at sensors, all of them grew double-digit. It's not one big program. What we are doing around factory automation, we continue to see those trends. We also \u2013 medical continues the momentum that we had.","And in appliances and data and devices, like Joe said, we're getting the benefit of the cloud. And we're also getting the benefit of miniaturization and efficiency in appliances. So, it is extremely broad-based. And you're seeing it in the orders. It's not one thing and it's not one market. It's really nice around the secular trends we talked about.","Shawn Harrison","What about as it relates to the win rate and the size of the opportunities that you are pursuing or winning?","Terrence Curtin","I wouldn't say the size of the opportunities are changing dramatically. I would say the take-up rates are a little bit heavier as we're seeing volumes stronger.","So, the opportunities are similar to what we framed out when we think it down. And we think about opportunities as content per application. But we're seeing some of the volumes, the underlying volumes being stronger and strong positions we want. ","And even if we want a program in the first quarter, it won't be MI [ph] orders. If I want an automotive program and isn't till the customers start placing orders, which could be two, three years out.","So, when you look at the orders, they are programs that were won three, four, five years ago, not as current other than SubCom. SubCom is the only exception.","Shawn Harrison","All right, great. Heath, just one thing to follow up on on the taxes. Are there any high-level views \u2013 I know it's pretty complicated, but puts and takes on the taxes and your view of 2018 under the new rules versus the old law?","Heath Mitts","As I said in my prepared remarks, we had guided a tax rate \u2013 an effective tax rate of 19% to 20% here at the beginning of the year. I would say we are trending towards the bottom end of that. Some element of that would be attributable to some of the changes in the US policy and some of it is just jurisdictional mixes, where we have things coming in from. ","So, not a tremendous impact. Versus other companies, we already start with a pretty low rate. And again, I continue to scare people back. We would expect our cash taxes for the year to be in the mid to high teens. So, pretty good numbers.","Shawn Harrison","Yeah. It seems like there's something there on the intercompany transactions that's at play here.","Heath Mitts","Certainly, that has an impact. As I discussed, we had about \u2013 there's multiple elements to it, but we had about $500 million write-down in our US deferred tax assets in the quarter. And that's a non-cash charge that we took and I think you'll see a lot of other companies discussing similar type of adjustments to their balance sheet.","Largely, that had to do with write-downs to our assets on our balance sheet for the new tax rate relative to both our carryforward net operating losses as well as our carryforward, what they call, 163(j), which is some of the intercompany or just general debt interest rate deductibility. And that's part of that $500 million that we wrote down.","Shawn Harrison","Okay, perfect. Thank you very much.","Heath Mitts","Thanks, David.","Terrence Curtin","All right. Thanks, David. Can we have the next question please?","Operator","We'll go to Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Craig Hettenbach","Yes, thanks. Terrence, just wanted to follow up your comments on EVs, and appreciate the context. It's still a small unit market today. At the same time, you're seeing just a swell of investment from OEMs committing capital to that market. So, just trying to gauge from you, as you look out over the next one, two, three years, how you are seeing that play out in terms of kind of a linear progression or potential step function up in EVs.","Terrence Curtin","What we get excited about is where we're positioned. When we sit there and we talked to many of you about, our view on EV plug and hybrid, hybrid, we sort of put a lot of those together. We sort of view that's about 4 million units today. About over the next five years, you're going to get up to about 16 million units.","I don't think that will be linear. You get into how do governments support it, what social adoption and things like that. But, clearly, when you take what's happened with diesel, EV has come much more to the forefront. You see it with all our global OEM customers that really the two things that they're all focused on is both the autonomous trends and the electric vehicle trends.","And what's great is both those trends impact us and we're positioned to capitalize on them. So, I feel very good about the momentum we have, the wins we shared with you.","And when you sit there, while it's still a small part of our business, when we talk about the content going from $62 up to well over $80, that's going to be a big trend that drives that and that's part of the growth momentum we've talked to you about and we're investing.","Heath talked about the investments that we're making around growth. Certainly, see it in the capital. It's really to make sure we capitalize on the EV trends globally, not with one customer, not in one region and we're really well positioned and it's still small today, but it's going to be a big growth driver as we go forward.","Craig Hettenbach","Got it. And just as my follow-up, maybe taking the other side on the order strength and understanding the global growth and the backdrop support that. At this point in the cycle, there's also rumblings of just things are tight and some lead times could extend. So, just your sense from a customer inventory perspective and distribution inventory and how you're seeing customers behave relative to other cycles.","Terrence Curtin","Craig, it's a great question. When you look at clearly having global synchronous growth, that creates tightness in itself. And I do think some of our businesses, whether it be things like commercial transportation, you see the growth rate we have there as the ag and the construction are strengthening. I think you see a little bit of it in our industrial equipment business as well as in our appliance businesses as you're getting it. We're getting some of the benefit as supply chains are catching up. So, that's where we see it. It would be more around those markets. And we do expect in our guidance, some of those markets will moderate as we get into the second half of the year with a view of some of that tightness will work out. But across the portfolio, when you look at the growth rates, our growth is very broad. And I think you can see where the areas that there are some places that it does feel hot. That could moderate as we get into the second half. When we look at our channel partners, our channel partners inventory have been staying pretty stable. And their sell-out and our sell-in, their point of sale and our point of purchase pretty much in line. So, it's been nice to see that that inventory in the channel is not going up. It's staying pretty much in line point of sale out and point of purchase in. and that's something we look at at a sort of pretty stable there in balance. We don't see it getting ahead of itself.","Craig Hettenbach","Got it. Appreciate the color.","Terrence Curtin","Thank you, Craig.","Sujal Shah","Thank you, Craig. Can we have the next question please?","Operator","We'll go to Deepa Raghavan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Deepa Raghavan","Hi. This is Deepa Raghavan, Wells Fargo Securities.","Terrence Curtin","Hi, Deepa.","Deepa Raghavan","Hi. How are you? Pretty strong automotive trends. This \u2013 looks like, especially, you're benefitting from trend acceleration across the board. Could you talk about, if some of the trends, example, auto safety or EVs or fully autonomous applications that the OEMs seem to be adopting much faster than expected, will any of these trends benefit you more than the others or is the content kind of similar across these new trends?","Terrence Curtin","Number one, I do believe, as we highlighted at investor day, both those trends will impact us. Autonomous, when you think about autonomous and TE, you think about high speed. It's really the high-speed that we always talk about that you need with connectivity, getting into the car. And that's why we did Hirschmann. So, that we view is going to be something very important to us, as well as just what Craig asked on EV.","When you get around the power dynamic that need to happen, how do you make power move in a car, going from a 12 volt to a full EV vehicle. Really plays into what we do. ","So, when we look at the content, historically, we probably would have told you, before price, content, we grow 4% for us above underlying production. We basically, as Steve highlighted on investor day, we sort of view that's moved up to more like a 6% due to those key trends.","So, I think the way that we're positioned, and also our global position, not just the technology we bring to our customers, I think we're very unique that how we cover the world and our leading position is equal globally, we will get the benefit no matter where the trends stay. ","Deepa Raghavan","Got it. Sensors, pretty strong, among others, obviously. Are some of these new automotive or commercial truck wins coming in slightly earlier than you would have expected?","Terrence Curtin","No, they are not. When you think of automotive or commercial truck programs, when you win those programs, especially in automotive, because [indiscernible] didn't really have an automotive position, they come in with the program launches. So, it isn't like automotive OEMs are moving up their launches. They are very methodical about program launches and how they make sure the vehicle quality is out there. So, when you look at the growth we had, it's in line with the timing we saw.","Deepa Raghavan","Okay. My final question, Communications segment. Would your data and devices division benefit from 5G or FirstNet rollout? If they do, would you talk about timing benefit? It looks like it would be more towards 2019 driven, but curious. Thank you very much.","Terrence Curtin","So, on 5G, if you take the past couple of years, Deepa, we have been talking a lot about data center and cloud. In the wireless, the next big step function in there is 5G. I do believe your timing is right on there. We like our position with 5G. Just the market trend hasn't kicked in yet to benefit us, for us to talk about. But, clearly, it's a trend that will benefit us starting in 2019 and beyond to our D&D business.","All right. Thank you for the questions.","Sujal Shah","Thank you, Deepa. Can we have the next question please?","Operator","And we'll go to Matt Sheerin with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Matt Sheerin","Thanks. Good morning. Terrence, you were talking about growth in the commercial transportation and seeing some upcoming catalysts, including agriculture and other markets. You're looking at five or six quarters of double-digit growth year-over-year here. What is your sense of the cycle here and on production side of the equation? And are you seeing, just as you are in automotive, just a multi-year content growth story within that sector?","Terrence Curtin","So, first off, yes. The content growth story, the same content trends we have gotten in automotive because of our strong position, we're able to take them over to Industrial Transportation.","And the other thing that's very nice about our industrial transportation business, it's pretty globally balanced as well. So, last year, when we spoke, we spoke a lot about China and what we were able to do around the China heavy truck cycle. Certainly, they had some regulation changes around the loading of trucks and we had the benefit of a strong heavy truck market in China as well as the content.","As we came into this year, we thought the heavy truck market would slow down in China. It is, as we thought. But what's been really nice is some of the other areas that were not contributing as strong \u2013 the construction, the agriculture \u2013 is starting to kick in, which is also driving both market trend and content growth wins that we've had that's creating this really strong cycle.","So, we feel good that \u2013 it's better than we thought it was going to be due to some of these other markets kicking in \u2013 ag and construction specifically. It just shows the strength of our global position and the trends we've tried to offer around where we add content with our customers.","And it's been good to see and our team has done a tremendous job not only getting the content win, also make sure they are satisfying customers. Having 30% growth in a business and delivering to a more global customer base, that's quite a feat.","Matt Sheerin","That's helpful. And is that sensor growth that you're seeing also sort of dovetailing off of the commercial side of things, but you're saying, no, there's a decent exposure to that market in the sensor side?","Terrence Curtin","Yeah, we did. Actually, as I said, we had double-digit growth in the commercial transportation piece of our sensor business in the quarter. So, we had auto, commercial transportation as well as the industrial end markets, all three had double-digit growth in sensors. So, we're actually seeing the benefit of that as well.","Matt Sheerin","Okay, thanks a lot.","Sujal Shah","Okay. Thank you, Matt. Can we have the next question please","Operator","We'll go to Steven Fox with Cross Research. Please go ahead.","Steven Fox","Hi, good morning. One question and one confirmation. Just to clarify on the sensor business, you're still looking at sort of a second off book of business that starts to ramp maybe more so than you've seen like in the last year or so, is that correct?","Heath Mitts","In automotive, that sounds \u2013 so, the automotive programs will get stronger through the year. When you look at the fourth quarter versus where they are, the double-digit we had in the first quarter was slow, but that's in the automotive piece of sensors, Steven.","Steven Fox","Okay. And then, my question is, on the industrial side, you've got about a $2 billion rough number revenue business in the industrial and the organic growth is up 17%. I was wondering if you can sort of decompose that and how much you would attribute to maybe just better trends in the cycle versus content? Any more color on that would be really helpful? Thanks.","Terrence Curtin","When you sit there, there's a couple of things. You have both medical in there and industrial in there. So, when you look at those two \u2013 and both of them, really, what we're seeing in factory automation as well as medical continues.","Certainly, in the industrial piece of it, it is around the factory automation element. And it is similar to some of the comments I made around automotive. It is global.","We're seeing strength in Europe. We're seeing strength in the Americas. And certainly, continuing in China around factory automation.","So, I would say, we're seeing the benefit of global strength that has lifted that up. There is content gain in there as well, Steve. That is also a big driver, which is important.","The piece that we're just watching back to \u2013 a little bit of Craig's question, I do think there are some supply-chain elements that we would expect that business to moderate a little bit in the second half, just due to people trying to secure supply, but that's the one piece that I would say we need a little bit more wait and see on as we get too exciting there.","Steven Fox","Understood. Thanks for your help.","Terrence Curtin","Thanks.","Sujal Shah","Thank you, Steve. Can we have the next question please?","Operator","We'll go to Jim Suva with Citi. Please go ahead.","Jim Suva","Thanks. I have two pretty short questions, so I'll ask them at the same time. On the automotive content growth, and now at the higher-end of historical, given the long lead times in models and visibility you have, is it better to say that we're probably at a stage where it's at that high-end or even higher for the foreseeable future?","And then, my follow-up question is, on the undersea telecom, we continue to see more and more contracts being awarded and deployed. Yet, you had challenges in that. Was that due to weather or not being able to get the components because it seems like a lot of the backlogs are taking longer than expected, and do you have visibility into that being right-sized about where it should be? Thank you.","Terrence Curtin","Let me take the second one. It's not weather. It was not \u2013 it had nothing to do with component. It's a new project ramp that took us a little bit longer to get out and manufacture it. It was within our shop. ","So, when you sit there, it's a big complicated project with new technology. And it took us longer to get the system up and running. And that's impacted us.","Like you said, the cycle is very strong. And when you look at the backlog that we booked and the orders year-to-date of $400 million, last year, we did $500 million for the year. We just did $400 million in the first full month of this year. So, the cycle is healthy.","And I think it's similar to what we highlighted last month, is we like the cycle. It's elongated. Even some of the programs we want are out in 2021. They aren't programs that we could even start today.","So, we do feel it's the cycle that Shad highlighted to you during investor day and this is just a new project ramp that we did resolve. We will get the benefit. But to Shawn's question, project accounting is not always the most intuitive. And it will have to work through over the life of the project. That will create a little lumpiness in the CS market.","On your first question on content, it does come back to program launches. It does also come back into mix a little bit. I think we feel very good about that 6% content growth that Steve talked about.","In some cases, it will be. Is there more EV adoption versus combustion engine adoption? I can't say we are at a new normal. What I can tell you is, we are very well-positioned against all those trends that are colliding in a positive way in the automotive space. And what I feel very good about, both last year and this year, we're proving to you consistently of our content story versus a production environment that, last year, was 3%. This year, it is 2%. And we're consistently outgrowing it.","And it is due to that content position, that's how we bring value to customers. So, I can tell you, we feel very good on what we told you last month. And I don't think one quarter changes it.","Jim Suva","Thank you so much for the details.","Terrence Curtin","Thanks, Jim.","Sujal Shah","Thanks, Jim. Can we have the next question please?","Operator","We'll go to William Stein with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","William Stein","Great. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a very strong results and outlook. The one question I have relates to your more robust view on auto production for the year. As we all know, China is becoming a more important factor in that forecast. And there were some tax incentives that were in place. And I think half of it rolled off about a year ago or thereabouts. And maybe more of it rolling off now. Can you bring us up to date as to what's happening with the incentives in China and how that is affecting your business and maybe whether it's been a surprise or not? Thank you.","Heath Mitts ","Actually, the incentives, we spent a lot of time last year talking about the incentives where the incentives probably hung on a little bit longer last year. But the incentives are over in China. And what's really great, like I laid out earlier, it's a global position.","The only thing we've seen in China a little bit is we've actually seen the car OEMs get a little bit more aggressive in pricing than actually waiting for a government incentive, probably more traditional behavior that we would we see here in the Western world than what we've seen in China versus government incentive. ","But the government incentives are over. And when we think about auto production globally this year, Asia, including China, with China as the biggest piece, we expect to be about 3% for the year. And we expect the globe to be 3% for the year. So, instead of China and Asia having an outperformance versus global auto production, we sort of view it to be an average.","And our increase in the auto production from 1% to 2% was as much due to Europe as it was due to Asia. Both contributed and both of that pretty much in the first half of our year. So, production in the first quarter was a little stronger. We expected a little bit stronger due to Europe and Asia here in the second quarter. Second half auto production estimates by us are essentially unchanged.","William Stein","It's very helpful. Thank you.","Sujal Shah","All right. Thank you. Well, can we have the next question please?","Operator","And we'll go to Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Sherri Scribner","Hi, thank you. I just have a big picture question about margins. If you look at the first quarter, very strong margin performance, helped by the automotive \u2013 the Transportation segment and the Industrial segments. But it seems like, if you look at the full year guidance, you're suggesting there some moderation. I think there was some commentary about that as well. So, somewhere in the middle of your 30 to 80 basis point improvement is where I think the full year numbers are coming out.","I guess, my question is, is that right you're expecting some moderation in margins and we sort of had a better-than-expected margin performance this quarter versus where you're expecting going forward?","And then, as part of that, do you think that maybe some of your second half assumptions for margins are conservative?","Heath Mitts ","Well, Sherri, this is Heath. I'll take the question. I would say that, certainly, we came out of the year on all cylinders from a margin perspective and we feel good about the performance. We would expect the margins in the Transportation segment to moderate, closer to the more normalized number, closer to 20 percentish, albeit we'll still show nice year-over-year margin expansion within that segment.","Same with the Industrial side. I would say Industrial is probably a little rich in the quarter. But still, lot of positive trends there.","Within Communication, as I indicated earlier, we would expect, because of some of the project accounting timing, with SubCom, it would still stay in the low-double-digits, maybe jus inside where we are today.","So, conservatism in the second half of the year is for others to discern, not me. But I would say that we're taking a cautious feel and we feel good about the organic growth. We feel good about the orders. And there's nothing in our guidance assumption that assumes there's big cost inflow or major mix change that's different, but we're taking a normal and a fairly cautionary approach. And we'll update everybody every 90 days.","Sherri Scribner","Thanks.","Sujal Shah","All right. Thank you, Sherri. Can we have the next question please?","Operator","And we'll go to Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Mark Delaney","Yes, good morning. Thanks for the opportunity to ask the question. And congratulations on the good quarter. I'll keep it to one question. On SG&A, I think the SG&A percent at 10.9%, just looking at my model, I think that's the lowest in about 10 years. So, very nice job on the SG&A line. How should we think about that item going forward? I think it was 12.1% in 2017. So, are these SG&A savings, is that something that's sustained or should we see an increase? Any sort of color on the ratio for fiscal 2018 would be helpful.","Heath Mitts","Sure. Mark, this is Heath. I think, again, similar to Sherri's question, we had some normal seasonality with that as well. So, I think that's a little bit low from a modeling perspective for fiscal 2018, that 10.9%. But, certainly, as we discussed at the investor day back in December, we do have a goal of moving our operating expenses, inclusive of SG&A, closer to 16%, while protecting our R&D and our raw engineering spend within that.","So, you will see progress towards that. I would think that modeling it that low for the rest of the year is probably a little aggressive, though.","Mark Delaney","Thank you.","Terrence Curtin","Okay, thank you, Mark. It looks like we have no further questions. So, I would like to thank everybody for joining us on the call this morning. ","If you've got any follow-up questions, please contact investor relations at TE. Thank you. And have a nice day.","Heath Mitts","Thank you, everybody.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today\u2019s conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Sujal Shah. Please go ahead.","Sujal Shah","Good morning, and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss TE Connectivity's fourth quarter fiscal year 2017 results. With me today are Chief Executive Officer, Terrence Curtin and Chief Financial Officer, Heath Mitts.","During the course of this call, we'll be providing certain forward-looking information. We ask you to review the forward-looking cautionary statements included in today's press release. In addition, we'll use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussion this morning, and we ask you to review the sections of our press release and accompanying slide presentation that address the use of these items.","Press release and related tables, along with the slide presentation, can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at te.com.

I'm very pleased to share our strong results for the fourth quarter, which capped off an exceptional year for TE across all the value drivers of our business model, including sales growth, earnings growth, as well as capital generation and deployment. Before I get into the slides, I want to spend a few minutes highlighting the progress we've made, demonstrating a successful execution of our strategy to create a safer, sustainable, productive and connected future. We are focused on attractive markets fueled by content growth and our sales growth this year is evidence of this. ","Our portfolio is solid with clear competitive advantages that have the ability to consistently deliver above market growth. Also, our customers value our ability to provide highly engineered solutions into applications where failure is not an option. To put this into context, to value creating for owners in 2017, we delivered 9% recorded revenue growth and 8% organic growth, which we believe is best in class performance versus our industrial technology peers. ","Adjusted operating margins expanded by 110 basis points to 16.8% with expansion in all three of our segments. And both the sales and the operating margin expansion resulted in adjusted earnings per share growth of 22%, which demonstrates the strength of our business model and resulted in performance above our guidance.","For the full year, we delivered record free cash flow of $1.7 billion, which represents 100% free cash flow conversion to net income. We also returned $1.2 billion to shareholders and added two acquisitions that bolt on nicely to existing platforms in our portfolio, reflecting our balanced capital deployment strategy. We're also pleased that our return on invested capital expanded by over 100 basis points during the year to nearly 15%.","As we look forward into fiscal \u201918, we are expecting another year of strong performance, above the markets we serve with 6% revenue growth, 4% on an organic basis and double digit growth in adjusted earnings per share, after netting out the impact of tax and currency. Heath and I will get into more detail on guidance later in a call.","So let\u2019s get in to the slides and I\u2019d ask that you turn to slide 3 and let me cover some additional highlights for the fourth quarter. We delivered record performance above our guidance for the fourth quarter with double digit revenue and earnings per share growth. Sales were $3.5 billion, representing 12% reported growth and 9% organic growth year-over-year. Also, organic orders were up 11% in total, reflecting 16% growth in Asia and 9% growth, both in the Americas and in Europe. ","Our sales were approximately $200 million above the midpoint of our guidance, driven by upside across all three of our segments. This strong revenue growth and related margin conversion resulted in adjusted earnings per share of $1.25 in the quarter, $0.10 above the midpoint of our guidance. From an organic growth perspective by segment, transportation grew 13%, industrial grew 6% and our communications segment grew 4%. With the backdrop of the strong growth, we demonstrated strong execution with adjusted operating margins expanding 70 basis points to 16.7%.","If you could please turn to slide 4, let me cover some more highlights related to the full fiscal year of \u201917. We delivered sales of $13.1 billion and this was up 9% on a reported and 8% on an organic basis. From an organic growth perspective, we grew our sales by $1 billion in 2017, with all of our segments contributing. Transportation grew 11% versus global oil production growth of 3%, demonstrating consistent outperformance versus the market due to content growth trends as well as our strong global position. ","Industrial solutions grew 4% driven by continued momentum in both factory automation as well as medical applications. And our communications segment grew 7% with growth across all three of our businesses. For the year, adjusted operating margins were 16.8% with expansion in all three of our segments, demonstrating our strong operational execution in 2017 and this resulted in us delivering adjusted earnings per share of $4.83, which was up 22% over the prior year.","Now, let me get into order trends, so if you can please move to slide 5. We continue to see broad based strength in our orders across our segments, which reinforces our growth outlook for the first quarter. Total orders, excluding SubCom, were similar to our third quarter, at $3.3 billion. Our orders were up 12% year-over-year on a reported basis and up 10% organically. ","Organically, excluding SubCom, our orders grew evenly at approximately 10% across all three regions, continuing the balanced demand trends we have been seeing over the past few quarters. By segment, in transportation, our orders increased 11% organically with growth in all regions. Our industrial orders grew 8% organically with growth in all regions and particular strength in Asia, which showed double digit growth. In communications, excluding SubCom, we saw year-over-year organic order growth of 6%, which strengthened in both appliances as well as data and devices.","Let me now talk about our performance by segment and if you could please turn to slide 6, I\u2019ll start with transportation. Transportation sales grew 13% organically year-over-year and operating margins were in line with our expectations and impacted by supply chain issues we discussed last quarter. Segment sales exceeded expectations due to strong auto demand in both Europe as well as in China. Our leading position in the heavy truck market had shown growth in sensors. ","Our auto sales were up 10% organically with mid-single digit growth in the Americas, mid teen growth in Europe and high single digit growth in Asia against the global auto production growth of only 1%. We are consistently demonstrating the ability to outperform the market due to content growth and we expect this trend to continue. We also expect the benefit from new program ramps as we move forward, which will also contribute to our outperformance versus vehicle production levels. In commercial transportation, we continued to outperform the market with organic revenue growth of 37% year-over-year and particular strength in Asia. ","This significant outperformance is driven by a combination of increased content from regulations to China as well as share gains from our leading global position. We saw double digit growth in each region with continued momentum in heavy trucks as well as growth in the agriculture, mining and constructions markets. While we do expect the China heavy truck market to moderate as we move through \u201918, we expect to continue to see revenue growth ahead of market growth rates. In sensors, our business grew 9% organically year-over-year with growth in auto, commercial transportation and the industrial markets. ","We continue to generate strong design win momentum, particularly in auto applications we're winning across a broad range of sensing products as well as technologies. Adjusted operating margins for the segment were in the range of our expectations and were impacted by approximately 150 basis points from the near term supply chain efficiencies we highlighted last quarter. We expect this issue to be largely behind us by the end of this quarter with December quarter margins returning to above 19%, which is in line with our target model.","If you can please turn to page 7 and let me move over to the industrial solutions segment. The growth momentum we started to see in the second quarter of our fiscal 2017 continues with 6% organic growth year-over-year in the fourth quarter. This organic growth was driven by 13% growth in industrial equipment, which was -- with particular strength in both factory automation as well as medical applications. Our positions in these markets coupled with the acquisition completed last year driving strong growth ahead of the market, both on a reported and on an organic basis. ","Both the Intercontec and Creganna acquisitions continue to perform exceptionally well and ahead of our expectations. In our aerospace and defense and marine business, we saw 1% organic growth driven by the defense market partially offset by program timing in commercial aerospace, which continues to be sluggish. Our energy business declined 2% organically due to weakness in Europe. Adjusted operating margins for the segment expanded 80 basis points year over year in line with our expectations. Our adjusted EBITDA margins expanded by 150 basis points year-over-year, demonstrating the performance of the business, excluding the impact from acquisition related amortization.","Please turn to page 8, so let me get into the communications solutions. Communications solutions delivered its fourth consecutive quarter of growth with 4% organic growth and 430 basis points adjusted operating margin expansion, up to 16.4% and this is through both a combination of the growth we\u2019re experiencing and the operational improvements we\u2019ve made in the segment. ","Data and devices delivered 6% organic growth as we continue to benefit from growth of high speed solutions and because of our multi-year transformation, our D&D business doubled at suggested operating margin from a year ago, driving significant improvement at the segment level as the actions we took to focus the portfolio and optimize the operations were really taking hold. Appliances had another strong quarter with 10% organic growth as demand remains strong, particularly in Asia. ","Our performance this year is a result of share gains and the benefits of the strong China air conditioning cycle. We do expect the cycle to moderate in China as we move through 2018 and we continue to expect our client business to grow globally above market rates in fiscal 2018. In SubCom, our business declined slightly as a result of program timing, while we continue to have a solid pipeline of new opportunities. Hopefully, you saw that this week we announced a new transpacific program that connects Asia to the United States through the consortium of parties, including cloud customers. With this win we announced, our backlog now stands at approximately $1 billion.","Please turn to slide 9 and let me cover the segment highlights for the full year. I really like how the slide shows the progress we made across all segments and when you sit here, overall for the full year, we had exceptional performance in the transportation segment with 11% organic growth and 40 basis points of adjusted operating margins to 19.4%. We do expect another year of above market growth in fiscal 2018 and operating margins to be in our normalized range of 20% plus or minus for the full year. Our industrial solutions segment delivered 11% reported growth and 4% organic growth for the full year with contribution from all the businesses. ","Adjusted operating margins expanded 50 basis points to 12.7% driven by both growth and the operational improvements we\u2019re making in this segment and we expect another year of mid-single digit organic growth and margin expansion in 2018. In communications, it clearly had a phenomenal year in 2017 and contributed to both TE\u2019s top line performance as well as margin expansion. This was driven by the 7% organic growth and almost 400 basis points of adjusted margin expansion. ","Clearly, we made hard work in this segment, especially around data and devices business and clearly this performance at the segment shows the successful transformation as well as the growth organic from high speed solutions for the data center. Also, our appliance business grew 13% organically, reflecting our industry leading position and our SubCom business saw strong growth of 6%.","Yeah. So I\u2019m very proud to say all segments contributed to our growth in margin expansion in 2017 and you\u2019ll also see that again in 2018.","So with that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Heath to cover the financials.","Heath Mitts","Thank you, Terrence and good morning, everyone. If you please turn to slide 10, I\u2019ll provide more details on Q4 financials. Adjusted operating income was 576 million with an adjusted operating margin rate of 16.7% which leverages the strong organic growth of 9%. GAAP operating income was 552 million and included 23 million of restructuring charges and 1 million of acquisition charges. Adjusted EPS was $1.25, up 10% year over year, driven by sales growth, operating margin improvement and the contribution from acquisitions. ","Excluding an $0.08 negative year-over-year impact from tax, adjusted EPS was up a strong 17%. For the quarter, our EPS performance was above our prior range and $0.10 above prior midpoint due to the strong revenue performance. GAAP EPS was $1.21 for the quarter and included restructuring charges of $0.04. For the full year 2017, restructuring charges were approximately 150 million and I expect similar levels for 2018, driven primarily by activity in our industrial solutions segment as we optimize the footprint as well as make structural improvements across TE\u2019s cost structure.","Turning to slide 11, our strong Q4 results demonstrate that we are performing well against our business model and executing upon multiple levers to drive earnings growth, including organic revenue growth, a consistent capital deployment strategy of M&A and return capital to our owners as well as our TEOA efforts. Adjusted gross margin in the quarter was 33% with improvement from prior year, driven by fall through on increased volumes and productivity improvements from TEOA programs. This was partially offset by the impact of supply chain inefficiencies in our transportation segment, which Terrence already discussed. ","Adjusted operating margins were up 70 basis points year-over-year to 16.7% with strong organic growth driving leverage in the operating structure of the company. Adjusted EBITDA margins in Q4 were 21.5%, up 80 basis points year over year. For the full year, adjusted operating margins were up 110 basis points to 60.8% with contributions from all segments. We expect further margin expansion in fiscal \u201918, while continuing to invest for growth in support of our growing design win pipeline. ","As we\u2019ve discussed on previous calls, we\u2019re also committed to reducing SG&A as a percent of revenue overtime, while making progress. We ended 2017 with an adjusted effective tax rate of 17.4% for the full year. Going forward, I would expect more normalized full year adjusted effective tax rate of 19% to 20% for 2018, which results in a tax headwind of $0.17 in our 2018 guidance compared to our 2017 results. Our business continues to generate solid free cash flow with record Q4 and full year performance. ","In the quarter, cash from continuing operations was 873 million, and free cash flow was 691 million. We returned 376 million to shareholders through dividend and share repurchases in the quarter. For the full year, free cash flow was a record 1.7 billion, the 100% net income conversion demonstrating a high quality of earnings. In fiscal 2017, we returned 1.2 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and used 215 million for acquisitions. ","Converting earnings to cash provides the ability to support both return of capital acquisitions while retaining the strong financial position. As we balanced the use of our cash flow, return on invested capital is an important metric we measure ourselves. We have made good progress this year expanding ROIC by over 100 basis points to nearly 15% as Terrence mentioned earlier. We\u2019ve included a balance sheet and cash flow summary in the appendix for additional details.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Terrence.","Terrence Curtin","Thanks, Heath. And let me get into guidance for 2018 and I\u2019ll start with our first quarter, which is on slide 12 of the presentation. For the first quarter, we are expecting a strong start to our fiscal year. We expect first quarter revenues at $3.35 billion to $3.45 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $1.23 to $1.27. At the midpoint, this represents reported sales growth of 10%, organic sales growth of 5% and adjusted earnings per share growth of 9%. ","By segment, we expect transportation solutions to grow low double digits on a reported basis, which includes the recent acquisition of Hirschmann, a leading provider of antenna technology and products and Hirschmann bolsters our position as a value added solution provider in the connected vehicle applications, truly a high growth area. On an organic basis, we expect mid-single digit growth in transportation. We expect auto to be up mid-single digits with global auto production being flat year over year, once again demonstrating outperformance due to content growth. ","We also expect strong growth in commercial transportation and continued growth in sensors. And as I mentioned earlier, we do expect segment adjusted operating margins to above 19% in the first quarter. In industrial solutions, we expect to grow mid-single digits organically with growth driven by continued strength in both factory automation and medical applications. And in communications, we expect low single digit growth with growth in data and devices and appliances offsetting some impact from SubCom project timing for the quarter.","Now, let me move to the full year and if you can turn to slide 13, I\u2019ll get into it. We expect full year revenue of $13.7 billion to $14.1 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $5.13 and $5.33. At the midpoint, this represents reported sales growth of 6% and organic sales growth of 4%. Bridging between the 6% total growth and organic of 4%, we do expect acquisitions and currency exchange rates to each add about 100 basis points of growth in 2018. ","On an adjusted EPS growth is expected to be 8% at the midpoint. We expect further margin expansion in 2018 and it\u2019s important to note that the adjusted EPS guidance is negatively impacted by tax headwinds of $0.17, which Heath talked about and positively impacted by currency exchange rates of $0.05. If you net out both the tax and currency factors, our EPS guidance reflects double digit growth. In 2018, we again expect growth in all three of our segments. In transportation, we expect to be up high single digits on a reported basis and up mid-single digits organically. ","Auto is expected to be up mid-single digits organically on 1% auto production growth this year, reflecting continued content growth and share gains. Commercial transportation is expected to continue to outperform its end market, benefiting from content expansion and share gains in heavy truck and we expect another year of growth in sensors. In industrial solutions, we expect it to grow mid-single digits on both a reported and organic basis, with the primary growth drivers being factory automation and medical applications. ","In communications, we expect to be up low single digits both on a reported and an organic basis. In data and devices, we expect to benefit from high speed ramps in cloud infrastructure customers as well as design ramps for server OEMs. Data and devices and appliances is expected to more than offset some declines in SubCom due to program timing in 2018.","In summary, I feel very good about our portfolio as well as our execution and believe TE is well positioned to continue to deliver profitable growth ahead of our markets. We have established levers to drive earnings growth and continue to perform well against our business model, as demonstrated by our strong fiscal results at 2017. We do look forward to sharing more with you as part of our Investor Day in December and I hope that you can join us.","Before, we do go into Q&A, I do want to close by thanking our employees for the strong execution this past year and their continued commitment to grow TE as well as our customers.","So now, let\u2019s open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll first go to the line of Craig Hettenbach of Morgan Stanley.","Craig Hettenbach","First question on autos. Terrence, the 10% growth versus 1% production, you guys have been tracking 2 or 3 and that certainly stands out. So if you can just touch on if there's any timing elements and then as part of that question, from a sensor program perspective, any visibility in terms of when you see those new design wins ramping on the sensor side in autos?","Terrence Curtin","Let me take and there are two pieces. So first off on automotive, there is no timing, so there is actually, it\u2019s anyway, we\u2019re trying to catch up some of the inefficiencies we\u2019ve talked about, but really what was nice about fourth quarter was how even our [indiscernible]. We saw \u2013 earlier in the year, we had tremendous growth in Asia and as we came through the year, as China slowed a little bit, we still had the fourth quarter around 9% in Asia, 14% growth in Europe and also 5% growth in the Americas. So it\u2019s pretty broad based and really from that, I think that\u2019s where you really see the benefit. As we go forward, and I think it\u2019s reflected in our guidance, we see next year to be a pretty tempered auto production. We expect production to be flat in the first half and we expect really the 1% growth for the year to really be driven out of Asia as well as Europe, with the United States being down a little bit and we still think we\u2019re going to get the net single digit from the content growth. So we feel very good about the momentum we have and it\u2019s consistent that we can grow content above production around the trends.","On sensors, your second question, we feel very good about the growth we had this quarter and it was across all three pieces that we sort of look at in the sensors and we had a nice growth in automotive, we had nice growth in commercial transportation as well as the broader industrial markets to grow them. The program ramps are similar to what we told you before. We expect some of the auto ramps, that will be happening more in the latter half of next year, that one you\u2019re going to see the benefits of those. And that will help in the later half but nothing has really changed from what we told you.","Craig Hettenbach","Got it. And then if I can just ask a follow-up for Heath, step up in buybacks this quarter, any read through to that? I know you guys have been pretty consistent about the cash return policy, but did notice that an increase in buybacks in the quarter?","Heath Mitts","No. Nothing has changed from a perspective of our overall capital deployment strategy. Clearly, we had good cash flow generation in the quarter, we balance that out with acquisition activity that\u2019s going on and make sure that we hold to a reasonable cash level and then return money back to the owners of the company. So nothing that\u2019s strategically changed in terms of our outlook on that.","Operator","That will be from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen.","Joe Giordano","Just kind of following up on that last question, M&A outlook, I know it's a core part of your business, of your strategy. It\u2019s a part of your capital allocation program. I know your goal is to be a little bit more disciplined on price versus maybe some of the acquisitions you did historically and you're in an environment with pretty high valuations, so how are you looking at this right now and how does the pipeline look and maybe some comments on potential timing of that?","Terrence Curtin","Sure. And I appreciate the question. Listen, M&A activity is never as linear as you like to model it to be. The reality is, we\u2019ve got above sticks in the fire, we\u2019re probing around in all areas that you would think that we would be acquiring in. Some of the platform activity that was done in sensors and in medical has enabled us to tackle a couple of more fragmented markets where we can go after bolt-ons, we can layer in to those existing - to this platforms that we brought into the TE portfolio. But we\u2019re out there pretty aggressively right now looking for things, but to your point it is a pretty good seller's market and we have to speak to our discipline accordingly. So we are active is what I would say. I think you'll continue to see us announce a handful of Hirschmann like size deals over the next couple of years. And our goal is still to make that an important lever to our business model. But it is an expensive market, there is no doubt about it, there's a lot of competition for deals out there. So we\u2019re going to maintain our discipline, but still aggressively go out and cultivate activity.","Joe Giordano","And then as a follow up, you mentioned like a 150 million or so in restructuring. I just wanted to what\u2019s your internal kind of estimate for cost out from actions you've done previously into \u201918. And how should we think about 150 you\u2019re spending this year playing out. And kind to just more broadly where are you, do you think you are in this whole journey of site consolidations and kind of streamlining the production footprint of the company.","Terrence Curtin","Sure. I think as a rule of thumb, not all restructuring activities is treated equal right in terms of returns, but on average it\u2019s about two-year payback on the restructuring dollars that we spent on a cash payback. Obviously it depends where in the world you do these things. You could have a quicker or longer payback. But on average it\u2019s about two years. So you can model that in relative to what we spend this year and what we are going to spend next year.","The second part of your question though about where we are in the journey. Listen, the company well before I got here, a little over a year ago had done a tremendous amount of heavy lifting in the communications solution segment, rightsizing primarily the data and device business as starting back I think as far 2012 as we walked away from about a billion dollars of revenue that was no longer going to be part of our strategic content and having to rightsizing the business for that. So over that four year journey or so you saw a lot of activity in that segment. We feel very good about the operating footprint as you think about communications solutions today.","Our focus has churned a little more towards the industrial solutions business, just been the beneficiary of a fair number of acquisition over the last several years and there's some natural site consolidation activity that would \u2013 to optimize that footprint. And we\u2019ll softly tackle that, but it\u2019s going to take a couple to three years to get through that. And I think it's important that our customers and employees are first remind on that we don't want to do anything to disrupt what's going on there. So we\u2019re growing nicely and most pieces of our industrial solutions segment we have to contemplate that as well as we think about where we have capacity around the world. But I would envision a couple to three years would be my \u2013 if I was going to guide you to that.","Operator","That will be the line of Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Wamsi Mohan","Terrence, you reported 8% organic growth in 2017 that's pretty impressive. Guidance implies 4% organic. Can you just talk about sort of what you're seeing from an end market perspective going into \u201918? And I have a follow up.","Terrence Curtin","Great question Wamsi, and let me paint a little bit of backdrop. When we think about this year, I really think we did a good job capitalizing as markets improved. So first off when you think about maybe going from eight to four, I would start with transportation. We had a 3% auto production environment here, in 2017, we expect that to step down to 1%. We do believe with our content and our win, we're going to grow above market, spend in single-digit where we guided, certainly auto production is moving up from three to one. Secondly, both in transportation as well as in our CS segment, we benefited from content gain as well as share gain both in appliance and our industrial transportation business really around China. Some cycles that had some regulations and I talked about air conditioning segment in appliance.","We do expect those markets to come back a little bit more to reality as we go and moderate through the year. But we do see growth in those markets, but we don't expect to grow as high as we had in \u201817. In industrial, I would tell you, I think we\u2019ve seen more of the same. I think the industrial markets throughout this year got more momentum as I said they become balanced across the world. And I sort of knew you are continuing to see this mid-single digit growth where we been running in the second half. And then the last thing that I would say on the bridging sort of eight to the four is, our SubCom business grew 6% last year, well over $900 million. What we're looking at next year, we expect SubCom to be $800 million to $900 million based upon the backlog that\u2019s over a billion dollars I talked about. And what\u2019s really nice about that is, we do expect our data and devices as well as appliances growth to offset even as SubCom is down a little bit. It\u2019s still a high point in cycle, but we do think its elongated. So there are some of the moving parts qualitatively that are reflected in the guidance that I talked about as part of the script and in the slides.","Wamsi Mohan","And I guess my follow up and it\u2019s somewhat related to your answer here, you showed pretty significant operating margin improvement and you noted some pretty strong above market trends here in fiscal \u201917. You EBIT margin improved double of what you typically expect of 50 bps and more than double and are still depressed my some supply chain inefficiencies. Your guidance is implying roughly 50 bps going into next year. And I'm just wondering why won\u2019t it be higher than that given that you still have sort of 4% organic growth and you don't have the headwinds of supply chains inefficiencies that you're sort of lapping this quarter. Thanks.","Heath Mitts","Part of this, as Terrence said we still have another quarter or so of the inefficiencies as we ramp that up through the calendar year. And we\u2019re taking a reasonable view where our investment levels are going to be for next year as well as where the growth is coming from and have mixed layers into that. But in general I would say we feel very good about the work that transportation teams has done to handle this revenue growth and dealing with the situation of improving what has been the efficiencies and where we see that going in terms of progress towards remediation on that. And we feel good about our ability to extend margins in the other two segments as well. So I think we\u2019re going to be off to a good start here in our first quarter and we\u2019ll continue to update you as the year progresses.","Operator","That will be from the line of Shawn Harrison with Longbow Research. Your line is open.","Shawn Harrison","Hopefully my math is right, I'm not working off a candy hangover, but if we get a two year payback on last year's restructuring program and this year\u2019s as well that's maybe 150 million I\u2019d say of I guess benefits to potentially come to the P&L. Are there any offsets, I know commodities are up or things like that that would negate kind of that easy math of 150 million of potential benefits from the two years of restructuring.","Heath Mitts","Well, I think the math is a little -- your math seems a little rich, but there certainly are some things. I mean we don't bridge every last thing. There's no doubt that commodity pressures are embedded in our guidance. I mean if you were to just - look at just commodities alone and freeze that today it\u2019s probably $0.10 of headwind in the quarter, I'm sorry, for the full year, if commodity prices stay where they are today, for 2018, I mean we're not going to go through all of the pieces because we've got productivity initiatives, restructuring initiatives and things like that to offset those types of things.","But certainly it\u2019s a balanced view of where those types of cost reside as well as some of the investment level as we are. We have a very rich revenue pipeline right now across most of our businesses. And we are making investments in both OpEx as well in CapEx. So engineering and capital expenditures to make those - handle this type of outsize revenue growth relative to our market. So it\u2019s a balanced view, but certainly there's puts and takes. Restructuring impact does help us, there is no doubt, not just in the short term but in the long term in terms of the optimized footprint going forward and we're making a bestselling place as well.","Shawn Harrison","There's a follow up if I may, Terrence last quarter I think you may have mentioned that you're seeing a little bit of a disconnect between longer term orders relative to immediate term kind of bookings that you would guide to. Did you see that normalize a bit with distribution maybe selling matching sell through a little bit more evenly here through October.","Terrence Curtin","Yeah Shaw, I did mention that last quarter. And in some ways we did see some things expanding out. When you look at the orders, orders have stayed pretty consistent in quarter three, quarter four as I mentioned. The other thing I would say is we are seeing from our channel partners sell through and sell out rates, so that\u2019s selling into them and their PSO out, are marrying each other. So we see inventory turns staying very healthy, we don\u2019t see inventory building up. And from that viewpoint I think things are reasonably in balance where we see things right now. So, where things are especially in a quarter where typically they get a little weaker because in many cases their end of the year at December, staying pretty solid.","Operator","That will be from the line of Jim Suva with Citi. Your line is open.","Jim Suva","Two quick clarification questions. First was on the restructuring I believe you said 150 million, was that for fiscal year ending 2017 or outlook for 2018 and what would the outlook for restructuring cost be for 2018.","Heath Mitts","Jim, this is Heath. It\u2019s actually both. Approximately 150 million for 2017 and we expect similar levels for 2018.","Jim Suva","And the changes in tax, is that relative to your recent acquisitions or some change in tax filing or the souring of your income or how should we think about what's going on with your taxes and this rate expected to continue to increase assuming no political tax reform?","Heath Mitts","Our rate is not \u2013 our guidance rate of 19% to 20% for the year does not contemplate any kind of tax reform as we're not going to speculate on what that may look like. But I would tell this, you know, as global as we are, our construct is really complicated journey to through and decipher well what the moving parts are going to be on our tax rates. Some of it is jurisdictional mix in terms of the increase and the results of some. These are handful of small three things that benefited us in 2017 that we do not anticipate repeating in 2018 around statute explorations that we have reserved for that we benefited from in 2017 that do not happen again in 2018.","But I think probably more importantly our security towards the fact that our cash tax rate was still inside of our ETR for 2017 and we\u2019ll continue to be even inside of that 19 to 20 for next year. Our cash tax rate tends to run roughly 150 basis points below our published effective tax rate which is more important metric as we think about.","Jim Suva","Then my last question is on the transportation, with transportation revenues being up year-over-year, the margins being down year-over-year, you mentioned supply chain inefficiencies are something. Can you go into a little bit of details of exactly what is going on there? Because I believe this is now the second quarter of that. And I think you said through the December quarter. So that would be three quarters of, it seemed like an awful long time to remedy some challenges for a company like yourself who's been in this industry for decades.","Heath Mitts","Well, I mean if you look at the revenue growth Jim, I mean the revenue growth is far outside of what the market growth is. And we\u2019re winning and content wins have been great of the topline. Some of the challenges that the supply chain reacting to our ability to get certain types of parts. And so there's in-sourcing activities going on, most of the cost is related to expedite freight charges, spending more money on things to get things to our customers in a more timely manner is costing us a fair amount of money to do that. I would say this, the team has done a nice job. But when you're talking about adding stamping and welding machines, it tends to be a fairly long lead times, these are not things you to go by off of a retail floor, you get order, commission them and install them and get them up and running.","And we are aggressively doing that. I would say that the quarter we just finished that we're talking about today we peaked out in terms of those inefficiencies. We are seeing in real time that those costs are starting to come down, but it will be behind us by the end of this quarter largely. So yes, it was a three quarter journey, it happens. I would say the revenue growth, the demand for our products are real good. And we're on top of it. But there's no doubt that has caused some pain points for the team as they\u2019ve had to respond aggressively towards this. And it did impact. I think we noted in the call, it impacted segment margins by 150 basis points. So we would have grown our margins in the mid-19% range absent these inefficiencies. But we do feel good, we will back for margin rate perspective, in the first quarter back well north of 19% and feel good about where they year is going to end for transportation.","Operator","That will be from the line of Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst ","This is Erwin Lu [ph] dialing in for Amit. I had a question about SubCom, you talked about the business being impacted by products timing issues. If I'm not mistaken, I think last quarter you indicated that the business would be flat year-over-year in fiscal 2018. I guess from a timing perspective, can you just provide or give us a sense of what's changed versus 90 days ago.","Terrence Curtin","Couple of things, SubCom is very different than the rest of our businesses. So this is much more of a project construction based business, so how projects come in, how we have to permit those projects, also how our customers want to get those charged in the project, when we look at it, it does get a little bit lumpy and it\u2019s been like that forever. So when you sit there, nothing has really changed about the business, we feel good about the backlog, being around $1 billion which is where it\u2019s been now, plus or minus a little bit for multiple years.","And it give us confidence about this cycle being elongated versus what we\u2019ve had historically. And that cycle once again is around the need for data in our cloud provider customers and that's what\u2019s great even about our latest award includes them. So as we look into next year, like I said in my comments we look at the project timing, it looks like we\u2019re going to be in that $800 million to $900 million range as we go into next year. We\u2019ll have to see how projects fill in. but right now I don't think anything's changed from last quarter, it\u2019s just what we expected to be up at this higher point of the cycle, plus or minus a little bit.","Unidentified Analyst ","And just as a follow up, as I look at your communications solutions business, particularly in data devices and appliances, you indicated that growth in Asia was a major driver of your performance. Is it possible to talk about some of the underlying demand trends on sort of an ex-Asia basis?","Terrence Curtin","Yeah, a couple of things. So in appliances, it is your traditionally driver, so it is around appliance bills, home starts and really this year I would say outside of Asia, traditional appliance that was sort of a low single-digit market. We were able to grow faster than that due to our leading position as well as content wins we\u2019ve had. But really we benefited from an air conditioning cycle in Cycle that was much stronger and you saw all that growth throughout the year. And that in devices it\u2019s really a global business when you think about how those customers act. We did see strength in Asia really around cloud and how we sell to as the cloud builds out. But when we said they are going forward, we do see Asia will always be a big driver when it comes to data and devices just due to where the products made also where the design is done. So outside the United States isn\u2019t as relevant \u2013 outside of Asia sorry isn't as relevant for data and devices when it comes to revenue.","Operator","That will be from the line of Steven Fox with Cross Research. Your line is open.","Steven Fox","Two questions from me. First off, you've mentioned both content wins and market share gains. I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about the market share gains for a few minutes in terms of what's driving that, where they're most prevalent and assume maybe we should exclude the data business since that seems to be a specific product cycle for you guys. But outside of data, can you talk about market share gains. And I have a follow up.","Terrence Curtin","Certainly, there's an element of what we track Steve, both regionally and I think when you take the share gains ex-content, we feel very good about our momentum in auto. Globally we also feel very good on share momentum in our ICT business. And I would also say if you jump into industrial growth and what we've been able to accomplish in the industrial side both of the factory, automation as well as medical.","When you get into excluding data in appliance, I would tell you we had tremendous momentum from a share gain in Asia over many years now. Taking our leading position in more of a Western position around Europe and then United States than actually has our Asian customers have become more global players then they work historically really driving share gain wins in Asia through all the major appliance manufacturers. So when you look at share gains at our ex-content or electronification, really they're the markets that we see it in and in more of our traditional products.","Steven Fox","And then just as a follow up, the Hirschmann acquisition obviously makes sense, but it seems to suggest maybe you're expanding your look at what you're going after in auto around connected applications. Is that correct and if so, what does it say for maybe other deals in that area or do you have enough now to do more in terms of just getting and stuff like that.","Terrence Curtin","Steve, on Hirschmann, I don't think I would say it\u2019s different, I do think it's things that we actually do already and how do we get a little bit deeper in it. So when you look at Hirschmann, and Hirschmann what it does is really be antenna technology and how that integrates into the [indiscernible] are some things that we've done already in our automotive business. So we get excited about it\u2019s an area where we\u2019ve had transaction organically and we do typically look at where we have traction organically for an inorganic similar to what we did [indiscernible] and similar to what we did with medical.","But when you take Hirschmann there were things we were doing that might have been a little bit on the lower tech scale than what Hirschmann did. And what this really allows us to do is continue to build our penetration around the connected car infrastructure really around the physical network that happens in a vehicle, so that\u2019s within vehicle. So it\u2019s a natural extension of what we're doing. And we're happy to have Hirschmann as part of our team and that opens up a bigger content envelope than what we were doing historically.","So it actually allows us to continue to building strong content momentum that we talked to you about and opens up a bigger area that we can also take Hirschmann more global than they have been because they have been very European centric and how do we take that technology with our strong auto position. So I would say it\u2019s a go-to market play, it\u2019s also getting core technology a little bit broader, I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s completely different than what we do that would be the only thing I would modify from what your question was.","Operator","That would be from the line of Matthew Sheerin with Stifel. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst ","Hi. This is [indiscernible] on behalf of Mat Sheerin. In the past and currently you mentioned that cloud and hyper scale infrastructure has been a big driver for data and devices. Could you just be able to give more detail on the materiality in the segment as well as your growth expectations for fiscal year on that segment. Thank you.","Terrence Curtin","But when you take it, and I\u2019m going to talk higher level. When you take our data devices businesses, you sort of break it down. We don\u2019t have much exposure to consumer anymore and that what Heath talked about as we moved away from that to really point our engineers harsher environments. So when you think about our data devices business there's an element of it probably about 30%, 40% that relates to traditional telco infrastructure. There is an element that also relates to wireless and then there is an element that relates to the cloud.","And certainly cloud means both servers as well as the emerging hyperscale providers that we all talk about a lot. So when you sit there really the traditional telco infrastructure has been pretty muted. I think you\u2019ve seen that. On the wireless side we are waiting for some of the 5G rollouts that are upcoming over the next couple of years to really help that piece of the pie. But clearly when you take this year, the growth has really been driven by the cloud and the our hyperscale customers. And that has created I would say almost all the growth we\u2019ve had in our data devices business this year and has offset some of the slowness in the traditional telco and wireless infrastructure. So that's the way I would ask you think about it in response to our question.","Operator","That would be from the line of Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Adrienne Colby","Hi, its Adrienne Colby for Sherri Scribner, thanks for taking the question. Within industrial solutions, commercial aerospace continues to be a bit of a drag. Just wondering if you could provide some color on the ongoing timing issue. And also if you could talk about the trends you're seeing in oil and gas, just trying to understand better what was going on energy in the quarter.","Terrence Curtin","So let me your first question, so in commercial aerospace, clearly that\u2019s about almost 50% of what we do in our aerospace and defense business. And when you sit there and the contact what we have we feel very good about, both with -- both airplane manufacturers. What we\u2019ve seen a sluggishness throughout the supply chain on build rates, and really that\u2019s been something that has been happening all year. So we feel very good with the content and clearly as that momentum picks up as build rates and the supply chain were through that\u2019s a sluggishness we\u2019re talking about.","On oil and gas, oil and gas in not our energy business, our energy business is much more around power transmission, distribution and generation. The oil and gas businesses at our aerospace and defense submarine business and I would say that business was very flat this year. We continue to see stabilization in that market, but we expect slight growth next year, but it\u2019s still running around $120 million per annum. And we not expecting some big rebound in that as we go through our 2018 guidance.","Operator","That will be from the line of Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","This is [indiscernible] on for Mark, thank you for taking the question. My first question is on automotive. How is TE thinking about the increased auto purchase tax in China in 2018 within its guidance?","Terrence Curtin","When you sit there, we look at auto production. And so right now when we're sitting there, we do sort of view auto production next year in China to be relatively flat to this year of low-single digit. So when we sit there clearly this year, we had very strong growth, about 9% production growth in China. So as the incentives have worked off and the facts you talked about, we do expect more muted China production next year and that\u2019s included in our 1% global auto production.","Despite that we feel very comfortable that we\u2019re going to grow mid-single digit on that backdrop of global production. And what\u2019s really nice about our global positioning in automotive is we really see that Europe will be a big growth driver in next year based upon our contact wins. So you're going to hear us talk a little bit more about Europe as we go into next year, while this year has been very much around China and Asia in automotive. You are going to see our European based upon our great global position that we have.","Unidentified Analyst ","And as a follow up, the sequential revenue guide in 1Q fiscal \u201918 is more benign than typical seasonality. Can you discuss what the main driver or drivers of that are?","Heath Mitts","Largely just, we would agree with you. But largely driven by the stronger order rates coming out of our fourth quarter where we see world. As we\u2019re looking at it we have pretty strong orders across all the businesses and across all regions. So it's a lot of going back to what Terrence has been talking about in the last few minutes around content and market share. We feel very, very good about it, but agree that it's not the normal seasonal step down that we would normally see. ","Sujal Shah","Okay, thank you Tim. It looks like there is no further anymore questions. So if you have any more questions please contact investor relations at TE.

As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Sujal Shah. Please go ahead.","Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Good morning and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss TE Connectivity's fourth quarter and full year 2016 results. With me today are Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Lynch; President, Terrence Curtin; and Chief Financial Officer, Heath Mitts.","During the course of this call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information, and we ask you to review the forward-looking cautionary statements included in today's press release. In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussion this morning, and we ask you to review the sections of our press release and the accompanying slide presentation that addresses the use of these items. The press release and related tables, along with the slide presentation, can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at te.com.","Finally, for participants on the Q&A portion of today's call, I would like to remind everyone to limit themselves to one follow-up question to make sure we are able to cover all questions during the allotted time.","Now let me turn the call over to Tom for opening comments.","Thomas J. Lynch - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Thanks for joining us today. I'm going to review the highlights of Q4 and the full year and preview fiscal 2017 guidance, then I'll turn it over to Terrence to cover our performance in more detail. Before I get started, one more reminder that our fourth quarter included 14 weeks this year.","Please turn to slide three. Fiscal 2016 was a very good year for TE. I'm especially pleased with our Q4 results which included record adjusted earnings per share above the high end of our guidance and record free cash flow. We also finished the year with strong orders, setting us up for a good start to our 2017 fiscal year. A key takeaway is that on both a 13-week and 14-week basis, the company had a very good fourth quarter, exceeding our guidance in earnings and expectations in cash flow.","Sales for the full 14-week quarter were $3.3 billion, essentially at the midpoint of our guidance. Excluding the extra week, sales grew 4% and 2% organically. Adjusted EPS was $1.27 on a 14-week basis, $0.07 better than the midpoint of our guidance. On a 13-week basis, adjusted EPS was $1.14, up 27% over the prior year, and as I mentioned, a new record for us.","Orders of $2.95 billion were up 11% year-over-year and up 1% sequentially excluding the extra week and our SubCom business. Adjusted operating margin was 16.5% and free cash flow was approximately $600 million.","We continue to execute our harsh strategy with the completion of acquisition of Intercontec at the end of the quarter, adding a very nice range of connectivity products to our Industrial Solutions product portfolio. We also continue to execute very well in the SubCom business with the October announcement that TE was awarded the new Pacific Light Cable Network, a trans-Pacific system where TE is working with Google and Facebook. Q4 was a very good quarter and momentum is strong as we enter fiscal 2017.","Now please turn to slide four. We were able to beat our guidance and deliver double digit adjusted EPS growth despite a slower-than-expected economic environment. This is a good indicator of the multiple levers we have to drive performance.","Our harsh businesses continue to perform well. SubCom had an excellent year and we made several key acquisitions including Creganna, which established us as a leader in the market for minimally-invasive medical solutions, Jaquet which expanded our sensor position in the transportation market, and Intercontec which I mentioned earlier. We also sold our Circuit Protection business to narrow our focus in the Communication segment.","From a financial perspective, sales were $12.24 billion; adjusted EPS was $4.08, $0.08 above our original guidance; and free cash flow exceeded our expectations at $1.6 billion.","We maintained strong operating margins of 15.8% for the full year with operating margins in the 16%-plus range in the second half. Adjusted EBITDA margins remained strong at 20.6% in a very low growth market. We also returned $3.1 billion to shareholders in dividends and stock buybacks.","Now I'll take a minute to highlight our fiscal 2017 guidance. We expect revenue of $12.3 billion to $12.9 billion, which represents total growth of 5% and organic growth of 3% at midpoint using a 52-week baseline in fiscal 2016. We expect adjusted EPS of $4.19 to $4.49, representing 10% growth at midpoint and another year of double digit EPS growth when compared to the 52-week base of $3.95 in 2016.","Before we move on, I wanted to recognize that this is the first earnings call since our announcement that Terrence Curtin will become CEO in March. I couldn't be more confident about the choice of Terrence. I also want to welcome Heath Mitts who joined us as CFO a couple of months ago. Heath is getting up to speed very quickly and will be a strong partner for Terrence.","Now I'll pass it over to Terrence and he will review our performance in more detail.","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Thanks, Tom. And good morning, everyone. Before we get into the segment results and updates, I'd like to cover our orders for the quarter, which will help provide the foundation for the trends that we're seeing in our business as well as our expectations for 2017.","If you could please turn to slide five, and this shows our order trends on both a 13 and 14-week basis excluding our SubCom business. I'll speak to our orders on a 13-week basis so you have an apples-to-apples comparison versus last year and last quarter.","Orders were up 11% year-over-year and our book-to-bill was 1.03. On a sequential basis, we saw 1% growth which is stronger than normal seasonality as we typically experience a slight sequential decline. So we're clearly pleased with the order momentum as we enter into 2017.","Geographically, we saw order growth in all regions on an organic basis. The strength overall was driven by Asia, both in China, as well as outside of China, with order growth of 22%. Europe and the Americas orders grew approximately 3%, and those regions remain steady with continued growth in orders.","From a segment perspective, in Transportation, orders increased 15% year-over-year and were up 3% sequentially as China auto OEMs increased production ahead of the expiration of government incentives at the end of the calendar year.","Industrial segment orders grew 15% year-over-year due to the Creganna acquisition, and on an organic order basis, they grew 4% with growth across each of our three Industrial businesses. Sequentially, Industrial orders declined in line with typical seasonality.","In the Communications segment, excluding SubCom, we saw sequential growth of 4% driven by both our Appliances and Data\/Device businesses. In Data and Devices, we are seeing increasing momentum in the business as product exits are largely behind us. And year-over-year orders were up if you exclude the impact from the sale of our Circuit Protection business.","Now let me spend a minute on SubCom, as this business continues its strong momentum. As Tom mentioned, we were recently named as the supplier of trans-Pacific system with Google and Facebook, and with $1 billion of backlog, we expect SubCom to grow again in 2017.","Please turn to slide six to discuss the segment results, and let me kick it off with our Transportation segment. Segment sales grew 5% organically in the quarter on a 13-week basis, with strong growth in Auto and Commercial Transportation. This was offset by weakness in Sensors that was driven by industrial-related markets like we've talked about the past few quarters.","Our Auto sales in the quarter were up 6%, in line with our expectations and ahead of auto production growth of 3% during the quarter due to content gains. Growth was driven by strength in Asia and in Europe partially offset by declines in North America.","Going forward, we continue to expect our Auto business to grow ahead of auto production, driven by electronic content growth and a rich pipeline of platform ramps from design wins that we generated over the past several years.","In our Commercial and Transportation business, we delivered very strong performance with organic growth of 4% year-over-year despite a very challenging end market in North America. Our performance was driven by strength in China and Europe, and this was partially offset by declines in North America.","Turning to Sensors, we saw overall growth of 4% that was driven by the acquisition of Jaquet. We did see a 2% organic decline as we continue to be impacted by the weaknesses in the industrial-related markets, which make up more than half of our sensor sales.","We continue to see strong design win momentum in the automotive space for sensor applications and expect to begin to see meaningful revenue from these programs beginning in fiscal 2018.","Adjusted operating margins in the segment were 19.6% and were in line with our expectations and were up sequentially 20 basis points. For the full year, the segment delivered 5% organic growth and 19.2% adjusted operating margins.","If you could please turn to slide seven, let me move over to the Industrial Solutions segment. On an overall basis, segment sales were up 16% year-over-year due to the acquisition of Creganna. On a 13-week organic basis, revenue in the segment declined 2% driven by weakness in the Oil and Gas and an overall slow Industrial Equipment environment. Geographically, we continue to see North America as weak, Europe as stable and China improving.","I'll provide some color now on sales growth in our industrial businesses and this'll be on a 13-week basis. In the Industrial Equipment area, we saw 15% growth driven by the Creganna acquisition, which is performing ahead of our expectations. We continue to be excited about the growth potential in this minimally-invasive medical market. On a pro forma basis, if we had owned Creganna this time last year, our growth would have been greater than 10%.","Excluding Creganna, the Industrial Equipment business declined 7% organically with softness in all regions but did show first half to second half growth of 7% as markets recovered from the first half inventory correction that we talked about earlier in the year.","In the Aerospace & Defense area, we had strong growth of 6% organically, driven by share gains in both commercial air platforms and defense applications.","In Oil and Gas, similar to prior quarters, our sales declined by 27% due to the end market conditions in that area.","And finally, our Energy business had a very nice growth of 6% organically with growth both in China as well as in the Americas.","From a margin perspective, adjusted operating margins were in line with expectations but down year-over-year. The year-over-year decline is due entirely to the Oil and Gas business, which impacted segment operating margins by approximately 100 basis points year-over-year due to the revenue declines that we saw in that business. We do expect the oil and gas impact to our margins to affect our comparisons to the first quarter of 2017 but then they'll be anniversaried as we get later into the year.","For the full year, the Industrial Solutions segment delivered 1% actual growth and 12.3% adjusted operating margins. Organically, the segment sales declined 3% for the full year but did grow 11% from the first half to second half following the inventory corrections that I mentioned that we experienced in the first two quarters.","So, if you could please turn to slide eight, let me cover Communications Solutions. During the quarter, the Communications segment revenue was down 1% organically on a 13-week basis. The SubCom business saw 13% year-over-year growth driven by strong execution from multiple projects that we have in force. For the full year, SubCom grew 25% in fiscal 2016. In Appliances on a 13-week basis, our business grew 3% organically while Data and Devices declined 13% organically due to the effects of product exits. What was nice about Data and Devices, we did experience another quarter of sequential sales growth in the business in quarter four as the product exits are largely behind us.","Adjusted operating margin for the segment expanded 180 basis points sequentially and 240 basis points year-over-year due to the productivity improvements and restructuring actions we've taken in the segment. For the full year 2016, Communications Solutions declined 2% organically driven by Data and Devices and generated 11.6% adjusted operating margins.","Now let me hand it over to Heath who will cover the financials.","Heath A. Mitts - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Thank you, Terrence. And good morning, everyone. To start off, I'm excited to join the TE team here and I look forward to getting to know the investor and analyst community over the coming quarters.","Now if you'd please turn to slide nine, I'll provide more details on our Q4 earnings. Adjusted operating income was $551 million with an adjusted operating margin of 16.5%. Excluding the extra week, our adjusted operating margin was 16%. Note that the operating income impact from the additional week was $55 million.","GAAP operating income was $517 million and included $30 million of restructuring charges driven primarily by Data and Devices and $4 million of acquisition-related charges.","Adjusted EPS was $1.27 for the quarter. If you exclude the $0.13 contribution from the additional week, adjusted EPS was $1.14 and up 27% year-on-year, a new company record. The growth above prior year was driven by an increase in operating income, incremental benefits from share buyback, and a lower adjusted effective tax rate of 13%. The adjusted tax rate was lower than prior guidance due to the mix of profitability by region and statute expirations in certain jurisdictions.","GAAP EPS was $1.22 for the quarter and included restructuring and acquisition-related charges of $0.05. For full year 2016, restructuring charges were $125 million, and I expect similar levels for 2017, driven primarily by activity in our industrial-related and acquired businesses.","Due to the benefit from the settlement of all pre-separation tax disputes with the Internal Revenue Service that was discussed last quarter, we ended 2016 with a full-year GAAP income tax benefit of $779 million and an adjusted effective tax rate of 18.5% for the full year. I expect a full-year adjusted effective tax rate of 20% for 2017.","Now if you'll turn to slide 10, our business is performing well in a challenging economic environment driven by the resiliency of our harsh portfolio and the execution of the TE Operating Advantage program or TEOA. Adjusted gross margin in the quarter was 33.2%, a 70% [sic] 0.7% improvement from prior year driven by productivity improvements across the segments. Adjusted operating margins were 16.5% in the quarter, and going forward into 2017, we continue to manage our business tightly and will continue to invest for future growth in our harsh businesses.","Adjusted EBITDA margins help explain the profitability performance of our business including acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA margins in Q4 were strong at 20.9%, which was up 20 basis points sequentially.","In the quarter, we had strong performance with cash flow from continuing operations of $782 million and free cash flow of $594 million, up a strong 53% from prior year. The growth was driven by significant improvements in working capital, and again, is reflective of the team's solid execution.","For the full year, I'm pleased to report that we generated nearly $1.6 billion of free cash flow, signaling a very healthy business. Looking ahead, we continue to expect free cash flow to approximate net income and capital expenditures to be approximately 5% of revenue. We remain committed to our disciplined long-term capital strategy of a balanced return of free cash flow to shareholders while still having ample free cash flow available for acquisitions.","In 2016, we returned $3.1 billion to our shareholders through dividend and share repurchases. Our balance sheet remains strong with reasonable debt levels and an ability to continue to support the return of capital and acquisitions going forward. We have added a balance sheet and cash flow summary in the appendix for additional details.","And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Terrence.","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Thanks, Heath. And now I'll cover our guidance for the first quarter and the full year of 2017. So, if you could please turn to slide 11 for the first quarter outlook.","We expect first quarter revenue of $2.95 billion to $3.05 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $0.98 to $1.02, representing sales growth of 6% and 3% on an organic basis, and 19% adjusted EPS growth at the midpoint. Following record adjusted EPS and strong orders in the fourth quarter, our guidance represents a strong start to our fiscal 2017.","By segment, we expect Transportation Solutions to grow mid-single digits both organically and on an actual basis. This is above expected auto production growth levels of 2% in the first quarter, driven by China, as well as Europe. Commercial Transportation growth, we expect to be driven by Asia.","In the Industrial segment, we expect it to grow double digits overall due to the Creganna and Intercontec acquisitions and will be flat organically, with the weakness in oil and gas market offsetting growth in our Aerospace & Defense business. We expect low single digit organic growth in the Communications segment driven by Appliances and SubCom.","If you could now turn to slide 12, and I'll cover the full-year guidance. For the full year, we expect revenue in the range of $12.3 billion to $12.9 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $4.19 to $4.49. This represents 5% overall growth, 3% organic growth and 10% adjusted earnings per share growth at the midpoint versus 52 weeks fiscal 2016 results.","I feel very good about our ability to drive 3% organic growth and double digit adjusted EPS growth in this challenging economic environment. This is in line with our overall business model and proves that our harsh strategy is delivering while we continue to benefit from the secular trend of content growth across our harsh businesses.","We expect our Transportation segment to be up mid-single digits organically on 1% global oil production growth next year. And this reflects content growth trends as well as share gains from the programs we've won in the past. Commercial Transportation we expect to outperform its end market again this year, benefiting from content expansion in the heavy truck market. And we expect our Sensors business to grow 7% in total year-over-year.","In the Industrial segment, we expect it to be up low single digits organically with continued gains in Commercial Aerospace and Defense, momentum in interventional medical applications driving the growth and also stabilization in our Oil and Gas business.","In the Communications segment, we expect to be up low single digits organically with growth driven by Appliances and SubCom. As I said, momentum in SubCom remains very strong with the $1 billion that we have in backlog, benefiting from the buildout of the cloud, and we expect growth in the mid-single digits in SubCom in 2017.","Now let me turn it back over to Tom for some closing comments.","Thomas J. Lynch - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Thanks, Terrence. To reiterate, 2016 was a very good year for TE and we're expecting another very good year in 2017 with 5% overall sales growth, 3% organic growth, operating margin expansion and double digit adjusted EPS growth excluding the additional week in 2015.","Our harsh strategy is definitely delivering, with 80% of our revenue driven by harsh environment applications. These products are highly engineered and developed at the application architecture level, providing a wide moat around our solution. Over the past five years, we have averaged mid-single digit growth across our harsh businesses and have multiple levers to continue to drive margin expansion.","We have remained active in shaping our portfolio to focus on harsh applications. Over the past year, our acquisitions have given TE a leading position in solutions for the minimally-invasive medical market, expanded our portfolio of industrial connectors, and bolstered our offering of sensors for the auto market.","At the same time, we returned over $3 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. Over time, we have maintained consistency with our capital strategy, returning nearly $12 billion to shareholders since we became a public company nearly 10 years ago. Moving forward, we expect free cash flow to approximate net income and continue to expect to return two-thirds of our free cash flow to shareholders and use one-third for acquisitions.","While there will be cyclicality, the markets that TE serves have strong underlying secular trends driven by the megatrends of safe, green and connected.","Using auto as an example, these trends are driving the need for more sensors and connectors to support increased safety features, autonomous driving systems, higher emission standards and infotainment. TE benefits directly from these trends, and this is reflected in our transportation guidance for fiscal 2017 where we expect to grow mid-single digits on 1% auto production growth.","We see similar drivers in our Industrial and Communications businesses, which will enable us to grow content.","TE has multiple levers to drive revenue and EPS growth. As the world leader in connectors and sensors, we have unmatched technology and global presence. With over 7,000 engineers, we are setting the pace for new product and technology development and are driving our customers' roadmaps with integrated solutions which TE is uniquely positioned to provide. And all the work we've done over the last several years has translated into each dollar of revenue today is delivering 40% more EPS than five years ago.","These are very exciting times for TE, and I'm proud of what we have accomplished this year. I'm also very happy that Terrence is succeeding me, as he's been instrumental in establishing TE's global leadership position in connectivity and sensor solutions and strengthening the company's financial performance to drive value for our shareholders. We've prepared Terrence for this role over several years, and I will continue on as Executive Chairman of the Board, making sure this is a seamless transition.","So, thank you. And now let's open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question is from the line of Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Good morning, guys. So, I guess I was going to ask you about the threat of Russia hacking a subsea cable, but you guys covered that earlier today. I guess...","Thomas J. Lynch - TE Connectivity Ltd.","(27:33)","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","That's your first question.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","I guess the first official question will be, Transportation orders were up rather strong, I think up 25%. Terrence, I think you mentioned that China was the driver for that. So, maybe you could just talk about what the trends look like excluding the China benefit. And would that suggest that maybe this 1% production estimate you have is perhaps more H1 or first half heavy for you guys?","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Amit, I think a couple of things. When we look at the orders, we saw nice orders. I think when you look at Automotive, we saw nice orders in Europe. We also saw very strong orders in Asia. As I mentioned, clearly, China was a big part of it. And North America has been the trends we've been seeing.","I think when you look at next year and we talk about the 1% production growth, the first quarter we do see 2% production growth, really driven, as we've seen, some acceleration in production in China. And then, I think you're going to see it be more 1% or less for the rest of the year.","We do think China, when we look at the 1%, is going to be about 3% production growth for the overall year in that 1%. We do expect Europe to sort of be low single digit production growth and North America to be flat when we look at it through next year. So, I think when you look at the first half, you'll see China normalize during the first half of this year is the way we're looking at it, with a little bit stronger in the first quarter.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's helpful. And then, I guess, Industrial segment, margins at 13.4% I think were down year-over-year by 40, 50 basis points. Is your mix some part (29:05) of it? But just help us understand, I mean, revenues are obviously much stronger today than they've been before. What gets you to that 15%, 16% op margin ZIP code on that segment? And could you get there by the end of this year?","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","I think when you look at the Industrial segment, as I said in my comments, right now we are being impacted about 100 basis points due to the impact of the oil and gas market. And to frame that for everybody again, our Oil and Gas business went from probably $200 million in 2015 (29:39) down to $125 million in 2016. So, we did have a pretty sharp decline, and that was high-margin business that has impacted the overall segment.","So, I do feel good we've improved the margins net of that effect, if you remove that effect, and we do expect margin expansion next year in this segment. I don't think we're going to get up to 15% next year, to your question, because we still have a pretty low organic growth in that segment. And that growth is going to be driven by Aerospace & Defense, certainly in the medical space, and we're also going to need some more volume to get up towards that 15%. But we have been doing cost actions and do expect the margin to improve next year and to be a contributor for total TE margin expansion.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Perfect. That's it for me. Thank you, guys.","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Thanks.","Thomas J. Lynch - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Thank you.","Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Thanks, Amit. Could we have the next question, please?","Operator","Next is the line of Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes. Thank you. Good quarter. And congrats, Heath, on the new role. As we look at autos here, I mean, if we look at 2016 for the full year, there was 2% to 2.5% production growth, you guys did about 3.4% growth organic in autos. Your guidance here inarguably \u2013 which is prudent given the weakness that we're seeing across different regions -- of 1% production growth is implying a 5% growth in transport.","So, could you help sort of talk a little bit maybe in a little bit more detail around some of the share gains and increased comp and drivers that you sort of alluded to on the call which gives you confidence that you can bridge this wider gap of almost four points incremental growth from a content perspective? And I have a follow-up.","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Sure. Thank you for the question. Actually, when you look at it, earlier in this year, as we covered, there were some supply chain corrections that we had in China early in the year, as well as North America sort of middle of the year. And now that we're in a pretty stable environment to where we're at today from a production. I think you're going to see that content growth to that separation. And it is around both content and share gain, Wamsi. It's not one or the other.","And I think you've seen that both in our fourth quarter, you've seen that separation come back from our growth rate in a pretty stable production environment, and also in our first quarter guidance, where we're guiding mid-single digits on 2% production. So, I think there's proof around our business model. And our business model, as we've told you, in a low growth production environment, you can have 6% of content and then a little bit of price give-back that sort of gets to that mid-single digit around this 1% production environment. And we feel very confident with the gains we have and all the global platforms we're on, even in a 1% production environment we can drive that type of growth.","Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, Terrence. And as my follow-up, your Transport segment margins on a year-on-year basis were lower despite significantly higher revenue. Can you help us dimension the investments you're making in Transport? Is it all in Sensors? And the magnitude and pace of investments in 2017 versus 2016 that we should expect. Thanks.","Heath A. Mitts - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Sure, Wamsi. We're definitely investing in Sensors, as we've been saying all year, with the significant design wins we're getting in the automotive side, which won't hit revenues till 2018. So, we're investing ahead of revenue for sure. We're also continuing to invest in the harsh connectivity side and in this integrated solutions area because it's a very promising space.","When you dissect it a little bit more, the pure auto connector margins and industrial transportation margins have held up really well in the year. So, most of this is because of investment in Sensors. If we hadn't have done that, you'd have seen our margins about flat year-over-year.","Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks, Heath.","Heath A. Mitts - TE Connectivity Ltd.","All right.","Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Thank you, Wamsi. Can we have the next question, please?","Operator","The next question is the line of Jim Suva with Citi. Please go ahead.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you very much. In the past, your company has been pretty firm on kind of an equation of \u2013 for Transportation of global SAR (33:54) growth plus content growth less ASP growth equals organic growth. Have those numbers remained the same? And is there a chance where that content growth could actually accelerate as we're starting to see more and more the car of the future catch on or is it just that is just such a small part of the overall bucket?","And then my second follow-up question is, on the Subsea business that you're winning, which is nice to see that, is there anything different with this round of the terms and covenants such as better visibility or worse or similar profitability or worse or better? And also, I assume that simply because it's not being funded by governments or the telecom operators that the funding is probably more in place versus past cycles, so maybe a little bit more visibility. If you can touch on that, that would be great. Thank you.","Thomas J. Lynch - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Yeah. We might have to have you repeat the second question. My memory, I'm not sure I'll hold it all. But regarding content, Jim, that's only if you look back to four or five years ago, we would've said if we were guiding 1% production growth, we would probably have been guiding 3%, maybe 4% revenue growth. Today, we're guiding 1% and we're guiding 4% to 5% revenue growth.","So, that's a combination of content and designing, continued designing for us. And there's no question that as the emission standards increase and you see more of a push for hybrid and electric vehicles, that's a tailwind for content. And it's been relatively slower than people have expected, but in China, for example, there's a huge push by the government there to transition to electric vehicles.","So, that's a real positive trend for us and we're very, very well positioned in the electric vehicle and the hybrid electric vehicle with our content. So, yes, I think over time as the penetration of HEV vehicles increases, we're going to be seeing more content growth.","We'd also, just in general, we expect content to grow about 6% over the next four to five years in the vehicle. So, it's a really good, sustainable, long-term trend that we're well positioned to take advantage of.","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","And then, Jim, I'll take your SubCom question. And if I miss any of it, just hit me at the end because there was about four questions in there I think. Overall, I think when you look at the cycle we're in, one of the things that's really nice about the cycle, I don't think it changes the visibility much, but the customer base is different. It is not your traditional carriers. It is actually the cloud operators. So, it is those cloud operators that are very concerned how do they make sure they have capacity as they come out with their service offering. And that has changed the customer profile than what it was five, 10 years ago.","So, they are much more active in owning the systems. Clearly from a financing perspective, it creates a different financing cycle because they do have the capital versus in the past it would be part of a telco operating budget or somebody had to go raise financing for the project. So, I think it helps accelerate the cycle a little bit. But it does come down to their offerings in the cloud. And I think what's great that you've seen in the programs we've won, we've had programs in the Atlantic, also the Pacific here and there are activities all around the cloud demand and the service offerings they have.","So, when you look at the cycle, it's very good that it's a different customer base and I think we've done a good job adapting to a different customer base, and I think that's why you're seeing the strong wins, coupled with the technology we bring, have been very strong. And I think when you look at profitability, the profitability is sort of where we expect it to be at this point in the cycle. At these levels, and we'll have these levels again next year, you're going to be around company average margins, maybe a little bit less, but excellent return on capital versus the company's WACC and feel good that we have the backlog in place that secures 2017, and now we have to continue to win projects to secure 2018.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thanks so much for the details.","Thomas J. Lynch - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Thank you.","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Thanks, Jim.","Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Thanks, Jim. Could we have the next question, please?","Operator","Next question is the line of Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yes. Good morning. And thanks very much for taking the questions, and congratulations to all of you on your new roles. First question is on the Sensor outlook. I think the comment was expecting 7% growth in Sensors in fiscal 2017. Can you talk about is that organic or is that including the benefits of Jaquet?","And then related to that, there was a comment about starting to see some new programs ramp in Automotive and Sensors, but then Sensors and Industrial were weak. And that actually surprised me. I thought when the Measurement Specialties deal was done, some of the earlier growth would have come in Industrial and the design-in cycles for Auto were going to take a little bit longer to ramp. So if you could just better explain where you're starting to see some of that automotive sensor content gain, that'd be helpful.","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Yeah. Sure. The 7% number I quoted on the call does include Jaquet. So, when you look at it, it's split pretty much organic and inorganic, that 7%, pretty evenly between the inorganic and organic.","You're exactly right when you think about Measurement. Measurement really did not have an automotive business, and that's one of the reasons we liked their portfolio so that we can build that out. So, the program wins that we have really when it comes to Auto, they won't be kicking in until 2018. So, we're not getting the benefit of the growth. Certainly as Tom talked, we're spending ahead to industrialize those programs and win those programs. And what's great about those programs -- they're among various technologies we'd gotten with Measurement as well as they're in multiple regions of the world. So it's not concentrated in one area. So we really like the breadth that we're winning as that will come in into 2018.","When we look at the market conditions, because Measurement was very much focused on the industrial markets, they were getting us some of the impacts of the industrial markets that I've talked about in our Industrial segment. So, anything around general industrial, test and measurement has been slowing; that's what you see in the organic impact that we've had. We have seen some pick-up across those industrial businesses similar to what we've seen in our Industrial segment, that has given us the confidence for the 3.5%, 4% organic growth next year that's implied in our guidance. But the Auto program still will not be coming in meaningfully until 2018.","Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's helpful. And then for a follow-up question on the outlook for the China auto market, you talked about expecting some normalization in China after the December quarter. I was hoping for a clarification. I mean, do you think when you talk to your customers that because of the end of the incentives at the end of this calendar year that they're pulling forward production and maybe some of this is shipping into inventory, or did you just mean you're going to be starting to have more difficult comps as you go into calendar 2017?","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","No. I think when you look at China auto production, we expect China auto production to be up 3% year-over-year. So, slower than it's been, and some of that is because of the activity this year on the small engine incentive. That small engine incentive ends in December, and we've seen actually some acceleration in orders before that as they build. I think when you sit there, we will have production in China step down quarter one to quarter two. But then, we do expect to come back into growth to more normal levels later in the year.","So, I think when you think about our Automotive business this year and ahead, you're going to see production in the first half to be a little bit more in the first quarter and then the second quarter due mainly to that China phenomenon. And we aren't assuming any new incentives right now in our guidance. We're sort of assuming that it's they end in December.","Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Okay. Thanks, Mark. Could we have the next question, please?","Operator","Next question is the line of Shawn Harrison with Longbow Research. Please go ahead.","Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC","Hi. Morning, everyone.","Thomas J. Lynch - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Good morning.","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Good morning, Shawn.","Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC","Wanted to bridge just the flat organic in Industrial at the beginning of the year with a stronger growth rate exiting the year. Is it solely just product ramps in Aerospace & Defense that you highlighted and some other factors? Are you expecting underlying demand to accelerate as you migrate through fiscal 2017 within Industrial?","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Shawn, when we look at it, I think what you have is \u2013 you mentioned one of the key drivers. Our Aerospace & Defense business is almost a third of the segment, and we do expect that to be mid-single-digit growth, similar to what we experienced this past quarter and we're guiding into the first quarter. We see the programs there and we also see some Defense programs kicking in that are share gain as well. So, that is a big driver.","The second big driver is as medical becomes organic growth later half of the year, like I talked about in Creganna, that's \u2013 the minimally invasive market is a 7% growth market. We're growing about 10% pro forma in that. So, we feel good about those two being the big drivers in the Industrial market next year. When you get into oil and gas and general industrial, we're sort of saying it stays pretty flattish.","So, I think some of the growth that you're going to see in some of these areas that have been a little bit more of a headwind, we're saying is flat to low single growth to get up to that low single digit organic growth. But they're the major drivers that we're looking at right now as we go into next year.","Heath A. Mitts - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Yeah. Another thing I would add is that first half of last year, remember, had the inventory correction in it. So, you do get a little bit of a benefit of the compare.","Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And if I may follow up on just the medical comment with one other, what is the run rate of the medical business right now? And my follow-up question would be that, are we expecting to get to a normalized share repurchase range of, let's say, what was it, $150 million to $250 million a quarter for fiscal 2017?","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","The medical business from a run rate right now, we sit there. Next year, it will be about $500 million, both on our legacy business, as well as what we've done with both Creganna and AdvancedCath. So, they'll be north of $500 million next year, Shawn, is where we'll be running. And then I'll let Heath answer the share repurchase.","Heath A. Mitts - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Shawn, I think we just entered the year. I think a more normalized rate to assume out of the gate is probably closer to $100 million per quarter. We'll evaluate it as the year progresses and see where M&A layers into that as well. But I think an assumption of probably a full-year share repurchase of somewhere between $400 million to $500 million in total is probably a good starting point for the year. And we'll see where M&A comes in and update you as the year progresses.","Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. Thanks, Heath. Congrats, everybody, on the new roles.","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Thanks, Shawn.","Heath A. Mitts - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Thank you.","Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Thank you, Shawn. Can we have the next question, please?","Operator","Next question is from the line of Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes. First, just a question on the near-term environment. If I look on a 13-week basis, the bookings up sequentially in what is kind of a seasonally slow bookings period. So, any other context what you're seeing in terms of the supply chain and indications from customers that it's performing a little bit better?","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Craig, it's great question. I think what we've seen across the supply chain is actually stability. I would say lead times are staying pretty tight. People aren't taking a lot on, but there's a lot of stability and I think you saw it in how we talked about the regions. And even markets like oil and gas, it does feel like it's around this, for us, revenue of $30 million a quarter. So, overall, from a supply chain perspective, I think lead time coming into us as well as, as we're selling out, feels stable and it does feel constructive as we're going into 2017.","Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. And then just as a follow-up on the comment of 40% greater earnings power on incremental revenue, and certainly you've had margin expansion, you've had share buyback contribute, as you move forward, what would you say would be the big levers to drive stronger earnings growth relative to revenue?","Thomas J. Lynch - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Well, I think the big one is growth, right? We're continuing to fine tune the cost structure as always. But going forward, I'd say the big one will be driving harsh environment application growth in the 5% to 7% range. And that has a lot of leverage with it which we think will drive 40 to 50 basis points of operating margin improvement with a consistent buyback program, that's how you really add up to this 10%-plus EPS growth. So, still multiple levers to go, and a fair amount of improvement yet to continue to be realized, which is exciting.","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","And I think 2017 guidance we gave this morning is right along that. So, you get to see the multiple levers. With the mid-single digit top line guidance, which is organic plus a little bit of inorganic, the margin expansion, as well as share buyback, you really get to see all the levers that are \u2013 all of them working together to get to that double digit growth we guided to for 2017.","Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks.","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Thanks, Craig.","Thomas J.

Please go ahead, sir.","Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Good morning and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss TE Connectivity's second-quarter 2017 results. With me today are Chief Executive Officer, Terrence Curtin; and Chief Financial Officer, Heath Mitts.","During the course of this call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information and we ask you to review the forward-looking cautionary statements included in today's press release. In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussion this morning. We ask you to review the sections of our press release and the accompanying slide presentation that address the use of these items.","The press release and related tables, along with the slide presentation, can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at te.com.","Now, let me turn the call over to Terrence for opening comments.","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Thanks, Sujal, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today for the earnings call. While many of you know me well, it's very exciting to me holding my first earnings call as CEO and sharing our strong results for the second quarter as well as an improved growth and earnings outlook for the year.","In the second quarter, we delivered sales of $3.2 billion, representing 8% organic growth year-over-year, and we experienced growth across all regions. We delivered record quarter two profitability, with 170 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion year-over-year and adjusted earnings per share of $1.19, which was up 32% over the prior year.","Now, this second-quarter performance was ahead of our prior guidance due to the higher organic growth as well as strong execution by our teams. All of our segments contributed to our sales growth and margin expansion was driven by our Industrial and Communications segments.","Based upon these strong results and our view of market conditions for the second half, we are raising the midpoint of our revenue and adjusted earnings per share guidance to $12.7 billion and $4.62, representing 6% organic revenue growth and 17% earnings per share growth, respectively.","I do want to take a moment to reiterate the key pillars of our strategy that we've had discussed within the past. First is our focus on harsh environment applications, which demand high levels of engineering and manufacturing in excellence and provide competitive differentiation.","Second is our TEOA operating system that drives the customer service enhancements and productivity that reduces our fixed cost footprint. And third is our consistent execution of our balanced capital allocation strategy, which enabled us to make strategic acquisitions that have expanded our portfolio, while consistently increasing dividends and repurchasing our shares.","Also in addition to these three, we are also focused on ensuring that we align and enable our teams around the world to be focused in executing towards these pillars. With our portfolio focused on the harsh environments, I'm pleased that our business is now firing on all cylinders with revenue and profitability growth across each of our segments.","Our second-quarter performance and increase guidance for fiscal 2017 demonstrate successful execution on our strategy and we believe this foundation will continue to drive growth ahead of our markets, deliver improved financial performance and generate strong returns for our owners.","If you could, please turn to slide 3 to review some additional highlights from the second quarter. As I indicated, we have growth across all segments of regions with particular strength in Asia, where our organic growth was 16%.","We delivered 10% organic growth in our Transportation segment, with auto and commercial transportation driving significant performance above-market growth rates due to content gains. In Industrial Solutions, markets are improving and we generated 3% organic growth, that was in line with our prior guidance for the segment. And in the Communications segment, sales increased 9% organically with growth across each of our three business units.","At the company level, adjusted operating margins were 16.6% with year-over-year expansion driven by the Industrial and Communications segments.","As we look forward to guidance, we're raising our organic growth expectations from 4% to 6% for the year, with second-half growth expected across all segments year-over-year. Adjusted earnings per share, we're raising from $4.40 to $4.62 at the midpoint, reflecting higher growth and a slightly lower tax rate.","Heath and I will go through the details on the guidance later in the call, but as you think about our revenue guidance increase, please keep in mind that we have stronger-than-expected second quarter and this outperformance explains about half of the full-year increase.","We're also seeing a strong momentum in orders, which reinforces slightly higher growth expectations for the second half in our commercial transportation business and our Communications segment, along with a slightly reduced headwind from add-backs versus our prior guidance view.","Before we get into the segment results and updates, I appreciate if you could turn to slide 4, so I can cover our orders for the quarter, which will help provide context for the trends that we're seeing and our expectations.","Demonstrating continued momentum, our total orders were $3.4 billion in the second quarter and if you exclude SubCom, which is what has shown on the slide, orders were $3.2 billion, which were up 16% year-over-year and up 15% organically. We saw organic order growth across all of our segments in the second quarter as well as growth among all our regions. By region and excluding SubCom, orders in the Americas grew 14%; in Europe, they grew 13%; and in Asia, they grew 18%.","As we want to remind you that these growth rates are somewhat amplified due to a relatively weaker comparison versus last year's second quarter when we're contending with both inventory corrections and certain regional weaknesses.","By segment in Transportation, orders increased 17%, with growth in all regions. Industrial orders grew 22% year-over-year due to the Creganna and Intercontec acquisitions, while orders organically were up 8%.","In the Communications segment, excluding SubCom, we saw year-over-year organic orders growth of 17%, including 9% growth in Data and Devices, that's from our high-speed connectivity focus, as well as Appliance orders grew 27% organically, reflecting continued strength and share gain in Asia. When you look at our sequential orders growth in Industrial and Communications, both of these support our growth outlook in the second half.","So, please turn to slide 5, so I can discuss the segment results and I'll start with our Transportation segment. Quarter two was a very strong quarter for Transportation, with sales growing 10% organically year-over-year and operating margins in the range of our expected levels. Segment sales exceeded expectations due to auto demand in China, where we saw another quarter of production growth versus the prior year and growth from our leading position in the heavy truck market.","Our Auto sales were up 9% organically due to growth in Asia and in Europe and auto production growth, we estimate, was up approximately 4% in the quarter and we continue to outperform the market due to content growth and share gains.","For the full year, we expect global auto production to be up 2% to 3% based upon the stronger-than-expected first-half production. With the strong production that we experienced in the first half, we expect the estimated growth for the year from a production perspective really to be driven by the first-half production growth.","Looking at the second half, it pretty much implies a flat to 1% production growth in the second half, which is what we expected when we started the year and we expect the production growth to moderate and really has not changed from our prior guidance.","Turning to commercial transportation, our business delivered another very strong quarter, as this business continued to outperform the market. Organic revenue growth grew 21%, driven by our strong global position, strength in the heavy truck market in China and content growth due to adoption of new emission standards and regulations.","In our Sensors business, we had 3% growth organically with growth driven by Transportation and getting the benefit of improving Industrial markets. Adjusted operating margin for the segment remained strong at 19% and was where we expected. And we continue to support a robust pipeline of design wins that will generate future growth above production. As we've have indicated to you before, you should continue to think of a steady-state Transportation operating margin as 20%, plus or minus a point.","If you could, please turn to page 6 to discuss our Industrial Solutions segment. Sales in this segment grew 16% on a reported basis, driven by Creganna and the Intercontec acquisitions, and 3% on an organic basis, which was in line with our expectations.","We are very pleased with the growth and performance of our acquisitions and they're contributing favorably to the segment, both on the top and bottom line. In industrial equipment, we grew 4% organically, with increased demand from factory automation applications and we're seeing the benefit of that in all regions.","In our aerospace and defense unit, our defense business grew organically, while our commercial air was negatively impacted by timing of programs in the quarter. Our oil and gas business has now stabilized and is no longer expected to be a headwind to revenue or operating margins on a year-over-year basis.","Our energy business grew 7% organically, driven by strength both in Europe as well as in Asia. Adjusted operating margins for this segment increased 130 basis points to 12.7% as we expected, and we believe operating margins will expand from this level in the second half with the revenue growth. To help show the progress, excluding the impact from the acquisition-related amortization, adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 160 basis points to 16.9%.","So, please turn to page 7, so I can cover Communications Solutions. The second quarter really demonstrates the progress that we've made in this segment. We had 9% organic growth and continued momentum in all three businesses.","Segment adjusted operating margins expanded significantly year-over-year and improved versus last quarter and now they're at 15.2%. Data and Devices reported another quarter of organic growth as we continue to benefit from the high-speed ramps at cloud infrastructure customers.","As we discussed last quarter, growth in this business is the result of our multi-year transformation to focus the product portfolio on key growth applications, and we expect organic growth for the full year.","In addition, D&D more than doubled its adjusted operating margin from a year ago, driving significant improvement at the segment level as the actions taken to transform the portfolio and optimize the operations have really taken hold.","In our Appliance business, we have very strong performance of 14% organic growth year-over-year as demand remained strong, particularly in Asia. And our SubCom business grew 11% in the second quarter.","Adjusted operating margins of 15.2% were up 680 basis points from the prior year with contributions from all businesses and actually was up 200 basis points sequentially.","So, with that segment overview, I'll turn it over to Heath, who'll cover the financials.","Heath Mitts - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Thank you, Terrence, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to slide 8, where I will provide more details on the Q2 financials. Adjusted operating income was $535 million with an adjusted operating margin of 16.6%, driven by strong organic growth of 8% and productivity benefits.","GAAP operating income was $473 million and included $59 million of restructuring charges and $3 million of acquisition-related charges. For the full year, we continue to expect restructuring charges of approximately $150 million, driven by footprint consolidations from acquisitions and structural improvements.","We aim to strike a healthy balance between investing for future growth while capturing SG&A efficiencies. GAAP EPS was $1.13 for the quarter. Adjusted EPS was a new record for the second quarter at $1.19, up 32% year-on-year. This was above our prior guidance range driven by revenue growth and the benefit from a lower tax rate.","The growth above the prior year is a result of our strategy in action with harsh applications driving growth, TEOA driving efficiency and balanced capital deployment enabling acquisitions and share buyback.","We also benefited from a lower adjusted effective tax rate of 15.4% driven by the expirations of statutes in certain jurisdictions and additional benefits from Accounting Standards Update 2016-09 related to stock compensation. For the full year, I now expect an adjusted effective tax rate around 18%, which is similar to last year.","However, as discussed last quarter, please keep in mind that the year-over-year dynamics. We get an EPS benefit in the first half of 2017 and have an EPS headwind in the second half of 2017 given that our Q3 2016 and Q4 2016 adjusted effective tax rates were 17% and 13%, respectively.","While the first half benefit is $0.10, you have a negative impact of $0.10 in the second half, resulting in a zero net impact for the year. Going forward, I would expect an adjusted effective tax rate between 19% and 20%. Page 15 of our slide deck contains a bridge that provides the details for the first half and second half.","Turning to slide 9; our strong Q2 results demonstrate that we are executing on our strategy and performing well against our business model. Adjusted gross margin in the quarter was 34.4%, a 180-basis-point improvement from prior year, driven by fall-through on increased volumes, productivity improvements from our TEOA programs and restructuring benefits.","Adjusted operating margins were 16.6% in the quarter, up 170 basis points year-over-year driven by our Industrial and Communications segments. Adjusted EBITDA helps explain the cash earnings on our business. Adjusted EBITDA margins in Q2 were 21.3%, up 160 basis points year-on-year.","Cash from continuing operations was $521 million, and free cash flow was $387 million in the quarter. Free cash flow grew year-over-year, primarily due to the better operational performance. We returned $234 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in the quarter.","Looking ahead, we continue to expect free cash to approximate net income and capital expenditures to be approximately 5% of sales. We remain committed to our disciplined long-term capital strategy for balanced return of free cash flow to shareholders, while still having ample capital to invest for acquisitions.","Our balance sheet is strong, with reasonable debt levels and an ability to continue to support return of capital and acquisitions going forward. We have added a balance sheet and cash flow summary in the appendix for additional details.","Now, I'll turn the call back to Terrence.","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Thanks, Heath. And let me cover our guidance for both the third quarter and full year. So let's start with the third quarter. And if you could look at slide 10, please.","We expect third quarter revenue of $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $1.14 to $1.18 per share. This represents reported sales growth of 4% and organic sales growth of 5%, with 7% adjusted EPS growth at the midpoint.","I do want to highlight that our outlook includes the negative impact of the stronger dollar, which we expect will be a headwind of $70 million to sales and $0.04 to EPS on a year-over-year basis. And in addition, as Heath mentioned, there is a unfavorable tax impact of 3 years (sic) [$0.03] when you compare it to the prior year.","Without these two headwinds, we would expect solid double-digit earnings per share growth year-over-year on 5% organic revenue growth, which is in line with our business model.","Looking by segment, we expect Transportation Solutions to grow low single digits on a reported basis and mid single digits organically. This is above the expected auto production growth levels of 1% that we expect in the third quarter, with our outperformance being driven by content growth. We also expect continued growth in our commercial transportation segment across all regions.","In Industrial Solutions, we continue to expect to grow low single digits on both a reported and organic basis, with growth expected across all three of our business units.","And in Communications, we expect high single-digit growth on both a reported and on an organic basis, with growth in each of our three businesses. We do expect SubCom to be particularly strong in the third quarter due to the timing of program executions.","Now let's move to slide 11 so I can cover full-year guidance. And just before I get in the guidance, as I said earlier, I'm very pleased that our business is firing on all cylinders, with revenue growth and operating margin expansion this year being driven by all three segments. And as we look at the second half, the margin expansion that we're going to experience in the second half will be driven by the Communications and Industrial segments. It's very similar to what we saw in quarter two.","So, when you look at our guidance for the year, we are raising the midpoint of revenue and adjusted earnings per share guidance from our prior view by $300 million on the top-line and $0.22. Roughly $100 million of the sales increase and $0.04 of the earnings per share improvement is from reduced currency exchange headwinds.","Organic revenue expectations were increasing from 4% to 6% or roughly $200 million. Of this, approximately, $130 million is from the outperformance we had in the second quarter, and $70 million is driven by higher outlook in both our Commercial Transportation business and the Communications segment in the second half.","I do want to note that our assumption for Auto growth in the second half has not changed from our prior view. We expect our Auto business to deliver mid-single digits growth in the second half on a slight production increase.","When you look at our implied year-over-year trends in the first half to second half, I would ask you to keep in mind the impact of currency exchange rates and the tax dynamics that Heath talked about and then we have more details on slide 15 of the deck.","For the full year, the increase I just walked you through results in revenue in the range of $12.6 billion to $12.8 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $4.58 to $4.66. This represents 6% reported and organic growth and 17% adjusted EPS growth at the midpoint versus the 52 weeks of fiscal 2016.","By segment, we expect Transportation Solutions to now be up high-single digits organically, reflecting strong results in the first half and continued content growth and share gains. As I said, while we continue to expect auto production to moderate, we expect to generate mid-single-digit revenue growth in our Auto business in the second half.","Commercial Transportation is expected to outperform its end market again this year, benefiting from content expansion in the heavy truck market. And we expect our Sensors business to grow mid-single digits year-over-year.","In our Industrial segment, organic growth guidance is consistent with the guidance we've been giving since the start of the year, reflecting continued improvement in the industrial markets.","And in Communications, we expect to be up low single digits on a reported basis, an improvement versus our prior year, reflecting selecting continued strength in Appliances and growth in Data and Devices. And we're raising our guidance for our SubCom unit to high-single-digit growth this year.","In summary, I feel very good about our ability to drive 6% organic growth, and expand our operating margins and generate strong double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth this year. I think this demonstrates that our portfolio is delivering and continuing to benefit from the secular trend of content growth across our businesses.","Before we go to Q&A, I do want to close by thanking our employees for the strong execution in the second quarter as well as their continued commitment to bring our technologies to our customers all around the world.","So, with that, let's open it up to questions, Sujal.","Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Okay, Brad, could you give the instructions for the Q&A session?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Sure. And our first question today comes from the line of Shawn Harrison with Longbow Research. Please go ahead.","Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC","Hi. Morning, everyone, and congrats on the good first half of the year.","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Thanks, Shawn.","Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC","This is the obvious question on Auto, but you have had some other players into the markets raise some red flags, be it excess inventory in North America, China production declining. And I know your fiscal year doesn't align with the other calendar year-ends of many companies. But are you seeing any weakness in auto production out there right now, be a kind of flattish second half that would lead you worried into the next fiscal year?","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Hey, Shawn, it's Terrence. So let me take that question. When you look at Auto this year and we go back to the beginning of the year, we expected North America to be flat to slightly down in production and it's sort of playing out as we expected. I think when you look at Europe, we've actually seen a Europe that has constructively gotten better throughout the year, incrementally. So not major movement, I would say, continued strength and it has been a positive trend.","And the same holds true in Asia, outside of China. When we guided in the beginning of the year and we guided to 1% growth overall, it was really the big wildcard was around the China incentive and what would be the impact once that incentive tailed off. And we always assumed that auto production was going to be pretty much flat in the second half and it looks like it's playing out that way.","And so while we had a strong first half in production and a lot of it was driven by China, as we're looking at order rates, we view the year is playing out as we sort of said all year, with the only real change being China production was a little stronger in the first half, which really has driven the increase from our original 1% production growth up to the 2% to 3%.","The other thing, I said on the call, we always also view the \u2013 even in that low production growth environment we were going to get into in the second half, we felt very good with our content wins that we were going to drive mid single-digit growth and that hasn't changed at all. So when you think through our guidance and the changes we're making in the guidance, our Auto has been pretty consistent with the picture that we said, and we expect the China auto to slow and we expected a tough North American market, it's been tough in North America now almost for two years when you sort of look at the production environment, it's been sort of flat to slightly down. So I don't think there is incremental red flag. I think it's playing out as we thought.","Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC","That's very helpful. And then secondly, just following up on the SubCom business now being up high single digits for the year, maybe you could talk about what visibility you have into fiscal 2018? Does the business decline, can you hold it flattish into fiscal 2018 based upon the backlog you have right now?","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Shawn, thanks for that question. Well, SubCom, we always talk to you about SubCom and we have a pretty good 18-month window based upon the projects in the pipeline, and what was nice during the quarter, our backlog is still pretty steady at around $850 million is what we have booked, and we're also working on a number of opportunities that we're quoting.","So I think when you look at where we are right now, the strength of the backlog, I would sort of assume as you model next year, keep SubCom pretty much flat with where we guided for this year. And like we normally do, we get more projects and we'll update as confidence increases, but I think the confidence we have is the amount of activity that we're quoting and working on, and I think modeling sort of a flat off this number we're giving you for this year is probably the most prudent thing to do right now.","Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC","Thanks so much.","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Thank you.","Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Thank you, Shawn. Could we have the next question please?","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yes, thanks. Good morning, guys. I guess two questions from me as well, on the Transportation side, could you maybe talk about the operating margin dynamics you saw on a sequential basis. I think it was down about 300 basis points. Could you just touch on what kind of happened over there and how do you think of margins as you go through fiscal 2017 broadly and when do you see the center headwind, which I think it is a big issue for you guys right now, abating?","Heath Mitts - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Amit, this is Heath. I'll take that. I think if you go back and look at our comments from 90 days ago, we were pretty clear that the Transportation segment margins were running very hot and are not really sustainable.","So I think internally, when we looked at the 19% it was right in line with where we thought it would come in and consistent with where we've guided in terms of 20% plus or minus. There is some investment activity going on in the segment, as we're ramping up, because our revenue pipeline is very strong in Transportation globally.","So we're going to continue to make those investments, and I think modeling plus or minus 20% is probably a good number for that. Sensors is improving, you see the organic growth in terms of their \u2013 it still continues to be a bit of a headwind relative to the overall segment margins, but it is progressing on track with where we thought it would be this year at this point, and the outlook going forward will continue to be less of a headwind as we progress through the next couple of years.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. And I guess, Heath, you talked about, I think the $150 million researching plan for the year. How much of that is just M&A integration versus implementing structural improvements within TE Connectivity's portfolio? And how should we think about the payback period for the cost take-out that you guys are doing?","Heath Mitts - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Thanks, Amit. That's a good question. There is some acquisition-related integration, some of those tied to more recent acquisitions that have been done, even including Sensors and into the medical space. There is some of that included in there. And then quite honestly, there is some broader footprint consolidation that we're doing as well, we'll continue to move forward on as we optimize the footprint. But there is a balance there between those. And I think in general, if you want to calculate, most of our restructuring has somewhere between a 18-month, two-year payback in terms of the cash-on-cash returns.","Some of the restructuring that you see in the $150 million, there's a chunk of that that's non-cash-related, that are write-offs. So if I think about it on a cash-on-cash return, I think two years is probably a good number.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Perfect. Thank you and congrats on the quarter, guys.","Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Thank you, Amit.","Heath Mitts - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Thanks, Amit.","Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Could we have the next question please?","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen & Co. Please go ahead.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Congrats on the quarter. I've seen several news releases highlighting some of your products and it looks like you have a pretty big booth at the upcoming LIGHTFAIR trade show. Are you trying to accelerate your penetration in the whole connected home market?","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Thanks, Joe. When you look at it \u2013 LIGHTFAIR is coming up. And when you think about what we do there, around the home, I talked a little bit about our Appliance business, which we have a lot in the home. And over the past five years, we have increased investment around lighting; that would be part of our Industrial business. So it's areas where as lighting goes that we need, you get into sockets, it comes into a natural opportunity for us. I think it's just one of those applications that sort of shows where we bring our engineering to and also how it is finally engineered as we have the switch over there.","So it is a product area we've gotten into. I don't know the revenue we have off the top of my head. But from that standpoint, I think it's pretty typical of the type of applications throughout our business we try to go after to really make sure how do we continue to outgrowth for the market. So certainly around that space, we have made investments into it.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you. And then could you give us some details on what you're seeing in Data and Devices, particularly in China?","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Yeah, no, on Data and Devices, our performance was extremely strong and even slightly ahead of what we thought because, as you know, we very much repositioned the portfolio around high speed. And I think you really start to see the benefit both on the growth side as well as the margins that we felt we could the business up to. It certainly came truly in there.","When we look in Asia in Data and Devices, we have a very strong performance in Asia. We grew double digits organically in China and we basically grew greater than that outside of China, which would include Japan and Southeast Asia. So really the traction when you look at that business has always been and continues to shift towards Asia.","And the sales performance that you saw as well as the operating performance really have been driven by those wins that we have, while you still get infrastructure investments being made around China as well as how do they service the rest of the world. So a lot of that growth will be driven out of Asia as we go forward as well.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks for the color.","Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.","All right. Thank you, Terrence. Could we have the next question, please?","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes. Thanks. Can you expand a bit just on the theme of increasing automotive content, so any particular applications that are driving the content increase in fiscal 2017? And then even as you go out to 2018 maybe some of the applications you guys are excited about?","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Craig, thanks for the question. I mean it is so broad-based. It's not just applications, it's everywhere in the world. So we talk about growth being greater than production. I mean, this year every region is going to have pretty substantial growth greater than production, whether it's China, whether it's Japan, whether it's Korea, even in places like North America where production is light, we're doing better than production.","So it's very broad-based around the world, and it comes back to those trends we talked to you about not only on the connected side where you have infotainment wins, but also were you see powertrain and emission programs that does call into where our teams can help solve the problems in the harshest environments on emission and then you continue that on the safety side.","So it's not one application. We're very fortunate, we cover all applications in what we do, being the global leader what we are, so we're benefiting from the secular trends all around Automotive and you're seeing it with the strong performance we have that's greater than production.","I mean, when you look at the guidance I talked about as we expect production to moderate, production being relatively flat in the second half, we're going to grow mid-single-digit, which just proves the content growth assumption we talked to you about, about 4% to 6% (35:56) price off of it. It's all across the trends; it's not just one. And it's really very good execution of how we cover our customers and enable their technology to make sure they can bring it to market.","Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. And then as my follow-up, I wanted to focus on one of the three things you highlight in terms of focal points for the company on capital allocation. And there has been I think some discussions around maybe some increased discipline around OpEx and M&A. Just wanted to get your sense of how the approach is changing if it is, and what the implications are for that as you approach M&A versus cash returns.","Heath Mitts - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Craig, this is Heath. I'll take that. By no means would I suggest there's been a pivot in terms of our approach. We're going to continue to be disciplined with our deployment. The dividend strategy stays on tack; the share repurchase strategy is consistent. And we have been active in the M&A market, but it's been a tough market right now with where evaluations are. And so we'll continue to be active and push that lever. But we're going to also be disciplined about where the returns are relative to those M&A investments and make sure there are deals for our shareholders.","Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. Thanks.","Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Okay. Thank you, Craig. Could we have the question, please?","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Yes. Thank you. Hey, Terrence, clearly, the market's worried about deceleration and auto production trends and you guys are clearly outperforming based on the content growth commentary that's implied both in your guidance and in your comments here. But can you remind us maybe what levers you might lean on, if the deceleration continues to be stronger? Say in 2018, where trough Transport margins might be. I know we're firing on all cylinders right now, but just from a risk mitigation standpoint, how should investors think about the levers that you might have at your disposal if things do end up getting a little tougher? And maybe calibrate in an environment of flat to 1%; you're growing 4%, 5%; if production were to be, say, a couple of points more negative, how that might influence your Auto growth? And I have a follow-up.","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Yeah, so I think let's talk a little bit about trough, and I think if production was flat next year we would expect that we're going to grow mid-single digit. And if it would be down a little bit from that, we would be growing low-single-digit, but I think with what we've done with our content wins we realize, these are platforms that we won, they're in the backlog. This is not stuff to go get when you think about next year. So I think even in a slightly negative production environment we're going to post growth.","So I don't really view that as a trough by any means, I really view \u2013 we would tighten up like we always do around where do we invest capital and make those trade-off decisions, but I don't view that as a free-for-all from a financial performance. We would just have to manage that.","I think it shows where the business has come from and I think it's the expansion around content, and everywhere in the world. So I think similar to this year where early in the year we told you we thought production was going to be 1%, we could grow mid-single digits. We're doing that in second half, certainly got some benefit.","But I think the way that we're positioned as well as where we see the trends, we do expect that global auto production long term should mirror GDP. So certainly we get into elements that maybe there are, somebody has a peak in the country or a region and adjust. But I think the content trend that we have and I'll go back to what I said, again, with Craig, the trends that happen around connecting the car from an infotainment perspective, the continued safety applications and probably the bigger one always has to be around the powertrain, what happens on from emissions and what happens in those environments, whether it be electrification of the vehicle, but when there's need, that's content benefit for us. Or even if you're adding turbochargers to get better fuel economy on a smaller engine.","That is where we thrive and that drives our engineers to create the most value, the toughest engineering challenges. And I feel very strong that we're going to continue to drive that content growth. And I think this year truly demonstrates that.","So I think when you think through is production a little worse, I think you're still going to have, even in a slight production decline, we're going to be growing due to our content position that we have established that over the past five years.","Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","No, that's very clear, Terrence. Thanks for that color. And as a follow-up can I just ask, we've heard of a pickup in restock activity in the channel, any comment on inventory levels, sort of non-auto inventory levels that you might have seen and could you address the discrepancy between sort of what you are including SubCom order pattern versus the guide? Thank you.","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Yes. So it's a great question. So let me take the first half of your question without Automotive and without SubCom, because we have seen a couple things, we have seen our channel partners increase their ordering levels. I would tell you from inventory that are in the indirect channels, it's actually, has not moved. So it isn't like inventory is building. But what we have seen through our channel partners is that they have seen some shortages in certain other electronic components in sort of the semi side. You see them getting a little bit more aggressive in their ordering patterns. And we experienced that in our second quarter.","In some cases those orders were placed out. We've discounted that in the guidance that we've given you in the third and fourth quarter. But certainly, we did see an acceleration of orders through our channel partners in the second quarter, which is typically a good indicator. It isn't like their inventory is getting ahead of themselves. But I think it does sort of show, just positive momentum, where they are starting to pulls. And so I think in some parts of the electronic supply chain there are some shortages that they're also trying to be cautious on. So we're monitoring that, and we'll continue to update you on that.","Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, Terrence.","Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Thanks, Wamsi. Good question.","Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.","Thanks, Wamsi, could we have the next question please?","Operator","We do have a question from the line of William Stein from SunTrust. Please go ahead.","\nTerrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.\nActually, on the content side, when you actually look at it \u2013 I presume, Will, your question is around Auto?\n\nTerrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.\nActually, where we see the content gain, it is traditionally outside of Intercontec. So when you actually look at it, it's really around the integrated solutions where we're providing new technologies is really where we're seeing the content wins as well as Sensors. So I think those combinations where you look at it and really where we've invested in the part what we call our adjacent technologies, they would be things like in EV, where we provide contact. Contactor is not an interconnect, it's actually something that is very important to an electric vehicle.\nWe have a very strong position on it globally. So those are the types of areas we're seeing it and when we look at the terminal connector side, it's growing very nicely, but from a content perspective it's much more outside of Intercontec.\n\nTerrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.\nHey, Will, could you maybe come up a few more bars on what you define as carrier? I mean, do you mean like the AT&Ts and the British Telecoms?\n\nTerrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.\nWe do not serve anywhere directly to a carrier anymore. That was part of our BNS business we sold. Certainly, we would sell to the people, our high-speed applications into the carrier network to those people that make the gear, but we do not sell to the carrier.\n\nTerrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.\nThanks, Will. Thanks for the question.\nSujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.\nThanks, Will. Could we have the next question please?\nOperator\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Steven Fox with Cross Research. Please go ahead.\nSteven Fox - Cross Research LLC\nThanks. Good morning. Just a couple questions, please. First of all, I was wondering, Terrence, you gave a lot of good color around orders. I was curious if you think about everything you talked about, what it says about sort of the business cycle that we're currently in. Are you more encouraged that we're seeing an uptick in economic activity as some may argue or is it sort of similar trends overall, given what you're seeing at distribution versus the easier comparisons, et cetera. Just wondering about your thoughts there, and then I have a follow-up.\nTerrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.\nYeah, Steve, thanks for asking that question. It's a good question. Where we would say it is, one of the things that's nice, I would say markets overall have a little bit of an upward tilt, and it's actually pretty consistent between regions. So I would say, when we started the year, we gave out our guidance for the year, which are around 3% growth.\nI do think Industrial markets are getting a little better. The auto market is sort of as we called it, Communications is better, but then also regionally when you sit there, we had very strong Asia performance, we talked about it for this quarter, but also it's been very broad based, it's just not the auto discussion we've had.\nEurope continually and incrementally get better and in the Americas, where I would say, it's been sort of sideways for a while, we have seen a little bit of tilt up, really driven around the industrial markets. So, I would say it's incrementally better, I would say it's less choppy than it's been would be phrases I would use, but I would also certainly say that there's still some political ping-pong around the world that I still think, while constructive, we're still ready to move quickly. I don't know, if anything changes that could impact any of the markets.\nSo, overall, I could say it is stronger. I think the orders reflect it, I think the broad base of the growth reflects it and a little bit more confidence in the greater economy, but what I get excited about is that in every region of the world right now, we're seeing some of the upward tilt, which we haven't seen in certain markets recently.\nSteven Fox - Cross Research LLC\nThanks for that. And then, just as a follow-up, on the auto content story, I mean the company has, historically, been known for being a powerhouse around powertrain applications, et cetera. How much of the content is driven by those core historical strength versus maybe new areas like infotainment maybe driving a little bit more of it or is it still mainly going to be a powertrain sort of going forward? Thanks.\nTerrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.\nNo, it's actually in all three, Steve. So, if you take it, and I know we show a slide when we see investors, if you start to think about our $60 today of content, approximately half of our content today in an auto is around, we call it grain, but to your point, you use the right phrase powertrain. About half of our content is in powertrain. About 40% of our content is around safety applications, and I would put anti-lock brakes, traction control and airbags into those. And then, about the remainder is really around the connected. That would be your convenience, your lighting, the things that happen within the cabin around infotainment, but less mission-critical type items I guess I would say.\nSo, that's really our mix and what's nice is, all of them have opportunities. We talked to you all about, five years from now, we think can get that content up $80 above it. We really feel it's across all three of those categories. So, it isn't just in powertrain. Certainly, powertrain, I think, has the biggest toggle of greater growth, especially as you get to EV adoption, that content is really driven in the powertrain and the infrastructure of the car side. So, I think that's one that has more upside than probably the others, but we're well positioned in all of them regardless.\nSo, I appreciate your compliment about us being a power in the powertrain, I like that. But we do think we've rounded ourselves out and, it gets into some of the questions today, is across Auto and that's really \u2013 it's a credit to our focus in getting ahead and leveraging the technology we can bring to these customers that we serve anywhere they are, both from an engineering site or where they manufacture. It's a real strength that we have.\nSteven Fox - Cross Research LLC\nGreat. Thank you very much.\nTerrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.\nThanks Steve.\nHeath Mitts - TE Connectivity Ltd.\nThanks, Steve. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator\nWe do have a question from the line of Jim Suva with Citi. Please go ahead.\nJim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.\nThank you very much. I have two questions and I'll ask them both at the same time. Probably one CEO-type question and one CFO question. The first one would be, you had mentioned your auto forecast for this year remained unchanged, kind of strength right now and then a deceleration going forward. That's good to hear. The main concern or question we have is are we facing a situation like last year, maybe a different region or whatever, inventory being built up or your forecast of flattish actually being too aggressive as many of the others have kind of talked about a big deceleration coming in? So, how come we're not facing inventory lot buildup and things like that and why you think your forecast were different than others?\nThen, for the CFO, I think you mentioned restructuring of about $150 million. Your operating margins are now performing well in every segment. Should we expect $150 million going forward? Because it is noteworthy that for the past several years, it was coming down. I think now it's kind of come up a little bit. Because you're making so much more profitability, is $150 million the good rate? Is this kind of a peak year and we should expect restructuring to decline or how should we think about those charges? Thank you very much.\nTerrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.\nHey, Jim, let me start with your first question. Then, I'll let Heath cover your second one. So, thanks for asking the question. First of all, on the auto production, and I know other people have talked about different outlooks for the year, I think one thing that's very important as you all compare these outlooks is, we're in a fiscal period that's (51:50) June and September and our outlook is really from talking to our customers.\nSo, we feel actually very good about where our outlook is, where their production builds are as well as where we plan the supply chain. So, I don't think we're aggressive. I don't think we're conservative. I think we're in line with what our customers are telling us right now. And it's sort of a flattish for the rest of the year. I know I think some others have come out with calendar year guidance. I don't think on a calendar year basis. So, I think, there is an element there that I would ask to just be as reasonable as you compare everybody's opinion about auto production.\nWe do see it moderating like what we've said from day one, mainly driven around China. And we did not have much expectation from North America this year. We expect it to be flat to slightly down and it looks like it's playing out (52:44). So I guess I'll let Heath speak on the restructuring question. Go ahead.\nHeath Mitts - TE Connectivity Ltd.\nLook, Jim, I think, the restructuring question is certainly a valid comment. I don't know that $150 million would be a number I'd hang my hat on in terms of that. Certainly, there was an opportunity in fiscal 2017 to do some things to optimize our footprint and to make sure that we are aligning where we do business closer to our customers.\nAnd opportunities will avail themselves as we go forward. There's no doubt. There's a handful of things that we continue to contemplate as we go into 2018, but each opportunity has to have its own merits to stand on its own from a cash-on-cash return perspective.\nSo we'll provide more color for that as we go forward, but I think there'll be some element of restructuring as we go into 2018 as we continue to finetune the operating model. But I don't know if it's $150 million or something less than that at this point.\nJim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.\nGreat. Thank you so much for the details. Greatly appreciated.\nTerrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.\nThanks.\nHeath Mitts - TE Connectivity Ltd.\nThanks, Jim. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator\nAnd we do have a question from the line of Matt Sheerin with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.\nYeah. Thanks and good morning, guys. So, just a question regarding the strong operating margin in the Communications Solution. I think that's the highest margin since you've kind of changed the reporting segments. And I know a lot of that was driven by the portfolio mix, deselecting products, but trying to figure out how much of that strength was due to Subsea Communications versus the mix and versus the change of the portfolio and how sustainable is that going forward?\nHeath Mitts - TE Connectivity Ltd.\nMatt, it's Heath. That's a fair question, but the year-over-year improvement of nearly 700 basis points in this segment was pretty well balanced across the three business units in the segment, Data and Devices, Appliances and SubCom. They all contributed roughly equal in terms of that margin improvement year-over-year.\nMatthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.\nOkay. In terms of targets, particularly, you've given that, it looks like Subsea will be or SubCom will be sort of flattish over the next few quarters into the next fiscal year. I imagine that you're still looking at growth within Appliances and Data and Devices. Is there still an incremental margin that you expect to generate where you can see even better margins there?\nHeath Mitts - TE Connectivity Ltd.\nWell, certainly, productivity plans will be in place, but the heavy lifting around the footprint consolidation in this segment related to the walk-away revenue that transpired over the last several years, that's behind us. And then, we are largely to, I'll say more of a footprint within the segment. Just a few tweaks left to go in that.\nSo, I would not want to foreshadow that you are going to continue to see 700 basis points year-over-year improvement for the quarter-on-quarter going forward, but certainly we feel good about where the number is today. Knowing that SubCom is probably going to be flattish year-over-year, you would expect more of the incremental operating income improvement to come from Appliances and from D&D, but they are both running pretty hot right now.\nMatthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.\nGot it. That's helpful. And just back to Transportation and specifically, the commercial segment, where you've seen a very strong organic growth in an underlying market that is basically even flat to down and weak, but we're starting to see signs of some stabilization from competitors. But, Terrence, what are you seeing in those markets in terms of underlying growth, both in heavy trucks and off-road vehicles?\nTerrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.\nMatt, it's a good question. I guess to maybe frame a little bit our performance, because I think our performance, this is just not one quarter, it's really been the past couple of years as the overall market was very negative, especially North America. Our over-performance is really driven by our strong position in China, not only North America. We really weathered the storm well. And the growth that we saw this quarter was really driven by emission standards in China as well as content gains with Chinese companies.\nSo, when we look at from a market perspective and we look forward, we do actually see construction starting to pick up after a very tough period, and I think you saw that in some of the results that have come out. Ag still continues to be challenge, a challenge globally. So that's still a market we're waiting to pick up.\nAnd on the truck and bus side, we've really benefited from our strong position globally. So, when we look at it, it does feel like we're starting to get more forward lean in those overall markets, where I would say the last two years has really been between our position and our content gains driving the growth, and it'll be nice as the market starts to click and getting stronger growth in that market. And as I said during the comments, part of our guidance uptick in the second half is really driven by Commercial Transportation as well as our Communications segment. So, we are seeing upward momentum there as we go through the year.\nMatthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.\nOkay. Thanks a lot.\nHeath Mitts - TE Connectivity Ltd.\nThank you, Matt. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator\nAnd we do have a question from the line of Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nMark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co.\nYes. Good morning and thanks very much for taking the questions. First question is a follow-up on Matt's question about Commercial Transportation. Can you help us understand a little bit more on the regional exposure that you have within Commercial Transportation, maybe how much is North America versus international markets? And then, I know the company mentioned some regulations that were helping the Commercial Transportation business. Can you just elaborate a bit on what sort of benefits you've been seeing from some of those regulations in commercial transport?\nTerrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.\nYes. Sure. So, (58:59) commercial transportation business is roughly \u2013 I'm trying to get that up \u2013 about 40% of our business is in the Americas, 60% outside the Americas, split evenly between Asia and Europe and really in Asia, when you think about the regulations, it's probably the bigger area, specifically China, we'll be getting the benefit from the emissions regulations that are happening there and a very strong position that we have at increased content wins, providing more to the customer than just what we historically did. So, it's a really good (59:40), but also pretty major content wins we've gotten and the other technologies we're bringing to the customer.\nMark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co.\nYeah, that's helpful. And then, my follow-up question is trying to understand a bit more the order patterns that the company is seeing in the Automotive business. I think guidance for Transportation in the June quarter is about $1.7 billion of revenue and then if you hit the full-year guidance, the kind of the midpoint implies about $1.6 billion. So, if you're seeing growth in Commercial Transport and Sensors, it seems like the implied auto sales for both June and September are down, low to mid-single digits both quarters, normally June is up sequentially. So, are you guys seeing some sequential declines on a quarter-to-quarter basis in the light vehicle business, in line with what your expectations are? I just want to kind of confirm that or is that just some conservatism about you had such strong first half and you're just not sure how the year goes from here?\nTerrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.\nWhen you look at the second half, we're going to be up pretty much mid-single digits year-over-year, Mark. Clearly, we do expect production to step down. Our first quarter was very strong. As we said, some of that was due to the China stocking. So, we will have sequential changes and limited reduction, but we're going to be up year-over-year and we typically also always step down quarter three to quarter four primarily due to Europe. Just from how the holiday and production seasons work.\nSo, not sure I'm completely following how you're looking at it, but second half year-over-year, we're going to grow mid-single digit on that flattish production. And the shape is a little different this year due to the strong first quarter, but when you get to the rest of the year, Q3 going down to Q4, we would expect the step-down as pretty normal seasonality (01:01:24) European position.\nMark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co.\nThank you very much.\nTerrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.\nThank you, Mark.\nHeath Mitts - TE Connectivity Ltd.\nThank you, Mark. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator\nWe do have a question from the line of Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nAdrienne Colby - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.\nHi. It's Adrienne Colby for Sherri. Thanks for taking the question. Within Industrial, can you talk about what drove the declines in aerospace and defense and also wondering if you could comment from a margin perspective what was driving some of the upside, is it mainly the moderation in the drag from oil and gas, if you're seeing contributions from other pieces of business?\nTerrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.\nThanks for the question. In aerospace and defense, we still are confident with our outlook for the year. In the quarter, we saw in the commercial aerospace side, just slower pickups from one of the large airplane manufacturers in the quarter. (01:02:13) we expect that will happen in the quarter three, but that was offset by defense picking up and I think that's real positive.\nWhen you look at year-over-year, oil and gas really did not have an impact year-over-year, I mean. So, the tailwind \u2013 with the headwind from oil and gas is behind us, the oil and gas business was pretty constant in the quarter. So, it didn't help our margin. Really, the margin improvement was around the cost actions that we talked to you about, that we were taking in Industrial to continue to improve the margin to get it up into the higher-teens. And I think you should start to see the benefit of that and we expect to continue to see the benefit in the second half. And clearly, that's part of our guidance.\nOur guidance is that Communications and the Industrial will be the margin drivers in the second half, but we're pleased with the performance that the Industrial team did on the margin improvement side in the second quarter.\nAdrienne Colby - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.\nGreat. And as a quick follow-up, it looks like SG&A ticked up a little bit this quarter. Just wondering if you could comment on that going forward?\nHeath Mitts - TE Connectivity Ltd.\nSure. It ticked up, generally pretty seasonal if you think about going back to prior years, generally from from first quarter to second quarter, you'll see that normal tick up and I think if we looked at as a percentage of sales, it's pretty consistent with what we see in the past So, that's the one market we're waiting to pick up. There're some very specific drivers that, the timeliness of investments that we do each year, but pretty consistent and on track with our internal expectations.\nAdrienne Colby - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.\nThank you.\nHeath Mitts - TE Connectivity Ltd.\nThank you very much. I want to thank everybody for joining us this morning. And if you have further questions, please contact Investor Relations at TE. Thank you and have a great day.\nTerrence R.

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Keith Kolstrom, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Keith Kolstrom","Thanks. Good morning, and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss TE Connectivity's third quarter 2013 results. With me today are Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Lynch; and Chief Financial Officer, Bob Hau.","During the course of this call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information, and we ask you to review the forward-looking cautionary statements included in today's press release. In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussion this morning, and we ask you to review the sections of our press release and the accompanying slide presentation that address the use of these items. The press release and related tables, along with the slide presentation, can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at te.com. [Operator Instructions]","Now let me turn the call over to Tom for some opening comments.","Thomas J. Lynch","Thanks, Keith, and good morning to everyone. If you would please turn to Slide 3. Q3 was a good quarter for the company. Sales and earnings exceeded the high end of our guidance range, and we had another terrific cash flow quarter. Orders were $3.4 billion for the quarter. Excluding our SubCom business, orders were up 2% versus last year, and book-to-bill was 1.02. Book-to-bill was over 1 for the third quarter in a row, and was at or above 1 in every one of our segments, excluding SubCom. This is the third quarter in a row of year-over-year quarters growth.","Sales of $3.45 billion beat the high end of our guidance due to continued strength in the transportation market and improvements in the telecom market. In addition, due to project timing in the telecom market, we did benefit in Q3 from about $20 million of revenues that we originally expected to hit in Q4. We expect total company revenues in the second half to be up about $25 million versus the guidance midpoint we gave in April.","Adjusted operating income margin was 14.8%, up 80 basis points versus the prior year and up 120 basis points sequentially. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.88 was $0.06 above the midpoint of our guidance due to the stronger sales and continued strong productivity performance. Free cash flow was $431 million, and we returned $314 million to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases.","For the fourth quarter, we expect sales in the range of $3.30 -- $3.35 billion to $3.45 billion and adjusted earnings per share in the range of $0.88 to $0.92. This represents approximately 1% year-over-year sales growth and 18% year-over-year EPS growth. We now expect full year adjusted EPS of $3.20, at the midpoint of our guidance. This is up versus the prior guidance midpoint due -- guidance due to the strong Q3 performance.","Now if you'd please turn to Slide 4. As I mentioned earlier, total company sales were $3.5 -- $3.45 billion, which was $25 million above the very -- the high end of our guidance range, driven by the auto and telecom businesses. Versus the prior year, sales were down about 1%.","Please turn to Slide 5, and I'll review our segment performance in a little detail. Unless I indicate otherwise, all changes are on an organic basis, which excludes the effect of currencies, acquisitions and divestitures. We had another outstanding quarter in our Transportation business. Sales exceeded $1.4 billion, which were up 8%, and adjusted operating margins were just under 20%. Global automotive production was up 3% to 20.7 million units, with strength in the U.S. and China offsetting continued softness in Europe. We also continue to see improvements in the heavy truck markets in the U.S. and China.","The strong operating margin performance is due to the increased revenue, continued productivity improvements and the strong performance in our commercial vehicle business. We are capitalizing on the Deutsch acquisition we made last year, and the integration is going very well. We expect another strong quarter end in Q4, with revenues up about 10% versus the prior year on an expected vehicle production increase of 3.5% and continued strength in the commercial vehicle market. Revenues will be down slightly, about 3%, due to seasonality.","For the full year, global auto production is expected to be up 2%, in line with the historical average. Due to our strong performance and the addition of Deutsch, we expect to be able to grow Transportation revenue by 7% for the full year.","Please turn to Slide 6. Sales and earnings in our Network Solutions segment were slightly better than expectation, due mostly to improved demand in the Telecom Networks business. The pickup in telecom is due primarily to increased carrier CapEx spending in the U.S., as well as selected projects in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. The fiber and wireless portion of our telecom business continues to be strong, offsetting declines in copper network investment. We've seen this trend for a while now. We also saw an increase in carrier activity around expansion of the fiber portion of the broadband network across the global market over the past several quarters. This is a good sign. With the ADC integration behind us, we feel we are very well positioned to capitalize on this activity as it turns into projects.","On a year-over-year basis, total segment revenues were down 4%. Subsea activity -- project activity continues to be fairly robust, but funding continues to be slow. In the DataComm equipment business, we continue to see a weak IT hardware spending environment, although some signs of that stabilizing. And additionally, we exited the low-end magnetics components business, which had revenue of about $60 million per year.","Sequentially, sales increased 15%, and adjusted operating margins improved 300 basis points. The revenue increase is primarily due to seasonality and an uptick in demand in the telecom market. One encouraging point is for the first time in 6 quarters, revenue increased in our telecom business on a year-over-year basis. Orders in the segment, excluding SubCom, were up slightly versus last year, and the book-to-bill was 1.03. In Q4, we expect sales to decline slightly versus Q3, with adjusted operating margins continuing to improve to near the 10% level.","Please turn to Slide 7. Sales and earnings in our Industrial Solutions segment were in line with expectations. On a year-over-year basis, sales were down 4%, as expected. Orders in this segment increased 4% over the prior year, and book-to-bill was 1.03. In the fourth quarter, we expect sales to be about flat with the prior year.","We see continued strength in the commercial aerospace and oil and gas markets, some signs of improvement in the U.S. and Asian industrial equipment markets and continued softness in the energy market and in U.S. defense spending. But overall, our industrial markets feel like they're stabilizing and feel like they're in better shape than they were this time last year. We expect to exit Q4 with segment-adjusted operating margins back near the 15% range due to favorable product mix, our ongoing productivity improvements and Deutsch synergies.","Please turn to Slide 8. Our focus on improving operating margins in our Consumer Solutions segment continue to make good progress in the quarter as adjusted operating margins improved to 10%. Overall demand in the segment was a little weaker than the prior year. In Q3, orders did strengthen in the appliance business in the U.S. and China. However, we experienced slower growth in the mobile device market and the continuation of a weak PC market.","In Q4, we expect sales to increase approximately 3% sequentially and adjusted operating margins to remain above 10%. In the Consumer Devices portion of this segment, we continue to be selective in the programs we are pursuing in order to drive margin improvement.","Now I'll turn it over to Bob, who's going to cover the financials in detail.","Robert W. Hau","Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. Let me discuss earnings, which start on Slide 9. Our GAAP operating income for the quarter was $439 million, which includes restructuring charges of $67 million and Deutsch acquisition-related charges of $3 million. We continue to expect approximately $275 million of restructuring charges for the full year and a substantial reduction in the level of restructuring actions next year.","Adjusted operating income was $509 million, with an adjusted operating margin of 14.8%, up 80 basis points from Q3 last year. Adjusted EPS were $0.88, and GAAP EPS were $0.79 for the quarter. GAAP EPS included $0.11 of restructuring and other charges and $0.02 of income related to tax items.","If you'll turn to Slide 10, our adjusted gross margin in the quarter was 32.8%, which was the highest level since separation. This is a 180-basis-point increase versus the prior year and about $50 million less in sales. The increase is largely due to continued progress in our TEOA or Lean programs driving increased productivity, with reductions in both material and conversion costs and improved profitability related to the integration of Deutsch.","Total OpEx spending was $623 million for the quarter, up $27 million versus the prior year, primarily due to several nonrecurring expenses during the quarter.","In the right side of the slide, details of the items of the P&L below the operating line. Net interest expense was $32 million in the third quarter, and I expect approximately $32 million of expense in the fourth quarter. Adjusted other income, which relates to our tax sharing agreement, was $10 million and largely in line with guidance. The adjusted effective tax rate was 23.6%, in line with our guidance of 23% to 24%. And in the fourth quarter, I expect other income of about $8 million and a tax rate of about 23%.","Before I move to the next slide, I want to mention the 8-K we filed on July 1, which provided an update on the Internal Revenue Service's review of the tax returns of Tyco International for the years 1997 to 2000. While this was an update on the status of the review, I want to assure everyone that our view has not changed on the eventual outcome regarding these issues or the amounts we expect to pay in the future.","I'm turning to Slide 11, and I'll discuss our balance sheet and free cash flow. Cash from continuing operations was $614 million, and our free cash flow in Q3 was $431 million. Year-to-date, free cash flow of $1.1 billion is up 25% versus the prior year. Capital spending during the quarter was $144 million or about 4% of sales, consistent with our anticipated spending rate of approximately 4% to 5% of sales going forward. Our receivable days outstanding were 59 days, and inventory days on hand were 68 days. Both metrics remain in line with our expectations.","Now let me discuss sources and uses of cash outside of free cash flow, shown on the right side of the slide. We began the quarter with $1.1 billion of cash and ended the quarter with about $1.3 billion. During the quarter, we returned a total of $314 million to shareholders. We paid dividends of $104 million and repurchased about 4.8 million shares for $210 million. As discussed on prior calls, the dividend increased in the quarter by approximately 19% to an annualized rate of $1 per share. We continue to expect additional share repurchases of $150 million to $250 million in the fourth quarter. The outstanding debt was $3 billion at the end of the quarter, and we expect similar levels for the remainder of fiscal 2013.","Now I'll turn it back over to Tom.","Thomas J. Lynch","Thanks, Bob. If you could please turn to Slide 12. Based on the order trends we've been discussing, we expect revenue in Q4 to be in the $3.35 billion to $3.45 billion range and adjusted EPS in the $0.88 to $0.92 range. This strong performance would result in adjusted EPS being up approximately 18% versus the prior year due to increased sales, improved productivity, cost reductions and our share repurchase program. Revenue is expected to be up 1% at the midpoint of our guidance due to continued strength in Transportation. And the important thing here is this is the first quarter of year-over-year sales growth since FY '11.","Please turn to Slide 13. For the full year, we expect sales in the range of $13.2 billion to $13.3 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $3.18 to $3.22. The full year midpoint assumes revenues about flat versus the prior year, adjusted operating margins of about 14% and adjusted earnings per share growth of approximately 12%. Second half adjusted earnings per share would be up about 15% versus the prior year on flat sales. Our adjusted EPS outlook is up compared to what we guided last quarter, due primarily to the strong Q3 performance. For the full year, we expect free cash flow of about $1.5 billion and a return in excess of $1.2 billion of capital to shareholders.","A few final comments before we go to Q&A. I'm really pleased with the execution momentum we are building. Our team around the world is doing a very good job of navigating through the economic uncertainty, focusing on our customers' short-term and long-term needs and delivering strong earnings and cash performance. And I emphasize the long-term needs because we continue to invest alongside of our customers.","Our adjusted operating margins are near 15%, and I'm confident we'll reach this level at about a $14 billion to $14.5 billion revenue run rate. This -- our annual free cash flow continues to run about 10% of revenue and gives us attractive choices. It enabled us to become a world leader in fiber optic connectivity, with the acquisition of ADC, and in harsh connectivity, with the acquisition of Deutsch. We've also increased our engineering and R&D investment to approximately $700 million per year in order to strengthen our technology and product pipeline across our businesses. And last but certainly not least, the substantial cash flow has enabled us to consistently raise our dividend and return close to $4 billion through share repurchase in our first 6 years. In total, we have returned over $5 billion in dividends and share repurchases to our shareholders since fiscal year 2008.","TE Connectivity has a very strong business foundation, and we expect to deliver improved growth as the global economy recovers. Electronics continues to proliferate, and this requires more connectivity. And at TE, we're really proud to be the world leader enabling this connectivity.","So now let's open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I have a question and a follow-up. First of all, maybe you guys could just touch on the Transportation margins, and it improved by 90 basis points, I think, sequentially to 19.8%. Maybe you could just talk about how much of this expansion was due to mix versus leverage. And then going forward, do you think these margins are sustainable in terms of there's no onetime benefit that you guys may have had in the June quarter?","Thomas J. Lynch","Amit, to answer the last question, no, I don't -- there weren't any unusual onetime benefits in that business in the quarter. We're really getting the volume leverage and we're getting the operating leverage from cost actions we took several years ago. And we're getting much better in that business at core productivity, which, historically, was not a strong suit but is becoming a strong suit. As far as sustainability, I think an important thing to keep in mind, we're performing very well, but auto production is going to be up 2% to 3% this year, which is the historical average. So there's not a windfall on auto production. It feels a little better than that in the U.S. because the U.S. is up, but Europe and Japan, for example, this quarter -- this past quarter, have been down. So I think this is just many years' worth of improvements in a number of areas and, at the same time, continuing to invest in that business to make sure we stay ahead on the innovation and technology curve.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Got it. And I guess my follow-up, maybe -- I guess, maybe I want to clarify, Tom, we should still be thinking of 25% conversion margins in the Transportation segment, I want to make sure that, that's the right way to think about it. And then the networking side, the 300 basis points of margin expansion you guys had this quarter was much better than what I was thinking. Can you maybe talk about was it always just driven by revenue leverage? Because I think most of that restructuring benefit is supposed to be a fiscal '14 story, so I'm assuming there's more margin expansion left going forward even if revenues don't improve substantially.","Thomas J. Lynch","Regarding the Transportation 25% fall-through, I think that's the right way to think about it over the cycle. In an up cycle, you might get a little more than that. In a down cycle, you're going to get more negative than that. But on average, we see it at about 25%. In networks, I would say there's 2 pieces: there's the continued improvement in productivity; and we're getting volume. As you know, that segment has -- that's been down for several years now, and we've been hurt by that. And -- but we took advantage of that to continue to tighten up the cost structure. It isn't really from the restructuring we introduced this year or we started this year. That's not going to kick in until next year.","Operator","Our next question is from Jim Suva with Citi.","Nicholas Jones","This is Nicholas Jones on behalf of Jim Suva. Could you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in European auto sales as far as like registrations versus production? Because I've noticed your outlook came down another percentage point for the full year outlook.","Thomas J. Lynch","Well, with respect to auto in Europe, I would say our auto business has consistently strengthened relative to our outlook for the year. It's been partially execution on our part but a better market, generally, every quarter than we expected. In Europe, it's definitely soft. New car registrations were down 6% or 7%. Some think they're bottoming. I hear that. But we do benefit from the fact that we're very strong. We're strong across Europe but particularly strong with the German OEMs, and a significant portion of their business is export to the U.S. and China. So the strength in the U.S. and China is definitely helping those OEMs.","Nicholas Jones","Do you think Europe is kind of stable and going to look up next year? Or is it still going to remain soft maybe for another year or 2?","Thomas J. Lynch","I would tell you that's hard to call. I think for us, we just stay close to the customers and make sure our lead times are tight. The recent trends and, I think, the industry is calling stabilization somewhat flat to slightly up next year. I don't -- we'll be giving you our view of that in November, when we talk about our fiscal year '14.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Wamsi Mohan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","In the Transportation segment, did you see any pull-in in the China commercial segment ahead of the class 4 emission standards that were supposed to go into effect July 1 for heavy trucks? And how long do you think the strength in commercial persists? Do you see this as sort of multi-quarter from here?","Thomas J. Lynch","I think there might have been -- not in our revenue, there wasn't any pull-in because we're not that strong in the -- most of the heavy truck business because it tends to be a very local business. That's what's exciting about Euro 4 now becoming the law of the land because that's where our strength really comes to play and the combination of Deutsch and TE over there. So we're starting to see a lift in our orders but no big pickup in our revenue because of an acceleration to kind of get under the wire with the implementation of Euro 4. The heavy truck market, our orders are still pretty robust there and especially in the U.S. So the construction side has been a little bit flat, but I think we're optimistic, given the general direction of the U.S. economy.","Wamsi Mohan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So continued strength for a few quarters here, at least?","Thomas J. Lynch","We certainly have that built into the fourth quarter.","Wamsi Mohan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And Bob, as a quick follow-up, are you baking in any of the margin improvement from lower raw material costs here in your near-term forecast?","Robert W. Hau","Yes, so we have single-digit million benefit in fourth quarter from lower copper, gold and overall raw materials in our business. We are certainly seeing a benefit of the decline that we've seen over the last couple of months.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt Sheerin with Stifel.","Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Question on the networking business and the margin targets. I know you've talked about getting -- eventually getting back to sort of a mid-teens operating margin. A couple of years ago, you were running at $1 billion of so of revenue a quarter. Do we need to get back to those volumes or will the cost-cutting actions that you're seeing enable you to get there sooner or mix or whatever the other issues?","Thomas J. Lynch","I would say, Matt, it's in the 3.5 to 4, depending on the mix of the businesses, but we have a better cost structure than we did. And we also have the benefits of the Deutsch synergy -- of the ADC synergies. Of course, right now, we're -- our SubCom business is at a very low point, and it's just a little bit above breakeven. Our telecom business margins are solid in the double digits, so as revenue picks up there, we expect to get a lot of leverage there. So we definitely feel this business, as it gets back to what we historically would define as a more normal revenue level, should be in -- at or around the company average margin. We [indiscernible].","Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then on the Telecom Networks and in Enterprise, on the Enterprise side, are you seeing any signs of reinvestments there? For instance, December quarter into the next year. And then on the Telecom Networks side, are you seeing any signs of life in China in terms of any pipeline there?","Thomas J. Lynch","On Enterprise, it's mixed. The Enterprise business, in general, over the last several quarters, I'd say it's been going sideways, flips up, goes down. And it's a very, very local business. For example, we're strong in India, and our enterprise market there has been very slow because of the economy. We're doing -- we're number -- middle of the pack player in the U.S., so we're picking up there, particularly in the data center. But overall, I'd say it's pretty mixed and relatively flat. That's how we see it for the next quarter. In the -- your telecom question again? I'm sorry.","Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Yes, just a bit about your outlook for China recovery and pickup there.","Thomas J. Lynch","I'd say 2 things: China's slow, and China's a tough market. It tends to be a very low-end market, so that's an area where we've become more selective over the last 2 or 3 quarters. We are really focusing on the mid- to high-end solution where they're available and because we find it super competitive at the low end. And in general, that's how we look at the company. We're staying away from the true commodity space that isn't strategic or necessary to kind of defend the balance of the business.","Operator","And we have a question from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs.","Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I was hoping you could elaborate a little bit more on the operating margin comments. I think the 15% threshold, the revenue required to get to that had been $15 billion to $15.5 billion of revenue overall. And Thomas, if I heard you properly, you said $14 billion -- around $14.5 billion now? With the restructuring that you're putting into place that comes into effect next year, should we expect the revenue that you need to get to 15% operating margin to come down further?","Thomas J. Lynch","I would say that, that includes the $14 billion to $14.5 billion, but we're close. Obviously, we're $14.8 billion in the third quarter, and it's down $1 billion from a year ago due to a couple of things: the margin leverage from Deutsch, the tremendous productivity year we're having, a little bit of business mix right now. For example, Consumer, with 15% of the business last year, it's 12% of the business this year. Some of that's Consumer being down and Automotive being up. So I think we have some of those kind of trends. But I feel confident in the $14 billion to $14.5 billion. Of course, we're not going to put a limit on that, but that's the best way to think of it. And think of it on an annual basis because we have seasonality, as you know. So Q3 is typically our peak quarter in revenue, all other things being equal. We come down a little bit in Q4. Last year we -- our revenue went down 3.5% to 4.5% sequentially to Q4. This year, only 1.5% because of some strength in other business. And then our weakest seasonal quarter is Q1. So when we say 15%, we're talking about a sustained full year of 15%, which means in the peak quarters, we'd be needing to run above 15%. We need to run 15.5%, for example, this time next year to offset what will be a lower-margin first quarter because of the lower sales due to the seasonality.","Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","For my follow-up question, there's been some talk about improved spending on broadband in the U.S., and I'm hoping you can help us understand how well you're positioned to benefit from that.","Thomas J. Lynch","Sure. We -- as you know, there's been a lot of announcements by the big carriers over the last 6 months and some search companies that are getting new into that business as well about expanding the amount of bandwidth per home. And more recently, just in the last week, another carrier announced a different type of plan where you could, as a consumer or a business, sign up for 500 megabits. One has announced they're going to deliver 1 gigabit. So that is all great news for us if it comes to pass. It tends to drive the whole industry to increased spending. So we did finally start to see a little bit of increased spending in the fiber portion of the network. And in our wireless business, which is still relatively small at about $150 million annual revenue, we've seen a double-digit pickup in the last 2 quarters as the carriers are trying to augment their tower-based network with not quite small cells, but distributed antenna systems. So it feels better than it has in a while for us in terms of spending on our portion of the network. I think there's only a couple of data points yet, so we're not getting carried away with bullishness. But what the customers are saying, we're seeing the amount of RFP activity in the U.S., all definitely feels more -- we're more bullish than we were last year, for sure.","Operator","We have a question from Shawn Harrison with Longbow Research.","Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC","I had, I guess, a follow-up, first, on the commodities. Assuming the second quarter is kind of where we see commodities bottom out, when would you see the full benefit, would it be the December quarter or kind of the March quarter of 2014 before you would see that fully run through the model?","Robert W. Hau","I think the key to think about is, we have a hedging program in place for our key raw commodities. And essentially, what we do is we look out our demand out 18 months, and we hedge roughly 50% of that demand. So there's definitely a lag in the impact, both negative and positive overall, from commodity swings. So if you think commodities bottomed out in second quarter, it's Q4, Q1 that you start seeing that benefit roll through the P&L.","Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And then as a follow-up, we've earlier said that -- Tom, you may have said the operating margin target for Industrial is about 15% in the fourth quarter. I was just wondering if you can confirm that. And then second kind of should that business, with maybe some incremental restructuring gains and some volumes coming through, be operating long-term above 15%?","Thomas J. Lynch","I'd answer yes on both counts, Shawn. Yes, we did say we expect to be back to the 15% range, and we definitely view that as the business. It should be above average company margins, no question, with a little pick up in revenue, continued improvement in productivity and the benefit of some of the restructuring we're doing.","Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC","Is that a business where you would see maybe most of the benefit from a commodity tailwind?","Thomas J. Lynch","No, I mean, actually, we use the most copper in absolute terms than proportionally in the Transportation business. But industrial does -- will benefit. But there's a lot of copper and precious metal in the Transportation business because of the harsh environment, super harsh environment.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Wood with Macquarie.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Research","In terms of the Transportation segment outperformance versus the global vehicle production, can you talk about how much of that is being driven by content on passenger vehicles versus the C&I or the Deutsch contribution there? And maybe along those lines if you can talk about whether Deutsch is still on track with that roughly $0.05 a quarter accretion? Or if the better C&I is helping that?","Thomas J. Lynch","Yes, I would say the performance, relative to production, is kind of all of those things you mention, other than Deutsch is really in the commercial vehicle, so it doesn't play into the light vehicle revenue versus production numbers. But we're benefiting as well from market share gains that we began to get into dine in [ph] shortly after the financial crisis. As you recall, we continue -- despite the significant drop in the auto business then, we made the decision to continue to invest in engineering and R&D and, in some cases, increased our investment. And that's really starting to play out. We won some design wins that usually takes 2 or 3 or 4 years to turn into revenue. And that's clearly helping us. So I think the industry estimates are we've gained 3 points of market share in the last 4 years. We do -- I think we're still gaining a little market share in China as well, even though we have a high market share there. Electronic content mix, I would say it's a little bit higher than norm because of the high-end car sales are a little bit higher than norm. It's not a big number, but we're getting a small tailwind from that. And our overall margin in Transportation is benefiting from just the addition of the Deutsch industrial and commercial business as it was because that was a high-20s EBITDA business and the synergy that we are slightly ahead of plan on the cost synergy. Revenue, although picking up, is slightly below plan. But the -- that overall acquisition is clearly shaping up to be a real winner for us.","Robert W. Hau","And Mike, we are on track to deliver the incremental $0.12 or $0.20 accretion from Deutsch.","Keith Kolstrom","And Mike, also -- it's Keith. As a data point, the commercial vehicle business was about $200 million in the quarter, so about 14% of the Transportation segment total.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Research","Got it. Okay. And also on the Subsea business, how far does your backlog take you out there? You're forecasting $110 million next quarter, but with the $20 million quarterly order rate, I mean, is that -- is there risk that, that pulls back down to your trough levels?","Thomas J. Lynch","Yes, our backlog, as you know, we don't put anything in backlog until we get that first big downpayment and are ready to go into force as we say in that business. So I think -- Q4, we feel pretty good about it. That revenue level, some business needs to come into force to hit the -- to continue that revenue level or move it up. We're encouraged by the fact that there's a lot of programs out there, but that's been the case for a while. A year ago, I would've thought the SubCom business would be higher than it is now. And it's just taking longer to get the funding, but there's some very big projects that we've been awarded that are what I'd call very sensible projects. Sometimes, in this business, you can be awarded a project, but you know it's -- there's a 10% chance it's going to get built. We have several that are well over the 50% chance and the funding is close. So -- but in terms of visibility in backlog, it's a quarter or 2 at max right now. When you hit the boom time, it tends to move out to kind of a year to 5 quarters.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Amitabh Passi with UBS.","Amitabh Passi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Tom, a question on Network Solutions. We're hearing incrementally from operators focused on upgrading their copper networks to the VDSL2 plus or Vector VDSL. Can you remind us what that means for your business from a content perspective versus fiber to the prem type networks? It seems like there's a bit of a shift towards upgrading copper-based networks versus taking fiber all the way deep into the network.","Thomas J. Lynch","I think both are going on. But overall, investment in the copper network, almost everywhere, has been consistently declining. One of our strengths is that we have a strong copper business as well. So most -- more than half of our business is in the fiber network. Three years ago, that was different. So we feel we're really well positioned. Our overall growth rate has been down, even though our fiber growth rate has been consistently in the mid-single digits to double digits because of the slowdown in the copper network. So as long as there's investment in the network, we typically feel good about it. In the wired, the Last-Mile, the backhaul, whenever their carriers are making that a priority again, we're going to benefit from that because we have a very -- we really have the full end-to-end fiber and copper network, which nobody has anywhere near both of those to the extent that we do.","Amitabh Passi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And just as a follow-up, if I look at the operating margin expansion in that segment from roughly 6% to 9%, was that largely all driven by volume? Or would you say structurally, this segment is now at a higher operating margin level relative to where it was a quarter or 2 ago?","Robert W. Hau","Amitabh, there's certainly a benefit from the sequential growth. Sales up, I think, about 10% sequentially. Clearly, we've been doing some significant restructuring. We'll see benefits of that into '14 and '15. We are seeing the benefits of our TEOA and general productivity in that business. I'd say, we certainly feel better about margins at 9%. But historically, 13%, 14%, and we anticipate, in the long run, our Networks segment will be about company average. 6% last year, I think -- or excuse me, last quarter was abnormally low, and we're certainly happy to see the 300 bps improvement sequentially.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Steven Fox with Cross Research.","Steven Bryant Fox - Cross Research LLC","Just a follow-up on that last comment. I was wondering, in terms of some of the restructuring activities in the Networks business, can you just sort of maybe give us an idea of what the actions were that has helped margins, how much was completed or maybe completed towards the end of the quarter that gives you sort of comfort into this quarter as you get the full benefits of that and sort of an idea what's left to do that's important? And I have a follow-up question.","Thomas J. Lynch","I'd say you have to think about the restructuring in that segment in 3 buckets. Over the last year or 2, most of it has been related to the ADC integration. So that's where most of it was. The -- what we call the legacy TE business was pretty lean in that business. And we knew one of the very attractive aspects of ADC, after their phenomenal product line and strong position in the fiber network was, there was a lot of opportunity to move their cost structure, more like the TE cost structure. So that is largely -- that's the major contributor. With the market being lighter in the last couple of years, we've taken that opportunity to take additional cost out. And then the third piece of the puzzle is the restructuring that's in the works now that will benefit starting next year. So some of that is additional -- what you'd call additional ADC plant, though but we don't -- we're -- we've been together a couple years now, so we don't distinguish that much anymore. And some of it is our Lean programs are really enabling us to put what used to be in 3 plants in 2 plants, along those lines. So there's really 3 pillars to the restructuring piece of it.","Steven Bryant Fox - Cross Research LLC","Great, that's helpful. And then just as a follow-up, I know you're not giving guidance for the December quarter, but relative to what you're seeing in both your sales and your orders for this quarter, how are you feeling about typical seasonality off of this base? Are there any markets that you feel a little bit better about, a little bit worse about, as you look out towards year-end spending?","Thomas J. Lynch","When I think about the markets in general, so let's think how we felt 6 months ago, we feel better. A part of that is because 6 months have gone by. But I do think on almost -- most indicators in our business, like we just -- we've talked about in this hour, orders up, book-to-bill up, things like that, are pretty -- are much better than they were a year ago. So if that lasts through the fourth quarter, I think that should -- we should feel better about the first quarter than we did a year ago. But as you know, it was in May of last year, we were feeling, as we guided 15 months ago, about the second half of FY '12 -- May of last year, the orders started to turn down. And it happened across the world, not just in our world. That didn't really turn back up until November. The good news is the order rates are still holding, and we're in the end of July. So I'd say that's a really positive sign, but I'd like to get through the next few months, obviously, before we start talking about next year.","Operator","And our last question comes from the line of Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank.","Kevin LaBuz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","This is Kevin LaBuz on behalf of Sherry. My first is on your Consumers side. Could you just talk about what success you've had gaining traction in smartphones and tablets? And I have a follow-up.","Thomas J. Lynch","Sure. I would say we've had more success in smartphones than tablets. We have a beachhead in tablets; it's fairly narrow. In the last 1.5 year, we've done extremely well with the smartphones designed in Asia. So it's not broad-based, but it's -- we have real momentum there. So in the tablets, not so well there but better in the other tablet area. So it's mixed for us, and it's still relatively small for us. And we continue to be very selective because not all smartphone and tablet business is great business. So that's really been our strategy. I think what I really feel good about and our team feels good about and deserves credit for is we know we can be successful where we target. It doesn't mean it'll happen overnight, but we know we can do the miniaturization, we know we can ramp from 0 to 500,000 parts a week in the way that's required in that market. We know we can be cost competitive and make an attractive margin in the projects we're targeting. So I'd say we feel like we have -- we know we have much better capability in that market, but we're still being selective.","Kevin LaBuz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","All right. And then my next question is on the networking solutions side. Obviously, you sound a bit better this quarter than you did last. So I was just wondering what changes you've seen over the last 90 days that have led to the better assessment.","Thomas J. Lynch","Well, I think, for sure, the second half in Networks is always better than the first half because of the seasonality and you're in the summer and you're coming out of the winter. So it always makes the business better. As Bob pointed out, margins were unusually low and at the bottom of our experience in the last quarter, so we knew they would get better. We're really seeing and encouraged by the activity in the large portion of the network. So much CapEx went into, particularly in the U.S., LTE in the last couple of years. But you still need the wired portion of the network if you're going to deliver video in -- 30 second download video into your tablet or smartphone. You need to be fiber or very close to the home. So sort of the physics would say got to build fiber deeper. The recent RFP activity says, boy, there's more RFP activity. We saw the first year-over-year increase in our orders in 6 quarters. So all of those are positive signs. A year ago, all of those weren't happening, and we were not as bullish, to say the least. so we -- but we also know that 1 quarter or 2 quarters doesn't make a trend. But the most important thing is we have an outstanding product line, and we are well positioned around the world. I mean, we are -- we're calling on every major carrier, and they know who we are, and they know what capabilities we have. And so we're positioned -- as they decide to accelerate, we're positioned to help them and benefit from that.","I think that was the end of the questions. I'll just take a minute to wrap up. Again, a very good quarter for us. I would say this quarter is a result of many years of hard work. And certainly, improving economic conditions in a few areas have been helpful, but most of this performance is due to the strong execution by the teams around the company. And we've talked a lot about the leverage this company has, and you really see it the last couple quarters that, with a little bit of revenue tailwind, tremendous leverage in the margins, the core productivity is the best I've seen since I've been in the company. And Bob mentioned our Lean program, which we called TEOA. We're becoming a Lean company, and it's showing up in everything we do and probably, most importantly, our ability to service the customer. We've gone through accelerating our restructuring, so we'll start to see the benefits of that next year. And then the cash flow is strong in this company. What really is, I think, a very good sign is it's been pretty linear this year. And if you look at our working capital statistics, at the same time, our on-time delivery statistics are getting much better. When those 2 things are moving in the right direction, that tells me we're executing well. The most exciting thing is there's still a lot more room for improvement. So thank you for being on the call, and have a good summer. And we'll talk to you soon. And with that, operator, we'll close things off.","Operator","Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Keith Kolstrom. Please go ahead.","Keith Kolstrom","Good morning, and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss TE Connectivity's third quarter 2012 results. With me today are Chief Executive Officer, Tom Lynch; and Chief Financial Officer, Terrence Curtin.","During the course of this call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information, and we ask you to review the forward-looking cautionary statements included in today's press release.","In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussion this morning, and we ask you to review the sections of our press release and the accompanying slide presentation that address the use of these items.","The press release and related tables, along with the slide presentation, can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at te.com.","[Operator Instructions] Now let me turn the call over to Tom for some opening comments.","Thomas J. Lynch","Thanks, Keith, and good morning, everyone. If you can turn to Slide 3, I'll give you a quick summary of Q3 and an overview of our Q4 outlook.","Q3 results were as follows: Sales of $3.5 billion were up 8% sequentially. This was slightly below our expectations, due to further weakening of the euro which had about a negative $50 million effect and a slower-than-expected recovery in our Network Solutions segment.","Adjusted operating margin improved 100 basis points sequentially to 14% and very importantly, sequential improvement in all of our segments. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.79 were at the midpoint of our guidance, despite the lower sales. And this is an improvement of 16% sequentially and 4% year-over-year. This year-over-year EPS improvement was on a slight sales decline.","Free cash flow is very strong at $414 million and that was up 19% over the prior year.","Uncharacterized Q3 for us is a quarter of good execution. Strong cost control and productivity improvement enabled us to improve operating margins back to the 14% level despite lower-than-expected sales. And importantly, margins improved across all segments.","In CIS, margins improved 100 basis points sequentially and are essentially at prior year levels on sales that are 12% lower than the prior year. We do expect additional margin improvement in CIS in the fourth quarter.","We completed the acquisition of Deutsch in April. The integration is on track and as expected. In Q3, Deutsch added about $0.04 of EPS as expected. We're excited about the opportunities this acquisition will provide. They have excellent products and technology as we've discussed before. We're going to add strong channels, the scale to drive cost down and better customer service, and the results we're seeing are a little better than planned, despite the markets being a little softer. We're very -- we're really excited about the quality of the team that joined TE.","And the cash flow, as we mentioned earlier, was very strong and we completed the sale of our Touch and Services business which generated approximately $400 million of proceeds.","We entered a little bit on the market environment. We entered the quarter with order momentum building across most of our markets and in particular, in Telecom Networks and our CIS businesses, as the economic outlook was improving in the U.S. Inventories in the channel were back in line, and we experienced a seasonal lift we typically see at this time of the year, especially in our Networks business. So things were tracking pretty much as expected.","In mid-May, this momentum began to stall and orders began to soften, especially in Telecom and our Industrial and Appliance businesses. We haven't seen a pronounced decline, but we have seen a softening.","Demand in the automotive and commercial aerospace businesses continues to be solid and we are building in the momentum in the consumer business.","These trends, coupled with the uncertainty in Europe which is having an impact from a demand and a foreign exchange perspective, and the lower-than-expected growth in China, is resulting in a reduction in our guidance for Q4. I'll go through the details later in the call.","I do expect us to maintain our margin in the 13.5% to 14% range in Q4, despite the softness, and to deliver another strong cash flow quarter. We also plan to resume our share repurchase program in Q4, and I'll comment more on capital allocation later.","Before we move into the review of our results and outlook, I'd like to recap the organization changes we announced last week, so if you can turn to Slide 4.","These changes have been in the planning stage for some time. The regrouping of our business units into these 4 segments had 2 primary objectives. Enabling us to best leverage our capabilities for the customer, and further optimize our efficiency. And we also believe this will provide improved information regarding the performance of the company for our investors.","The changes in our segment structure are also enabling several of our top business leaders to get expanded or different roles, which I believe is really great for the organization's vitality and future evolution.","The most noteworthy change, for purposes of this call, is Terrence moving into a segment leadership role. I'm really excited for Terrence and the company. And we're also very fortunate to have Bob Hau succeeding Terrence. Bob, most recently was the CFO of Lennox International, and prior to that, was at Honeywell. Bob is a talented financial leader, with strong multi-industry experience and operating skills, and he'll join us in early August. If you can please turn to Slide 5, and I'll talk about our Q3 sales.","Total the company sales of $3.5 billion were down 2% year-over-year on an actual basis and down 3% on an organic basis. Currency translation due to the weaker euro, negatively impacted year-on-year growth by 400 basis points or about $143 million, and the Deutsch acquisition contributed $174 million in revenue.","On an organic basis, year-over-year, sales increased slightly in Asia, but were offset by broad-based weakness in Europe and continued weakness in the North American telecom market.","In Asia, automotive continued to be strong, offsetting softness in our CIS businesses. In China, we had another quarter of double-digit automotive growth, but most other markets were slower than normal.","Europe, which accounts for about 1\/3 of our total revenue, was down 4% organically from the prior year level and flat sequentially. With the exception of Energy, all of our major businesses were down versus last year. We expect a further slight decline in Europe in Q4, due to the auto seasonal shutdown, and reduced industrial spending at OEMs and in the channel.","And in general, Europe has been slow for a while and the decline we had seen has been gradual. Steady, but gradual.","In the U.S., our auto business has been strong and demand in our Telecom and SubCom businesses have been weak. On an organic basis, which excludes Deutsch, our U.S. revenue was down year-over-year and up sequentially. We expect similar trends in Q4 with Telecom weakness and a slowdown in Industrial, offsetting another good quarter in auto and commercial aerospace.","I'll now turn it over to Terrence to walk through the third quarter results, and then I'll come back to cover the outlook in more detail.","Terrence R. Curtin","Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Just before I get started with third quarter performance, I want to remind everyone that the segment reporting changes that Tom mentioned earlier will be effective with the first quarter of fiscal 2013, which begins on September 29. We will report current results in this new structure for the first time, as part of our January 2013 release, and we would expect right now, to file an 8-K with recasted segment historical P&L information by December, which should be well in advance of the January earnings call.","Now let me give you some highlights to the key markets in each of our segments. Unless I indicate otherwise, all changes will be on an organic basis, which excludes the effect of currencies and acquisitions. So if you could please turn to Slide 6.","In our Transportation Solutions segment, sales increased 13% on an actual basis versus the prior year, and 6% organically. Sequentially, total sales were up 10%, driven by the acquisition of Deutsch which added $174 million in sales in total, and the breakdown of that between our businesses are $96 million in automotive and $78 million within our Aerospace, Defense and Marine unit.","Overall in the automotive market, our sales performed as expected, within an organic increase of 7% versus the prior year. Sales were up 22% in Asia and 11% in the Americas. While in Europe, sales were down 4%.","Global vehicle production was approximately 20.5 million units in the quarter, which was up 10% compared to the prior year. By region, vehicle production was up 20% in the Americas, 22% in Asia. However, the EMEA region remained soft, with production down 8%. The strong year-over-year growth rates in Asia and North America were once again driven by the rebound following the disaster in Japan, as well as our strong market position.","We expect fourth quarter production to be about 19.5 million vehicles, so we're down about 5% sequentially, in line with typical seasonality driven out of Europe.","In the Aerospace, Defense and Marine market, sales were flat versus the prior year. Strong demand and increased share in the commercial aerospace and oil and gas markets were offset by declines in the Military market. For the Transportation Solutions overall in the fourth quarter, we expect revenues to be down slightly sequentially, due to the seasonal decline in auto production.","Part of our sales that relate to Deutsch are expected to be about $180 million which would be up 4% sequentially versus the third quarter, and is -- which is also high single-digit growth when compared to Deutsch standalone versus its prior year. Please turn to Slide 7, so I can cover our Communications and Industrial Solutions segment.","In this segment, total sales declined 12% on an actual basis, and 9% organically versus the prior year. Sequentially, sales were up 8% organically, which was in line with expectations. In the Industrial market, organic sales were down 14% versus the prior year, but were up 5% sequentially. While we did see temporary improvement in quarter 3, customers, both direct and in the channel, became more cautious around mid-quarter. And due to this, and based upon current order trends, we expect quarter 4 in the Industrial market to be down about 10% sequentially.","In the DataComm market, which we include sales to the communication equipment, server, storage and wireless equipment markets, our organic sales were down 15% versus last year, due to reduced broadband and wireless spending, particularly with customers in Asia.","Sales did show a nice sequential improvement and were up 10%. And in quarter 4, we expect revenues in this market to be similar to quarter 3 levels.","In the consumer area, consumer device revenues were down 4% organically versus the prior year, due to continued softness in the PC and consumer electronics markets, that were partially offset by strong growth in both the mobile and tablet markets.","Sequentially, our sales grew 9% organically and we expect sales in the fourth quarter to be up 5% to 8% sequentially as well. We are seeing improvement related to the new program wins and new product launches in both the tablet and mobile phone areas.","In the Appliance business, we were down 3% versus the prior year, due to soft demand in Asia, which was more than offset by growth in the U.S., and sales grew 8% sequentially in this market.","In the fourth quarter, we expect the CIS segment revenues to be down about mid-single digits sequentially, due mainly to normal seasonality and a softer demand from customers in the Industrial and the Appliance businesses. So please turn to Slide 8, and let me get into the Network Solutions segment.","Total sales were down 13% on actual rates and down 9% on an organic basis versus the prior year, driven by our Telecom and SubCom businesses. Sales did improve 5% sequentially which was lower than we expected.","Organic sales to the Telecom Networks market were down 15% versus the prior year, but up 9% sequentially. Year-over-year declines were once again due to reduced carrier spending in the U.S. and Europe.","As I just mentioned, sequentially sales were up about 9% in this market, but that was only about 2\/3 of what we have expected. We saw a nice order momentum coming out of our second quarter, the March quarter, but we did see order rates begin to slow in mid-May in the Telecom market, and currently, we expect sales in -- for the fourth quarter to be down about 5% sequentially.","Demand in this market, particularly in the U.S. continues to lack consistency. However, the longer-term trends remained attractive, based on the demand for higher speeds and more connected devices.","In the Energy market, sales were up 3% versus the prior year, with growth in all regions. And we had 6% growth sequentially. We have seen some of the softness in orders. However, we expect revenues in quarter 4 to be up slightly versus quarter 3, driven by continued investment in distribution, transmission and power generation around the world.","In the Enterprise Networks market, our sales were down 2% as data center investment growth was offset by declines in office network spending.","And finally, in our SubCom business, our sales declined 21% year-over-year as we expected. We did book about $110 million of projects during the quarter. However, funding of additional order projects continues to be slow. We expect sales in the fourth quarter of approximately $120 million versus our prior expectation of $140 million, due to the push out in these customer fundings.","For the fourth quarter overall, Network Solutions sales, we expect to be down slightly on a sequential basis, due to the softness in the Telecom Networks business. Let me now shift to earnings, which start on Slide 9.","Our GAAP operating income for the quarter was $371 million, which includes $94 million of charges related to the acquisition of Deutsch and restructuring charges of $25 million. The Deutsch acquisition-related charges include $68 million of noncash fair value purchase accounting adjustments and cash acquisition charges of $26 million. The $26 million is made up of transaction costs of $15 million and restructuring charges related to cost synergies of $11 million.","We continue to expect $75 million of total cash charges related to the Deutsch acquisition. About 1\/2 of this cash portion will be incurred in 2012, and the remainder in 2013.","As Tom mentioned, the Deutsch integration is on track and we expect the EBITDA to exit the year at approximately a 28% level, which is slightly ahead of where we reviewed with you when we did the acquisition plan, when we told you would be about 27% at this time.","Looking at adjusted operating income. Adjusted operating income was $490 million in the quarter, with an adjusted operating margin of 14%. This performance is a strong improvement, both in dollars and rate, both year-over-year, as well as sequentially. Both gross and the operating margins were in line with our outlook for the third quarter, despite the lower-than-expected sales in the quarter. The 100 basis-point sequential improvement in operating margin, include an improvement in all segments, driven by the increased volumes and the cost actions that we initiated over the past year in our CIS and Network Solutions segments.","As Tom mentioned, we do anticipate revenue levels in the fourth quarter to be down sequentially. However, we do expect operating margins to remain in the 13.5% to 14% level with additional improvement in the CIS segment.","Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.79 and this was up 16% versus the prior quarter, due primarily to the fall through on higher sales and the benefits of our cost and productivity actions. So let's turn to Slide 10.","If you look at the top half of the slide, our gross margin in the quarter was in line with guidance at 31% on lower-than-expected volumes due to the cost actions I just mentioned and the operating leverage on the sequential volume growth. We expect gross margins to be in excess of 31% in our fourth quarter.","Looking at the bottom half of the slide, operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 17% as expected. In quarter 4, we expect research development and engineering, as well as SG&A to be approximately 5% and 12.5% of sales, respectively.","Now let me discuss items on the P&L below the operating line. Please turn to Slide 11.","Net interest expense was $42 million, up from $37 million in the second quarter, due to a full quarter of interest on the debt that we issued related to the Deutsch acquisition.","As we discussed when we announced the Deutsch acquisition, part of the debt raised was a pre-funding of our upcoming bond maturity in October. Because of the pre-funding, our net interest expense will remain slightly elevated, again in the fourth quarter, before being reduced in 2013 by about $8 million per quarter, once we pay down the October maturity. We expect a net interest expense of approximately $40 million -- $41 million in the fourth quarter.","Adjusted other income, which relates to our tax sharing agreement was $9 million. And in quarter 4, we expect other income of approximately $11 million.","The GAAP effective tax rate was 25% in the quarter, and the adjusted effective tax rate was 26%, which was in line with our guidance and we expect the adjusted tax rate to be about 26% again, in the fourth quarter.","Now, let me turn to free cash flow and working capital that starts on Slide 12.","Our free cash flow in the second quarter was $414 million, a very strong result, and up 19% compared to last year. Cash from operations was just below $500 million. And with the strong year-to-date performance, we now expect our free cash flow to exceed $1.3 billion in 2012. At this level, free cash flow will exceed our long-term target of 100% this year.","Capital spending during the quarter was $115 million. And for the full year, we expect capital spending of approximately 4% of sales, in line with our long-term expectations of 4% to 5% of sales.","Working capital performance in the quarter was very strong and levels are in line with our expectations. Receivable days outstandings were 62 days and inventory days on hand, reduced to 66 days. The inventory days are a 5-day sequential improvement, and I believe we've done a very good job managing our working capital in this uncertain environment. If you could please turn to Slide 13. Let me discuss sources and uses of cash outside of free cash flow.","We began the quarter with $2.9 billion of cash and ended the quarter with $1.3 billion. During the quarter, we paid dividends of $90 million which reflect the 17% increase to $0.21 per share per quarter, and we used $2 billion in April to acquire Deutsch. And when you look at this slide, the $2 billion is shown, both in the acquisition line and the repayment of Deutsch debt of $642 million.","In addition, we received proceeds of $394 million from the sale of our Touch and Services business.","Outstanding debt was $3.76 billion at the end of the quarter, which is down about $200 million from last quarter due to the commercial paper pay down in the quarter. As I mentioned on the last call, we plan to reduce our debt levels to around the $3 billion level in 2013.","As Tom mentioned earlier, with the strong free cash flow we expect for the year and the proceeds from our divestitures, we plan to restart our share repurchase program in the fourth quarter. And I want to remind you, that we have $1.5 billion still remaining under our authorization.","Before I turn it back to Tom to cover the outlook, I'd also like to very quickly say, I've enjoyed my tenure and time here as TE CFO over the past 6 years, and I'd like to thank everyone, both my finance team, all of our employees, as well as our investors and analysts for their support. I'm very much looking forward to my new role, leading the Industrial Solutions segment and the opportunities that we have in the space, and I'm also confident that Bob Hau will be an excellent CFO going forward. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Tom.","Thomas J. Lynch","Thank you very much, Terrence. If you turn to Slide 14, I'll talk about what we're seeing in our order trends.","As I mentioned earlier, the order rate started to slow around the middle of the third quarter, particularly in CIS and Networks. And right now, orders are continuing to run around the $3.4 billion per quarter rate, which is down about 3% organically versus our last outlook. So what we saw in March and April were orders running in the $3.6 billion range, slightly higher. And then it began to soften.","And as we all know, there's a great deal of uncertainty in most markets, particularly as it relates to the weak economy in Europe.","In our Transportation segment, book-to-bill was 1.01. Orders continued to be solid with steady demand in the automotive and commercial aerospace markets. In CIS, book-to-bill was 0.97, with particular softness noted in the Industrial business and in the distribution channel, as customers continue to be very cautious.","In Network Solutions, excluding SubCom, book-to-bill was 0.99. But spending by telecom carriers continues to be less predictable and below expected levels. The net of all this is demand in our Telecom businesses, including SubCom, is at one of the lowest levels in several years due primarily to the slow global economy.","We're the leading provider of fiber connectivity. And based on the fundamental bandwidth expansion needs, we believe this -- the long-term growth of this market is going to be in the mid to high single-digit range. And we very much earn a strong position to capitalize on this growth.","If you turn to Page 15 or Slide 15, I'll cover the current outlook.","For the fourth quarter, we expect our sales to be in the range of $3.325 billion to $3.425 billion, which is down 2% to 5% sequentially. EPS are expected to be $0.72 to $0.76 per share, or down or 4% to 9% sequentially. Versus our prior guidance, the difference is due to a weaker economic outlook, a weak Telecom market, and the weakness in Europe and the continuing weakening euro. The euro itself is causing a decline of about $80 million in sales and a negative $0.02 earnings per share impact. If you turn to Slide 16 for our full year outlook.","Full year sales are expected to be $13.25 billion to $13.35 billion, which is down slightly versus 2011 on an organic basis. Earnings are expected to be $2.82 to $2.86, also down slightly versus 2011 adjusted earnings per share of $2.95, excluding the extra week that we had in 2011.","The euro has created about a 300 basis-point headwind to our overall sales growth, compared to last year, and about a $0.09 negative impact.","A few final thoughts before we open it up for Q&A. It is clearly a challenging economic environment, but I think you can see where we're holding the operating margins, that we're taking the appropriate action. I continue to feel really good about our portfolio, the range of connectivity products and solutions we offer. We did make 2 big acquisitions over the last year and a half to become the leader in fiber optic connectivity and to become one of the top 2 players in hours activity, and I really think the integrations are going well. The synergies are on or ahead of plan, and this is just going to make us a stronger company for the long time. And at the same time, we continue to focus the portfolio, most recently with the divestiture of the Touch and Services business.","We're getting back on track in tablets and smartphones. A small part of our business still, but we have a little momentum there. And in -- really importantly, our operating leverage is -- leverage continues to improve. And within that, as we mentioned, CIS margins are picking up momentum again, with 2 quarters in a row improvement and we expect Q4 to be at the third quarter.","When you look at performance versus 2011 on a 52-week basis, second half margin will be about 50 basis points higher this year, and EPS will be about equal with the second half of 2011 on sales that are 3% lower. So again, we're managing the middle of the P&L very well in my opinion. And second half EPS will be up about 17% versus the first half of 2012.","And I think our strong suit, which is our cash flow, it's going to continue to get stronger. And as Terrence mentioned, we'll start regular share repurchases this quarter.","Just a little more comment on capital allocation. We're pretty much completing our first 5 years since we separated. And in that time, we generated over $7 billion of free cash flow. We used about $4.4 billion of that for return on capital and about $3.4 billion for M&A. So the ratio is about 55%, 45% return on capital. And our priorities were to #1, strengthen the needs of the company and make sure that the strategic position of the company got stronger. And of course secondly, any capital we didn't use for that, to make sure we return promptly to the shareholders.","When I look forward, our priorities are going to change. I think #1 will be a consistent return of capital. We'll continue to look for bolt-on M&A in targeted markets, but I think you can think of us kind of a 2\/3, capital return, 1\/3, reinvest in the company. So I think we're positioned to do that. We like the make up for the portfolio and we certainly expect to get, to continue to generate strong cash flow.","I think the bottom line of all that is it's definitely uncertain out there, but we're really confident in our strategy and in our ability to execute well through the challenging environment. So thank you, and now, we'll open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from line of Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I just have 2 questions. Tom, maybe when you look at the operating margin profile, you guys are clearly doing a good job of hitting the 14% target on sub $3.5 billion revenue now. The mix though looks like, of margin to just Transportation has been doing a lot of the heavy lifting. How do you think of margins with the other 2 segments? And could you maybe talk about what gets the other 2 segments to 14% off margins, in terms of for a revenue run rate or for the cost initiative, especially in the Network Solutions side?","Thomas J. Lynch","Sure. Yes, I think your comment that Transportation has been carrying the load is right. And Networks, I think the issue there is with the bottom of the cycle. We think that I would expect that group of businesses to get back to 15% as the revenue comes up. I think inherently, it's -- the gross margins in that business are good. Some of the highest we have in the company. So it's really a volume, more of a volume issue. Clearly, we continue to drive productivity there. On the CIS, I think it was a combination of 2 things. One, the market softened and the channel correction that happened in the first half of the year, in response to that, we took a lot of cost out. So there's clearly significant cost actions we've taken in that business. And now as revenue -- even though it's not picking up, you can see us improving the margin and we should get significant lift in that business, as the margin -- as the revenue picks up.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And then Tom, maybe I'm reading too much into this. But I think you said, that you guys intend to return 2\/3 of the free cash flow back to shareholders. That seems a high number at 67%. Whereas in the past, you've talked about 50% to 60%. Could you verify that? And then would the split between buybacks and dividends change on a go-forward basis?","Thomas J. Lynch","Well, as I said, we ran about 55, 45 return to M&A in the first 5 years. And if my memory serves me right, about 2\/3 of the return was buyback, and 1\/3, dividend. So dividend is about $1.4 billion and return's about $2.9 billion in that period. I do think because we've made 2 significant acquisitions that really fill the 2 key strategic areas that by -- almost by definition, going forward, that there'll be much more focus on a consistent return of capital and bolt-on acquisitions. I would never say never, but that's what I say when I think -- when you think in terms of the model, the 55%, the 60% to 70%, is how I think of it as a return. I would expect us to continue to raise the dividend, as long as global economies are sound and our earnings are keeping in line with our target dividend yield. I hope that answers your question.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Matt Sheerin representing Stifel, Nicolaus.","Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just a question on the commentary on the CIS business and specifically, the channel softness. Obviously, you went through an inventory correction there. And it sounds like distributors are being more cautious. But what is sell-through look like in inventory levels? Are they bringing down inventories yet again? Or are they just being super cautious here?","Thomas J. Lynch","Matt, I think it's more of the latter, super cautious. A quarter ago, when we were all together, I think we were feeling cautiously bullish as the inventory correction was over and we saw in Q2, and in Q3 actually, the lift in sequential revenue through the channel and their sell-throughs were going up. But as this slowdown began to happen in mid-May, with U.S. jobs peaking and all those other things, everybody's just starting to dial back a little bit. I don't think the inventory and the channel, a problem. I think just that -- what we've gone through over the last 5 years, a couple of times collectively, everybody is managing that much more closely, and including ourselves, where our inventory days are actually down this quarter. I think it's just -- everybody's a little bit gun-shy.","Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","You're getting the sense that the distribution point-of-sales has weakened as well, going into this quarter?","Thomas J. Lynch","No. I think the slope is just changed. It was ramping, and now it's flattening, and I think that's just leading the caution.","Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then on the OpEx side, it looks like you're holding margins fairly well, given the volume softness across different parts of your business. If we're in this sort of a component cycle that's stuck here and we continue to see softness, are you looking at other cost-cutting measures, whether it be in CIS or other businesses, particularly networking, where it doesn't look like things have bottomed yet?","Terrence R. Curtin","I would say, Matt, I think as we proved over the last year, if we do, we will continue to assess where are we from a volume level and we will take actions as appropriate. So I think what you can expect, and I think what you saw, like we did in CIS over the past year -- CIS was an area that we had to adjust it. We're happy that in the third quarter, we're back to prior year OI levels even on lower volume. Essentially in there, we're going to prove it. So we see markets change that fundamentally, we sort of had a higher level that we will take -- we'll evaluate further cost out. So...","Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","It doesn't sound like you're at the point now where you're ready to do that. You feel like things have at least, fabbed -- aren't you getting materially worse? Is that fair or...","Thomas J. Lynch","I'd say there's not much visibility, Matt, but what we do have is a pretty robust set of alternatives of what we do, depending on the circumstances. And even though, as we entered the second half of the year, we were expecting, I'd say modest recovery and normal seasonality, we weren't -- we kept our cost structure more conservative to that. And that's why, we were able to get the margin to where it is. So that's -- we're taking a very conservative view, not in a way that would hurt our responsiveness to customers. But it's uncertain out there, and so we're managing it accordingly.","Operator","And we'll go to the line of Shawn Harrison representing Longbow Research.","Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC","I just wanted to talk a little bit about Deutsch. It sounds as if margins are going to be better exiting the year than you anticipated, and high single-digit revenue growth year-over-year. Maybe if you could just speak to where that revenue growth could get over the next 12 months? Can you see it accelerate, given the feedback you're getting from the channel? And then, why is profitability running a little bit better than expected?","Thomas J. Lynch","I think a couple of things. On the profitability, the teams had been tremendous at getting at the early synergy opportunities ahead of schedule. So that's helped. The revenue is off slightly, and that's economics, but it's still up year-over-year and the business is solid. I'd say it's -- we're not calling next year yet. It's a little outside our window, and we'll talk about that next quarter, but we're very bullish about the business. We do expect that we'll get lift through the channel because they -- especially in their Aerospace and Military business, they didn't really have much there and we bring a lot there. We're the biggest player to those channels. So I mean, we'll definitely be able to help that there and that's part of that channel strength comment before. And I think we'll continue to find more opportunities for cost synergy. Just because of our size, helping them buy materials cheaper, and things like that. So we feel good about it. It's a little bit hard to call the market, the end-demand environment, but -- much like we did with ADC, the end-to-end system we can offer in fiber, we have that end-to-end hours connectivity we can offer into the Industrial and commercial market, every application we can serve. So we're very, very excited about that.","Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And then as a follow-up, just with restarting the share purchase program and understanding that you have some debt coming due, how aggressive do think you'll be in terms of repurchasing stock during the fourth quarter?","Thomas J. Lynch","Well, we're going to get started. As you know, this quarter, I think our main thing is to be consistent within a certain range. And I think that's the thing that -- we have bought back a lot of shares, but when we've made acquisitions, we've turned it off. They were big acquisitions. You can expect us to be consistent in -- and I'd say, think about the 150 to 250 range.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank.","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I just wanted to get a little bit of detail on what you're seeing or what you're hearing from customers in the networking segment, and clearly there's lots of long-term demand drivers, but as you've noted in that segment, it continues to be weak. Do you have any sense from your customers about when they expect to see a pickup in that market?","Thomas J. Lynch","Yes. We talk to them regularly. I think it really -- it's a customer-by-customer situation in that business. Last year, Europe was very strong, for example, and the customers were more aggressive even than we thought. This year, they've turned that back. I think it's some of that uncertainty. In the U.S., it started very slow because of all the strategic activities that was going on in the U.S. telecom market. So we have seen the U.S. pick up. It's just not anywhere near the rate, and it was slow last year in the second half. So I think it was a combination of caution, as well as -- if I'm going to spend a little more capital, and I believe that at -- overall, CapEx spending is down, a little more going into the wireless versus the fiber, right now. That's not unusual a few years back. The big push in the fiber to the home, or fiber deep into the premise-type program, those have slowed down. No surprise. We fully expected that. So it's really a case-by-case. And we've seen China slow a bit. It was very strong for us last year, slowing down this year.","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, great. That's helpful. And then in terms of the consumer business, consumer devices. That has been a segment where you've been struggling. This quarter, you mentioned PC's down, but you said tablets were a bit better. Can you give us a little more detail? And do you think you're gaining share in that market?","Thomas J. Lynch","I think we're growing with the market now, Sherri. I think, as you know, we had -- before the double whammy, the customers -- our customers that were losing share, we were strong with them. We hadn't established with the customers that are winning share. So in the last year, it's been about stabilizing the business, both from a top line and a market position and a cost perspective. I think our team has done a tremendous job of doing that. And now we have, we've won several important programs that should -- I used to call it a beach head. I think it's more than a beach head for us now. Still a small part of our business. But this last quarter, in terms of the programs you want and the orders we got, we show good [ph]. So I'd say we're now growing with the market, and that tablet and smartphone market is growing 40% to 50% or 30% to 40%, something like that, and we're finally growing with that, even though it's a small part of our business. So for us, the proof point is, we can serve these customers. We have the technology, and we can get more than 1 or 2 wins. We still have to build on that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim Suva, representing Citi.","Samuel Meehan","This is actually Samuel Meehan, on behalf of Jim Suva. I want to get a couple more details about Europe. When you look at the weakness in Europe, European automotive, have you seen any mixed shifts or model push outs that would have a significant impact on content dollars per vehicle?","Thomas J. Lynch","No. Not really. I'd say the strength is still in the high end and a lot of that is exported from Germany to the U.S. and China, and that part is still robust. Most of the weakness is in the Southern Europe OEMs. So we have not seen any negative shifts in content because of mix of cars.","Operator","Now we have a question from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.","Ruplu Bhattacharya","This is Ruplu filling in for Wamsi. Just -- you've talked about the margins and transport connectivity. I just wanted to touch on that again. Some margins improved quite a bit, 140 basis points sequentially. How much of that was Deutsch and how do you see -- how should we think about margins going into the September quarter? Do you think you can maintain that higher margin?","Terrence R. Curtin","#1, Deutsch as we talked on our last call, both in Transportation as well as the total company, is about 10 to 20 basis points of NOI benefit. So when you look at that part of the question -- when you look at the fourth quarter because we will have seasonal slowdown in Europe, we do participate in the shutdowns that the OEMs have. We do expect our margin in Transportation to be about 16% in the fourth quarter. I think when you look at what's offsetting that, we do expect a further improvement in our CIS segment, going the other way, that helps us to cost improvements that we've had there in CIS. The combination is going to allow us to keep our margin up in that 13.5% to 14% level, Ruplu.","Ruplu Bhattacharya","Okay, got it. Just as a follow-up on subsea. I see you've lowered the guidance a little bit from 5 20 to 4 90 for the full year. Last quarter, you talked about one contract coming in later this year. Is that the contract that is being pushed out? And you also mentioned something about $110 million. When did those come into revenue?","Terrence R. Curtin","If you look at that, Ruplu, the 110 we booked during the quarter was actually a number of smaller projects, really in the oil and gas area. The one project that we've talked about last fall, you're correct. That customer has not completed his funding yet and that's really why the revenue is down from the 140 that we expected last quarter, in fourth quarter, down to the 120. The 110 that we'd talked about, they will be contracts that start up next year and it will be as part of next year.","Operator","Again, we have a question from Amitabh Passi with UBS.","James F. Hillier - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","This is Jim Hillier for Amitabh. I was hoping in light of some of the macro trends, you can provide us any color on the current pricing environment as well as how lead times are currently trending?","Thomas J. Lynch","Pricing overall I'd say, not any big change. I mean, I think there's always pricing pressure in the business. But we're not seeing any unusual pressure. It always feels like a lot of pressure. But nothing unusual here. So I think we'll continue to be in that -- I'd expect to be, plus or minus at 2% price erosion range.","Terrence R. Curtin","And on lead times, lead times have been at normal levels. I mean, certainly on certain products for certain customers and applications, that's specific, but on an overall basis, you look at our lead times, there's no extension or contraction of them. They've been at normal levels for most of this year.","Thomas J. Lynch","I think what we see more is just change orders. A little more frequent. So it's people waiting, waiting to buy until they get a little more sure. So it's not so much that the fundamental lead times are reducing, but we do see a little more churn in the order.","James F. Hillier - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And if I could also follow-up on your telco business. It appears that while spending has been weak, if look at the budget outlooks for some of the major North American carriers, spending looks more back half-weighted this year. And from your customer conversations, do you think that ultimately we could see some improvement in this business by year end? And also as a follow-on to that, if you any update on the NBN ramp, that would be really helpful.","Thomas J. Lynch","Say, for us, we're only 2 months away from our year end. So could there be, yes. I'd say the general feedback has been it's coming. It's coming. And it's been a little slower than obviously, than we expected. Could it happen by the end of the calendar year? I mean, our fundamental view is that pent-up demand is happening because of this. Because you still have to be able to invest more in the wireless part. You still have to get the signal in the ground to have the coverage and the capacity really work. So I'd say we expect the investment to pick up in our portion of the network, but it's hard to call the timing right now. I mean, a quarter ago, we were feeling pretty good in seeing the ramp, that it was our Q3 and Q4 which would have been the June and September quarters. We got half of what we expected in Q3 and it's not going to -- right now, our call is that it's not going to happen in Q4.","Terrence R. Curtin","And on your NBN -- NBN for our 2012 is about $20 million. We're going to -- we started to get some of that program, started to ramp here on our quarter 3. A similar amount in quarter 4. Next year, right now, we would expect that to increase up to $50 million, $60 million, as that program continues to ramp.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Mike Wood with Macquarie Capital.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Research","Tom, with the recent management changes, are you expecting any sort of -- after everyone takes over and gets set in the job, are they supposed to come back with cost savings initiatives or growth initiatives, investment suggestions?","Thomas J. Lynch","We always expect that. I think with this -- look, I think we'll get some fresh looks at things. Right? But all these 4 leaders have been in the company from anywhere from 3 to 25 years. So they may know the company pretty well. We -- they've been part of the senior team for several years now. So they understand even the business they're going into, while it may be new for them to run, they understand it pretty well. So -- but I do think that my comment on vitality, and what I mean by that is, it's good when people shift around, especially if it's not that disruptive because they've been around and they already know the business. So I do expect to get new ideas. Absolutely. I don't expect us to turn the place upside down, as a result of it. But I do expect that we're going to be stronger as a result of these changes.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Research","Okay. And on the Transportation side, your orders were above the growth of global OEM production. Your sales reported were slightly below that. Has that segment also been impacted by the destocking that you'd mentioned, just given the uncertainty ahead of the plant shutdowns in Europe?","Terrence R. Curtin","No. No. Really, Mike, when you look at it, what you saw in the third quarter of our sales being a little bit less in production, really just due to our Asia content per vehicle and what we've got in Japan, just being such a weight on the production growth. In the fourth quarter, we expect our sales to be greater than production and we expect it to be that way for the year. So it's really just how the production builds were going around the world.","Operator","And we will go to the line of Mike Wherley with Janney Capital.","Michael J. Wherley - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I just wanted to ask on the restructuring. So you're not talking about any further actions right now. But the restructuring that you've already done, is that going to roll through immediately in the fiscal fourth quarter? Or will it be more of a fiscal 2013 event?","Terrence R. Curtin","Most of the restructuring has to do with the Deutsch integrations. So when you look at that, it mainly relates to Deutsch and the integration of Deutsch into our structure. That will come in the relationship as we have the Deutsch integration. There are some tailing items that are coming. But most of those costs are already in, or will be in, in the fourth quarter. So some of those costs you see are tails related to prior actions.","Michael J. Wherley - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay, so in the CIS segment, for example, is the benefit already being realized in the third quarter? Or will there be some upside in the fourth quarter?","Terrence R. Curtin","As I've said, we do expect CIS margin to go up sequentially. There is a little bit more benefit because the volume's coming down. But there will be a little bit of benefit in the fourth quarter.","Michael J. Wherley - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just on the smartphone and tablet commentary. Are you getting on to more platforms? I mean, I know you mentioned a few wins. But is it about a broader set of customers? Or is it more content uptake on each platform that's sort of helping you out there? Which is it more?","Thomas J. Lynch","It's more customers. It's a couple of customers we really haven't had much of a position with, and now we have a starting position with them. So we have more customers in a broader way and in a deeper way than we did a year ago, is the way I think about it.","Operator","Next, we'll go to the line of Craig Hettenbach with Goldman Sachs.","Craig Hettenbach - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Tom, you mentioned -- or commented on the stable trends in the automotive market. Can you talk about just how suppliers and customers are managing inventory through this environment? Did you see any type of change through the quarter?","Thomas J. Lynch","No. I think -- I mean, everybody is tight. Where we see it is, as I kind of mentioned earlier, a little more churn in the releasing of orders. So which -- I think it's typical. Right now, in Europe, we're going into the shutdown season. So the Southern OEMs are going to shut down for more than normal, but that's no surprise. We've been expecting and planning that for months. I think it will be kind of a normal shutdown in the North. But inventory levels, whether on the lot or in the channel, seem to be in pretty good shape, and our inventory levels are in good shape.","Craig Hettenbach - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then if I could just follow up on the smartphone and tablet piece, you commented, you think you now have a beach head. Any thoughts around the types of technology? I know you've done antennas, how the kind of connectors fit in, and is there an opportunity to kind of expand your content on programs as you go forward?","Thomas J. Lynch","I think there's an opportunity to expand it, but within the products that we know best. So right now, our focus is on the key things we do, antennas connect, and connecting systems. So -- no, we're not -- not to say we will never stray from that, but I think there's just so much opportunity as we continue to get better. The good news is we have the technology. We have the products. It's for us. It's -- our problem in the past has been more about execution and the pace of execution, and we're really improving that. And now we have to build a track record. We earn a couple of programs, do well, and then we earn a few more. And that's the way we're -- the approach we're taking.","Craig Hettenbach - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, and how much -- I know you guys have talked about the management change about a year ago, in terms of the customer interface and things like that, how much has that come into play, in terms of the ability to gain traction now?","Thomas J. Lynch","The changes we did with our channel?","Terrence R. Curtin","In consumer.","Thomas J. Lynch","In consumer, I'm sorry. That's helped a lot. Organizing around the vertical markets which -- it took us a while to take the CIS and break it into these global vertical businesses. But it's -- one of the first we did was consumer and that has made a massive difference, as well as the leadership that's in that group. So they've made all the difference in the world. We have better customer intimacy and relationships and we're executing better. And we just have to keep doing it.","Operator","And next, we go to the line of Anthony Kure with KeyBanc.","Anthony C. Kure - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of quick ones. Can you just talk about China, specifically how it progressed through the quarter, and if you saw any inflection points, maybe to the negative and then any change in that, relatively recently, just maybe talk about the linearity of China through the quarter if possible?","Thomas J. Lynch","I think China has been steady, but slower than we thought. When we sat there a quarter ago, we would have been expecting, and as you know, the government was keeping interest rates up, trying to cool things off, trying to cut back on some of the speculation in housing that was going on and trying to head that off and of course, balance that with economic growth. We saw that for sure, the first 2 quarters. We thought by the third quarter, that, that would begin to pass and that stimulus would happen. Now, there's still applying stimulus. It was announced and things like that, but we haven't really seen it pick up. Auto has been still very robust, although slowing a little bit slower than it's -- for sure, than it has the last couple of years, but still high. 15%, 18% for us. But a lot of our other businesses are flat to -- even slight. In some cases, slightly down. Now, some of that, is the exports are down because of Europe and U.S. But it's -- I haven't seen an inflection point. No. I'd say our people on the ground there expect things to get better because of what the government is saying. But it's hard to call.","Anthony C. Kure - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful color. And I guess in a similar vein, instead of China, maybe on the enterprise IT market, I'm just hearing consistently now that the sea level folks make -- the decision makers here are really taking a sharper eye on budgets in the second half of the calendar year. I'm just wondering, is that -- are you seeing that? And has that had any differences among the geographies, either better or worse?","Thomas J. Lynch","I'd say we're seeing it pretty broad-based. That second quarter to third quarter, our business that serves those markets picked up, recent sequential pickup, we would have expected that. Again, go back 3 months, we would have expect some sequential pickup in Q4. We don't expect that now in this outlook. So I agree with you. We're feeling that as well.","Operator","And we have a follow-up from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I just want to maybe talk a little bit about the commodity cost, how that's playing out in the September quarter and your progress there? And then secondly, given the fact that FX has been a fairly severe revenue and to some degree, and EPS headwind for you guys this year. Any confidence on a hedged FX on a rolling 12-month basis that you guys come up with annual guidance?","Terrence R. Curtin","Amit, it's Terrence. So 2 things. Let me take the second piece first. So #1, we do hedge transactionally. We don't hedge translationally. I mean, you are right if you look at this year. It is a significant headwind that we're dealing with, almost $400 million with the euro weakening. I don't see us changing our policy around hedging translation because of -- our earnings are also hedged because that translation comes through at the OI margin. When you look at metals. Metals is a slight benefit right now. As you know, we have a risk management process that we do on how we fix. So really when you look at it, metals are a slight benefit, not significant due to the position we put in place when copper and gold and silver were a little bit higher. So we're relatively fixed out for the next 6 to 9 months pretty firmly. There may be some benefit if metals stay where they are and later next year. But right now, it's pretty minor benefit.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And it goes on the metal hedging. It's still a rolling kind of 2 quarter-out process, right?","Terrence R. Curtin","It actually goes out 18 months. But the more current it is, the heavier we are fixed from a ratio of what we buy, and then it sort of goes out overtime. But you're right, it's a rolling 18-month program.","Thomas J. Lynch","This is Tom. Before we cut off the call. Just a few closing comments or 1 closing comment. Terrence and I have been together since we separated in the year before that in the business, and it's been -- for me, it's been fantastic. Many of you, if not all of you out there have had the opportunity to deal with Terrence and the consummate","Pro. A guy who loves, and committed to the company, and he's made it a lot better. And in his new role, he's going to make it even better. So I know, it's not easy for him to unplug from this part of the job. But boy, I'll tell you, he's done a good job. He's left our organization in great shape. He's been integral in recruiting a tremendous successor. And he's going to take this other business, in my mind no question, to another level. So thank you, Terrence for everything you've done. And thanks, everybody, on the call. I appreciate it.","Terrence R. Curtin","Thank you, everyone.","Keith Kolstrom","Thanks for joining our call.

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. ","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Sujal Shah. Please go ahead.","Sujal Shah","Good morning and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss TE Connectivity\u2019s third quarter results. With me today are Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Lynch and Chief Financial Officer, Bob Hau.","During the course of this call we will be providing certain forward-looking information and we ask you to review the forward-looking cautionary statements included in today\u2019s press release. In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussion this morning and we ask you to review the sections of our press release and the accompanying slide presentation that address the use of these items. The press release and related tables, along with the slide presentation, can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at te.com.","Finally, for participants on the Q&A portion of today\u2019s call, I would like to remind everyone to limit themselves to one follow-up question to make sure we are able to cover all questions during the allotted time.","Now, let me turn the call over to Tom for opening remarks.","Tom Lynch","Thanks and good morning everyone. The following are the key takeaways from today\u2019s call: Q3 was another quarter of solid execution as we delivered $0.90 in adjusted EPS, up 6% from last year and above the high end of our guidance. ","Adjusted operating margins continued to grow and we are up 50 basis points to 15.9% year-over-year. Organic growth was 4% and total growth was 11% excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange. Our harsh environment businesses continue to perform well and generate strong profitability and overall I am pleased with our execution in what characterizes the mix demand environment and we\u2019ll talk about that quite a bit on the call today. ","Automotive, Sensors, Commercial Air and SubCom led our growth. However, revenue was below our expectations due to weakness in China and supply chain adjustments in some North American industrial markets. We saw order growth begin to slow midway through the quarter and order rates are now running about flat with last year. ","For the fourth quarter we expect sales up 3% organically versus the prior year and adjusted EPS up 6% at the mid-point. For the full year we expect to deliver 5% organic sales growth and 10% adjusted EPS growth. This guidance is down from what we provided 90 days ago due to the continued weakness in emerging markets, particularly China. In constant currency, full year adjusted EPS growth is expected to be 19% year-over-year.","We had another good quarter of strategic progress in our Sensor business with key platform wins in automotives, consumer and security application. Strategic rationale for the measurement specialties acquisition continues to play out very well and we are really excited about our prospects here. We now expect the Broadband Network Solutions sale to close in about 90 days earlier than originally expected and expect to use the year $3 billion of proceeds for share buybacks. ","Now before I get into the details of our performance, I\u2019d like to provide some color on what has changed in the market environment from our views 90 days ago. From a macro regional perspective, Europe continues to grow and it looks better than it did to us 90 days ago. The U.S. is mixed with a bit lower growth than expected due to supply chain adjustments, let\u2019s say the U.S. looks a little worse, but we do think this is mostly supply chain related and China has weakened with softness becoming more pronounced. ","From a segment perspective, transportation remains strong with the exception of China. In the industrial solutions segment we see some softening in China and supply chain adjustments in the U.S. market. Communications, data and devices and applications are seeing the impact of a weaker China market. The main them of market here is, we are seeing a weakness in China. ","Now please turn to slide three and I\u2019ll go through a summary of our Q3 results. We delivered solid results for Q3 with adjusted EPS of $0.90 above the high end of guidance. Sales were $3.1 billion growing 1% year-over-year and up 4% organically, but weaker than expected as I mentioned earlier. ","During the quarter we retuned $386 million to shareholders, which included $252 million in share buyback, significantly increasing the pace of repurchase from the first half of this year. Company orders excluding SubCom were flat organically at $3 billion with the book-to-bill ratio of 1.0, and basically orders ran at the same run rate excluding SubCom as they were in Q2, which was below, about $100 million below our expectation. ","Out TEOA program continues to contribute towards higher margins and profitability. Adjusted gross margins were up 50 basis points year-over-year and adjusted operating margins expanded to 15.9% up 50 basis points versus the prior year. ","During the quarter we continue to see strong performance in our harsh businesses with good organic growth in auto, sensors and commercial air. In our SubCom business we grew strongly year-over-year while having another program come in to force growing the total value of programs in force to $1.5 billion. ","As I mentioned, our China businesses saw a weakening demand in the quarter and separately we also saw some inventory tightening in certain industrial markets in the U.S. Currency translation rates impacted Q3 by $296 million in revenue, that unfavorably impacted Q3 and $0.10 in earnings per share year-over-year, excluding the impact of currency exchange rate, adjusted EPS improved by 18%. ","Now please turn to slide four for a summary of our guidance, which we\u2019ll also come back to later. For the full year we are projecting sales of $12.35 billion, up 3% from the prior year and 5% organically. We expect adjusted operating margins to exceed 16% with adjusted EPS up 10% at mid-point and nearly double that in constant currency. Our guidance assumes a 6% adjusted EPS increase in the second half versus last year. ","For the fourth quarter we expect sales up 3% organically over the prior year and adjusted EPS up 6% at the mid-point of guidance. Given the weakness in China in supply chain adjustments I mentioned earlier, we are adjusting our full year guidance down by approximately $150 million in revenue and $0.04 in adjusted EPS. We now expect to deliver 5% organic growth and 10% adjusted EPS growth. ","With the cumulative move of the dollar versus world currencies during our fiscal year, 2015 FX headwinds are approximately $925 million in revenue and $0.32 in EPS versus last year. If it were not for the impact of FX, we would be generating 11% revenue growth and 19% adjusted EPS growth year-over-year. All in all we are delivering a pretty solid year in what I\u2019d call a murky environment and we\u2019ll talk more about that as we go through the call. ","Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Bob to cover the segment results and financials. ","Bob Hau ","Thanks Tom and good morning everyone. Please turn to slide five for Transportation Solutions. Revenue grew 4% organically in the quarter, in-line with our expectations. The automotive business grew 6% organically, with growth in all regions, while global vehicle production was down 0.3%. For the full year we continue to expect growth in excess of two times auto production due to share gains and increased electronic content. ","Our Commercial Transportation business was down in the quarter due to continued significant weakness in the off-road vehicle market and weakness in the China heavy truck market.","Sensors continue to outperform expectations and are gaining momentum with both existing and new customers. Assuming we had owned measurements and AST last year, our total year-over-year growth in sensors was 10% in Q3.We gained multiple new wins in automotive, consumer and security applications in the quarter. We continue to aggressively build this business and our unmatched customer pacing and engineering resources are a significant asset for TE as proven by our new wins. ","Total transportation adjusted operating income was $317 million in Q3, down 2% year-over-year as expected, the strong operational performance offset by FX, weakness in commercial transportation and ongoing planned investment from sensors to support a growing pipeline of opportunities.","Margins actually expanded year-over-year in each of our three business units; automotive, commercial transport and sensors. However the mixed caused by high sensors growth combined with weaker commercial transport revenue impacted the margin rate for the segment overall. In Q4 we expect to grow actual and organic sales in the mid single digits despite weakness in China in commercial transport, slightly lower than our prior expectations. ","Please turn to slide six. Revenue in our Industrial Solutions segment declined 1% organically year-over-year versus an assumption of low single digit growth when we provided guidance in April. Industrial equipment business unit was up 1% organically, with growth in Europe offsetting weakness in the U.S. ","In our Aerospace, Defense and Oil and Gas business, continued strength in commercial aerospace was offset by 37% decline in our oil and gas business, resulting in a 5% organic decline for AD&M in total. ","Our energy business was flat organically as growth in China and the Americas was offset by declines in Europe. Adjusted operating income was $109 million in Q3, down 11% year-over-year, due to unfavorable FX and significant decline in a higher margin oil and gas business, more than offsetting improvement in commercial aerospace. In Q4 we continue to expect similar market trends as Q3 resulting in organic revenue decline in low single digits. ","Please turn to slide seven. Our Communications Solutions segment grew 12% year-over-year on an organic basis driven by our strong position in the growing SubCom market. This more than offset market weakness across our China businesses, coupled with a planned exist of low margin products in data and devices. ","Adjusted operating income of $71 million was up 163% year-over-year and adjusted operating margin more than doubled to 10.3% from 4.2% a year ago due to robust SubCom growth. Heading into Q4, we expect revenue to growth mid-single digits on an organic basis, driven by the SubCom projects in force. We now have five programs in force with the announcement in May of the New Cross Pacific cable network with the NCP consortium. ","Please turn to slide eight, where I\u2019ll provide more details on earnings. Adjusted operating income was $497 million, up 5% versus the prior year despite significant FX headwinds. The growth versus the prior year is driven by our TE operating advantage efforts to improve safety, quality, cost and delivery, as well as volume leverage. ","GAAP operating income was $469 million and included $18 million of restructuring and other charges, most of which were divested stipulated costs and $10 million were acquisition related charges in the quarter. Adjusted EPS was $0.90 for the quarter, $0.03 above the midpoint of guidance and $0.05 above prior year driven by strong productivity, restructuring savings and cost management. GAAP EPS was $0.85 for the quarter. GAAP EPS included acquisition related charges of $0.01, income from tax items of $0.01 and restructuring and other charges of $0.05. ","For the full year 2015 I expect approximately $100 million of restructuring and other charges. This represents an increase from prior guidance, driven by product exits in data and devices and resizing for a smaller oil and gas business. We expect roughly $0.27 of restructuring and other charges and $0.18 of acquisition related charges which will more than offset reserve reversals of $0.33 from tax liabilities for the full year. ","Turning to slide nine, our adjusted gross margin in the quarter was 33.6%. This is an expansion of 50 basis points versus the prior year, driven primarily by growth in the harsh environment businesses in SubCom and productivity gains from our TEOA initiatives. ","Adjusted operating margins expanded 50 basis points driven by productivity, restructuring savings and cost management. Total operating expenses were $552 million in the quarter, with increases from acquisitions and RD&E to support growth in sensors.","Cash from continuing operations was $524 million and our free cash flow in Q3 was $391 million. Free cash flow was impacted by the timing of tax payments in the quarter and both gross and net capital expenditures were down $30 million year-over-year. I currently expect the capital spending rate to be approximately 5% of sales for 2015. ","I\u2019ll remind you we\u2019ve added a balance sheet and cash flow summary in the appendix for additional details. And now I\u2019ll turn it back over to Tom.","Tom Lynch","Thanks Bob. Please turn to slide 10 and I\u2019ll cover our outlook at a higher level with additional details provided in the slide. Despite the softer market condition we are experiencing in China, we expect to deliver another solid quarter in Q4 with revenue of $3.1 billion up 3% organically year-over-year. ","We expect adjusted EPS of $0.93, an increase of 6% year-over-year. Our Q4 outlook does include a significant headwind from currency exchange rates, which are negatively affecting our guidance by approximately $244 million in revenue and $0.10 per share in EPS versus the prior year. ","Our fourth quarter performance will be driven by the continued strong performance of our automotive business and momentum in SubCom and contributions from our recent acquisitions. Industrial is expected to continue to be somewhat soft and will continue to be impacted by the uncertainty in China and ongoing weakness in oil and gas. ","Please turn to slide 11. Note that the total impact of currency exchange rates for the year is approximately $925 million versus the prior year and $0.32 in EPS. To really provide a baseline for the performance of our business, revenue would be growing 11% and adjusted EPS would be growing by 19% year-over-year or not for the negative impact of the stronger dollar relative to other currencies. ","Now before we open it up for Q&A, I thought I\u2019d just add a few comments that I think are really important about our company. TE is the world leader in Connectivity and Sensor Solutions and building a leading position in Sensor Solutions, which is a great place to be in the increasingly connected world. And kind of just stepping back, Q3 organic growth is higher than last year, a little lower than our guidance, but its higher than last year. Q4 is a little lower. They have different mix, but nonetheless we are delivering solid organic growth in the second half, in a pretty uncertain economy and growing very solidly when you include the harsh environment M&A that we did last year. ","As I mentioned, we are growing earnings almost 20% on 10% constant currency growth. This was a big year to really support our harsh environment strategy and I think it\u2019s working very well. And on that subject, the harsh environment businesses continue to perform well despite the recent weakness in China. Q3 and Q4 organic growth is in the 2% to 3% range and 4% plus for the full year and 12% at constant currency. ","Over the last three years we grew the harsh environment business over $1.6 billion in revenue and that\u2019s including the foreign exchange headwinds. We grew the operating profit of those businesses about $500 million, again at current exchange rates and this portfolio now makes up about 80% of the company. And as we said before, the margins are well above company average. So I feel really, really good about the strength of our harsh business and the resiliency of our harsh businesses. ","If you go back, this has powered about a 300 basis point improvement in operating margins since 2012. Sensors is a very exciting new growth platform with substantial sales and margin growth opportunity and we\u2019re just at the very beginning of providing integrated packaging solutions. It\u2019s very, very early, but I\u2019ve talked to a lot of customers about this and the opportunity is real and will be another source of growth for the company. And the net of all this is, over the past several years we\u2019ve really transformed TE into what I\u2019d call an industrial technology company.","Overall I think though this company is performing very well. We\u2019re positioned very well. We do view the recent softness to be temporary. We don\u2019t have a crystal ball of course, but when we look at the fundamental drivers underlying all our businesses, we feel very good about them. It reinforces the strategy we have. That strategy is pretty straight forward and we look forward to continuing to execute it very aggressively and delivering solid performance across the company.","So with that, we\u2019re going to open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we do have a question from Amitabh Passi of UBS. Your line is opened.","Amitabh Passi","Hi guys, good morning. Tom I had a question and then maybe a follow up for the rest of the team. Just on your transportation solution segment, operating margins came in below 20%. I think you attributed part of that to mix weaker commercial transportation. It also looks like ongoing investments in sensors. I just want to get a sense whether we should expect that sort of level now to persist for the next couple of quarters and then as a follow up you intriguingly mentioned a few design wins in the automotive segment and sensors. I was wondering if you could touch on that and maybe provide a greater insight.","Tom Lynch","Obviously on the second question, we can\u2019t say too much as I\u2019m sure you understand, but as far as the margin goes, we expect the margin to continue to be in the 20% range plus or minus depending on mix. ","As Bob pointed out, the three major segments in the business, all improved their margin year-over-year. Sensors margins are lower than industrial transportation and automotive as expected and that\u2019s why I mentioned its one of the real opportunity to continue to grow profitability as we scale that business. So we don\u2019t see anything short of a significant volume decline. I think when we\u2019re running the 4% to 5% growth rate, we have the momentum to continue to deliver strong margin. So plus or minus 20% a little bit is what I would expect over the next several quarters.","Amitabh Passi","Okay. Can I squeeze another follow up there?","Tom Lynch","Of course.","Amitabh Passi","Okay, thanks. And then maybe just on the supply chain adjustments you talked about. Again, I don\u2019t know if you have any visibility or insight. I mean is this a one, two quarter phenomena. Just generally how you expect the supply chain and the potentially excess inventories to be digested here in the near term.","Tom Lynch","I mean we do have some insight, because we are large through the channel, right. So we have a very big business through the channel which serves tens of thousands, actually hundreds of thousands of end customers. So we feel like that\u2019s kind of a statistically sound base of information to look at and the channel was pretty robust in the first half just like our industrial businesses as everybody was expecting a little bit stronger second half and we have seen that tighten up. We\u2019ve seen it tighten up on sell through and sell-ins. I think the good news is coming out of the last big downturn, everybody in the supply chain is very glued together in terms of what\u2019s going on, so we react much quicker than we did. ","Of course it\u2019s hard to predict with a ton of confidence how long it will last, but what our forecast reflects is it starts to abate through the fourth quarter, our fourth quarter and that by the time we get into the first quarter it should be largely behind us from the industrial part of the business. That\u2019s the kind of forecast, that\u2019s what we\u2019re hearing from the market, so that\u2019s the best insight we have right now.","Sujal Shah","Okay, thanks Amitabh. Can we have the next question please?","Operator","Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Amit Daryanani","Thanks a lot. Good morning guys. I guess to start off with, Tom I look at the guide you guys are providing right now, adjusting to that next scale wind, your sort of reducing your forward expectations for the full year by about $235 million, $240 million. Could you talk about how much of that is really due to the softness in China that you\u2019re talking about and how much of that is perhaps due to the product exist in data and devices that you guys are undergoing?","Tom Lynch","Amit, I think the way to think about that, the $240 million narrow before the tailwind from FX, is really a spread relatively evenly across all three of our segments; transportation, industrial and communications. All three of them are seeing the implication of slower China and then we\u2019re also seeing the implication of the supply chain or inventory adjustments really in our industrial and appliances business in those last two segments.","Amit Daryanani","Got it, that\u2019s helpful. And then if I just think of the transportation segment with China slowing down, Europe seems to be holding up well to you guys so far. I\u2019m curious, what\u2019s your thought on \u2013 how much of your Europe exposure you think ends up as exports to China essentially and do you think that could be another level on concern you will have to contend with as you go down the next few quarters.","Tom Lynch","Well, just to put it in \u2013 our China auto business is now flat to slightly down. It\u2019s really the first time since probably the financial crisis and well that\u2019s what we got reflected in the fourth quarter. So we are definitely seeing less imports into China of high end vehicles. I think you\u2019ve heard several OEMs report their outlook for their China sales. So we\u2019re seeing some of that. I believe we have that reflected in our European automotive numbers. ","We generally have pretty good visibility. Its again not perfect visibility, but we\u2019ve taken our overall China numbers down quite a bit and I think it would be important to highlight that. Quarter-over-quarter we\u2019re going to be down about 12% in China revenue; that\u2019s last year\u2019s fourth to this year\u2019s fourth and its pretty broad based as Bob said. And the overall $240 million that Bob referred to, about two-thirds of that is China and Latin America, of course China being the biggest piece. ","It had been slowing; it slowed more abruptly. I think this is key quarter to see is that seems like maybe things are settling down over there now over the last few weeks. It\u2019s just now begun the bottom out and recover, because we think the core fundamentals of a large population, a growing middle class, growing incomes, urbanization, a place for all of our businesses, particularly where we\u2019re strong, which is harsh environment and as I mentioned, harsh businesses overall are still growing slightly despite a broader slowdown in China.","Sujal Shah","Okay, thank you Amit. Can we have the next question please?","Operator","Our next question comes from Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Craig Hettenbach","Yes, thanks. Just following up on some of the commentary on China weakness. Have you seen any change more broadly on the automotive side in terms of production forecasts you get. Like what OEMs are doing in this environment? Are they cutting back slightly to reflect that or any type of additional information on the production side would be helpful? ","Tom Lynch","I mean what we\u2019re \u2013 with our customers at the OEMs are telling us is in the fourth quarter they plan longer than usual in China shutdown; a week, maybe some after two weeks, so there\u2019s definitely a goal to balance inventory throughout the channel, including cars on the lot. Now the inventories aren\u2019t crazy. I think they\u2019ve been keeping them pretty tight there, but definitely reflect the slowing demand. ","Craig Hettenbach","Got it. And then if I could switch gears just to the MES, the commentary that that acquisition has gone well, any specific anecdotes you can talk about in terms of as you look to leverage that through your broader distribution channel, through you customer relationships. Like what type of upticks you are seeing from that as they potentially benefit from a much broader platform at TEL.","Tom Lynch","Sure. I think the broad anecdote, we can\u2019t get too specific yet as you know customers have their requirements, but a consistent anecdote is particularly in starting with auto and across several of our harsh environment businesses. We are spending a lot of time with customers where we bring in the product and technology express for measurement and get them into places where they couldn\u2019t get in before and we\u2019re seeing a lot of bidding activity resulting from that, because they are really a fine, fine engineering and technology and product company. ","I think as I\u2019ve mentioned on these calls before, we knew them quite well and certainly expected that and that\u2019s why we acquired them, but the deeper we got, the more engineers and applications engineers, we got to know the better we even felt about that, so where it\u2019s kind of interesting. In some ways the biggest challenge we have is which one is the pick, because there\u2019s a lot of opportunities to pick one. ","I mean as Bob mentioned we are ramping up our resources in a thoughtful way in that business, so that we can take on more and more design opportunities. But it\u2019s pretty broad based. I\u2019d say that it\u2019s definitely focused in the harsh, although we had some \u2013 we can\u2019t talk about it too much, but some really key wins in consumer that its very good business. Again, because these are highly engineered components and packaged in a way that they can perform their function no matter how they are treated by the consumer. So we\u2019re pretty excited about that. ","So I\u2019d say it\u2019s been a good almost first year, about a year now of working with this team and the back end, bringing lien into the operation, figuring the best place out, where to make things, putting the organization together, that\u2019s all done, so we feel like that first year where your figuring things out and how do you best work together, how do you leverage strength but not turn off the small company, but I think I\u2019d give us very high marks for that and now we\u2019re really going on the defensive what\u2019s getting in from of customers.","Sujal Shah","Okay, thank you Craig. Can we have the next question please?","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs.","Mark Delaney","Yes, good morning and thanks very much for taking the questions. The first question was just some clarification on the comments about some of the monthly trends that you\u2019re seeing with the business. Tom I understand you talked about seeing some weakness beginning during the June quarter and I think you commented that on a year-over-year basis bookings are pretty flat. Could you just clarify if you\u2019ve seen any stabilization in the monthly order patterns or you\u2019re still seeing some month to month declines in the bookings?","Tom Lynch","I would say, it feels like its stabilizing. Week to week things bounce around, but we\u2019re really kind of running at this ex-SubCom level to $2.9 billion to $3 billion order rate.","Mark Delaney","Okay, that\u2019s helpful and then for a follow up question, I\u2019m going to focus on SubC. I guess a two part question. First, it seems like the comments for the fiscal \u201915 revenue guidance, just a little bit above 700, it seems like a real small downtick versus the comments for $720 million on the last conference call. So can you maybe just help us understand \u2013 I know its small, but if anything\u2019s kind of changing that\u2019s driving that slight change to the revenue forecast for SubC for fiscal \u201915. ","And then second part on SubC, just given the new award that you\u2019ve won, what sort of visibility do you have into fiscal \u201916 revenue in the SubC business?","Tom Lynch","Mark, your right. There is an ever so slight decline, $720 million to $712 million, $715 million, something like that if I remember correctly and that\u2019s really just the timing of some material coming in, when we get it loaded on the ship. This is a project business and so as you progress, as material comes in, all you need is a vendor to be late by a week and you lose some revenue, but it is purely timing so no implication of that whatsoever.","In terms of \u201916, two of it to give guidance for \u201916, but obviously we\u2019ve done well this year. We feel good about adding the fifth program in force and we\u2019re spending that this year and that\u2019s now $1.5 billion enforced for us.","Mark Delaney","Thank you.","Sujal Shah","Okay, thank you Mark. Can we have the next question please?","Operator","The next question comes from William Stein from SunTrust.","William Stein","Thanks for taking my question. Tom, earlier you mentioned that you saw part of the slowdown extending through the fiscal Q4 guidance and likely ending in Q1. So this clarification is really about whether that\u2019s the China related weakness or the North American sort of channel adjustments you\u2019re seeing or that it relates to both and what gives you the confidence to have the view that this ends by the end of fiscal Q4. Thank you.","Tom Lynch","Sure, thanks Will. Really my comment about we think it will \u2013 based on what we\u2019re seeing and hearing now, worked its way through in Q4 as the North America industrial and part of that is end demand is still, its slower. It feels slower than what we\u2019re hearing in the second half and first half, but it\u2019s not off that much and we still have a pretty healthy American economy, even though I think most of us feel it\u2019s not growing the way we thought it would. It\u2019s still growing in all the indicators like payrolls and things, so. And then when we just look at the sell in and the sell through, what we\u2019re hearing is that that should start to work its way through by the end of our fiscal year, that\u2019s our best estimate at this time. ","China is harder to tell. I think just because data is harder to get. I mean kind of the only data you have is your own data and we have seen China can move up very quickly as well. So I\u2019m more uncertain about that Will and I mean last year we had a tremendous first quarter in China. Actually we had a pretty good first half and saw it again, the same for the second half, so it\u2019s harder to tell there. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this has kind of leaked in through the first quarter, but that\u2019s a guestimate based just on recent order trends.","Sujal Shah","Okay, thank you Will. Next question please. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Shawn Harrison from Longbow Research. Please go ahead.","Shawn Harrison","Hi, a two part initial question if I may and then a brief follow-up. On the BNS business and then also the proceeds, is the BNS business still running at kind of a $0.53 EPS run rate for the year. And then on the proceeds in terms of deploying that, is that on top of the typical buyback where you\u2019ve been spending $150 million to $250 million a quarter, so we\u2019d see say $200 million on average of buyback and then $600 million or $800 million a quarter of incremental buyback once the deal closes.","Tom Lynch","Yes Shawn, the BNS business as you know is now recorded in our discontinued operations. I would say it is broadly or generally performing as we expected through the sale process. In terms of proceeds, we have a practice or a capital requirement approach of $150 million to $250 million per quarter share repurchase. We did $252 million this most recently completed quarter. We expect to be in the market in the fourth quarter. Once the BNS transaction closes, that will be an additional $3 billion or that we\u2019ll be able to return the majority of that back to the shareholders. That\u2019s in addition to our appointment of our operating free cash flow.","Shawn Harrison","Okay, and then as a brief follow up, Tom as you could just remind us and I guess delineate between the content you have per vehicle in China versus say Europe, so the declines we\u2019re seeing in China auto production. Just to weight that a bit and how much of what you\u2019re seeing right now is truly declines in production versus some other factors in terms of maybe mix going against you.","Tom Lynch","I would say it\u2019s definitely production related. Our content in China is SubC. It\u2019s much higher in Europe, but there can be a mix effect that it\u2019s kind of interesting over any period of time that we look at, it just doesn\u2019t \u2013 the numbers are so big, its 80 some million cars being sold. With the math kind of almost moved itself out unless you had a pneumatic shift. I mean we were worried coming out of the last downturn that the world is going to go to buying small cars and that is going to have an impact on our content and we didn\u2019t see any of that. ","Now the exciting thing about China is content is growing faster in China cars, both local and multinational and how far in China right now are local SUVs where we have really no content and our content in China regardless of whether the local Chinese auto maker or multinationals, really almost exactly the same. In fact a little higher with the locals because we provide a little more to them than we would the OEM, which is a real strategic advantage that we started back in the downturn. ","So I guess the short answer Shawn is or the long answer is we are not really seeing that much impact. If at all its kind of in the $0.10 to $0.20 range of content per unit mix at this point.","Shawn Harrison","Very helpful Tom, thanks so much.","Sujal Shah","Right, thank you Shawn. Can we have the next question please?","Operator","The next question comes from Sherri Scribner from Deutsche Bank.","Sherri Scribner","Hi, thanks. I was curious \u2013 I don\u2019t know if I missed it, but did you give a number for global vehicle production in this quarter and then also could you give us some detail on how much China is as a percent of revenue for the three different segments. I know that Asia Pacific is about a third of your business, but maybe some metrics around how big China is by different segments would be helpful.","Tom Lynch","Sure. At a high level China is running in the 17%, 18% of our total business, that\u2019s total company. It\u2019s much higher than that in data and devices. Part of that is because most of the production is in China and it is sometimes hard to in those kind of businesses to where is consumption locally and where is consumption globally. Our auto business which runs over $1 billion is our local consumption.","Sherri Scribner","Okay.","Bob Hau","And then the other part of your question Sherri is that auto production volumes for the fourth quarter. Well, we have in our current guidance auto production for the fourth quarter globally, about $21 million vehicles, up about 2.5% year-over-year. That gets it to the 2% on a full year basis, just under $87 million vehicles.","Sherri Scribner","And did you have a 3Q number?","Bob Hau","3Q was down three-tenths of a percent, about 21.5 million, 21.7 million units.","Sherri Scribner","Okay. And then can I just ask the question about the transportation segment. I think your long term goal has been to grow that segment in the high single digits and it looks like we\u2019re tracking a little bit below that. This year I know there has been some puts and takes, but what\u2019s your view overall of the ability to continue to grow that segment in the high single digits. Thanks.","Tom Lynch","Thanks Sherri. I think at historical production levels of about 3% and the last three years is going to average out. If you take next year\u2019s estimates this year and last year, it\u2019s going to average out to about that. We would expect to do that, especially with our expansion into sensors which will go \u2013 we\u2019re kind of going from a very low base there. Yes, I think that production grows in that 3%. We expect to grow two plus ex production, which is what we\u2019re doing this year. ","So for example, this year production is growing 2% and we\u2019re growing 6% plus. So we still see it on hold and I think we really feel good about this year\u2019s performance, because it proves out what we\u2019ve been saying about the pipeline of wins that we\u2019ve had over the last four or five years and that we\u2019re growing our win rates faster than the market\u2019s growing and now that\u2019s showing up in kind of this multiplier production effect. ","So if you go back four or five years, we were always saying 1.5 times production and now we\u2019re over 2 times production and as we begin to ramp the sensors business over the next several years, that will increase it even more. So we feel very good about this great auto business of ours.","Bob Hau","I\u2019d say in the current quarter or to me the current year, we\u2019re definitely seeing the headwind from FX impacting the overall growth. If you back that out, transportation is well above the 6% to 8% and that\u2019s also got the benefit of the acquisition. Our guidance is mid single digits organically. That\u2019s below that 6% to 8% long term rate and that\u2019s really driven by slower commercial vehicle, both in heavy truck declines in the second half of this year and slower off road, but long term we still believe the 6% to 8%.","Sujal Shah","Thank you, Sherri. Can we have the next question please?","Operator","The next question comes from Jim Suva from Citi.","Jim Suva","Thank you very much. Congratulations to you and your team. On slide six of your prepared handouts entitled Industrial Solutions, I was taking a look at the operating margins. I know unless the questions have been focused on transportation, which is like I said, but kind of looking away from the other areas for the potential improvement, the operating margins for industrial solutions came down pretty meaningfully year-over-year and yes of course the actual and organic sales came down 5% to 1%, but the 100 basis point decline in operating margins is a pretty big gap. ","Can you talk just a little bit about that, because to me it seems like this is one area of meaningful improvement that you can give to the company and is it really tied now to sales for the future of this company or restructuring, are you doing some plant consolidation or how should we think about what actions your actively doing or would you simply tie the sales for improving this turnaround of this, several of which is below corporate average. ","Tom Lynch","Thank you, Jim. Well yes, the margin decline as we pointed out there is really two big factors, right. The oil and gas business is down 30%-plus and that\u2019s the highest margin business in the segment and FX and we have a strong European industrial footprint, particularly in energy and in industrial equipment and they are strong margin businesses, so particularly energy which has been slow, thus our equipment business actually has been pretty good. ","If you go through the make-up of the business and talk about who knows how long this oil and gas thing is going to last, but that team has managed to despite a 35% decline in revenue, keep the margin in solid double digits and the piece we bought, which is more in the service and support side than the new project side is still in the 20% plus range. ","So what I would say is our aerospace defense business is very strong, was there above company average margins. Our oil and gas are low right now, but again who knows when, but as that grows, that inherently because of its harshest environment characteristics and higher margin business. ","Industrial equipment is the one that\u2019s the big fragmented business that serves multiple industries, lots of small customers that we\u2019ve been steady improving. Growth slowed down a little bit right now, but that\u2019s where you are seeing us in the past and continuing to fine tune our manufacturing network. TEOA is especially important there in this slow volume high mix business. But those margins today are at about company average withholding it down right now, oil and gas and energy; energy because the Europe oil and gas is just something that happened in the market. ","We still believe and are committed to this, say above company average margin business. ","Jim Suva ","And for that pressure from oil and gas, you\u2019re just going to wait for it to come back or do you like proactively make some plant adjustments\u2026","Tom Lynch","We kept the margins in double digits by being very proactive. I mean super proactively, Bob you want to add on to that. ","Bob Hau","Jim, as I mentioned in my opening comments, we\u2019ve now increased our restructuring charge for $100 million. Part of that is communications, restructuring and part of that is oil and gas. So we\u2019ve definitely been taking action this year.","Jim Suva ","Okay, and then as a quick follow-up for the stock buyback you had mentioned that the BNS is looking to close about \u2013 I mean a little bit earlier than expected, within 90 days. Can you remind us and investors about your cadence or appetite for the stock buyback and time that you are going to do? I think it\u2019s about a $3 billion sales proceeds, and what timing that one should expect the stock buyback. It looks like the acquisition, divestiture is going to close a bit earlier. ","Bob Hau","Yes, so we had been indicating we expected that transaction to close by the end of the calendar year. We now see that closing within the next 90 days or so and as you indicate, its $3 billion of proceeds and we have said really since the date we announced the transaction back in January, that it would be \u2013 the vast majority of those proceeds would be used for share buyback and we have not indicated the specific timing of that. ","Jim Suva ","Great. Thank you very much. ","Sujal Shah","Great, thank you Jim. Can we have the next question please? ","Operator","The next question comes from Wamsi Mohan from BoA\/Merrill Lynch.","Ruplu Bhattacharya ","Yes, good morning. Its Ruplu filling in for Wamsi. Tom, just a high level question to start. Can you just give us your thoughts on the overall product portfolio? Are you done with the product exists that you were doing in the data and devices segment and overall is there any more opportunity to rationalize the product portfolio. ","A - Tom Lynch","I think the product portfolio is pretty solid right now, and I\u2019ll cover about a few exceptions for that comment. We are still rationalizing in data and devices. Our strategy there is to really focus on our core connectivity business, which is a good business for us and move out of what we\u2019ve now seen to be commodities and things like that, and that\u2019s going well and that\u2019s why you see such big declines in that business, because we are elegantly in treating our customers well, but existing those products. ","Across the rest of the portfolio, I think you will see more adding than subtracting. And whatever we do on the subtraction would be more fine turning around \u2013 hey we don\u2019t, this range is a commodity, it\u2019s not really strategic, we don\u2019t need it to sell other products, we don\u2019t want to put our energy into it. I would rather you know anything that widens this harsh environment mode and sensor business is where our inorganic and organic investments are going. If you see further exits, it will really be around the edges. ","Ruplu Bhattacharya ","Okay, thanks for that. And then just for my follow-up. You talked about the heavy truck market being weak in China. Can you talk about the other -geographies; are you seeing weakness in any other place apart from China in that market?","Tom Lynch","I think in North America as you know it\u2019s been a very hot market, the last couple of years. The growth rate is slowing but no surprise there, we\u2019ve all expected that. But we expect heavy trucks to continue to grow. We actually expect China to kind of rebound eventually. It\u2019s hard to call, but you went through a nice surge with the adoption of Euro 4 and really, the government really drove that hard. ","So at a period where trucks were going down and content was going way up, and there has been a little shift in China to smaller trucks, but we believe with all the infrastructure building over there that\u2019s going on, that will swing back to larger trucks which are much more efficient and there is a lot of opportunity in China to improve the transportation of goods industry, and that play to our strength, because that\u2019s more content. ","So I think in a little bit longer term, probably hopefully late next year you will start to see China pick-up. The U.S. continues to be okay and Europe has been pretty solid. The challenge in the industrial transportation market has been off-road. As we know the agriculture, industry has been really not investing due to where foreign prices are and you have the commodity industry, you have the spillover effect of oil prices down. So construction, although is mixed, it\u2019s starting to level off. All those industries have been a drag over the last few years. ","So what I think will happen over time is you will see those industries begin to recovery because of pent up demand. You will get a lower growth rate in heavy trucks and this business will over time return to kind of a low single digit production growth rate, which is very attractive for us because we have so much content and we\u2019ve grown our content so much over the last couple of years. ","Ruplu Bhattacharya ","Thanks. I appreciate the color. ","Sujal Shah","Thank you, Ruplu. Can we have the next question please? ","Operator","The next question comes from Matt Sheerin from Stifel. ","Matt Sheerin","Yes thanks. Most of the questions have been answered, but I did want to go back to the commentary about the distribution inventory correction that seems to be going on. Could you give us a sense of what you are seeing on a sell in basis versus sellout and expectations for where do you think investors are going to go and what do inventory days look like at distribution now versus where they should be. ","Tom Lynch","Days are up a little bit, but I think it\u2019s more single digit in days and my conversation with the distributors again I think everybody has been managing it, we are all managing it much better than we did over the last time around because of what we\u2019ve learnt. ","So I mean clearly the first half, we had nice growth in our sell-in in the first half and sell through was pretty solid too, but we began to see late second quarter early Q3 sell through began to slow a big and that\u2019s when the inventories began to build a little bit and I think we were like lets jump on this quickly and get things in balance. ","So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big horrendous deal, but it\u2019s enough to have our third quarter being slightly down in the change and probably our fourth quarter relatively flat, but that\u2019s why we think the coming into Q1 sell through and inventory levels are back to where they should be. Again, I don\u2019t \u2013 it\u2019s not a major disruption, but it is a fine tuning which I think is good, just because it\u2019s so good when it\u2019s happening, because you are selling that. But I think it is good because the system is more in balance. ","Matt Sheerin","Okay, that\u2019s helpful and just a quick question for Bob. Your share count assumption for the quarter in your guidance, what\u2019s that?","Bob Hau","So we expect that in fourth quarter we\u2019ll continue with that, between $150 million to $250 million range, so call it 1 million or 2 million share reduction in the quarter.","Matt Sheerin","Okay, thanks a lot guys. ","Sujal Shah","All right, thank you Matt. Can we have the next question please? ","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Wood from Macquarie Securities Group. ","Mike Wood","Hi, thanks for all the information. [Indiscernible] to breakout the SubCom charge is what you are trying to do with increasing margins in the mobile device sub segment. Can you just give us more color of what\u2019s happening in those two sub markets? ","Tom Lynch","The sub segments are data in devices Mike. ","Mike Wood","So yes, SubCom end is on the mobile device side where you are exiting some lower margin product. How successful are you in getting that margin up in the mobile device side. ","Tom Lynch","Yes, so on the mobile, we would call it data and device business. If we combine those businesses, we announced that earlier in the year because customers are converging, technologies are becoming more similar and frankly we needed to reduce costs in those two businesses, which are our two weakest business. ","So we are still in the turnaround. I think we have some good wins, we have some losses. I don\u2019t think there is enough there to say from a market perspective we are changing our position. We are changing our cost structure and we are getting back into the product range which we do best, kind of core connector clientage for the board type of connector power connectors, where we are very good and that we want to put a lion\u2019s share of our energy around. ","So it\u2019s still in the kind of midway through the turnaround I would say, stabilizing but not exciting from a profitability point of view. We still have work to do to reestablish the growth and get the margins up to double digit. ","On the SubCom side as Bob mentioned seems steady progress in the market. We continue to have a high win rate. There continues to be a lot of bid activity. The cloud players are very active in this. So that, we pointed out before, that\u2019s a big change from the primary drivers were before. But fundamentally we think it\u2019s a good change, because there is a tremendous desire for high quality service and plenty of bandwidth, because that\u2019s so integral for the total value proposition of those players. So we think that\u2019s a fundamentally good driver and backlog now for $1.5 billion. ","So I would say, we continue to see more approved points that we are in the uptick site. We are feeling good, pretty good through \u201916. You got to keep knocking off several wins a year control the pipeline, but overall we feel good that, \u2018Sure, SubCom is on the way back up and we are getting our arms around the date and devices business from a strategy and a cost structure. We can see, this where we want to be. ","Mike Wood","Great and then on MES it seems like if I back into the numbers it would roughly similar contribution versus last quarter to the segment. Has that seen any impact yet from China? I believe China was just under 20% of sales and is that expected of any is there any restructuring actions taking off at that weakness. ","Bob Hau","I would say, I\u2019d call it a consistent quarter. Although certainly we are going to see is China in general slows down. We\u2019ll see an impact but not significant and overall, growing very nicely organically as I mentioned. Our sensors business, if we had owned AST and measurement this quarter last year, that business grew 10%. So certainly seeing some nice growth overall. ","Tom Lynch","I would say in China, sensors are not as established in the vehicles over there, so particularly in the local vehicles. So you have kind of a more, an additional demand for that in order to become competitive, you need to put more features in. So we feel that\u2019s an extra demand driver and the only per say restructuring that\u2019s going on is where we are combining for scale. We are not doing in response to market conditions, oh! Its growing slower so we are taking part of that.","We are investing in the businesses as I said from that perspective, so that we can win more deals and growth faster. ","Mike Wood","Great, thank you. ","Sujal Shah","Okay, thank you. Can we have the next question please? ","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Steven Fox from Cross Research. ","Steven Fox","Thanks. Just one question for me. I\u2019m just a little confused still by the increase in the restructuring charges understanding what you just said. But you expressed a lot of positive statements around the harsh environments in general, but you are downsizing oil and gas. And then along the same lines your are doing some product pruning, which I would has been an ongoing effort for a number of years. I\u2019m just curious how that \u2013 what that has to do with restructuring and whether that was also in response to end markets. Thanks. ","Tom Lynch","Yes Jim, I\u2019ll let Bob add to this too. Oil and gas is adjusting to the 35% decline in the business and the natural uncertainty about everything that\u2019s going on around oil, which does a run come back in, when do oil prices go up, etc\u2026 ","The remainder of the increase is related to kind of the phase of, accelerating the phase of data and device. So that\u2019s what is related to. We are really not restructuring in any other business, Bob. ","Bob Hau","Yes, the vast majority of our restructuring to-date and will be for the year is in the communication segment and in oil and gas in particular. Oil and gas last year was at $300 million business. We are going to exist a $200 million clip. That really calls for some pretty significant restructuring and then data and devices in combination of the product exits that we\u2019ve really been underway for call it, 12 to 18 months and closer into that 12 months, plus the combination of the old Datacom and the consumer business drove us to take some additional costs out. But we are not taking our costs in our harsh environment growing to your other question, Mike\u2019s question on measurement, we are not talking out cost where we\u2019ve got growth opportunity. ","Steven Fox","Understood and then just real quick. I understand the need to sort of keep your plans for a buyback close to your, best for now. But I mean when the closes can we expect some kind of signals around how you plan to execute or use that $3 billion in proceeds or is this sort of going to be statuesque and learn about sort of on a backward looking basis. ","Tom Lynch","I think one of the hallmarks of TE has been some pretty good transparency and once the deal closes and we get into the activity, we\u2019ll give you some color about what our expectations are. ","Operator","And our last question comes from the line of William Stein from SunTrust. ","William Stein","Thanks for taking my follow-up. So with the pull-in of the timing of the BNS sale, can you just highlight to us what the regulatory approvals that you are still waiting on are and with regard to the $3 billion consideration, understanding that you\u2019ve told us that you expect to use the majority for buybacks, would you consider another acquisition potentially in the sensory area. At the Analyst Day you were \u2013 the company I would say was still constructive on its intention to acquire in that space and I wonder if think could be an opportunity to readdress that. Thank you.","Tom Lynch","Well, let me address the second part of that question. I think that the strength of the company is our strong cash flow, a really strong capital structure, strong operating leverage and all that provides choices, right. So we clearly have an active M&A pipeline, sensors and harsh environment are very important to us and where we get the right opportunity to strengthen those businesses we would see them. Of course it has to be at the price that we think fits with our strategy and our return goals. ","So yes, I mean the bottom line is we can do both. That\u2019s really the simple method, we can do both. And if you look back the last few years that\u2019s what we have done. We bought MES, we bought AST, we did a significant buyback. I think that\u2019s really one of the strengths of TE. ","Bob Hau","And then in terms of the timing well, we pulled it in a bit from end of the calendar year to now within 90 days. We have really three large regulatory hurdles; U.S., Europe and China. We have U.S. and Europe, so we are awaiting China and of course there are a number of other countries that have the right and obligation to weigh in. But it\u2019s really those big three and of course then where comp stocks in the midst of integration planning that we are helping them with, obviously and let them comment on that progression, but it really is at this point a regulatory hurdle with China. ","William Stein","Great, thanks very much. ","End of Q&A ","Sujal Shah","All right. Thank you, Will. If you have follow-up questions please contract Investor Relations at TE. Thank you for joining us this morning, and have a great day. Thanks everybody. ","Tom Lynch ","Thank you. ","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference today.

Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the TE Connectivity Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Keith Kolstrom. Please go ahead.","Keith Kolstrom","Good morning, and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss TE Connectivity's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2013 results. With me today are Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Lynch; and Chief Financial Officer, Bob Hau..","During the course of this call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information, and we ask you to review the forward-looking cautionary statements included in today's press release.","In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussion this morning, and we ask you to review the sections of our press release and the accompanying slide presentation that address the use of these items.","The press release and related tables, along with the slide presentation, can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at te.com. [Operator Instructions] .","Now let me turn the call over to Tom for some opening comments.","Thomas J. Lynch","Thanks, Keith and good morning, everyone. This was a very good quarter for the company and we capped the year of strong performance in an uncertain economy. Q4 is especially noteworthy for several reasons. Our organic growth was 3.3% and the company returned to growth for the first time since early last year as continued strength in our Transportation Solutions segment was augmented with growth in our Industrial Solutions segment and then our Telecom Networks and Appliances businesses.","Quarters excluding our SubCom business, grew 6% in the quarter and the strength was broad-based in terms of end market and region. Our $0.93 per share is a new earnings record for TE and it's up 22% versus the same quarter last year.","We delivered 15.7% adjusted operating margin at a run rate of less than $14 billion in annual revenue. We did have a very favorable mix in the quarter but adjusting to more normal mix our margins were still above 15%. Our efforts to driving lean across the company, which is our TE operating advantage program are really paying off with customer satisfaction and margin improvement and we'll have more to come on this at our Investor Day in November.","For the third consecutive year, we were selected at the top 100 innovator by Thomson Reuters. 5 years ago, we stepped up and refocused our renovation efforts and we have a terrific product pipeline and a wide range of intellectual property that should fuel our growth for several years to come. And we had another strong cash flow quarter, and for the year delivered $1.5 billion in free cash flow, our sixth consecutive year of 10% or better cash flow yield on revenue.","For the year just ended, we increased adjusted earnings per share by 13% on sales, which were relatively flat. The team did a great job of delivering cost savings and productivity to more than offset the impact of a slow economy.","I'm also very pleased with the integration of the Deutsch acquisition. The markets for Industrial Transportation and Commercial Aircraft are strong and we expect to deliver the sales and cost synergy ahead of the acquisition plan.","As expected, Deutsch has added great products and people at TE. I'm also very pleased that we generated adjusted net income in excess of 10% for the year, and as I mentioned earlier, we are converting these strong earnings into strong cash flow.","During FY '13, we returned $1.2 billion in capital to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. In fiscal year '14, we expect to return over $1 billion in capital shareholders -- in capital to shareholders, and as shown in our press release earlier this morning, our board has recently approved an increase of $1 billion to our share repurchase authorization.","Now please turn to Slide 4. Total company sales were $3.43 billion and were up 3% organically versus the prior year. The sales increase was driven by continued strength in the Transportation segment and improving demand in the industrial and telecom businesses.","Please turn to Slide 5, and I'll review our segment performance. Unless I indicate otherwise, all changes are on an organic basis, which excludes the effect of currencies, acquisitions and divestitures. We had another outstanding quarter in our Transportation business. Sales were $1.4 billion, up 10%, and adjusted operating margins were again over 19% and in line with our expectation. Global automotive production was up approximately 4% to 19.6 million units with strength in the U.S. and China. European demand continues to be soft but does appear to be stabilizing.","We also continue to see improvements in the heavy truck markets in several geographies. The Deutsch acquisition positions us very strongly in this high end harsh connectivity market.","The strong operating margin performance is due to the increased revenue, continued productivity improvements coupled with a very lean footprint and the strong performance in our commercial vehicle business. We expect another strong quarter in Q1, with revenues up about 10% versus the prior year on an expected vehicle production increase of about 3%.","Please turn to Slide 6. Sales and earnings in our Industrial Solutions segment were better than expected due to stronger end market demand and favorable product and channel mix. Importantly, we had a strong ordered growth -- we had strong order growth for the second quarter in a row, a solid growth in every region. On a year-over-year basis, sales were up 2% and orders increased 10%. Book-to-bill was 0.96. Orders were especially strong in the commercial Aerospace and Industrial Equipment markets. Energy was up 7%.","In the first quarter, we expect sales to be up mid-to-high single digits versus the prior year with Industrial Equipment up close to 10% and Aerospace and Defense and Energy up low to mid-single digits. Continued strength in our commercial Aerospace business is more than offsetting lower spending on Defense program.","Sales and earnings in our Network Solutions business were little better than guidance. Within this segment, orders and sales continued to improve in our Telecom Networks business, which is the business where we provide the connectivity for the broadband network for telecom carriers and cable operators. Across the world, we are seeing a gradual pick up in fiber rich broadband network deployment. This improvement was offset by continued weakness in our DataComm equipment business.","In our SubCom business, project activity continues to be robust and funding continues to be slow. Revenue in the quarter was in line with expectation but the return to the growth cycle looks to be in the second half.","For the segment overall in Q1, we expect a slight decline in revenue as the weaknesses of SubCom and DataComm more than offset the growth in the telecom business.","Please turn to Slide 8. Sales in the Consumer Solutions segment were down 5% versus the prior year. The continuation of declines in the PC market and a slowdown in the growth in smart phone and tablets more than offset our growth in our appliances business. In Q1, we expect sales to be down mid-single digits as growth in appliances is offset by continued softness in the Consumer Devices business.","I'm going to turn it over to Bob who's going to cover the financials in more detail.","Robert W. Hau","Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. Let me discuss earnings, which start on Slide 9. Our GAAP operating income for the quarter was $465 million, which includes restructuring charges of $71 million and acquisition related charges of $3 million.","Restructuring charges were $311 million for the year, which was higher than our $275 million guidance. Given the progress we made on projects already announced, we implemented additional items that we originally expected to occur in fiscal 2014.","In fiscal 2014, we anticipate a substantial reduction in the level of restructuring activity with charges of approximately $50 million. Adjusted operating income was $539 million with an adjusted operating margin of 15.7%, up 220 basis points from Q4 last year.","The improvement is driven by 3% organic sales, productivity from TEOA and benefit of accelerated restructuring. As Tom mentioned, we did benefit from a favorable mix in the quarter.","Adjusted EPS were $0.93 and GAAP EPS were $0.92 for the quarter. GAAP EPS included $0.13 of restructuring and other charges and $0.12 of income related to tax items.","Turning to Slide 10. Our adjusted gross margin in the quarter was 33.7%, which was a record level for the company. This is a 190 basis point increase versus the prior year, largely due to continued progress in our TEOA or lean programs driving increased productivity with reductions in both material and conversion costs and improved profitability related to the integration of Deutsch.","Total OpEx spending was $617 million in the quarter, which is flat versus the prior year despite sales being up 3% organically.","On the right side of the page, net interest expense was $30 million for the fourth quarter and I expect approximately $31 million of expense in the first quarter with a decline of about $1 million per quarter as we move through the year in 2014.","Adjusted other income, which relates to our tax sharing agreement was $7 million and largely in line with guidance. The adjusted effective tax rate was 23.8%, also in line with guidance.","In the first quarter, I expect other income of about $8 million per quarter dropping to about $6 million per quarter for the remainder of the fiscal year. And expect the tax rate of 24% to 25% throughout fiscal year.","Now turning to Slide 11, I'll discuss our balance sheet and free cash flow. Cash from continuing operations was $595 million and our free cash flow in Q4 was $412 million. Full year free cash flow was $1.5 billion.","Capital spending during the quarter was $183 million or about 5% of sales. This is consistent with our anticipated spending rate of approximately 4% to 5% of sales going forward.","Receivable days outstanding were 61 days and inventory days on hand were 68 days, both metrics remain in line with our expectations.","Now let me discuss the sources and uses of cash outside of free cash flow shown on the right side of the slide.","You see we began the quarter with $1.3 billion of cash and ended the quarter with about $1.4 billion. During the quarter, we returned a total of $313 million to shareholders. We paid dividends of $103 million and repurchased about 4.2 million shares for $210 million. We expect additional share repurchases of $150 million to $250 million per quarter during fiscal 2014 consistent with the 2013 levels.","Outstanding debt was $3 billion at the end of the quarter.","On October 18, we filed the press release calling for the redemption of all the outstanding 5.95% senior notes, which were to mature on January 15, 2014. The slightly earlier redemption is part of our normal cash management. And while no decisions have been finalized regarding replacement of this debt, I do not expect our capital structure to change from the redemption and continue to expect that levels to be about $3 billion.","Now I'll turn it back to Tom.","Thomas J. Lynch","Thanks, Bob. Please turn to Slide 12 and I'll cover our outlook.","As I mentioned earlier, we've seen solid improvements in our order rates over the last couple of quarters in most of the end markets we serve. And although the overall global economy feels like it has more momentum than it did this time last year, though, there's clearly still uncertainty given slow job growth, the weak economy in Europe and an unsettled U.S. government budget.","When we take all these trends into consideration, this is our guidance for Q1. In Q1, which is our seasonally slowest quarter of the year, we expect organic sales growth of 4% to 7% and adjusted earnings per share growth of 14% to 20%. At the midpoint of the guidance, adjusted EPS would be $0.76, an increase of 17%. I feel like this is a really good start to our new year.","In Q1, we expect continued strong performance in our Transportation and Industrial businesses with high single-digit year-over-year growth. We expect our Network Solutions segment to be down slightly as improving conditions in the telecom network marks -- -networks market are offset by the softness in our DataComm business and continued project delays in SubCom.","We expect our Consumer Solutions business to be down mid-to-high single digits as Q4 trends continue into Q1.","Please turn to Slide 13. Now for our full year guidance. Based on these current trends, we expect our organic revenue growth in fiscal '14 to be in the range of 3% to 7%. We do expect the continuation of solid demand in the Transportation and Industrial markets as well is in the Appliances and Telecom Infrastructure markets. We expect continued softness in our SubCom business as contracts coming into the force remains low until at least the second half of the year and we expect our Consumer Devices business to be about flat.","We expect to continue our execution momentum and to deliver adjusted earnings per share in the range of $3.50 to $3.80, which is about a 13% year-over-year increase at the midpoint of our guidance range. This improvement is driven by organic sales growth, another year of strong productivity and the increased benefits of restructuring.","At the midpoint of our guidance, we expect to deliver 15% adjusted operating margins for the full year at $13.9 billion of revenue. We also expect a significant reduction in restructuring charges as our footprint is much improved.","Overall, this was an excellent quarter, a very solid year of earnings and sales growth -- and our cash growth and I feel good about our momentum entering fiscal '14. I'm confident that if the global economy continues to recover, we are well positioned to deliver attractive sales and earnings growth.","Now let's open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Amit Daryanani, representing RBC Capital Markets.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Two questions for me. One, maybe you could just talk a little bit on the December quarter guide. I think sales, you're implying will be down about 4%, so call it $160 million, $165 million down sequentially. but if I'm run the math and EPS implies that operating income will be down $190 million or so. That suggests detrimental margins of 50% plus, so will you talk about why is such a severe decline or detrimental margin in the December quarter and then maybe you can give us comfort on why you see them expanding to getting out of 15% by year-end.","Robert W. Hau","Thanks, Amit. First, regarding the sales guide. As I mentioned, this is always our seasonally lowest quarter, so we will typically see a 4% to 5% sequential decline in revenue. It is a little higher fall off in operating income but that's not unusual either, because we typically -- what always happens in this quarter is you hit the holiday, you have less work days so your productivity and efficiency suffers a little disproportionately. And on top of that we come off what is typically a very strong quarter when we're running all out at the end of September. So if you look at how we pattern from last year, first half second half, almost exactly the same pattern. So no real difference there, that's why I'm confident that the sales growth and margin, particularly the margin growth through the second, third and fourth quarter and 15% is the -- I feel confident about achieving that.","Fair enough. that's all. But let me just ask you a question about the Transportation side. If I look at the September results and also the December guide, looks like the Transportation business is up about 10% year-over-year organically in both quarters. If I looked at the lower production numbers, that's up about 3%. So I guess, it seems you are seeing about a 7% content growth for September and December, net of ASP erosion . Could you to tackle why you're seeing such a big acceleration on the content growth and could that perhaps sustain for the next several quarters as well?","Thomas J. Lynch","Yes. I don't think it's -- there's any sudden change in content growth. But I think it's a couple of things. One, we continue to do well around the globe and are growing in every market. And believe we continue to move up our market shares. Secondly, the Industrial Transportation business is very strong with the heavy truck market. And that's a pretty high end market for us. So that's also lifting our growth rates.","Operator","Our next question today comes from line of Mike Wood with Macquarie.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Research","I wonder if you could comment in terms of the range of possible outcomes for SubC sales next year. In the context of $90 million next quarter, which would be at like a mid-$300 million run rate, and obviously you've talked about the robust pipeline. So what visibility do you have there in terms of the timing, potential downside, potential upside?","Thomas J. Lynch","Thanks, Mike. Right now, I'd say SubCom feels flat year-over-year but the second half is hard to call. I think there's probably more upside than downside based on the project pipeline and when we map the extent of this project pipeline to prior years, we know all projects will not come into force but if we look at the typical come into force rate, we would expect to see things starting to pick up in the second half and as we watch projects move through their funding process. That's where we'd expect though -- first quarter is pretty much what the first quarter is going to be. Second quarter is probably going to be close to that. Hopeful that the second half picks up and these contracts that we won come into force.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Research","Great. And then if can you comment also on the Transportation segment follow-up to that last question. Next year in terms of your vehicle production guide, you have more of a contribution from Europe than you had in your projection for this quarter and 1Q? What's the impact on TEL in terms of that greater contribution from Europe from a content standpoint, your out performance versus the global vehicle production?","Thomas J. Lynch","Well Europe definitely has higher content. And Europe, you really have to break it down. On the surface, which is the local demand for cars in Europe, that's been weak. But particularly, the German OEMs, they've been strong as they export quite a bit and that's where we are strongest. So we don't see a dramatic change there. We see a slight improvement in Europe for us. So there's no big swing in our numbers based on Europe.","Operator","Next we'll go to the line of Matt Sheerin with Stifel Nicolaus.","Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Looking at your margin guidance for FY '14, a 15%. Could you talk about the drivers? You have got 2 segments -- consumer and the Networking business you're guiding sort of flattish, you're coming off of peak margins in the Transportation business. What are the drivers in terms of margin expansion within the different segments particularly in the businesses that are guiding flat?","Robert W. Hau","Yes, Mike, this is Bob. Across the board in 2014, we're seeing improvement in operating margin from all 4 of our segments. As you know, we had significant restructuring activity is 2013 and we see the benefits coming through into 2014. We've indicated about a $100 million at exit. Into 2015, we'll see that $400 million. In our 2014 numbers, you have probably between $60 million and $70 million of operating income improvement from those restructuring activities. And of course, we continued down the path of lean and our TEOA activity. So all 4 of our segments, obviously, participating in that where we have the good top line growth obviously in our Transportation business and Industrial where we're seeing mid-to-high single digit growth, we'll get some nice volume leverage in our Industrial and Consumer business -- I mean, our Consumer and Networks businesses where they're a little bit more flattish, margin improvement will be harder to come by.","Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And Tom, on the DataComm, the commentary continues to be cautious there. Do you see any signs of life going into fiscal '14 and if you think it's going to remain flat and down year-over-year. Are you looking at additional cost savings in that business?","Thomas J. Lynch","I would say it's going to be down, but most of the decline is because we exited some very low-end business this year. When you take that out, we're going to be slightly down. I think that's mostly just the slow market. But we're in the middle of the pack player there. That business has gone through a lot of restructuring over the last year, so I don't anticipate any significant additional restructuring there. Never say never, but we stepped up to that about 6 to 9 months ago.","Operator","Our next question today comes from the line of Shawn Harrison with Longbow Research.","Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC","Just following up on Matt's question on the margin targets. It's just, would you be willing, Bob, just kind of give a may be a range where you think each of the 4 segments could be for the year in terms of EBIT margin?","Robert W. Hau","I don't want to get into guidance by segment but I think the key -- and I've mentioned this in the previous answer, if you look at the volume growth overall top revenue Transportation, Industrial being kind of mid-to-high single digits Transportation, obviously stronger than Industrial but in general, nice improvement. That's where we're going to see the higher lift from a year-over-year standpoint. Consumer Solutions and network, we're seeing real benefits from the restructuring actions that we took in 2013 and continued improvement in new products have higher margins but without the volume lift you're not going to get dramatic improvement in the operating margin. Now obviously overall, I'm doing very well grown from the 14.2% we had this year to 15% next year. But clearly, Transportation and Industrial are doing majority of the heavy lifting given the volume.","Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC","Got you. I guess on the restructuring savings, maybe another way to come with that question is on that $70 million -- or $60 million to $70 million expect of restructuring savings to fall on the '14, how much of that is Networks versus Industrial versus consumer?","Thomas J. Lynch","Probably the easiest way to think about that is if you look at where the investment went to $300 million, roughly between networks and consumer, 70% of the spending were in those 2 businesses. So you'll see that majority of the benefit in those 2 businesses. 40% networks and about 30% consumer.","Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC","Got you. Got you, that's helpful. Then just as a follow-up. I guess, with commodities being down, how much of a tailwind from commodities you're baking in on a dollar basis to your '14 numbers?","Thomas J. Lynch","Commodity is definitely helping on a year-over-year basis, you have to be a little cautious, number one, there's a lot of the year left and our commodities still move. Additionally, with our hedging program that benefit feathers in over time. But on a full year basis, if commodities were to hold where they're at today, there's probably $45 million to $50 million of tailwind for us on a full year basis.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Jim Suva with Citi.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","When we think about the outlook, just to be clear I assume that the stock buyback, I think you said $150 million to $250 million per quarter is built into your EPS guidance. And then also, am I correct that you are not building any potential acquisition so if you can talk about that a little bit because it seems like you past acquisitions are progressing better than historical and some of your peers do a lot of acquisitions. Are you now looking at the point where we should expect TEL to start a little bit more aggressive on acquisitions?","Thomas J. Lynch","Yes, Jim. We have baked in the share repurchase at that $150 million to $250 million range, the range of repurchasing we had in '13 and we plan to continue that per quarter going into 2014, so that's baked in, a modest improvement in the shares outstanding minus reduction. In terms of acquisitions, we have not baked into our guidance any acquisitions we may or may not do into 2014. Obviously, if we were to conclude any acquisitions in the year, we've revised our guidance to that point.","Robert W. Hau","Just adding onto that regarding M&A. We have a robust pipeline. But as you know, we're pretty thoughtful about it. We really focus on strategic fit. But I would expect and we desire to continue to round out our product line and our overall connectivity portfolio. It's a big market. We have the broadest product line but we're not satisfied yet. So we're always looking, but we don't build that into our outlook.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great. And as a quick follow-up, there's been some indications that the Australia fiber build out has been slowing down here, as well as some changes in China. Is that incorporated into your guidance, did you put in some conservatism there for it, and how should we think about those recent trends that are happening into those area, which once were a very highly attractive area and very robust outlook?","Thomas J. Lynch","I would say Australia for sure is still -- are very attractive. what's going on there, as you know, the changing government, they've got to sort through how they want to build the broadband network. The prior government was fiber to the home. This is more like fiber to the node. In both cases it's a lot more fiber in and a lot more broadband in the country had today. So it could affect us, $10 million, $15 million a year is our estimate right now, which we have included in our guidance. So we don't see -- I mean things could change, but we're not getting any indication and we're very close to the organization down there. On China, we are being [audio gap] in China, it's where we play in the network, it's a business you need to be selective in. I would say generally, this is reflected in our guidance, the market hasn't been as attractive as we saw a couple of years ago, a lot of competition, a lot of low-end competition, so much like we do on our energy business in the market like China. We're selective in playing were quality and reliability really matters. But from our telecom perspective, that business has been a slow business for us. The opposite side of the road on automotive so to speak, which has been, it continues to be a booming business for us.","Operator","A question today comes from the line of Mark Delaney of Goldman Sachs.","Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I was hoping you could help us, remind us about what your exposure is to the European market and I think there is some green shoots in the Automotive business and than maybe even in Telecom as we look into the 2014. So are you seeing any positive indications in Europe and can you help us think about how much TE might benefit from that?","Robert W. Hau","About a third of our business is done in Europe. The biggest part of that is Automotive. And a pretty significant portion of that business, 20% to 30% is exported out. So it's a little murky to walk through. But in general, we're strong in all our businesses in Europe and that has depressed our growth rates over the past 2 years but we have a strong, profitable businesses there, our best businesses, Automotive which as I indicated is continue to be a good business because of the export base. Our strongest Energy market is in Europe, which has been a slow this year, very slow, but we're starting to see signs of picking up. We have a pretty sizable telecom business in Europe, which is not very fiber rich yet. So we're encouraged about the prospects for that and we are seeing some green shoots so to speak in some areas of accelerated fiber build out. And our largest industrial equipment business is in Europe, which has been slow but is also, as we mentioned in overall Industrial business, showing signs of stabilizing and picking up. So I'd categorize Europe end market demand as being feeling a little bit better, but off of a low base. So it's nothing to get gleeful over yet but the stabilizing is the way it looks.","Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. For my follow-up, can you guys just clarify on the restructuring benefits that you assume for fiscal '14, I know a $60 million to $70 million -- is that the $60 million to $70 million of benefit that you got for fiscal '14 overall or as you exit fiscal '14 you will be getting to $60 million to $70 million on a run rate basis?","Robert W. Hau","The $60 million to $70 million is for the full year. We'll exit a bit higher and what we've said is $100 million plus benefit into 2015 once we hit that full run rate.","Operator","And we have a question from the line of William Stein with SunTrust Robinson.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","I'm wondering if you can comment on the cash flow outlook for next year with the lower restructuring charge. How does that affect cash?","Robert W. Hau","Thanks, Will. I think we're going to continue to generate cash at around the net income level. So I'd say it's in that 14, plus or minus. I do expect some CapEx to increase year-over-year and restructuring charges are down but restructuring spending is about flat. So and the early stages of restructuring our cash outflow lags our charges and that eventually, it catches up. Bob, I don't know if you want to add on to that.","Robert W. Hau","Yes, the charges that you see or saw in 2013, that's $300 million plus, the cash flow is out really over 3 years, simply the majority of it is in 2013 and 2014. '14 it's up slightly, but not significant one.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And then if I can just hit the margins, I know there has been a lot of discussion on this. It's like Transportation at a very strong level going higher and certainly for the company, you just go blew through the 15% target nicely in the quarter. How we think about aggregate to the operating line, and then is there a significant delta from 1 segment to the next with regards to the drop through?","Robert W. Hau","I'd say relative to the relationships of the businesses, Transportation and Industrial, which are a long cycle highly engineered, harsh environment businesses, which honestly is that we do best at, have a higher flow through than the Consumer, which is the other end of the spectrum where you need volume particularly in devices to get flow-through and volumes has been intermittent for us there. Networks is sort of the mix. Our Telecom Networks business, again, highly engineered products and harsh environment, high flow-through. So you'll typically get higher flow-through in Industrial and then Transportation and Telecom networks.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. [Operator Instructions]","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just have a quick follow-up guys. Regarding the capital allocation, Tom, I think you mentioned at the onset of the call that you expect to return $1 billion back to shareholders. But if I do my math, at least at the midpoint of the buyback on that $150 million to $250 million range that would be $800 million alone and in your dividend policy, I think it's a little over $400 million. That would put you all up to $1.2 billion, I think. So does that imply that maybe the buybacks would be at the lower in the $150 million to $250 million range or do I just mishear the $1 billion comment initially?","Thomas J. Lynch","I said $1 billion, but it's early in the year. Last year was the year of no M&A, to be determined what happens this year. Well I think, think of that as what we see right now, that's what is the most likely range. What happened this year as we progress through the year, there were no M&A opportunities that made sense to us, so we increased the buyback. That could happen again or if we see the right opportunities that are strategic and help us strengthen the company and increase our growth rate, we'll go in that direction. But at this point, I'd say a $1 billion is the way to think about it in total.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So that, I guess, Tom, that would imply the buyback would be $150 million a quarter then, right?","Robert W. Hau","Amit, actually the comment on the script was over $1 billion, so I mean, again, it's early in the year so.","Thomas J. Lynch","If you were to take it literally in a $1 billion, it would be at the low-end.","Amitabh Passi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got it. So the way to think about it is at minimum it is going to be $150 million, and as you ramp through the year, and if you don't find or don't do enough deals, you can ratchet it up higher much as you did in fiscal '13?","Thomas J. Lynch","That's correct.","Operator","And speakers, nobody else is queued up at this time.","Thomas J. Lynch","Thanks, everyone for calling in. Just one reminder. Our Investor Day, the first one in 2 years is in New York on November 19 and we look forward to hopefully seeing all of you there.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode.  Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session.  (Operator Instructions).","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Keith Kolstrom, Vice President Investor Relations.  Please go ahead.","Keith Kolstrom \u2013 VP, IR","","Thank you, good morning, and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss TE Connectivity's fourth quarter 2012 results. With me today is our Chief Executive Officer, Tom Lynch and our Chief Financial Officer, Bob Hau.","During the course of this call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information and we ask you to review the forward-looking cautionary statements included in today's press release.  ","In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussion this morning and we ask you to review the sections of our press release and the accompanying slide presentation that addresses the use of these items. The press release and related tables along with the slide presentation can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at TE.com.  ","Finally, for participants on the Q&A portion of today's call, I would like to remind everyone to limit themselves to one follow-up question to make sure we are able to cover all questions during the allotted time.","Now let me turn the call over to Tom for some opening comments.","Thomas J. Lynch","","Thanks, Keith, and good morning everyone.  Please turn to slide three and we'll get started. ","We had a pretty solid Q4, delivering sales of 3.4 billion, adjusted earnings per share of $0.76 and free cash flow of 569 million.  Our operating performance was in line with our guidance.  And are adjusted EPS benefitted by $0.02 due to a lower tax rate.  ","Our Transportation business had another strong quarter, while our CIS and Networks businesses continued to experience soft markets as expected.","Overall, I consider this to be a quarter of good execution.  Our adjusted operating margin at 13.5% during the quarter and ran just under 14% during the second half of the year despite the fact our Networks business continues to be in a very weak part of the cycle.  ","Our overall business is now running at a full-year adjusted operating margin of 13 to 14% at the $13 to $14 billion revenue range.  So I feel good about the improvement in our operating leverage.  However, in this uncertain and slow economic environment, it's also clear that we need to reduce our costs further.  I'll touch on this in more detail later in the call.","During the quarter, we resumed our share repurchase program and bought back 5.5 million shares spending just under $200 million.  ","Integration of Deutsch is proceeding very well.  And the touch in services business \u2013 divestitures are complete.   With these changes, we have a very strong and focused connectivity portfolio.  ","For the full year, sales were 13.3 billion, down 3% organically versus fiscal 2011.  Adjusted EPS was $2.86, also down 3% versus the 52-week fiscal 2011.  Free cash flow was 1.43 billion, up 7% versus the prior year.  And operating cash flow was right around 2 billion.  ","I'm especially pleased about our free cash flow performance, which has been strong and consistent over our first five years despite what has been, at times, a volatile and uncertain economic environment.  This is certainly one of our most important strengths in the company.  ","Now, if you could please turn to slide four.  Total company sales of 3.36 billion were down 3% versus the 13-week prior year quarter and also down 3% on an organic basis.  Currency translation, primarily due to the weaker euro, negatively impacted year-on-year growth by about 400 basis points or 155 million.  The Deutsch acquisition contributed $153 million in revenue. ","On an organic basis, in Asia, our revenue was up slightly.  Automotive continued to be strong across the region, offsetting demand softness in our CIS businesses.  Within CIS, the industrial equipment market was especially soft.  On the positive side, our small but emerging Mobile business was up 40%.  ","In China, markets were quite mixed.  But overall, the slowest since the '08, '09 timeframe.  Our auto business continued to be strong, up 20% year-over-year while our CIS businesses were down 10%.  ","In Europe, which accounts for about one-third of our total revenue, business was down 5% organically from the prior year level.  Most of this decline was in automotive and industrial as our networks business was flat with last year.  We expect further seasonal declines in Europe in Q1 due to the seasonality of our business and continued softness in auto and industrial.  Right now, the automotive industry is projecting about a 10% reduction in European automotive production in this coming quarter.  ","Our revenue in North America was down 6% year-over-year on an organic basis.  Continued strong demand in our automotive business was offset by soft demand in our Telecom and Industrial businesses as well as our SubCom business.  ","Please turn to slide five and I'll provide some highlights of our segment performance.  As a reminder, beginning next quarter, we will be reporting in our new segment structure and I'll touch briefly on this later on.","Transportation had another strong quarter of performance.  This business is now running at a 5-billion-plus annual revenue rate.  Overall, vehicle production is now at about an 82 annual unit rate with continued growth.  And in 2012, there was strong growth in the U.S. and Japan, moderate growths in China offsetting weakness in Europe.  ","The industry is currently projecting vehicle production to be about flat in the coming year with the 2012 levels with continued growth in North America and China expected to offset declines in EMEA and Japan.","In the first quarter, we expect revenue in this segment to be up slightly versus the prior year with growth in the U.S. and China offsetting weakness in the industrial and commercial vehicle market and weaker auto production in Europe.  ","Please turn to slide six.  Revenue in our CIS businesses was about $1 billion in the quarter.  Most of our markets in this segment continued to be soft primarily reflecting slowdowns in industrial equipment and IT infrastructure spending around the globe.  Margins in this segment did improve through the year and we stabilized our consumer business.  As the quarter progressed, we did see additional softness in orders in our industrial appliance business.  And we expect these businesses to be down sequentially in Q1.  Most of this softening in Industrial and Appliances in Asia and Europe.  ","Please turn to slide seven.  Demand in our Networks business continues to be rather weak, especially in the U.S. Telecom and in the SubCom business.  Telecom, our largest business in the segment, which accounts for about 1.3 billion of annual revenue has been very soft in the U.S. for about 18 months.  It was down 15% in the quarter year-over-year and for the year.  In Europe, business was about flat and in Asia, we were up slightly.  These are the lowest \u2013 these business levels are at the lowest revenue in over five years.  And we do expect at least another two quarters of soft demand due to this normal seasonal slowdown.  ","Now despite the current softness in the market, I continue to remain very bullish about the future of our network segment because the wired portion, primarily fiber portion of our customer's infrastructure is critically important to meeting their capacity in coverage needs.  And we have never had a better product line to meet these needs.  ","Now while this business is slow, we are going to take advantage of this and reduce our costs across the business.  We're taking an approach similar to what we did in '08 and '09 with our automotive business.  ","Now I'll turn it over to Bob Hau, our still brand new CFO to cover the financials in more detail.","Bob Hau - CFO","","Thanks Tom, and good morning, everyone.  Before I cover the fourth quarter financial performance, I want to remind everyone that the segment reporting changes as Tom mentioned earlier are effective with the first quarter.  We will report first quarter results in this new structure in January of 2013.  And we expect to file an 8-K with recast historical P&L information in December, well in advance of the January earnings call.  Now let me discuss earnings, which start on slide eight.  ","Our GAAP operating income for the quarter was $401 million, which includes 14 million of charges related to the acquisition of Deutsch and restructuring charges of $39 million.  The Deutsch acquisition-related charges includes $7 million of non-cash fair value purchase accounting adjustments and cash acquisitions charges of 7 million.  We expect approximately $75 million of total cash charges related to the acquisition of Deutsch.  About $40 million of the cash portion was incurred in 2012.  With the remainder expected in 2013.  The Deutsch acquisition is on track, and EBITDA, exiting the year, was in line with our expectations.  ","Our adjusted operating income was $454 million with an adjusted operating margin of 13.5%.  Both gross and operating margins were in line with our outlook for the quarter.  We do anticipate revenue levels and margins to be down sequentially in Q1 due to normal seasonal trends and continued softness in Telecom and Industrial markets.  ","GAAP EPS were $0.93 and adjusted EPS were $0.76 for the fourth quarter.  GAAP EPS included $0.07 of restructuring and other charges, $0.03 of acquisition-related charges, and $0.27 of income related to tax items.  The tax income was related to a reduction in evaluation allowances associated with tax loss carry forwards in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions where the ability to use NOL's in future periods now seems more certain than prior estimates.  ","Please turn to slide nine.  Starting at the top half of the slide, our adjusted gross margin in the quarter was slightly above guidance at 31.8%.  We expect adjusted gross margins to be down around 31% in the first quarter due to lower sales volumes.  ","A summary of operating expenses is shown at the bottom half of the slide.   Total OpEx spending of $617 million was lower than the prior-year quarter due primarily to the additional week in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011.  ","SG&A was up about 100 basis points as a percentage of sales due primarily to the lower sales levels.  In Q1, we expect RD&E and SG&A to be approximately 5.5% and 13.5% of sales respectively.  ","Turning to slide ten, let me discuss items in the P&L below the operating line.  Net interest expense was $40 million in the fourth quarter.  As planned and discussed in our earnings call in July, in early October, we did pay off notes that matured of $714 million.  Therefore, in the first quarter, we expect net interest expense to drop to approximately $32 million and stay at that level through the fiscal year.  ","Adjusted Other Income, which relates to our tax-sharing agreement, was $12 million.  In Q1, we expect other income of approximately $9 million.  ","A GAAP effective tax rate was negative 5% in the quarter due to the reduction in the NOL evaluation allowances that I discussed previously.  The adjusted effective tax rate was 23.5%, which was favorable versus our guidance of 26%.  As Tom mentioned, this favorable rate has a positive impact to EPS of approximately $0.02 in the fourth quarter.  And we expect adjusted tax rate to be 24% to 25% in Q1 and the full year 2013.  ","Now turn to free cash flow and working capital on slide 11.  ","Cash from continuing operations was $714 million, up 17% from the prior year.  Our free cash flow of Q4 was $560 million, a very strong finish to the year, and free cash flow for the full year was $1.43 billion.  We continue to expect free cash flow to approximate an income going forward.  ","Capital spending during the quarter was $148 million, and in fiscal 2013, we expect capital spending levels of approximately 4% to 5% of sales, consistent with our historic levels.  ","Working capital levels are in line with our expectations with receivable days outstanding was 63.  Inventory days on hand returned to 69 days.  Our businesses continue to do a very good job of managing working capital in this uncertain environment.  ","Please turn to slide 12 and I'll discuss sources and uses of cash outside of free cash flow.","We begin the quarter with $1.3 billion of cash and ended the quarter with 1.6 billion.  During the quarter, we returned a total of $283 million to shareholders.  We paid dividends of $89 million and repurchased 5.5 million shares for $194 million.  This cash flow statement shows a lower dollar amount per share repurchases due to the time difference of actual payment of funds.  ","Our outstanding debt was $3.7 billion at the end of the quarter.  As I mentioned earlier, debt was reduced by approximately $700 million in early October with the payoff of the notes that matured.  We expect debt levels of approximately $3 billion in fiscal 2013.  We expect to continue to generate strong free cash flow in future periods.  And plan to continue share repurchases of $150 to $250 million per quarter in fiscal 2013.  ","Now, I'll turn it back to Tom.","Thomas J. Lynch","Thank you, Bob.  Please turn to slide 13.  ","Before I get into the orders and our outlook, I just wanted to refresh everybody's memory on the new segment structure, and this slide shows are fiscal 2012 revenues in the new segment groupings.  ","The regrouping of our business units into these four segments has two primary objectives as we discussed on the last call.  First and foremost, it enables us to best leverage our capabilities for the customer and further optimize our efficiency.  It's pretty critical for us.  And it also has enabled several of our top leaders to move into expanded or different roles, which is very important for the organization's totality and long term.  We believe this will also provide improved information regarding the performance of the company for all of our investors.  And as Bob indicated, a recap of historical period results will be filed in December.  ","Please turn to slide 14.  As we alluded to earlier, as we enter into fiscal '13, and I don\u2019t think any surprise to anyone, things are pretty uncertain in much of the global economy.  And many of our customers, many of which I have talked to in just the last month, especially tier-one customers are taking a very cautious approach to the outlook, which translates into tightening down the amount of inventory and supply chains; a typical reaction.","As our fourth quarter progressed, we saw our order rates slow.  And this slowdown was pretty much across the board in Europe and in our industrial business in the U.S. and Asia.  Total orders for the quarter were 3.19 billion.  And our book-to-bill was 0.94 excluding SubCom.  ","This trend is very, very similar to the trend we had in the fourth quarter of last year and our book-to-bill was very similar to the Q4 fiscal year '11 and Q4 fiscal year '10 book-to-bill that we had exiting the fourth quarter.  ","Please turn to slide 15.  Based on the order trends I just discussed, we're currently expecting revenue in Q1 to be in the $3.15 billion to $3.25 billion range and adjusted EPS in the $0.62 to $0.66 range.  It's a slight increase over last year and a decline sequentially.  On a year-over-year basis, the benefits of Deutsch are being offset by continued weak market for broadband network equipment as well as weaker exchange rates, particularly the euro.  Sequentially, the decline is a combination of normalcy finality in most of our businesses coupled with the slowness in Europe and Asia we alluded to earlier.  ","Please turn to slide 16.  For the full year, I'm going to lay out three scenarios, arrange if you will, to show how we would expect our company to perform at different sales levels over the next year. ","At the low end, which would be a very slow growth year or no growth year, we would expect revenue to be flat year-over-year, and essentially, our quarterly revenue pattern would mirror last year. You can see this in the lower left-hand corner of the chart.  In this case where there's really no revenue growth, which is the benefits of Deutsch being offset by weaker exchange rates, we would still expect to generate 5% adjusted EPS growth as a result of the productivity improvements we continue to see and the benefit of share repurchases.  ","The midrange scenario or midpoint assumes 3% growth with a modest economic pickup beginning in the second half, and revenue, again, following seasonal patterns.  In this case, we would expect EPS growth of approximately 10%.  And I would call this, based on everything we see today, we hear from our customers and the assumption people are making about the economy, this is our most likely scenario.  ","And then the high end of the range assumes a stronger recovery in the second half and drives full-year sales growth of 5% and EPS growth of 15%.  The key takeaway from all these; one, it's obviously difficult to call a year out in these circumstances right now.  But in any scenario, we would expect to see solid earnings growth even in a no-growth scenario because of our productivity and are strong cash flow, we're going to generate approximately EPS.  And if we were to see a pop in the second half of the year across the global economy and a recovery in the Telecom spending, then you could really see our operating leverage kick in generating up to $3.30 in EPS.  But as of now, I would say based on everything we see, $3.15 feels like the most likely scenario.  ","In any of these three scenarios, we would expect to return over $1 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchase.  And in the most recently completed quarter as Bob mentioned, we did over $280 million in the quarter.  ","And I guess a core assumption we have is that the first half of our fiscal year is going to continue to be pretty slow economically.  And then there will be some \u2013 we'll see our seasonal pickup in the second half.  And we do expect a little bit of an economic pickup by the time our fourth quarter rolls around.  And that would be our July, August, September quarter.  ","So please turn to slide 17 and I'll kind of wrap things up here.","Although 2012 was a tough year from a demand perspective, I feel we continue to strengthen the company.  We improved our operating leverage.  We strengthened the portfolio with the addition of Deutsche.  And the divestitures of Touch and Services.  And had another very strong cash flow year.  And to reiterate, since 21007 when we came out on our own, we have generated over $7 billion of free cash flow.  And we've returned approximately $4.4 billion to shareholders.  ","We look forward to 2013.  Clearly, these are uncertain times.  And a couple of our key markets especially Telecom are in a weak part of the cycle.  Despite this, I believe we are very well-positioned to manage through any negative economic scenarios and accelerate our profitability as the economy improves.  And I think you could get a sense of that in our Q3 and Q4 with just a little bit of revenue running in the$13.5 to $14 billion level.  We're generating 13.5% to 14% operating margins.  ","In addition, our technology and product pipeline is very strong across the company.  Over the last five years, we've been increasing R&D spending, absolute spending because there are so many opportunities in our core connectivity business.  And over the next couple years beginning in '13, I expect that we'll begin to realize a wealth of new products particularly in high-speed lightweight and fiber optic applications across our entire portfolio.  ","And are strong suit, our cash flow and operating leverage enable us to deliver double digit earnings growth even at a low sales growth rate.  ","But it's also clear that in this environment, we can't depend on normal revenue growth to drive margin expansion.  And so as a result, we are taking additional actions to further reduce our costs.  Our objective is to permanently reduce costs by an additional $75 million.  We expect to hit this annual run rate in the second half of fiscal 2015.  We expect to incur approximately $200 million of charges during fiscal 2013.  Our current year that we just entered was roughly half occurring in the first quarter.  ","Cash spending in fiscal 2013 related to these actions is expected to be approximately $150 million.  [Inaudible] is a very important investment albeit painful.  And at times, to continue to get our cost structure down to the levels that we feel are in sync with the levels of the business.  ","And with these investments we're making your products and cost reductions, we expect to be able to deliver that 15% operating margin at a lower level than previously anticipated. For those of you who have been following us, 15% operating margin is an incredibly important level of performance for us to hit.  That's why we're taking these actions.  And we would expect to be able to do that in the $15 to $15.5 billion revenue range.  ","With that, I\u2019ll open it up to questions.  ","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","(Operator instructions).  Our first question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan \u2013 BofA. Please go ahead.","Wamsi Mohan \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch","","Yes thank you. Good morning.  Tom can you talk a little more about what you\u2019re seeing in the automotive market and MAF.  We\u2019ve heard from some of the companies of an atypical buildup of inventory of \u201czero kilometer used cars\u201d is how they dubbed it?  ","Also curious, are you seeing any softness in China in the luxury car market, and I\u2019ll follow up.","Thomas Lynch \u2013 CEO, Executive Director","","Thanks Wamsi.  Well Europe continues to slow down, and I think right now, and some of it is a little bit of extra inventory. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s overwhelming, because I think the automakers have been adjusting as well as the tier one.  But right now the expectation in Europe is to be down 10% year-over-year in Q1 in number of cars produced.  And that is our biggest market.","With respect to China, China was - by China measures flow even in automotive through 2012 we had a very strong year again.  But production was in single digits for the first time. [inaudible] digits for the first time in a while. Now most of the decline was at the mid-tier to low end vehicles, it was not at the high-tier.  We\u2019re seeing a little bit of slowdown at the high-tier, but it\u2019s still fairly robust.  I was there last week with our automotive team, and they expect production to be up slightly.  Total production of Chinese cars to be \u2013 China cars to be up slightly in the year, and for us to have another year of double digit revenue growth, so obviously watching it pretty closely.","Wamsi Mohan \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch","Okay, thanks Tom.  As a follow-up, I think you mentioned on the prepared remarks that these additional restructuring actions will kick in, in the second half of this fiscal year. Why is it that it takes so long to realize these benefits?  Is it the region where these actions are being taken, and what end markets are these actions gears towards?  Thanks.","Thomas Lynch \u2013 CEO, Executive Director","Thanks Wamsi.  A couple things.  If it\u2019s factories, it takes a while with noticed periods and all of those things, and the move equipment.  You also typically have in that case, we\u2019re incurring some costs that are operating expense costs in the period of the move. So it does take a few quarters, I\u2019d say typically two or three, if you\u2019re involving factories to begin to see the benefit of the savings. We would expect to see a little bit in Q4, but \u2013 and of course we\u2019re doing, we\u2019re pushing for as much as fast as we can, but practically speaking we have to be careful of not disrupting the customer flow.","What was the very last part of your question?","Wamsi Mohan \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch","Just the end-markets where you\u2019re taking these actions.","Thomas Lynch \u2013 CEO, Executive Director","I would say primarily around our consumer and networks businesses.  Those businesses \u2013 you know consumer we\u2019re kind of regaining our footing in that business, and besides a lot of new products now coming into market, part of it is to make sure we have the right cost structures.  You know, that\u2019s a very competitive business, and we\u2019re making good progress there.  And then in the networks business, it\u2019s because the markets been down for such a longtime, taking the opportunity to make sure that in the event that it\u2019s a lower level of business than we had thought, we still have attractive returns.","Wamsi Mohan \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch","Okay, thanks a lot.","Thomas Lynch \u2013 CEO, Executive Director","Thank you.","Operator","","Our next question is from Matt Sheerin \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus. Please go ahead.","Matthew Sheerin \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co. Inc","","Yes, thank you.  So, regarding your commentary Tom on weakness in the industrial markets, I know that a lot of that is through distribution in terms of your overall exposure to distribution, not as much as other suppliers but certainly in the industrial side. Are you seeing sell into distribution at a lower rate than sell out like we say last year when we saw an inventory correction? Or are you getting signs that just demand from the distributors is weak and will continue to be weaker?","Thomas Lynch \u2013 CEO, Executive Director","I would say it\u2019s more just sell out is weak.  I will also say Matt that we do have a pretty substantial amount of our business go through the channel for the company as a whole of 20%.  In our industrial businesses it\u2019s closer to 50%.  So we leverage the channel, benefit from the channel, work with the channel quite a bit.","Matthew Sheerin \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co. Inc","Okay.  And then on the cost cutting actions that you\u2019re taking, it sounds like it makes sense on the networking side. Are you looking at mostly manufacturing related cost, as opposed to technical sales and support, because we are potentially at the bottom of the market here and you don\u2019t want to take those kind of costs our and those kind of resources out right?","Thomas Lynch \u2013 CEO, Executive Director","We totally agree with that and as we did in the big downturn three and a half years ago, we didn\u2019t take those kind of resources out.  We believe that\u2019s really kind of the heart and soul of the company, and that\u2019s where we create our value.  So, no, it\u2019s more around excess capacity that \u2013 hey I think there\u2019s a couple of things. We\u2019re getting smarter, we\u2019re getting better with our leans, so we\u2019re creating capacity every year, which if you go back two or three years ago we would have expected to use for growth, but in these times we don\u2019t need it, and so we\u2019re going to take advantage of the slowdown and take some of this capacity offline and move it into other locations.","Matthew Sheerin \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co. Inc","Okay, thank you.","Thomas Lynch \u2013 CEO, Executive Director","Thank you.","Operator","","We have a question from Amitabh Pass \u2013 UBS.  Please go ahead.","Amitabh Pass \u2013 UBS","","Thank you.  I had a clarification and then a question.  My clarification was, in you EPS guidance for fiscal \u201913, have you already embedded the potential impact of your share repurchases of somewhere between 150 to 250 million per quarter?","And then Tom, my question for you was, your (Y line) segments, whether it be your telecom, fiber business, the service provider segment, of Subsea has been weak for quite some time. Just wanted to get your thoughts on what do you think spurs incremental spending there, particularly in North America?  And is there a need for you to perhaps bulk up the macro cellular wireless piece of your business to perhaps complement what\u2019s going on with the wire line markets?","Bob Hau \u2013CFO","","Hi, this is Bob. From a share repurchase standpoint, as we\u2019ve indicated, we\u2019re planning about 150 to 250 million per quarter in 2013. We did restart the fourth quarter of \u201912, and that is baked into the EPS guidance per employer. ","Thomas Lynch \u2013 CEO, Executive Director"," ","And on your question about the networks business, it really depends on where \u2013 the cycle depends on where we are in the world.  So Europe is kind of flattish right now.  Some carriers there are being very aggressive pushing fiber deep, others are backing off typically because they did it a few years ago.  But in general, fiber\u2019s still not that deep in the network. It\u2019s deepest in the U.S., but it\u2019s still not close enough to the home or the office to handle all the digital content that\u2019s coming.  And then in Asia, it\u2019s still growing, although it\u2019s lumpy.  And then you have big programs like what\u2019s going on in Australia and New Zealand. ","In terms of small bay station, we have through the ADC acquisition what is commonly referred to is the (daftedness) or distribute antenna, which is \u2013 it\u2019s the forerunner of small bay station I would say. The capability to add on capacity and coverage without having to build a tower, and clearly that\u2019s where the industry is going, especially in the U.S.  We have a product line there that we feel pretty good about.  But we\u2019re more excited about, as you build out all these small bay stations, to get the signal back on to the main network you need to connect them with fiber. So these small bay stations in supporting an LTE Network are going to be out pretty close to the home, in order to have the bandwidth that you need for the home, and they will be in our view predominantly connected by fiber.  So, in the last year and a half, we\u2019ve had the acquisition activity in the carriers in the U.S. and we\u2019ll tend to slowdown spending. And then I think a really big push to get 4G or LTE out there, and at the expense of some of the wired infrastructure.  ","So, we\u2019ve seen these cycles before.  When we\u2019re in the bottom of them, they always feel pretty tough, and there are those moments when it seems like it\u2019s never going to come back, but we really like the product line we have and we feel we\u2019re very poised for when that investment cycle hits again.","And then with respect to SubCom, as you know, that\u2019s a very cyclical business and it\u2019s at the low end of the cycle.  Five years ago it was at the top end of the cycle, and life couldn\u2019t have been better. But even at the low end of the cycle it\u2019s a good business returning cost to capital.  And when you model bandwidth around the world and nobody is perfect at this, and we expect another growth cycle to come in the next few years.","Amitabh Pass \u2013 UBS","Excellent. Thank you.","Thomas Lynch \u2013 CEO, Executive Director","Thank you.","Operator","","We have Sharron Harrison \u2013 Longbow Research. Please go ahead.","Sharron M. Harrison \u2013 Longbow Research LLC","","Hi, good morning.  Two questions, just the first on Deutsch. Maybe if you could just \u2013 it sounds as if things are going pretty well there, but if you could maybe talk about just how it\u2019s progressing, what we should expect from that business in \u201913 and both kind of just the earning contribution whether you think there\u2019s upside or challenges?","And then just second, the raw material environment, if you\u2019re facing any incremental headwinds right now, or if you think you\u2019re kind of relatively neutral to raw materials?  Thanks.","Thomas Lynch \u2013 CEO, Executive Director","Thanks Sharron.  With respect to Deutsch, going very well.  The cultural \u2013 and I\u2019ve been to most of the locations is very good as we\u2019ve said before, our people have been in these similar businesses a longtime, so there\u2019s an initial point of understanding to start with, which I think is important.  The business is a little slower than, you know when we bought it.  The assumptions we had when we bought it, I think that\u2019s reflective of the slowdown in the global economy.  The synergy is higher, so on balance we expect the earnings contribution from Deutsch in \u201913 to be as we stated at the time of acquisition, which I\u2019m pretty pleased with given it\u2019s a little softer topline.  We also feel there\u2019s \u2013 the longer term there\u2019s a little more opportunity than we thought from a sales perspective.  The ability to take these products, some directly, some with modification and other applications so, so far so good.  I have a tremendous amount of enthusiasm I think with the Deutsch team and us about what the prospects are.","And then with respect to raw material.","Bob Hau - CFO","Raw materials for us, about a push for 2013 perhaps a very small tailwind if copper, gold, and silver stay where they\u2019re at today, but it would be low single digit millions of tailwind if it were to hold, particularly given where we stand from a hedging standpoint."," ","Also add on a Deutsch standpoint, I mentioned in my opening comments, we exited 2012 about on expectations from an EBITDA standpoint.  As Tom pointed out, sales a little bit late. Integration cost coming in better, integration segments coming in better than we had anticipated. So, we actually crossed the 30% EBITDA margin in the second half of 2012 in the first six months of ownership. So, we\u2019re very pleased from that standpoint.","Operator","","(Operator instructions).  Our next question is from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets, please go ahead.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC","Yes, thanks a lot, good morning, guys.  There\u2019s two questions on my side \u2013 one, just on the Deutsch side, you touched on this a little, but, you know, your revenues were 27 million off, which you guys were initially expecting last quarter from Deutsch \u2013 even though the rest of tel transportation segments seem to have held a blow, what do you think Deutsch under performed on the revenue line so severely?","Thomas J. Lynch \u2013 CEO, Executive Director","","The biggest part, Amit, is in the heavy truck business \u2013 you know, with slow down and industrial activity, so that\u2019s really where we\u2019ve seen it.  I think you\u2019ve seen some of the companies, the big OEM\u2019s, how they\u2019re guiding in that area in the last month, and they\u2019re big customers of ours.  And China, we\u2019re starting to see acceleration again towards the new caf\u00e9 \u2013 equivalent to the caf\u00e9 standards which is a big opportunity for us, and was one of the core series of the case, for doing Deutsch, where today trucks in China are, unlike the automotive market, a truck market is all kind of local and at the low end with a few exceptions, but with a new, much more strict emissions standards that should come into play over the next year-and-a-half, and get ready for that over the next year, we see a really big opportunity there.  But in the short term, it\u2019s off-road heavy truck. ","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC","Good, that\u2019s helpful, and then, you know, could you just touch on what drove the sequential margin declines for the transportation segment?  Was that about 160 basis points \u2013 was that largely just a revenue mix, or something else that impacted that?  And then how do you think that segment will perform in fiscal \u201913 \u2013 you know, that you\u2019re baking into your guide?","Thomas J. Lynch \u2013 CEO, Executive Director","","Amit, from a sequential stand point, you hit it right on the head, it\u2019s definitely associated with the lower revenue partially on a seasonal basis.  We saw a bit of weakening in operating margins just from a standpoint of leverage through the factories.  ","Bob Hau - CFO","","At the \u2013  and Amit, at the 13.7, $3.15 EPS scenario, I would expect the margin in that business to be up modestly.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC","Fair enough, thanks a lot.","Bob Hau - CFO","","It takes another year of good performance.  ","Operator","","Our next question comes from Jim Suva with Citi, please go ahead.","Jim Suva \u2013 Citi","","Thank you, congratulations to your team.  Can they talk a little bit about the restructuring \u2013 is it mostly attributed to activity or ADC, or Deutsch, or a combination of the three?  Proportionately, how would you think about where their structure actions are?","Thomas J. Lynch","","That\u2019s a \u2013 I appreciate that question, Jim, and thanks for the complement.  It\u2019s hard to cut it that finely because, you know, ADC\u2019s been a part of us almost two years now, but if you were to go back and look at some of the locations we\u2019ve already announced \u2013 you know, there\u2019s a couple that are ADC locations that were originally contemplated, you know, as part of this synergy, and we\u2019re doing more than we originally contemplated because the business is slower.  There is a little bit of fine tuning in Deutsch, I would say.  Again, as we get smarter, and as Bob mentioned, we\u2019re identifying more synergies.  ","If you want to break it down, the business is \u2013 I mean, we\u2019re going through and finding wherever we have excess capacity that\u2019s still may not be where the customer is going, or where the customer has gone \u2013 it\u2019s an ongoing journey to make that happen.  But generally speaking, you could say the majority of it is going to be around Consumer and Network.  ","Jim Suva \u2013 Citi","Okay, and then as a quick follow up, with this restructuring actions going on, is your M&A pipeline still very active, or has this slow down economy you\u2019re taking a cause on it, or are those people focused on restructuring \u2013 are they like different [inaudible]?  I\u2019m just trying to get a feel for your M&As?  You talked about stock buyback, you talked about restructuring but M&A, just really didn\u2019t come up,  and I\u2019m just wondering about your outlook [inaudible]?","Thomas J. Lynch \u2013 CEO, Executive Director","","No, our M&A headline is still full because I think in that case, it\u2019s all part of understanding what\u2019s going on in your markets, and we certainly have areas where we\u2019ve said many times that are very attractive to us if the right opportunity was available, desire to do something, and it was the right price.  So, I think we have a group of people that work with our businesses that are constantly making sure that that pipeline is growing in the sense that we\u2019re identifying all the companies out there, so we\u2019re on top of our mark.  So, I would say, clearly the threshold for doing one is higher, and as I said last quarter, we\u2019ve done two sides of the ones in the last two years, and our priority is to make sure we make them successful, and I feel very good about where we are on that journey with those two acquisitions.  So, in a sense that it gets harder and harder to \u2013 the threshold gets higher and higher, and likely to be smaller size, really true [inaudible] in the area where we are most interested in.  So, we don\u2019t want to, in a sense, restrict the pipeline, because I think, you know, we could run, and maybe misunderstand what\u2019s going on in the market, and to miss opportunities, because many of these take a long time to come to fruition.  ","Jim Suva \u2013 Citi","Thanks, and congratulations to your team.","Thomas J. Lynch","","Thanks, Jim.","Operator","","Our next question is from Craig Hettenbach with Goldman Sachs, please go ahead.","Craig Hettenbach - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","Yes, thank you.  Tom, you called out the parallel to the restructuring actions to automotive market in \u201908, \u201909.  So, I was hoping to get a sense of the operating leverages [inaudible] in that business kind of coming out of the down turn, if you see any similar parallels to the earnings power for the networks and consumer once end demand comes back?","Thomas J. Lynch","","Yes, I \u2013 in automotive we picked up a point-and-a-half to two points, we also did increase our investment in R&D, and that business at that time, especially in hydroelectric and a few other areas.  We \u2013 I would expect in the businesses we\u2019re primarily focused on to get a similar kind of leverage a point to two points in consumer or networks, that\u2019s the objective, and the opportunity is there because the team has identified, you know, the excess capacity and how we could take advantage of locations that have capacity.","Craig Hettenbach - Goldman Sachs Group Inc","Okay.","Bob Hau - CFO","","Overall, we expect about $75 million worth of savings, which once we get up to that run rate in the second half of 2015 \u2013 Tom indicated, we see an accelerated opportunity to get to the 15% operating margin, $75 million will remain to [inaudible] point at the total [inaudible] connectivity level.  ","Craig Hettenbach - Goldman Sachs Group Inc","Got it, thanks for that \u2013 and then as it relates to the [inaudible] location, the buyback is [inaudible] this quarter.  Any thoughts on the dividend, which if you look at your payout, even though you steadily increased it sense it\u2019s been out, it\u2019s still, you know, below the overall market, and just really curious how you think about that payout ratio, if there\u2019s on opportunity over time to increase that from where it is today?","Thomas J. Lynch \u2013 CEO, Executive Director","","Well, we do think for us, depending on where we are in the cycle and what our other opportunities are, that payout ratio in the 25-35% range isn\u2019t \u2013 would be a right ratio for us.  And as you know, we\u2019ve been consistently increasing the dividend, I would expect that at the upcoming board meetings in advance of our annual meeting, that\u2019s certainly a topic that we will be reviewing with the board to see what we want to do in the coming calendar year regarding payout, but we have to take into consideration what does the economy look like, what do the other opportunities look like, but our philosophy would be consistent increase in the dividend rate, we just have a lot down with that [inaudible] yet for the coming year.  Okay?","Operator","","We have a question from Steven Fox, Cross Research.  Please go ahead. ","Steven Fox \u2013 Cross Research ","Thanks.  Good morning.  Two questions, first, as it goes to the restructuring, I was just curious what it implies about your typical incremental margins, whether there\u2019s been any change there or the ability to realize meaningful sales synergies from Deutsch over a longer period of time?  ","And then secondly, Tom, maybe you could just talk a little bit more about China, around the other markets there seems to be \u2013 seems to be the lynchpin maybe for the next six months in terms of which way the economy goes globally and how your operations have improved over the last year or two there.  I know you\u2019ve been \u2013 had some initiatives underway to bring them up to par maybe with other areas, so that will be helpful.  Thank you. ","Thomas J. Lynch \u2013 CEO, Executive Director","","Just a point of clarification on your first question, restructuring relative to Deutsch? ","Steven Fox \u2013 Cross Research ","No, the overall restructuring, the new restructuring charge that you\u2019re announcing.  I\u2019m trying to understand what it implies about your typical incremental margins, if you have to take cost actions here.  ","Thomas J. Lynch \u2013 CEO, Executive Director","","We\u2019re addressing fixed costs, primarily in the restructuring.  So the goal is to continue to improve the flow through on higher volume growth.  So yeah, we \u2013 we typically fluctuate between 25 and 30% depending on the mix of businesses and the region it happens in and you know, we want to continue to reduce where it makes sense and we don\u2019t sacrifice capacity for growth, that\u2019s fixed cost base.  So that\u2019s the way to think about that.  ","As far as Deutsch sales synergy, I think it\u2019s early, but we\u2019re seeing it for sure in the two key markets.  You know, we\u2019re seeing opportunities of one having the complete product line going into a customer and from soup to nuts providing the heavy-duty connectivity system and that\u2019s beneficial to customers, they\u2019re telling us they like that.  It simplifies their life.  I think overtime, that is an opportunity.  The shorter-term opportunity is to take advantage of our channel strength around the world where we have a large \u2013 a large infrastructure or I\u2019d say an effective infrastructure that works with our channel partners to support all the smaller customers, generally smaller customers around the world and we\u2019re seeing increased activity around this product line from Deutsch from through those partners, in many cases, not sold by the channel partners before.  So that would be early synergy.  And then in the longer-term, I think it\u2019s really the opportunity to get more design-ins because can provide more of a system and we can solve the problems in a more effective way having this complete range of products for the harsh environment.  ","And then with respect to China, yeah, we have quite a presence in China.  As you know, about $2 billion of revenue.  We have substantial engineering resources there, obviously manufacturing resources there.  Our strong suit in China is in our Beacon business, automotive where we\u2019ve been supporting the automotive industry there, both multi-national and the locals for a long time.  I think we\u2019re doing, you know, we\u2019re doing well in the Telecom business.  Telecom and Energy are tough businesses in China, lots of low competition, but we\u2019re in the upper echelon of suppliers, not huge businesses \u2013 and the balance of this business in China, typically, not to generalize too much, but a [inaudible] export business where \u2013 whether it\u2019s computers or mobile phones or even industrial equipment.  You know, we have a \u2013 more than a beach head there.  ","So \u2013 but clearly, China getting energy and getting a pickup in their environment, then I was encouraged from my visit and talking to our folks last week that it \u2013 it looks like that transitioning government over there comes soon, the desire to get the economy going, stimulus flowing again in some areas and the recognition that that economy needs to grow 7.5 to 9% to keep the country moving forward.  But for the last year it\u2019s been slower than I\u2019ve seen other than the, you know, the crisis here.  ","Steven Fox \u2013 Cross Research ","Thank you very much.  That\u2019s helpful.

","Mike Wood - Macquarie Research","Hi, good morning.  Regarding the outperformance that you\u2019re expecting with global auto production, is that being driven by higher content per vehicle or Deutsch synergies or is this just better performance on the high end?  And can you talk about whether or not you\u2019re worried about a trade down impact as the economy is slowing?  ","Thomas J. Lynch \u2013 CEO, President ","","Sure.  It\u2019s not really Deutsch related in the automotive business.  They bring a little bit of capability, but they\u2019re more harsh environment.  It\u2019s continuing content at every category of cars, A, B, C, D, E.  It is selective expansion beyond our traditional product line in areas like sensors.  It\u2019s continuing to lead, we\u2019ve invested a lot for a long time in light-weight and be able to connect alternative metals and copper and we\u2019ve got tremendous capability there.  So it\u2019s a combination of factors that contribute to us growing a little bit faster than the market.  ","Mike Wood - Macquarie Research","Okay, and the growth that you mentioned in tablets and smartphones, are these new wins with customers or are these just an expansion with your current business? ","Thomas J. Lynch \u2013 CEO, President","","We\u2019ve had a couple of significant new wins, not enough to say, you know, we\u2019re well established yet.  I think enough to tell our customers that, hey, we really are a good capable, innovative supplier to these markets and to tell ourselves that we can do it.  So the last year was an important year for us to convince more than anything ourselves that this is a market that we should be able to be successful in.  So it\u2019s a couple of more wins, not just extensions of existing wins.  And, of course, in that business, you\u2019ve got to have wins all the time because unlike automotive or industrial, you don\u2019t typically get designed in with a particular part number that lasts that long.  It is \u2013 if you\u2019re not that well established in the business, it\u2019s a good thing because it gives you a chance to get established, but it does make pretty ferocious business.  So you have to be good at it and you have to be quick to ramping volume, which has not been our strong suit in the past, but which we\u2019re getting much better at.

","Kevin LaBuz \u2013 Deutsche Bank AG","Hi.  Thank you.  This is Kevin LaBuz on for the behalf of Sherri.  It\u2019s really no surprise given the macro situation that you\u2019ve seen it slowdown in sales, but I\u2019m wondering what have you seen on the design side?  Has the pace activity there slowed? ","Thomas J. Lynch \u2013 CEO, Executive Director","","Not really.  You know, we\u2019ve seen a little bit and I\u2019d say there are really one-offs where when things slow down, sometimes customers slow down their efforts to introduce something that might be cutting edge.  But we haven\u2019t seen even a lot of that, a couple things where we were close to getting designed in and then the customer decided, in light of the market, to hold onto the incumbent solution.  ","But for the most part, the customers aren\u2019t slowing down their demands on the number of designs.  I think that\u2019s not in their best interest and you can really lose a lot of momentum if you have a customer doing that.  You want to have a pipeline of design so that when things do come back and they spend more money, they\u2019re ready.  And a lot of what we do in this industry, supporting our customers, whether it\u2019s high-speed or light-weight or fiber optic related are important parts of the architecture.  So it\u2019s not just a simple component that gets dropped into a design, it is very often a component that is custom designed or partially custom designed for their application.  And in many of our industries, the consumer might have the shortest cycle but in almost any industry, next-generation products are designed several years out and if you delay that, you really run the risk of missing a window.  ","So we\u2019ve kept our investment, that\u2019s why I said earlier, even with the restructuring, we\u2019re not touching engineering.  You look at our investment in engineering over the last five years, it\u2019s gone up.  I just think we have so much opportunity that we felt like we were going to go after it.  But I guess to answer your question, we have not seen much change in the design demands of our customers.  ","Kevin LaBuz \u2013 Deutsche Bank AG","All right, thank you.  And just on \u2013 just turning to Asia, there\u2019s been a lot of talk about slowdown in China, but what do you think in other geographies there, including China, what about Asia?  ","Thomas J. Lynch \u2013 CEO, Executive Director","","I would say, and it really depends on market, but to generalize a little bit, Japan had a strong year in \u201812 and I would expect them to have a very slow year in \u201913.  You know, the post-earthquake bounce really drove some business there, but we\u2019re seeing that slow down already. ","China, by typical recent measures, I would say had a slow year although a growth year.  Expect that to pick up a little bit, we\u2019re seeing signs of that in our order rates this quarter.  Korea, steady, I would say.  You know, low growth, but steady growth and of course, continuing to have significant exports in the auto and in the mobile device business.  So those being the three big markets.  Southeast Asia, very promising, growing market.  Places like Indonesia really \u2013 standards of living starting to improve and investments starting to grow there.  And Australia\/ New Zealand, pretty significant investments in infrastructure and relative to us, Telecom infrastructure so very important there, those governments have made a statement that having a full broadband solution across the country is important to being competitive.  By the way, I think we\u2019ll see that over time everywhere and that\u2019s one of the reasons we\u2019re so bullish on our Networks business.  ","Kevin LaBuz \u2013 Deutsche Bank AG","Excellent.  Thank you.  ","Thomas J. Lynch \u2013 CEO, Executive Director","","Thank you. ","Operator","","We have a question from Tony Kure, KeyBanc.  Please go ahead.  ","Anthony C. Kure - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.","Hey, good morning.  Just a quick question on the guidance for fiscal \u201913.  As you look at the EPS and the revenue lines, I\u2019m sort of trying to back into the EBIT margin improvement.  We\u2019ve already talked to your expectations on the transport side, but you know, overall for the company, I\u2019m looking at sort of a 20 to 30 basis point operating margin improvement.  First, is that correct?  And second, how would it be influenced by the other segments, the two segments at this point? ","Thomas J. Lynch \u2013 CEO, Executive Director","","That\u2019s directionally correct, yeah.  You\u2019re in the ballpark with that.  With that kind of revenue growth we would expect the productivity we have in the pipeline to generate that kind of operating margin.  ","Anthony C. Kure - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.","And then like you talked about the transport being up marginally, could you talk about the other two segments from the margin expectations? ","Thomas J. Lynch \u2013 CEO, Executive Director","","Yeah.  I would say\u2026 ","Bob Hau \u2013 CFO","","I think ultimately to your point, the 20 to 30 basis points operating margin is about right on a year-over-year basis.  Transportation being the strongest one given some growth opportunities there.  The other three segments; industrial, consumer and networks, all expanding on a year-over-year basis, but to a smaller level given the lack of volume leverage from those three individual segments.  ","Anthony C. Kure - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.","Great.  And then on the Enterprise IT side, obviously slowing down there, just \u2013 if you have visibility into what\u2019s driving that, I mean, we\u2019ve heard a lot about the C-level decision making extending, a lot of projects pushing out.  Do you have that sort of visibility that these types of things are pushing into 2013 or are these just cancelations on run rate business?  Maybe if you provide [inaudible] down onto that market?  ","Thomas J. Lynch \u2013 CEO, Executive Director","","I think, again, it depends on the region of the world and the customer.  There\u2019s some customers that are very aggressive and pushing us for earlier implementation of next-generation, high-speed solutions.  There are some that are, in light of the economic circumstances and holding capital budgets in an uncertain economy are living with the solutions they have.  So I would say it\u2019s mixed, but if I were to categorize in one area, I\u2019d say it\u2019s more of a push than a cancelation.  We often don\u2019t \u2013 we don\u2019t see too much kind of cancelation because I think from an end \u2013 our customer\u2019s point of view, that\u2019s not a smart thing for them to do.  It\u2019s easier for them just to push rather than lose the attention of the supply base and the continued innovation and investment we bring.  ","Anthony C. Kure - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.","Okay, great.  Thank you so much.  ","Thomas J. Lynch \u2013 CEO, Executive Director","","Thank you. ","Operator","","And our last question is from Michael Wherley, Janney.  Please go ahead. ","Michael J. Wherley - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","I just had a question about the consumer restructuring and you know, if you\u2019re seeing some program wins there, where does exactly is consumer restructuring?  Does it have to do with customers that lost share or is it just more broad based?  ","Thomas J. Lynch \u2013 CEO, Executive Director","","It\u2019s really about tightening up the capacity, Michael, and when I talked about the organization change we made three months ago, that had been in the works for a while, it was really founded on grouping like businesses together and making the final break from what had always in this company been structured as a regional geographic business and making the transition to a vertical global business.  So in the past, consumer really was three businesses in the Americas, Europe and Asia.  We concluded a couple years ago that that was not going to enable us to be, one, cost effective, or nimble in responding to the needs of that market.  So part of the capacity in the restructuring that you hear us talking about is really tightening up the backend of that business now that we\u2019ve had it as standalone for about nine months now and you know, getting scale because time to volume and scale in that business is critical to getting the margin you need to make it an attractive business and I\u2019m encouraged with the leadership and team we put in a year ago, the progress they\u2019ve made in that year both on new products, important new wins that the key customers and the customers are setting the pace in that market.  As well as making a lot more sense out of the backend of that business and making us much more efficient.  ","Michael J. Wherley - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","","Okay.  And what\u2019s your core confidence that you can \u2013 that you\u2019ve gotten better at sort of the quick ramp ups where you\u2019ve struggled in the past in that consumer business? ","Thomas J. Lynch \u2013 CEO, Executive Director","","Growing confidence.  We have a couple of really great success stories with a couple of the biggest and the most demanding customers and they were \u2013 they were critically important for us, of course because we don\u2019t have a long track record of doing that, so we \u2013 very important products for these customers that we did a very, very good job, and you know, in one case, helped them out of a bind.  So I think we\u2019re building our confidence and their confidence in us, in this business.  You\u2019re only as good as your last experience, so you, you know, we have to be good every time.  So far, so good, knock on wood.  But you know, we\u2019re not \u2013 we\u2019re far from declaring victory and probably never would anyway, but I think our team\u2019s confidence in the ability to make this a good business is growing.  ","Michael J. Wherley - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","","Okay.  Thanks very much.  The last question I have is just sort of on your LEAN opportunities across TE.  You know, separate from the restructuring, what sort of headwind are you making with LEAN and how does that sort of tie in with the current restructuring?  ","Thomas J. Lynch \u2013 CEO, Executive Director","","The headwind on LEAN is really good and I think you could start to see it in the year last year where we had the actual flight shrinkage in some of our markets, in revenue and overall, and you know, the operating margin held in there nicely.  Three years ago, that would not have been the case.  So LEAN is focused on taking the waste out of the process and it\u2019s a \u2013 it\u2019s been around, it\u2019s a tool-based program, it requires a lot of discipline and strong site-by-site leadership and it\u2019s \u2013 it is implemented at every site we have; some further along than others.  But in at least half our sites, and we refer to it as a Star 3, you get when it\u2019s actually improving your performance.  So it\u2019s a \u2013 it\u2019s a journey that takes a lot of perseverance.  It is helping us, and it is bringing up physical capacity, which plays into some of the decisions we're making now.

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today\u2019s conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Sujal Shah, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Sujal Shah","Good morning. And thank you for joining our conference call to discuss TE Connectivity\u2019s first quarter results. With me today are Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Lynch; President, Terrence Curtin; and Chief Financial Officer, Bob Hau. During the course of this call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information. We ask you to review the forward-looking cautionary statements included in today\u2019s press release.","In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussion this morning. We ask you to review the sections of our press release and accompanying slide presentation that address the use of these items. Press release and related tables, along with the slide presentation, can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at te.com.","Finally, for participants on the Q&A portion of today\u2019s call, I\u2019d like to remind everyone to limit themselves to one follow-up question to make sure we are able to cover all questions during the allotted time.","Now, let me turn the call over to Tom for opening comments.","Tom Lynch","Thanks for joining us today. And here are the key takeaways from today\u2019s call. We\u2019ve begun fiscal 2016 with the quarter of solid execution, delivering $0.84 in adjusted EPS, $0.08 above the high-end of guidance with sales slightly above our midpoint. This was driven by strong performance in our transportation segment and SubCom business in combination with tight cost management in light of the macro environment. Excluding the impact of currency exchange rates, Q1 adjusted EPS was flat year-over-year, and adjusted operating margins of 15.7% were ahead of expectations.","For the full year 2016, we are reiterating our adjusted EPS guidance of $4. This is 11% year-over-year growth and 15% growth in constant currency. Relative to our view last quarter, the transportation segment is a little stronger; global auto production expectations improving. In industrial our direct business with OEMs developed as expected and appears to be stabilizing but sales through our distribution channel were weaker than expected and the recovery is taking longer than anticipated.","The oil and gas market remains very weak with derivative effect impacting some other industrial markets. The midpoint of our annual guidance assumes 2% global auto production growth in our fiscal year. We\u2019re also assuming sequential improvements in industrial sales and orders in the second quarter and into the second half. For the full year in communications, we assume double-digit growth at SubCom, second half growth in appliances and continued decline in data and devices.","By region, we assume that the overall U.S. and European economies continue to grow slowly and China returns to growth in our markets in the second half. We continue to take a balanced approach with our capital strategy, and over time expect to return approximately two thirds of our free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and buybacks with a third of free cash being used for acquisitions, and we\u2019ll talk more about this later in the call.","We are very pleased with the performance of the businesses we acquired last year and will continue to look for acquisition opportunities that broaden our ability to address harsh environment applications and provide integrated solutions to our customers. We believe that integration is another emerging secular trend for our business and we are well-positioned to capitalize with our broad portfolio of products.","In sensors, our unmatched presence across virtually every industry, coupled with a broad technology and product portfolio we acquired is enabling us to expand our design win pipeline across market verticals and provide integrated solutions in certain applications. In medical, we have increased our presence in the high growth minimally invasive market and are well-positioned to provide integrated solutions to our customers that incorporate our connectors, sensors, fine wire technology, and material science knowhow.","While we can\u2019t control the macro environment and inevitable economic cycles, we have positioned TE around harsh environment applications and continue to benefit directly from the secular trends of electronic content growth. We believe TE is uniquely positioned to provide highly engineered solutions that integrate connectors, sensors and other technologies to improve reliability, lower cost, and increased performance, making the Company an increasingly valued partner to our customers. And we have secured several key integrated solution design wins, particularly with major auto OEMs over the last several months prove out this point.","Now, please turn to slide three for a summary of Q1 results. While we continue to have the backdrop of a challenging macro environment, we generated adjusted EPS above the high end of the guidance with sales slightly above the midpoint of guidance. Sales of $2.8 billion were down 7% year-over-year but down only 1% in constant currency. Adjusted EPS was down 6% year-over-year and flat in constant currency. Performance above guidance in the quarter was driven by strength in our transportation segment and higher sales in SubCom, as a key program moved to completion earlier than expected. This coupled with tight cost control more than offset industrial being a little weaker than expected in the quarter.","We generated adjusted operating margins of 15.7% in Q1 which were ahead of expectations, and our adjusted EBITDA margins were 21%. During the quarter, we returned $1.4 billion to shareholders including $1.3 billion in share buybacks. The Board of Directors also approved the recommendation to raise our dividend by 12% with an annual rate of $1.48 per share. We expect this to be approved by shareholders in March and be effective in June. We also paid $127 million in dividends in the quarter. In addition, we returned approximately $1.3 billion of cash to shareholders due to share buybacks.","While down year-over-year due primarily to weakness in China, our transportation segment sales were above expectations with better than expected demand in China. So, China was weak but it was not as we weak as we thought. In the industrial segment, our direct business with OEMs performed about as expected but we did see lower sales through the distribution channel.","Overall, we continued to perform well in harsh environment in applications, last year\u2019s acquisitions in sensors and medical gaining momentum. And during the quarter, we announced the sale of our circuit protection business, which is on track to close later this quarter.","Before we get into the segment update, I\u2019d like to provide a brief insight into order patterns, which will help provide a baseline for our results and expectations. Please turn to slide four.","Organic orders were down 3% from the prior year but were better than our exceptions 90 days ago. Orders were up 3% sequentially excluding SubCom and our book-to-bill was 1.04. China orders were up 11% sequentially on an organic basis and better than expected. These data points are positive indicators for our expectations of second half sales growth. One area that doesn\u2019t remain weak is the distribution channel, where our expectation of sales and orders recovery has pushed out slightly versus our prior view. Distribution accounts for about 15% of our total sales.","Transportation orders improved 7% sequentially, reflecting incremental growth in global auto production expectations. During the quarter, we saw our industrial orders stabilize and grow slightly sequentially with direct orders improving in line with expectations and weakness in the channel that I previously mentioned. Communications orders ex SubCom declined 9% sequentially, driven by previously announced product exits and weakness in the distribution channel.","To provide a little additional color on China, while both orders and sales were down year-over-year in aggregating Q1, we are seeing improvement in auto production; we saw a year-over-year organic growth in orders in transportation. We continued to see China weakness in the industrial and communications segment but are expecting growth in the second half as inventories come more in balance. Excluding SubCom, our book-to-bill ratio was 1.04 in Q1 with all segments book-to-bill exceeding in 1.0.","With that backdrop, I\u2019ll now turn it over to Terrence to cover each of our segments in more detail.","Terrence Curtin","Thanks, Tom and good morning, everyone. If you could please turn to slide five and we will start with transportation solutions. Sales grew 1% organically in the quarter, above our guidance expectations due to China sales being stronger than we anticipated. Overall segment organic growth of 1% was driven by automotive and sensors. Our auto sales organic growth of 1% in the quarter was driven by Europe growing 6% and North America growth of 3% offsetting the expected reductions in China that Tom talked about.","With the orders that we experienced along with production schedules, we expect China to return to growth in the second quarter, reflecting the positive demand impacts from the government tax incentives that are driving increased production levels.","For fiscal 2016, we now expect global auto production to be up 2% to just under 88 million vehicles, with China production up 6% compared to 2015. This compares favorably to our view last quarter when we expected global auto production with China production growth of only 2%. We continue to be confident that our auto business can grow well ahead of production as it\u2019s included in our annual guidance, and this is driven by electronic content growth and a rich pipeline of platform ramps from design wins generated over the past several years.","As expected, our commercial transportation business was down year-over-year, driven by weak global construction and agriculture market, and weakness in the North America heavy truck area. While our sales declined versus last year, our organic orders were up 10% sequentially as we\u2019re seeing signs of this business stabilizing. And we expect to be up to flat low single digits on an organic basis for the year.","Turning to sensors, our business continued to show strong momentum in the quarter in both sales and design wins. Aligned with our acquisition rational, we are using the existing TE go-to-market teams to take new products and system level solutions to our customers. This results in new sensor program awards to cross multiple market verticals. TE is uniquely positioned with the world\u2019s broadest portfolio of connector and sensor solutions, and we have recently been awarded design wins in the automotive space and integrated multiple components to provide a complete solution to our customers.","In this segment, adjusted operating income was $280 million in the first quarter. This was down year-over-year due to currency, a change in product mix and our continuous investment for growth in automotive and sensors businesses. Adjusted operating margins came in higher than we expected and we anticipate the second half margin to be at 20% or above.","Please if you could turn to page six to discuss our industrial solutions segment. Aligned with our expectation, revenue in the segment declined 6% organically year-over-year in the first quarter. As Tom mentioned, we are being impacted by weakness in the distribution channel which is almost 30% of the segment sales organically. Distribution sales were down 6% organically in the quarter, as we see broad-based supply chain corrections occurring that we highlighted last quarter.","Our direct sales to OEMs are improving in line with our expectations and we saw our OEM orders improve sequentially by nearly 3%, while orders through the channel partners remained flat sequentially. We currently expect that our distribution partners will continue to work through the second quarter to get in line with OEM demand. In addition to the distribution channel, we continue to be impacted by the oil and gas market. You can see on the slide, we broke this out separately this quarter and it shows the 44% organic reduction in sales year-over-year in this market and the impact that\u2019s having on the segment.","With the weakness in the oil and gas market, our business is now running at approximately $30 million per quarter, down from approximately $60 million per quarter a year ago. We have seen order rates stabilize around the $30 million level, and we expect a more favorable year-over-year compare in the second half. Also, I want to highlight that the low oil and gas prices are also having some derivative effect in other areas of the industrial segment, impacting sales in our industrial equipment business and areas like factory equipment and rail and also in helicopter demand which affects our aerospace business. These derivative effects are reflected in our guidance and our results.","In the commercial aerospace and defense business, our momentum remains strong with the slight year-over-year decline driven by the defense business due to program timing. We remain very well-positioned with our program wins in the space and expect to benefit from growth in the commercial aerospace and as the defense market continues to improve.","Our energy business grew 4% organically with strength in Europe and the Americas more than offsetting softness in China. From an adjusted operating income perspective, it was $78 million in the first quarter, down year-over-year, as expected due to the impact of currency, declines in our higher margin oil and gas business, and 6% organic decline in the channel. If you exclude the oil and gas business and FX impacts, our operating margins remained constant year-over-year, reflecting the benefit of our TEOA program as well as cost management.","If you could turn to slide seven please, so I can talk about communications solutions. In the first quarter, the segment revenue of $617 million was down 6% and 3% organically as expected. Our SubCom business saw a strong year-over-year growth as we successfully completed the America, Europe connect program earlier than our original plan. We now expect SubCom to grow low-double-digits for the full year, which is slightly better than our expectations 90 days ago.","Our data and devices, and appliance businesses were impacted by the slowing in China as well as the supply chain adjustments by our distribution partner, similar that I talked about in industrial. We expect this to be largely behind us as we head into the second half of the year. And just to remind you, data and devices growth is also impacted by the product exits that we initiated late in 2015 as part of our repositioning effort. From a margin perspective, adjusted operating margins expanded 380 basis points year-over-year, which was above expectations, driven by the early completion of the program in SubCom that we highlighted.","Now, let me turn it over to Bob, who\u2019ll cover the financials.","Bob Hau","Thanks, Terrence and good morning, everyone. Please turn to slide eight where I\u2019ll provide more details on earnings. Our adjusted operating income was $444 million, down 5% in constant currency, due to investments in transportation, impacts of oil and gas weakness, and the distribution inventory corrections impacting our industrial segment that Terrence covered.","Including $30 million of foreign currency headwinds, operating income was down 11% from the prior year. GAAP operating income was $398 million and included $6 million of acquisition related charges as well as $40 million of restructuring and other charges related to data and devices product exits, elimination of corporate stranded costs from BNS divestiture and general cost reductions.","Our Adjusted EPS was $0.84 for the quarter, down $0.05 from the prior year with reduced volume from higher margin products and negative impacts from foreign currency exchange rates, offsetting incremental benefits from the share buyback. Excluding the $0.05 impact from foreign currency, adjusted EPS was flat to the prior year. GAAP EPS was $0.83 for the quarter and included acquisition related charges of $0.01, restructuring and other charges of $0.07 and $0.07 from tax related income. I now expect approximately $85 million of restructuring charges for the full year of 2016, a $10 million increase from our prior guidance 90 days ago.","Please turn to slide nine. While we remain in a challenging environment, the progress we\u2019ve made with TEOA and productivity initiatives enabled the business to demonstrate resiliency as reflected in our margins. Our adjusted gross margin in the quarter was 33.4%. While this was down from last year due to lower sales and higher margin products, it\u2019s up 90 basis points sequentially from Q4. As Terrence discussed in the industrial section, we\u2019re seeing softness in some higher margin businesses like oil and gas, and lower sales to the distribution channel.","Adjusted operating margins decline 70 basis points, driven by lower volume and product mix while benefiting from the early completion of the SubCom program in the quarter. Total operating expenses were $502 million in the quarter, down 8% from the prior year. We continue to tightly manage discretionary spending but are also continuing to invest in our harsh businesses.","In the quarter, cash from continuing operations was $367 million and our free cash flow was $237 million, up from prior year levels due to lower working capital and reduced revenue and timing of SubCom payments.","We continue to have a balanced capital allocation strategy. In Q1, we returned $1.4 billion to shareholders including $1.3 billion in buybacks. In the quarter, we bought back nearly 21 million shares executing against our commitment of returning the proceeds in the Broadband Network\u2019s divestiture. We\u2019re also introducing a chart on EBITDA margins, which better shows the profitability performance of our businesses including acquisitions. EBITDA margins in Q1 were 21% and shows our margin resiliency despite lower sales levels. We continue to be pleased with the operating performance of our business, especially in light of the challenging macro backdrop.","Also you may have seen in the 8-K filed yesterday, Tyco International on behalf of TE Connectivity has entered into an agreement with the internal revenue service to resolve all disputes related to the previously disclosed intercompany debt issues. The resolution would result in a total cash payment to the IRS from TE Connectivity of between $147 million and $163 million, which includes all interest and penalties. We are pleased with the proposed settlement and look forward to having this behind us in the near future. Of course we have also added a balance sheet and cash flow summary in the appendix for additional details.","Now, I\u2019ll turn it back to Tom.","Tom Lynch","Thanks Bob. Please turn to slide 10, and I will cover Q2 guidance at a high level with additional details provided in the slide deck. We expect Q2 revenue of $2.88 billion to $3.08 billion, down 3% or 1% organically, and adjusted EPS of $0.84 to $0.92, down approximately 3% year-over-year at the midpoint but flat in constant currency. Versus our view last quarter, we expect transportation to be a bit stronger, industrial to be a bit weaker, and communications to be impacted by the early completion of the SubCom program we discussed earlier, and most of that was in Q2 when we guided last time.","For the full year, we expect revenue of $12.3 billion at the midpoint, up 1% versus the prior year and reflecting 4% organic growth at midpoint. We are reducing top line by about a $100 million, reflecting the sale of our circuit protection business that we expect to complete this quarter. Our adjusted EPS guidance remains at $4 and represents year-over-year growth of 11% at midpoint. On a constant currency basis, revenue is expected to grow over 3% and adjusted EPS is expected to grow by 15% year-over-year.","Versus our prior view, transportation is expected to have higher growth, industrial is little weaker, and communications is weaker factoring the impact of the sale of the circuit protection business. I think you heard a constant theme that transportation little better, industrial little weaker but overall no big change from the prior guidance.","Our full year outlook is based on the following market and regional assumptions. In transportation, we expect mid single digit actual and high single digit organic growth. We are assuming that global auto production is up 2% year-over-year, which is an improvement from our prior view of flat production. We are anticipating China auto production to grow 6% year-over-year. We expect another year of strong growth in our sensors business. In industrial, we are assuming flat actual and low single digit organic growth. We have seen orders stabilize in some industrial end markets and assume inventories come into balance by the end of Q2, ending the negative supply chain effect on our business. We continue to assume a weak oil and gas market, and will continue to see the signs of the negative impacts in other adjacent markets in the industrial space, which is also factored into our guidance.","In communications, we assume high single digit actual and low single digit organic declines but growth in SubCom and appliances being more than offset by product exits and the sale of the circuit protection business in data and devices.","By region, we assume Europe and the U.S. to continue to improve with China markets rebounding in the second half. Outside of auto, China markets are as expected 90 days ago. Our guidance does assume a 53rd week in current currency exchange rates. As the year progresses, we have much less of a headwind from FX translation and an increase in earning tailwind from our share repurchase program.","We remain positive on our outlook and at several levels to drive growth in a very challenging macro environment. As a result of the transformation of our portfolio and increased focus on harsh applications, we are well-positioned with differentiated solutions for our customers. Secular trend of constant growth is increasingly apparent in our served markets and our ability to produce integrated solutions that saw system level challenges for our customers will enable TE to continue to become an even more valuable strategic partner for our customers in the future. These factors combined with our TEOA initiatives and capital strategy, are expected to drive consistent double digit earnings growth. ","Now Sujal, let\u2019s open it up for questions.","Sujal Shah","Thank you, Tom. Cynthia, could you give the instructions for Q&A session?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question is going to come from the line of Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Amit Daryanani","Thanks, good morning guys. So just to start with on the industrial segment, could you just talk about the margin ramp expectations as you go forward after the December quarter numbers, and is there incremental cost cutting initiatives that you guys are thinking about to help drive these margins potentially towards the mid teens to corporate averages?","Bob Hau","It is Bob. Good morning. We do have some incremental restructuring, as I mentioned our prior guidance included $75 million of restructuring; I would now raise that to 85. In the first quarter we spent $35 million. So, the action that we did have plan for the year, we pulled the trigger little bit faster, so we\u2019ll see some benefit of that in the latter part of the year as well as the increased spending. That\u2019s not particularly directed at industrial; it\u2019s more directed at data and devices where we have the product exits in corporate spending overall which impacts all of our segments from the BNS stranded cost. There is some additional activity and additional benefit in oil and gas that will obviously benefit industrial. Overall as we see volume recover and in particular, as we work through the final implications of the distribution inventory channel recovery in the second half of the year, you will see margins lift obviously at 11% in the current quarter with revenue down and in particular oil and gas high margin in channel -- distribution channel very high margin, you are seeing a negative impact that improves into the second half for year.","Amit Daryanani","And then just as a follow-up, the March quarter guide, I apologize if I missed this but you are looking at sales to be up rather nicely sequentially but the EPS guide -- the operating margins are implied to be down. Is there gross margin dynamic that\u2019s being up sequentially or is OpEx going to ramp up and if so, could you just talk about why and how much?","Bob Hau","There is a number of moving pieces as you move from Q1 to Q2, probably the biggest one, and Tom and Terrence alluded to this a little bit and I made a brief comment on it in my opening comments. Part of the benefit in Q1 was the timing of the completion of the SubCom program that\u2019s a very high margin as you wrap up a SubCom program; you typically record very good margins on that last guest [ph] spending there. And that is pure timing that was completed earlier. So, we saw the benefit in Q1 that holds directly out of Q2 and to some extent Q3.","Operator","Next, we will go to line of Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Craig Hettenbach","Question to Tom, the opportunity in auto seems intriguing in terms of you are talking about integrated products. So, just want to get some background there in terms of the technology pieces you have to offer, really as you interact with customers and suppliers kind of how you see the market evolving there and how you can play into that?","Tom Lynch","Of course in our core of connector business, we have an incredible range of products, and we are in every facet of the vehicle. And that\u2019s supported by almost 2,000 engineers facing the customers. So, you have this tremendous presence at every customer with a wide range of connectivity products. But we also of course now have sensors and a broad range of sensor technology. We have sealing and protecting products, we have relays; we have been doing integration on a very small scale for many years. And with the admen of the sensors in the product line, the ability to go into certain applications, not every applications but the more complex applications and pull three or four different products together which might have been handled by three or four suppliers before and integrate them into a sub-system, take that cost base weight and from a customer\u2019s perspective, it\u2019s one supplier to deal with. So, we have been doing this in the past but the addition of sensors into the product line has really opened up much more for us and we have had some very nice designing wins, I mean significant designing wins in the last six months that -- they won\u2019t start shipping probably for about a year and half to two years. It\u2019s this broad range of products and with all these engineers we have sitting in front of the customer. And we know the architectures almost as well as that customers and doing this for so long. And we have that many engineers, this deep knowledge, and they share with us what their kind of comp is. They are not just asking us for spec. They are telling us this is what we are trying to do. And that really opens it up for us to bring in a solution.","Craig Hettenbach","And just as a follow-up, certainly we\u2019ve seen a lot of volatility and pressure in the equity markets, I am just curious as you look at your M&A pipeline and on the private side you are seeing much change, do you think there could opportunities, any thoughts on that for M&A?","Tom Lynch","As you know, I mean our strategy is around harsh environment, connectivity and sensors. So, we have a robust pipeline that\u2019s based on our product strategy. So, the last -- the first part of your question that\u2019s in a sense what drives our acquisition strategy. We are not just buying parts, we want there to be customer synergy as well. So yes, we expect -- last year, we acquired, closed acquisitions worth about $700 million of revenue. Our goal is to continue to plug in technology and products like we\u2019ve been doing because with all this engineering presence, and all the sales and marketing presence in front of the customer, just think of us adding more tools into our tool bag. And that\u2019s what customers want. So, it\u2019s a pretty powerful model we have. And as you know, we are selective. I mean we don\u2019t do that many. We look hard; we make sure that there is a good fit. But we have a pretty active pipeline. Terrence, do you want to add to that?","Terrence Curtin","No. I think Tom, you handled it well. And I think when you look at last year, and we did do for last year, certainly the big one for around measurements in the sensors as Tom talked about. Also in the medical space that is another example of a harsh environment application, leveraging the capabilities, as Tom talked about your first question Craig. So I think you are going to continue to see things like that. And I think when you think about the pipeline momentum we have, we feel very good about it. And I don\u2019t think there is anything that has meaningfully changed even with all macro backdrop as we look at the pipeline to sort of answer one element of your question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Wamsi Mohan","Your restructuring charges incrementally are going up 10 million over here. But is that enough given that the near-term weakness in data and devices is really pronounced; organic revenues were down close to $90 million, it\u2019s the largest decline in share dollar amount relative to much larger segments. I\u2019m curious, how you see this progressing, especially given that you\u2019re also divesting the CPD business? And I have a follow-up.","Bob Hau","Wamsi, the $85 million as I mentioned is a small increase. We did spend quite a bit of restructuring last year, particularly at data and devices proactively, got at some of the costs as we execute against those product exits that we initiated in the first part of 2015. We took a lot of restructuring charges and started actions. Then as we continued to execute against those exits and revenue declines that\u2019s what\u2019s driving some of the incremental spend. So, we got out in front of it early on in 2015, as we announce those exits and we continue to take out costs where appropriate.","Wamsi Mohan","And as my follow-up, so what\u2019s the margin trajectory that we should assume sort of ex-SubCom within data and devices? Should we be expecting some of these past actions to start to bear fruit from the margin front here through the next couple of quarters? I\u2019m assuming most of the operating margin improvement in those segments came from better SubCom performance in this quarter.","Tom Lynch","Hi Wamsi, this is Tom. I would say you\u2019ll see it next year. The market outlook is pretty weak and we\u2019re dropping -- we\u2019re getting out of a lot of revenue; most of it is very, very low margin. But by the time we get through this year\u2019s restructuring and the product exits, we expect that we will be in the build margin momentum. Because as you\u2019ve heard us say before about two-thirds of the business is very good solid business that\u2019s the core kind of highly engineered products that we do, so next year; I wouldn\u2019t look for much this year.","Wamsi Mohan","Okay. Thanks Tom.","Bob Hau","Wamsi, just to remind you, we\u2019ve got product exits or the divestiture of the circuit protection business that\u2019s part of data and devices that will impact us in the second half of the year. We expect to complete that here in the current quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt Sheerin with Stifel. Your line is open.","Matt Sheerin","A question Tom on your commentary regarding the distribution inventory correction that looks like it\u2019s extending here another quarter. Are you getting a sense that sellout of distribution is stabilized and relatively normal or -- and there is just an inventory build that has to be reduced here or are you getting sense that sellout for distribution is still weak or maybe getting weaker?","Tom Lynch","I\u2019m going to let Terence to handle that one, he was just with that group.","Terrence Curtin","Hey Matt, good morning; couple of insights. I think when you look at it, one of the things that it was weaker, we actually saw the inventory come down as expected with our partner, but sell-through was a little weaker than we expected which is why we see supply chain correction happening impacting our channel partner. So, the inventory bring down in the first quarter on what they had was there with the sell-through was weaker. But we look at as also the direct order patterns that we see. And what we see the direct order patterns on terms that Tom talked about as well as what we\u2019re seeing elsewhere, it does look like it\u2019s going to be another quarter or so that we\u2019re going to have our partners and expect that sell-through to improve.","So, when you look at this quarter, we still expect it to be a weak sell-through quarter. I think when you take our segments like industrial, I think what we talk about, about this quarter we\u2019ll expect the same sort of next quarter from the channel element of it. So, they\u2019re still being worked through and sell-through was a little bit worse than we thought.","Matt Sheerin","Okay, fair enough. It looks like some of the semiconductor suppliers that have already announced earnings have talked about that inventory correction having played out. They tend to lead by a quarter or so. So, that maybe encouraging. And just as my follow-up regarding the recent divestitures of BNS and then now the circuit protection business, are there other things that you\u2019re looking at to divest or is that pretty much done, specifically in the data and devices area where it looks like you\u2019re putting down and deselecting revenue, but are there other parts of that business that you could sell-off?","Tom Lynch","No Matt, you stated it well. It\u2019s much more around product line exits now. Now, we\u2019re pretty -- we feel the portfolio is really strong with the 90% sensors and connectors, 80% harsh and even within the data and devices piece that I alluded to on the prior question, products that are in there are very good products, solidly profitable. So circuit protection was more of a standalone business. It was primarily in the consumer space. So, we\u2019re pretty much -- I never say never because the world is always changing, but the heavy lifting is behind us.","Operator","From the line of Mike Wood with Macquarie, your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi guys, thanks. It\u2019s Ryan filling in for Mike. I just had a question on the destocking that you guys are calling to and this next quarter. What are customers telling you guys that give you confidence that this is happening? And give a rough sense of how much destocking took up the overall orders and particularly in the industrial segment?","Terrence Curtin","Couple of things, what our customers are telling us, certainly we\u2019ve seen, we have their orders with that increase. So as Tom highlighted both in transportation and industrial, we saw sequential order increases and that was driven by direct activity. When it comes into the actual destocking amount, we did think that was around $20 million in the quarter, actually inventory but the sell-through was a little bit worst than we expected, which is why we think it\u2019s going to work through in this quarter. As we try to look at our channel partners, do have to get back to OEM demand that has come back into parity at some point.","Tom Lynch","What I would add to that Terrance is our actual orders from the channel partners were flat this quarter and they had been declining for three quarters. So, it\u2019s one data point and as Terrance said earlier, we\u2019ve got to see the sell-through pick up. And we feel like when you look at the direct business still growing albeit low growth that over time the channel converge with that. Now we are projecting it will converge into low growth with that based on the trends we\u2019re seeing.","Unidentified Analyst","And just a quick follow-up; is there any material end market differences or product differences that explain the trend differences between OEM and distribution other than just destocking?","Terrence Curtin","Distribution is pretty broad-based, so the trend that we have actually seen has been broad based and that\u2019s why you see both the impact in the industrial segment and the communications segment. When you look at the direct business, it varies by end market dynamics. So certainly things like commercial aero are very strong, oil and gas weak, but on the channel side it\u2019s pretty broad based. ","Operator","From the line of Shawn Harrison with Longbow Research, your line is open.","Shawn Harrison ","I wanted to dig into auto a bit. You guys have always been pretty pragmatic in terms of thinking about production rates and where the market is going and it looks like fiscal \u201816 will be a little bit better than you initially thought. But are we entering kind of a peakish production environment? I guess the real question is how long can you -- kind of the strength, can it last knowing that content is always going to be your friend but just wondering are there markets where you are concerned that they could be peaking in 2016?","Tom Lynch","I\u2019d say Shawn, couple of different ways to think about it. And you really got to do it almost by region, right, because Europe has still not got back quite back to pre-financial crisis demand levels. The U.S. while calendar 2015 was a record level, it\u2019s still slightly -- the average age of a vehicle is slightly higher than normal; if that would change dramatically, might get worried. And of course China is naturally slowing down but still going to be a pretty nice growth business in this 5% or 6% long-term. And if you just look at the emerging markets and how many people are coming into the middle class, the trends show get a nicer place to live and buy a car. So, we think those trends are pretty good. And auto production last year slowed a little bit from the prior year, this year it\u2019s in the 2% range. So, it feels very hot when you are in the U.S. but globally it\u2019s still a little bit below, the fiscal 2016 production rate is a little bit below its historical growth rate.","And then on top of that to your other point, the content growth is just consistent in every part of the vehicle. And we don\u2019t see that slowing. And then on top of that the point I made in the comments about this integration. And it doesn\u2019t happen overnight but it\u2019s real. I mean we are being pulled into dozens of opportunities to do this. And this broad product range of ours enables that. So there is multiple drivers. And then of course if the push stays on green, which I think it will, even though oil prices are very low right now, the content in a hybrid vehicle or electric vehicle is a multiple of an internal combustion engine. So, I think that the positive drivers far outweigh the negative drivers. I mean there will be cycles but it\u2019s not like we\u2019ve been in a boom cycle; it\u2019s been over the last five years a little bit higher than normal coming off the prior five years being lower than normal.","Shawn Harrison","And then as the follow-up, I guess I\u2019m struggling with the flat sales in industrial for the year because the first half of the year understanding all the dynamics are probably be going to be down mid to high single digits year-over-year implying you need similar type of growth into the second half. And the direct sales within industrial I think you quote, it was up 3% here in the December quarter. And so there is an implication that we either see some restocking event or some acceleration of true underlying demand in the second half across the entire portfolio. And so I guess I\u2019m trying to dig into whether you expect any restocking in the second half of the year or where do you expect the demand to accelerate to even flat for the year?","Terrence Curtin","Couple of things, Shawn, I do think little bit high on an organic basis when you take currency out. So, when you do look at it, I think there are -- we also were impacted in our fourth quarter on the channel effect as well. So, there is little bit of a favorable compare but we do expect the overall direct business to be about plus 3%. We will get some of the anniversary effects. We do assume that our channel business will get back a parity where ran last year in the latter half. So, there is a little bit of a restock that happens in quarter four due to quarter four being very weak that we talked about last fourth quarter. So, there is a little bit of that effect that helps you get closer to flat. We do have com-air programs that are launching, which is an uptake as well as something in medical that are launches due to the medical side, and the program wins there. So, that are something that are little bit uppers in medical and com-air that help make it little bit rich as well as the distribution channel getting back to more normalized level, more like it was in the middle of last year than where it was in the quarter four on quarter time and certainly the quarter two time that we are in right now.","Operator","That will be from the line of William Stein with SunTrust. Your line is open.","William Stein","First, I would like to dig a little bit into the sensors business, in particular in automotive. It sounds like these are integrating functions that might have already existed in the car. Is that a fair way to look at what\u2019s happening, and the dynamic in this part of your business maybe more of a share gain versus a competitor standalone sensor competitor in that area or is this more sort of new content?","Tom Lynch","It\u2019s a combination. Well, where we are seeing the most opportunity now is in the power train as customers evolve their power train and the ability to integrate in a subsystem, sensors, connectors, rounding, sealing et cetera. So that\u2019s where couple of our more exciting opportunities have been. But we think it will -- where you have sort of larger more complex content, that\u2019s where the biggest opportunity.","William Stein","And maybe you can help me also think about your share and your opportunity in that market. I think you have a very substantial share of automotive connectors and very small share in automotive sensors. Are you seeing any initial effect in sales, not just design wins but actual sales in that market today? And what do you think the pace of your share gains over the next several years?","Tom Lynch","I think it moves slowly. I mean no, it\u2019s not in our sales yet. I mean we are selling at a high single-digit growth rate products we have in sensors. So that\u2019s playing out very nicely according to plan. I would say the design rate in some of the applications that we\u2019re penetrating is playing out ahead of plan; some of them are more rich applications in the auto space. But it will take some time but you are right significant connector share. But by the way, we feel the opportunity continue gaining as we have been with the new applications we are bringing and very small sensor share because we didn\u2019t really have much of a sensor platform. But now with the acquisition, we have pressure, position, humidity et cetera, things we didn\u2019t have much of before. And we are getting design-ins across all of those in the auto space, industrial transportation space.","William Stein","If I can squeeze in one clarification, is the circuit protection revenue included in the March quarter guide or is that it is excluded from the full year, how\u2019s that working?","Bob Hau","We expect that transaction to complete in the latter part of Q2, so it\u2019s -- in part of Q2, it is out for the second half for the year, essentially the drive of the reduced guidance on a full year basis.","Operator","Thank you. And that will be from the line of Steven Fox with Cross Research. Your line is open.","Steven Fox","Just a couple of questions on margins, just looking at off of the base of gross margins you just reported, the 33.4%, you mentioned the bunch of different mix issues going forward distribution, SubCom, appliance, et cetera. How does the gross margin get affected, as we go through the rest of the fiscal year by all these mix changes coming and going? And then I had a follow-up.","Tom Lynch","Steve, there is always mix issues, both favorable and unfavorable. And in the current quarter, we are really seeing a negative mix on oil and gas into distribution channel in particular with the positive lift in the SubCom. The SubCom benefit in Q1 is a direct timing out of largely Q2 but also Q3. Oil and gas really assuming will continue -- really through the end of the second quarter when we start getting easier year-over-year compares and the distribution channel as Terrance pointed out, we have one more quarter of this inventory correction and lower point of sale to work through. So, you will see that improve into the second half for the year. You will also see lower FX impacts as we saw significant strength into the dollar really start in Q2 of last year. And so that year-over-year impact diminishes and of course you get the benefit of more restructuring savings and lower metal costs into the second half of the year that help lift the overall gross margins going forward.","Steven Fox","So, it sounds like, if you add all those up that\u2019s probably a lot of math to do right now, but that you have more tailwinds around gross margin than headwinds as you get into the second half of the year even excluding the volume pick-up?","Tom Lynch","Yes.","Steven Fox","And then just a quick follow-up question on the SubCom business. So, I understand timing had an issue to play here in terms of the margin impact but if you smooth out this quarter and last quarter in terms of volumes and then look to this double-digit growth you\u2019re talking about for the full year, where are the margins improving to in SubCom; how much increases coming through and where are they at versus maybe prior peak levels? Thanks.","Bob Hau","Yes. What we said on SubCom is at the $750 million, $800 million range we are at, we get into the double-digit range. As we see additional volume, if new programs were come into the force and if that volume were to ramp up say to $1 billion, which is really where we peaked in prior years, you start getting up into the Company average to 15%, 16% operating margins.","Steven B. Fox","Right. So all that\u2019s on track once we smooth everything out here.","Bob Hau","Yes. Obviously we saw better than that in the first quarter, and our full year guide is in that about $800 million range. So we\u2019ll see double-digit; we won\u2019t to be up, the Company average is here. [Ph]","Operator","That will be from the line of Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Sherri Scribner","Hi, thanks. I just wanted to make sure I understand the operating margin dynamics in the different segments. I think what you said was that transportation, the margins in the second half would improve to 20% to higher for operating margins; industrial would get better in the second half; and then for the comps business, it gets -- margins get worse in 2Q and 3Q. But I think you\u2019re implying that they get better in the fourth quarter and I just want to make sure I understood those dynamics?","Bob Hau","You\u2019re exactly right Sherri on transportation and industrial, very consistent with what we were trying to describe earlier in the call. From a communications solutions segment, I think the way to think about it is if you just out the timing benefit of the completion of the SubCom program, we still see improvement on a year-over-year basis we\u2019re in double-digits, just north of 10% operating margin. And we\u2019ll see that kind of negative impact of that into Q2, but then more in that 10% range in the second half of the year.","Sherri Scribner","And that\u2019s ex SubCom?","Bob Hau","That\u2019s including SubCom.","Sherri Scribner","Including SubCom, okay, perfect. And then I was hoping to get some comments, Tom, in terms of the macro environment from you. I think you said the China is about as you had expected 90 days ago, but it sounds like most metrics are suggesting China is weaker. So I was hoping you could maybe provide a little more detail and maybe some detail on what you\u2019re seeing in emerging markets.","Tom Lynch","Sure. I mean China is our big emerging market by far. We do have business in Latin America and India, but China is the big one. China was down as we said year-over-year in revenue. It was up sequentially, flat in orders, up sequentially in orders, which is a good sign. And it came back faster than we thought. Now, it\u2019s one data point. We have to see that continue. But we have the first sequential improvement in orders in a year. So that feels like a pretty good sign. I mean we expected that to happen in the second quarter and happening in the first quarter is encouraging. So that was a little better.","If you go around the rest of the world, I think the U.S. in a way was a little worse, because of the industrial and the channel, and oil and gas continues to be down and as Terrance talked quite in detail about the channel. And then Europe continues to be steady, another -- I think it\u2019s 6 or 7 quarters of growth in a row now in Europe. And we don\u2019t see any signs of that backing off yet.","So versus 90 days ago, the outlook feels slightly better because of this industrial OEM orders increasing sequentially and China orders increasing sequentially. Of course this is -- it\u2019s a key quarter for that to continue and to set up. We will get normal seasonal growth in the second half. So, we\u2019ve been seeing our orders trend naturally the way they always do seasonally, as we get towards the second half of the year. But we expect them to pick up from the run rate, because of the correction, primarily in the channel and secondarily. If China continues where it was in Q1 orders would be in good shape for China for the balance of the year, even if it doesn\u2019t raise from there, stayed at that level. Terrence, do you want to add?","Terrence Curtin","Sherri, just one thing I would like to add and highlight is when you look at China, China is over $2 billion of revenue for us and 50% of that is around our automotive business. So, when we talk about our China trends. I know it was a little bit better in our transportation area like Tom talked about and certainly we see production increasing in China, I would say in the greater industrial and other spaces, it\u2019s moving as we expected. It is a little bit more sideways orders are improving, but when you look at it overall, orders increased almost 10% from our fourth quarter to our first quarter, which is a significant step that we didn\u2019t see, as Tom talked about as our orders were stepping down quarter-over-quarter last year.","Sujal Shah","Thank you, Sherri. Could we have the next question please?","Operator","And that will be from the line of Jim Suva with Citi. Your line is open.","Jim Suva","Thank you and congratulations to you and your team there. A quick clarification question and my follow-up kind of back to back on the clarification, you mentioned a second half improvement in industrial. I understand the inventory and distribution issues but what if oil stays at $30; I\u2019m not smart enough to know if it\u2019s going to go higher or lower but if it stayed at $30, is that supportive of your second half recovery view; does that pose a risk or does that impact it at all?","And then my follow up is on the timing of the stock buyback given the BNS sale. Can you help us understand the cadence that we should expect about that? I mean in one hand you\u2019ve been very diligent and always bring back stock each quarter; on the other hand, one would say well why not do a big accelerated program, so you get a bigger EPS benefit sooner, especially given the recent stock price volatility? Thank you very much.","Terrence Curtin","Let me take the industrial question on oil and gas and Bob will take the share repo question. On oil and gas, one of the things that we have seen, certainly the program element of the oil and gas market, we\u2019ve seen in our step down of revenue. So, like I said last year early in the year as well as year before, we would run about out 60 million a quarter. Our business as it\u2019s come down and oil has been impacted, we\u2019re seeing a lot of those large projects obviously not happening, and there is not being a lot of large projects being bid. The $30 million per quarter level that we have right now is sort of a maintenance type revenue level for us; it\u2019s not big project build. So whether it\u2019s 25, 35, 40, I do actually think that\u2019s a floor that we\u2019re going to be pretty close to plus or minus little bit. So, I do think that element that we have in our forecast reflects current oil prices.","Bob Hau","Jim, on the share repurchases, our intention remains -- we expect to be completed with the return of the proceeds from the BNS transaction in third quarter. As you know, we looked at a variety of different mechanisms to return that cash, as we transitioned through -- between announcement and actual closure and came to the conclusion that that answer was open market transaction. There is a lot of reasons why an accelerated share buyback doesn\u2019t work for us, the easiest way to understand is we\u2019re a Swiss company and rules are different for Swiss companies even though we\u2019re registered on New York Stock Exchange and that makes an accelerated very difficult to do.","Sujal Shah","Can we have the next question please?","Operator","And that will be from the line of Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Mark Delaney","The first question is on the automotive business. And I understand the long-term content opportunity but in 2016 given that you are seeing China stimulus targeted towards low end cars, are you seeing any short term mix effects that are headwinds for content in the near-term that you thought about?","Terrence Curtin","Mark, hi; it\u2019s Terrance. Clearly size of engine does impact; it\u2019s just not that meaningful. I think when we take the penetration that we\u2019ve done in China, both with the local OEMs and the multinational OEMs and mix effect isn\u2019t what it used to be and it is reflected in our guidance. Certainly it\u2019s focused at 1.6 liter engines and below, the stimulus. And what\u2019s good is we cover every OEM there and we have content on it. So, it is in our guidance but it\u2019s pretty minor.","Mark Delaney","And then follow-up question for Bob on the potential tax settlement, if that does get finalized with the IRS, how should we think about both other income and the tax rate going forward?","Bob Hau","As you might guess Mark that gets really convoluted, really quick, I think the most straight forward answer to give you is the settlement is not yet final; it\u2019s proposed; the two sides are largely agreed. We\u2019re working through a lot of nuances within the IRS to get that finalized. And at this point anything I would give you would be speculation and hypothesis. We are very comfortable, and as stated in the 8-K we are very comfortable that we are adequately reserved. And so there won\u2019t be an additional charge. And going forward, once the settlement is actually finalized, we will give some detailed guidance on the implication of other income and the go forward effect of tax rate.","Sujal Shah","Thank you, Mark. It looks like we have no further questions. So, we thank you for joining us today. If you do have further questions, please contact Investor Relations at TE.

(Operator Instructions) And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Keith Kolstrom, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Keith Kolstrom","Thank you. Good morning and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss TE Connectivity's first quarter fiscal 2014 results. With me today are Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Lynch; and Chief Financial Officer, Bob Hau.","During the course of this call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information, and we ask you to review the forward-looking cautionary statements included in today's press release.","In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussion this morning, and we ask you to review the sections of our press release and the accompanying slide presentation that address the use of these items.","The press release and related tables, along with the slide presentation, can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at te.com.","Finally, I would ask for -- participants on the Q&A portion of today\u2019s call that everyone try to limit themselves to one follow-up question to allow enough time for everyone to get their questions in during the allotted time.","Now, let me turn the call over to Tom for some opening comments.","Thomas Lynch","Thanks Keith and good morning everyone.","If you turn to Slide, I think its Slide 3 that's the summary of our results. The company is off to a very good start in Q1. The majority of the markets we serve continue to improve and we are executing well. Following are some of the key highlights of the quarter.","Orders increased 8% in the quarter and our book-to-bill is 1.03 excluding our SubCom business. This is the third consecutive quarter of organic orders growth. And the strength was broad based across all regions and in the majority of our businesses. Organically sales were up 7% overall and up 8% excluding SubCom.","The transportation market continues to be very strong and we are the clear leader in this market and capitalizing on the strength. Our industrial markets and our telecom markets continue to improve in the quarter. This more than offset continued weakness in SubCom and DataCom.","Adjusted operating margins were 14.6% up 220 basis points over the prior year, stronger revenue, productivity gains driven by our TEOA program, increased savings from restructuring and metal tailwinds drove this improvement. We are on track to exceed 15% adjusted operating margins for the full year at $14 billion sales level.","Adjusted earnings per share of $0.82 was up 26% versus last year and $0.06 better than the mid-point of our guidance. Free cash flow is $266 million and put us on track for another year of 10% plus cash flow as a percent of revenue.","As a result of the strong Q1 and strong orders performance, we are raising the mid-point of our full year adjusted EPS guidance by $0.10 to $3.75. This is an increase of 16% versus our prior year performance. And additionally, our Board has recommended that at our annual meeting in March, our shareholders approve a 16% increase in the dividend.","Please turn to Slide 4. This Slide summarizes revenue by segment. I will now go into each segment in more detail unless I indicate otherwise all changes are on an organic basis which reflects the effect of currencies, acquisitions and divestitures.","Please turn to Slide 5. We had another strong quarter in transportation sales of $1.44 billion were up 14% over the prior year and orders were up 13% with the book-to-bill of 1.02.","Global auto demand continues to be strong running a little head of historical long-term vehicle growth levels. Vehicle production in the quarter was about 20.8 million units up 4% from last year. Revenue from the heavy truck market was also very strong in the quarter due to the improving economy and the acceleration of purchases and advance of new emission standard in Europe and China. And as I said last quarter, the Deutsch acquisition is really helping in this market.","Revenue grew in all regions this quarter. Europe was up about 11% due to strong exports and slight improvements in local demand. We are encouraged by increased new car registrations across most of Europe in December, the first time it's been this broad based in a while. We do believe pent-up demand and gradual improvement in the economy are driving this and expect to have another solid revenue year with our European customers.","In the Americas, revenues were up 15% due to continued strong demand and share gains from our investments made during the downturn. We expect solid production growth to continue through FY 2014.","Asia revenues were up 17% with 30% growth in China and 27% in Japan. We expect to continue our momentum across Asia through the year.","Our margin improvement was due to a combination of favorable mix with more heavy trucks than the industrial transportation market. Stronger overall volume, productivity improvements driven by our TEOA program and favorable metal cost. We expect another quarter of double-digit growth in Q2 and mid to high-single digit sales growth in the second half.","Please turn to Page 6, market demand in the industrial solutions segment continue to strengthen through the quarter and our revenues were up 6% and orders were up 9%. This performance was inline with our expectations. Similar to last quarter, the industrial equipment, commercial aerospace and oil and gas market continued to have strong demand and we expect this to continue for the balance of the year.","Our energy business grew 4% in the quarter, but we do see signs of softening in the next couple of quarters especially in Europe. We also believe the defense portion of our business should pick-up a bit based on the resolution of the U.S. government budget.","Looking forward, we expect another good quarter in Q2, the sales up about 6% due to the trend we discussed.","Please turn to Page 7, performance in our network solution segment was mixed in the quarter and overall in line with expectations. Sales of $713 million were flat versus the prior year. On the positive side, the telecom networks business grew 11% in the quarter driven by increased investments in fiber optics networks. The enterprise business was up 6% with growth in all regions, offsetting that our DataCom business was down 8%. We are making progress in high-speed system wins, but we do continue to lag the market in mid and lower speed, which is where most of the volume is today.","The SubCom market continues to be slow in projects going into force but our backlog of awards continues to be strong. We still expect the business to pick up in the second half due to two new projects which we expect to come into force this quarter.","Margin in this segment were adversely impacted by two assets write-offs, excluding these write-offs adjusted operating margins were about last year. We expect Q2 results to be up slightly versus Q1 and I would expect our normal seasonal second half pick up in the segment in addition to an increase in SubCom revenues as these new contracts come into force.","Adjusted operating margins in the second half are expected to be back to double-digit based on \u2013 low double digits based on the expected volume increase.","Please turn to Slide 8, revenue in our consumer solutions business was up slightly in the quarter, the overall trends in this quarter was similar to Q4 of last year, improving demand in the appliance market, declining PC demand and strength in tablets and smartphones. We are capitalizing on the stronger appliance market where we have the leading market share. We have adjusted into the PC decline in our consumer devices business and are making gradual progress in smartphones and tablets.","Adjusted operating margin in this segment was similar to the prior year. In Q2, we expect revenue to be down 3% to 4% versus the prior year. However, adjusted margins are expected to be similar to the prior year levels.","Now, let me turn it over to Bob Hau to cover the financials in more detail.","Robert Hau","Thanks Tom and good morning everyone.","A quick footnote of Tom's market comments, effective for the first quarter of fiscal 2014, we realigned certain businesses principally the relay products business within our segment reporting structure to better align our product portfolio. Approximately $100 million of annual revenue, which was previously reported as part of the appliance business inside the consumer segment has been moved to the industrial equipment business in the industrial segment.","We have included a Slide in the appendix of today's presentation, which provides the impact of each of the quarters of fiscal 2013 and 2012 for reference.","Now, let me discuss earnings which start on Slide 9. Adjusted operating income was $486 million up 25% from the prior year. GAAP operating income was $479 million and includes $7 million of restructuring charges in the quarter. As I mentioned on the earnings call in October, we anticipate a substantial reduction in the level of restructuring activities in fiscal 2014, which charges for the full year of approximately $50 million versus $311 million of charges in fiscal 2013.","Adjusted operating margin was 14.6% up 220 basis points from Q1 last year. The improvement is a continuation of a strong momentum that was achieved through the course of fiscal 2013 and a change versus the prior year is driven by 7% organic sales growth, productivity from TEOA, cost savings from restructuring actions taken in the last couple of years and favorable metal costs.","Adjusted earnings per share were $0.82 and GAAP earnings per share were $0.85 for the quarter. GAAP EPS included $0.01 of restructuring and other charges and $0.04 of income related to legacy shared tax liabilities.","Turning to Slide 10, our gross margin in the quarter was 33.6%. This is a 200 basis point increase versus the prior year due to volume increases \u2013 increased productivity from TEOA or lien programs and cost savings from restructuring. Total OpEx spending was $631 million in the quarter, which is up 5% versus the prior year. The increase resulted primarily from increased selling expenses to support higher sales levels and increased variable compensation cost partially offset by cost savings attributable through restructuring actions.","On the right-side of the Slide, net interest expense was $29 million in the first quarter and I expect approximately $27 million of expense in the second quarter and similar levels through the remainder of the year. Adjusted other income which primarily relates to our tax sharing agreement was $7 million and in line with guidance. In the second quarter, I expect other income of about $6 million.","The adjusted effective tax rate was 26.1%, which was higher than our guidance of 24% to 25% due primarily to a one-time expense of approximately $10 million related to a change in tax laws in Europe. I expect the tax rate to return to the 24% to 25% range through the remainder of the fiscal year.","Turning to Slide 11, I will discuss our balance sheet and free cash flow. Cash from continuing operations was $387 million and our free cash flow in Q1 was $266 million. Net capital spending during the quarter was $121 million, or about 4% of sales. I continue to expect capital spending rate to be approximately 4% to 5% of sales for the full year.","Receivable days outstanding were 62 days, which is down slightly versus the prior year. And inventory days on hand were 74 days consistent with prior year levels. Both metrics remain in line with our expectations.","Let me discuss sources and uses of cash outside of free cash flow shown on the right side of the slide. We began and ended the quarter with $1.4 billion of cash. During the quarter, we returned a total of $315 million to shareholders. We paid dividends of $103 million, repurchased about 4 million shares for $212 million. We expect additional share repurchases of $150 million to $250 million per quarter during fiscal 2014. Our outstanding debt was $3 billion at the end of the quarter.","Now, I will turn it back over to Tom.","Thomas Lynch","Thanks Bob.","Please turn to Slide 12, and I will cover our outlook. As I said earlier, this was a very good start to the year for TE driven by a strong transportation market, continued improvement in most industrial markets and strong execution across the company. And order trends were strong in most of our businesses.","Based on these trends, we expect Q2 revenue of $3.4 billion to $3.5 billion, which is an organic growth rate of 5% to 8%. We expect adjusted earnings per share of $0.88 to $0.92, an increase of 16% to 21%.","In Q2, we expect another strong quarter in transportation and a good quarter in the industrial segment, network and consumer results will be largely similar to Q1. For the full year, we expect revenue of $13.8 billion to $14.2 billion, which is organic growth of 4% to 7%. We expected adjusted earnings per share of $3.55 to $3.85 and this is an increase of 13% to 19% and as Bob mentioned a $0.19 in our guidance from last quarter for the year.","Just to close, the momentum we saw in most of our markets in the second half of our last year has continued through the first four months of this year, these improving market conditions coupled with our operating leverage improvements driven by TEOA and the accelerated restructuring last year should enable us to deliver strong performance in fiscal 2014.","Now, let's open it up for questions, operator please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Mike Wood, Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Mike Wood - Macquarie","Hi. Thank you. Congratulations on the quarter.","Thomas Lynch","Thank you.","Mike Wood - Macquarie","In terms of just some more color on the European growth on the transportation side, it looks like you are forecasting 3% vehicle production growth for the full year next quarter. Recently you have been exceeding that by a substantial margin in terms of your sales. You have mentioned exports, how much of that is actually related to any kind of a pre-buy in the C&I side of the business in Deutsch related to the emission standards changing?","Thomas Lynch","There is clearly some of that, just to keep in mind of our total transportation, industrial transportation is in the neighborhood of 15%. So while it's definitely a good thing, it's not that much overall leverage on the segment.","The European light vehicle market has especially with the German OEMs significant amount of exports and a lot of that is premium cars to the U.S. and China where we have very nice content. So that help to offset what has been for several years now weak global demand in Europe that is, as I mentioned, we are encouraged to see over the last couple of months and especially in December, our pick-up in year-over-year new car registration. It's not a long trend yet, but it feels like in talking to our customers its moving in the right direction.","So we expect another solid year with our European customers.","Mike Wood \u2013 Macquarie","Okay. And in DataCom, you'd spoken previously about skipping a product generation there moving too quickly to more advanced speed connector. But you are redesigning that 10 gigabyte speed connector. How is that acceptance going, are you just too late to kind of make traction in that particular product?","Thomas Lynch","I'd say we're doing well in high speed in terms of customer selecting us for next generation. It is going slower than we would have thought a year ago and that whole market if you watch the big equipment OEMs, there is a lot of dynamics in that market right now and the net effect for us is the switch to new higher speed solution it's taking longer. So, it's going to be, I think a couple of years before we meaningfully move the \u2013 a meter in our DataCom business. Given that I mean its good product line, important product line to us and it's also their products that ultimately move into other parts of our business down the road, but it's been slower than we would have thought for the reasons I said.","Mike Wood \u2013 Macquarie","","Okay. Thank you.","Thomas Lynch","You're welcome. Thank you.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Yes. Thank you. Good morning. Which geographic regions did you see the strength in industrial transport. And Tom even for that 15% of revs you're talking about, what sort of growth did you actually see in that part of industrial transportation? And have a quick follow up on margins.","Thomas Lynch","","The overall growth was well north \u2013 was north of 10%, very, very robust double-digit. Again, some of that is go forward, we did see very nice growth in China and Europe, solid growth in the U.S. What I would expect will happen is that will moderate especially in China and Europe where the new standards are being implemented, that will moderate in the second half, but I would expect the U.S. will continue to improve as the economy improves.","Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Thanks Tom. On margins then should we expect the margins to sort of play out at this level, so maybe the mix becomes less of a benefit, but you continue to see volume growth as Europe improves through the course of year?","Thomas Lynch","Yes, Wamsi. That's a good way to think about it. We won't have as much favorable mix from the industrial transportation group. We will continue to see nice volumes and get the benefits of that. And the metal levels made them pretty steady now for couple of quarters. So, while there is year-over-year tailwinds on a sequentially through the year, I wouldn't expect that. So I would think of the transportation business continued nice sales growth really solid sales growth in this margin neighborhood.","Robert Hau","Wamsi, I would expect that mix to moderate which means the year-over-year margin expansion will slow. In this quarter we're looking at 440 basis points, we will continue to see that but I would continue to see very good margins across the segment going forward.","Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks a lot.","Thomas Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","","Thank you. Next, we'll go to line of Matt Sheerin with Stifel. Your line is open.","Matt Sheerin \u2013 Stifel","","Yes. Thank you. Obviously you have had nice margin expansion in transportation; industrial as well. But looking at the other businesses, particularly the computing, the consumer business, what drives those margins? Is it volumes at this point? And looking within that business, I know you have some PC exposure. You talked about weakness there; it looks like demand is beginning to stabilize. And then also in terms of your position on the mobility side, what is your outlook in terms of market share opportunities there?","Thomas Lynch","So Matt regarding the margin question, I think your characterization is accurate that we are -- in the transportation and industrial business we're getting less due to volume and productivity. In the networks and consumer business I feel good what the team is doing productivity-wise, but we're not getting the volume yet, different reasons overall in networks we got a very slow SubCom business and the DataCom that I already talked to.","In consumer, while PC is hopefully the rate of decline will start to level off which will help us. But we're making that's a slow steady progress in the tablets and smartphone, it doesn't really have \u2013 even though the product cycles are shorter than in the industrial business for sure, it's still you got to win one designing at a time. So until we begin to see our overall volume in consumer devices get consistently over 5% or 6%, that's what it's going to take to begin to move the margin up.","In the consumer Solutions segment the appliances business is a very nice margin business at about company average and starting to grow again with the improving economy.","Matt Sheerin \u2013 Stifel","Okay great. And then a question for Bob on the margins. In some of the commentary you talked about some materials benefits particularly metals. But could you talk about other things like copper and gold for instance and any tailwinds there in terms of margins and benefits on costs?","Robert Hau","Yes. So overall in the first quarter, we did definitely see a tailwind of metals which for us is really copper, silver and gold. And those probably about $15 million, $16 million benefit in the quarter. For the full year, we're actually expecting about $50 million or $60 million so that quarterly $15 million, $16 million or so will remain in effects for the balance of the year.","Matt Sheerin \u2013 Stifel","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go to line of Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets","Thanks a lot, good morning guys. I've two questions as well. Maybe just start off on the transportation side. For the last couple of quarters, and especially the December quarter, your business was up 14%, production was up 4%. If I look at that 10% of out performance, if you may, it seems to be a lot more than just content growth of the Euro -- E6 mandate helping you out. I'm curious; maybe you could talk about that 10%. How much do you think is content versus potential share gains versus new platform wins? I'm trying to get a sense of can you sustain this kind of out performance going forward?","Thomas Lynch","Well, I think very strong performance for a couple of reasons, some of it is mix again with the industrial transportation business where we have a very strong position as a result of combining Deutsch with our legacy TE industrial transportation business. And that business is growing much faster right now than the auto business which is still growing light vehicle is still up plus 10% for us.","In certain markets in China, in the U.S. we think we continue to gain share, we really invested -- have invested in those markets particularly during the downturn and now that's starting to show up in our revenue. So but and I do think you'd expect to see us drop down to high single digit growth in the second half of the year in the overall transportation segment. It feels like we gained a little bit of share year-over-year.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets","That is all. Then just on the network solutions side, demand has been challenging for you guys for several quarters now. And if you think of the headwinds in DataCom and Subsea really, do you think you have to look at options to potentially further right-size this business, or do you feel comfortable looking at the book-to-bill that demand will come back in the back half and you just got to wait for that revenues to flow in? I'm just curious how you think about rightsizing the business versus waiting for demand in the back half right now.","Thomas Lynch","Well, I think there are two different answers to that. SubCom, I think we're positioned, it's been slower than we thought. I'd be more worried if there wasn't as much project activity as there is, that those projects have to turn into come into force. So we feel reasonably confident although this market has slid on us for the last two or three quarters but we're very strong in the market. I don't think we've ever been stronger in terms of our product offering. So that market comes back with our strength in it we're confident we'll do very well and we think we'll start to see that in the second half.","DataCom is a little bit different. We're not strong in that market. We have done a lot to adjust our cost structure to reflect that without -- we haven't reduced our engineering investment. And so that we do have a significant engineering investment for IT type solutions there both in fiber and copper. As I mentioned, they are going slower, I don't, we have no intention to take more cost out of the business. It's an important business for us. We believe it's really upside for us, but I think if you go back to where I thought would be a year from now, I thought that would be more deployment of high speed than there is, so it is definitely pushing out of the improvement in the business for us. But tweaking the strategy, yes, but no fundamental change to it.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets","Got it. Thanks a lot and congratulation on a good quarter.","Thomas Lynch","Thank you, Amit.","Operator","Thank you. Next we'll go to the line of Shawn Harrison Longbow Research.","Shawn Harrison - Longbow Research","Hi, I'm going to beat networks maybe dead in a bit. But even margins flat year-over-year I would have thought with the metals tailwind with a little bit of restructuring you would have been able to do better. Is the margin at DataCom that much richer compared to everything else in the business and so that with DataCom being down so substantially year-over-year explains why margins would have been a little bit better?","Robert Hau","There is a number of points in I think Shawn around all that. The telecom business is growing and improving. The SubCom business is one of the lowest points in the last six or seven years. So we're getting really zero leverage out of that business right now. And we think we're at the bottom as I said earlier. The DataCom business is, it's in a turnaround really for us, there is no question about that. So it has the potential for high margins. We did write a few assets off in networks, which further took a low margin lower but we think there is opportunity improvement, but it's not going to be sudden, we're going to need more volume.","I feel good about the cost structure because as you pointed out, we did take costs out we're just not getting the volume to take advantage of that right now. But in telecom, we have a leading product line in fiber optic, in SubCom we have a leading product line. In DataCom we trail although for the future, we have a good product line but that's got to turn into reality. And in enterprise we have a solid product line in that business is historically a low growth business and we're right in there with that.","Shawn Harrison - Longbow Research","But let's say I take an optimistic, glass half-full view and two years out DataCom recovers, is the margin profile in that business better than kind of the networking average which should be mid teens and so you would get a I guess a greater lift as that business accelerates, is that what really needs to happen?","Thomas Lynch","Yes, we need more revenue and we need particularly the industry to start moving to high speed. When you dissect that business without getting into too much detail, the high-speed stuff is a lost leader and our core business while we're not a leader in mid to low speed solutions, it's a solid business. We're just, we've been investing a fair amount in high-speed fiber and copper and so with very little revenue in there, it has the effect of exacerbating the margin on a downward -- in a downward way in that business.","Shawn Harrison - Longbow Research","Okay. And then just as a brief follow up. Bob, I think last quarter was $60 million to $70 million in restructuring savings that were supposed to benefit the model this year, did that change?","Robert Hau","We're actually seeing slightly better than that. Right now restructuring is a little bit close to $70 million to $80 million.","Shawn Harrison - Longbow Research","Then the aggregate number of $100 million, did that change at all?","Robert Hau","No, a little north of that which is what we have been saying previously.","Shawn Harrison - Longbow Research","Okay. Thanks so much and congrats on the quarter and guidance.","Thomas Lynch","Thank you.","Robert Hau","Thanks Shawn.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go to the line of Jim Suva with Citi.","Jim Suva - Citi","Thank you and congratulations to you and your team there on good results. A quick financial question for Bob and that's on restructuring followed by a more fundamental question probably for your team. But I think you'd mentioned that restructuring looks like its going to be coming down lower this year. Can you help us quantify that a bit more, I think you gave a little bit of numbers there. And is that then a recurring rate sustainable at that or were you looking at lower rate one-time this year, and if so it appears like this rate could be so low.","Are we looking at folding it into your normal operations? Then for the more operational question, when we look at content growth for vehicles, I think in the past you gave some commentary in kind of long-term 6% to 8%. With cars going more and more to hybrid and safety and emissions always continuing to improve. Is there a chance of that 6% to 8% actually starts to increase or goes to the higher end or even above the higher end of that? Thank you.","Robert Hau","Yes, Jim. It's Bob. On the restructuring, we spend about $7 million this quarter roughly inline with what we anticipated previous guidance and still guidance today is about $50 million on a full year basis that's down dramatically from prior years. Last year we spent just north of $300 million. And we think ongoing natural restructuring charges of -- business of our size given the nature of our markets and then customers, it's probably $50 million to $75 million. So we're a bit below \u201cnormal\u201d right now that's largely given the amount we spent last year.","And as we've said before, we talked a little bit about in our Investor Day, we are looking at ways to fold it in. I think it's important to describe it and disclose it externally whether investors dial it out or roll it back in, it's up to them, we'll give them the information. One of the big reasons that we still have today adjusted earnings versus GAAP earnings and we're still dealing with the tax sharing agreement pre-split and some of those numbers can move significantly, would be very disingenuous to only talk about GAAP earnings. But we certainly look to a) settling the tax sharing agreement over the next couple of years and b) much lower restructuring charges.","Thomas Lynch","Hey, Jim. On your other question, we've typically talked about content of 4% to 6% and I do think that there is more likely for that to go higher than lower that's the way I would say. And I walked around in Detroit last week and walked through the auto show and you can feel it you really, I mean we obviously see it in our business and its our biggest business, when you see 100 cars on the floor and you can track them with the features they have versus the prior iteration of a particular model you can feel it.","So I do think, it's more likely to go up slightly than down, those at a metered pace just because of the product cycles and it doesn't happen over night, designing new features but it's a really good trend and its why we're excited about the business so much.","We -- also historical production rates that tended to be 2% to 3%, we think for the next few years or the industry I should say think that could be up a point, a point and a half and that was a very, very low growth in demand for local demand in Europe. I think that most of the trends are positive. In China, you have dealers starting to finally expand in the tier three to six cities, so you\u2019re going to \u2013 we expect to continue to have a robust automotive market there. So the combination of more likely upside in production than downside versus the historical rate and more likely upside in content than outside, I think makes it a very attractive market for many, many years.","Jim Suva \u2013 Citi","Great. I think I got my numbers. Of the 4% to 6% that is content growth and 6% to 8% is then when you add on the global SAR or the global units of auto production and so 6% to 8% is what the sales rate is and content of 4% to 6% is that kind of what you're seeing?","Thomas Lynch","Yes. That's what we're seeing. And that's and of course netted into that is price, which is moving up a little but where as you can see in our margins we're able to give the customer the price that they need and keep the margins moving in the right direction.","Jim Suva \u2013 Citi","Great. Thank you and congratulations again to you and your team.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Mark Delaney, Goldman Sachs.","Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs","Great. Thanks very much for taking the question and congratulations on a strong quarter. I don't understand on the margins there has been a tremendous amount of year-over-year improvement in the adjusted operating margin, 14.6% this December quarter versus about 12.5% a year prior.","I am hoping you can help me understand within the March quarter guidance maybe the bridge from last year. So specifically, by my math, the March quarter implied operating margin guidance is right around 15%?","And then the revenue level at the midpoint is pretty similar to the revenue that you guys did for the September 2013 quarter. I would think that there is maybe some metal pricing benefits versus the September 2013 quarter and then some restructuring benefits that are coming through. Given that you did the 15.7% in the September quarter, I'm just trying to hope you can walk me through how you are thinking about getting to the 15% or so in the March quarter of fiscal 2014?","Thomas Lynch","I'd describe it, Mark, is steady -- continued steady volume growth where we'll get the lift there. The metal difference isn't that much from two quarters ago. It's been a nice tailwind but it's not that much incremental. We are investing more there is no question so we are -- we believe continuing the strength in the product line and just continuing to invest in the emerging markets and engineering and selling. So we are continuing to invest. But over all would expect to continue to drive the margin up and we were pleased with the productivity.","Our price erosion is up a little bit not dramatically but there is no question that has typically happened with particularly copper hanging around at this rate for a while relative to where it was 18 months ago that customers are expecting appropriately some of that back. So we have pluses and minuses but net-net very good momentum in the margin.","Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs","Understood. Thank you for that. For my follow-up question at the Analyst Day Tom and Bob, you guys talked about looking at doing a more acquisitions, I think may be on the tuck-in type of size. Can you give us an update on how that's progressing?","Thomas Lynch","Well, it's -- we did the two big once and we've been continuing to build our pipeline especially focused in anything related to transportation and the broader industrial markets. So we keep plugging a way there, it's an active pipeline. We're always talking to people but we're thoughtful about it. Number one, really fit strategically and obviously we would be -- got to be able to create value with it. But we expect it to be a \u2013 an important part of how we grow the company on an ongoing basis. But we feel good about the organic momentum particularly obviously in transportation and industrial and we have to continue to \u2013 we have to get it going in the other two.","Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs","","I understood. Thanks and congratulations again on a good quarter.","Thomas Lynch","","Thank you, Mark.","Operator","","Thank you. Next, we'll go to line of William Stein with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I'm hoping you can clarify the comments about the changes in demand in the automotive end market related to the new emission standard. I assume you are talking about Euro 6. Can you clarify whether that relates to light cars or a heavy trucks and to verify your comments about pull-in in light cars to get ahead of this rollout?","Thomas Lynch","Yes, well, let me \u2013 I'm glad you asked. So I can clarify it. It's really in the truck market for instance. So that's where we see what looks like accelerated demand we've had, the older version trucks because the new ones are more expensive, not an unusual thing in this market it's not the major thing driving us. We believe improving economic environment plus the age of the trucks on the road are an even bigger part of that. But clearly for the first half of this year the very high growth rates of course in the industrial transportation which is only 15% of transportation are being driven by the \u2013 our customers ordering are really good.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","","Great. That's helpful. And if I can ask one follow-up. I'm hoping to hear a bit about demand in inventories in the channel relative to your direct business.","Thomas Lynch","The channel was a little bit slower in December than we expected, it's still a solid business. So we did see the kind of \u2013 it's really not unusual calendar year end inventory tightening. I think not a big number and not different from our expectation kind of in line with our expectation. So when you look at it more sequentially from our fourth quarter into the first quarter definitely a little bit softer because of adjustment. But, I don't see any overhang or anything like that out there and talking to our distributor partners.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Great. Thank you.","Thomas Lynch","Thanks Will.","Operator","","We have a question from Sherri Scribner, Deutsche Bank.","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank","","Hi. Thank you. I just wanted to dig a little bit into the improvement you're expecting in the second half of the year in networking and consumer business. I know you talked about some orders that you're anticipating. And it sounded like you're expecting some additional strength in the SubCom market. So I was just hoping for a little more detail on the strength in the networking piece in the second half of the year.","Thomas Lynch","Networks, we'll typically have a seasonal peak. So in telecom especially primarily in telecom weather get better, we see the business pick up. So we're really in that business pretty much looking for a similar pick up first half, second half that we saw last year. SubCom is much more related to contracts coming into force and the big thing is we're counting on two contracts to drive that. We got the contract, find the contracts all that. So we would expect that they'll go into force but until they do anything can happen. So that's a big thing driving network. In consumer, it is a little more of continuing to getting traction.","In appliance, I would say if the economy continues to improve, that business naturally follows the economy. So that's less seasonal and more economic related. Consumer of course has its peak in the quarter, the quarter and a half before the Christmas season. But we're not looking for anything dramatic in the second half in the consumer business and even relatively and that's a small business for us. So relatively it's nice but absolutely in terms of it, affect on the overall company is kind of a penny a quarter, I think Bob in that range. So it's not a big lever. We're trying to make it a bigger lever.","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank","","Okay. And then based on the guidance if I do the math, it looks like it's a midpoint for your fiscal 2014 guidance at $14 billion in revenue. Your operating margins are somewhere around 15.5%, I know you've said that you could do plus 15% but are you comfortable with sort of a 15.5% operating margin for the year and that would suggest some decent operating margin leverage in the second half?","Robert Hau","","Yes, sure. At midpoint to that $14 billion the operating margin is above 15.3%. And yes, export we are comfortable with that given the progress we saw going through much of last year and in the first quarter around overall benefits of our lien initiatives what we thought TEOA as well as the improved benefits from restructurings and metals tailwind gives us confident so that, that 15.3% and that generates the $3.75 earnings at mid-point.","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank","Okay. Is that assuming that SG&A is relatively flat from first quarter levels or do you see some declines in that based on the productivity improvements? Thanks.","Robert Hau","Overall for the year, SG&A is about 13.5% of sales.","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank","Okay. Thank you.","Robert Hau","Thanks.","Thomas Lynch","Thanks Sherri.","Operator","","Thank you. We have a question from Steven Fox, Cross Research.","Steven Fox - Cross Research","","Thanks. Good morning. Just going back to the operating margins for a second, if I look at the transportation and industrial margins, it seems like there was a greater drop through effect on both sides of the business on a quarter-over-quarter basis. So on the positive sales from transportation you pull down greater than average drop through and the reverse was happening on industrial. Can you just sort of breakdown how much more was related to metals in those segments versus \u2013 I don't believe there was a lot of restructuring but what else was driving that because I'm just (inaudible) those numbers? Thanks.","Robert Hau","Hi, Steve. I think I'd point to the two things. Number one, better volume better revenue left in those two segments so you'd get the benefit of the buying leverage into our factories. And then from a metal standpoint in particular relative to networks, the other three segment that's much more metal content. So you see that $15 million or $16 million of year-over-year benefit really layered into the other three segments where networks doesn't participate. All of our businesses clearly involved in TEOA and lead, but there is a significant extra lever when you get volume leverage.","Thomas Lynch","But when you compare auto or transportation or industrial as well is -- there is sales per part in transportation higher so that's a higher volume business than industrial sales. You're not going to typically have the same fall through but we feel in the industrial business overall there is nice opportunity to fund the metal margin improvement through TEOA, we'll further along with that in transportation than we are in industrial, so we expect to see the same kind of improvements.","Steven Fox - Cross Research","","Great. That's helpful. And then just quick follow up on China, Tom. Given how fast it is growing, could you just talk a little bit about within the China market especially on the auto side where you think you're picking up share from a content standpoint, is it helping or hurting the overall content growth for the company within auto given the mix differences and why you think you're picking up that share little bit more color would be helpful. Thanks.","Thomas Lynch","Sure, thanks. Well, I think the momentum piece is, I mean we've been in China a long time and we are \u2013 I mean our whole team is local. So, we have a very, very strong seasoned team that is a local team that's been in the business a long time that's been developed by our other teams around the world. So we have a lot of know-how there and we work with every customer. And we bring the bear the technologies from the other parts of the world. We're strong. We're as strong with the local customers as we are with the multinationals. While the content per vehicle in the locally produced cars is less, it's rapidly rising at a greater rate because in order to compete in that market you have to have the features that the multinationals have.","So, I think that while the overall contents for vehicle in China is less than it is. And Germany for sure it's raising at a faster rate. And in China for the local customers, we provide a much -- in some cases a much broader product range than we do other places because the customers need the expertise. So that has helped us, that four, five years ago we decided to kind of get \u2013 I don't want to take services in the sense that we charge for services because we don't really do that, but we help a lot in the design of the electrical system for the local customers because they wanted to help. So that's helped us. That helped us a lot. And you just see the continued expansion and especially demand for high-end cars. So while the low end car, overall there is lower content, you are selling a lot of premium cars particularly from Germany into that market where we have a significant content.","Steven Fox - Cross Research","That's very helpful. Yes. Thanks very much. I appreciate it.","Thomas Lynch","Thanks Steve.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Amitabh Passi from UBS.","Amitabh Passi - UBS","Hi. Thank you, Tom. I had a question and then a follow-up. I guess the first one was just a big picture question. It seems to me when you embarked on the ADC acquisition and Deutsch part of the motivation was to sort of diversify your growth drivers and your portfolio. Yet if I look at the numbers today about almost 45% of your sales are coming from transportation and about 60% of your EBIT dollars. So just curious as you look at your portfolio, and I know you touched on this but would like to get more details, is there an appetite maybe to accelerate the inorganic element to continue to sort of balance out the portfolio, both from a growth and profitability perspective?","Thomas Lynch","Amitabh, I would say the way the underlying strategy of Deutsch was harsh environment. So with our sweet spot, what we are best at and where we think the most value we can add and the most value we can extract is in the really harsh environment. And so we are not \u2013 I'm not worried at all about the transportation business getting bigger if it's for natural reasons, right, the market is growing, we are strong. We do well there. The customers really value the full value proposition we bring to support them in every part of the world.","I think the industrial business benefited from those two, so half of the revenue it came from Deutsch, half one in transportation, half one into our industrial solutions business and (inaudible) which \u2013 now we have the almost $1.1 billion business as a result of that acquisition. And again, enabling us to do other things that we wouldn't have otherwise done because of the width of the \u2013 breadth of the product line.","So if you think of us, we like the harsh environment. That's where we are best at. We are clearly better at it than we are in consumer and DataCom and networks are important to us and we think we have a lot of value add there. But, we are not really on a strategy to try to lessen our participation in transportation because if you just look at the underlying trends there, it's just more content and there is still a long way to go.","So we want to continue to be strong there. And of course, we want to \u2013 the way, I characterize our four businesses, transportation is a great business and we are really good at it. Industrial is a good business and we are good at it with the opportunity to be better. Network solutions on a mix of solid business, we believe the fiber part is really a good business to be in because the bandwidth demand and we are good at it. And consumer we are getting better but we are not good. And we have a terrific team in there that's changing it and so we view that as opportunity \u2013 selective opportunity as we say.","So that's how we think of the portfolio and we think all four of the segments need to have the right attention in order to be the best. So we are not really trying to deemphasize transportation.","Amitabh Passi - UBS","Okay. Perfect. Then just as a quick follow-up, I would like a little more insight into the telecom networks piece of network solutions. You grew almost 11% year-over-year. I think you are guiding to 5% growth. Verizon seems to be deemphasizing investments in wireline. MDN was the hot topic two years ago, it kind of fizzled out. So just as you look at project activity which areas and regions are you most excited about and why after growing 11% in the first quarter, do you still think it's a mid single-digit growing segment this year?","Thomas Lynch","I mean, I think 11% was driven very strong by some wins in South America, some accelerated activity in Europe. We expect those to level off. There is uncertainty around MDN, it's still in an early stage far enough that I don't think anybody is going to turn back if there is a question of how deep will they drive the fiber. And probably won't see everybody get fiber-to-the-home. But it's going to be fiber deep which is still a really good business.","If you go back to the prior quarter it was a different part of the world, the important thing, the encouraging thing but we need to see it quarter after quarter after quarter is it just more project. So we \u2013 as I think, I said in Investor Day there is a lot more projects in the last year than they were the year before that. But it tend to be a lumpy business.","Our fundamental belief is that when you model data flow, you got to have the fiber network deeper than it is. You don't have to go fiber-to-the-home to give the consumer a good experience, but you need to have fiber setting the offload even from a LTE network deeper than its generally in the network around the world, which is why we think its 5% to 6% growth business over time. But it does take fortitude to ride through the cycle and last year we took a lot of cost out to make sure that whatever cycle it is that we are probably above cost of capital kind of return.","So that's how we see it right now. We don't expect 11% growth over the balance of the year.","Amitabh Passi - UBS","Okay. Got it. Thank you so much and good luck.","Robert Hau","Thank you.","Thomas Lynch","Okay. Well, thank you very much and for those of you like us who fought through the snow to participate, we appreciate it. Again, a good quarter and more than anything I think it reflects a lot of the actions we have taken over the last several years certainly it's very nice to see general economic improvement. We are not giddy about \u2013 hey, all of a sudden we are in the high growth area. We continue to be focused and we look forward to talking to you in the not too distant future. Thanks for joining us.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference.

Welcome to the TE Connectivity First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host Vice President of Investor Relations, Sujal Shah. Please go ahead.","Sujal Shah","Good morning and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss TE Connectivity's first quarter results. With me today are Chief Executive Officer, Terrence Curtin; and Chief Financial Officer, Heath Mitts. During this call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information, and we ask you to review the forward-looking cautionary statements included in today's press release.","In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussion this morning, and we ask you to review the sections of our press release and the accompanying slide presentation that address the use of these items. The press release and related tables, along with the slide presentation, can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at te.com.","Note that all remarks on today's call will reflect TE continuing operations. We completed the sale of our SubCom business during our first quarter and it is reflected as discontinued operations and not included in our results or guidance.","Finally, due to the increasing number of participants on the Q&A portion of today's call, we\u2019re asking everyone to limit themselves to one question to make sure we can give everyone an opportunity to ask questions during the allotted time. We're willing to take follow-up questions, but ask that you rejoin the queue if you have a second question.","Now let me turn the call over to Terrence, for opening comments.","Terrence Curtin","Thanks Sujal and thank you everyone for joining us today to cover our first quarter results and our revised outlook for 2019.","Before I get into the slides, I\u2019m going to provide an overview of the key messages in today's call. First off, I am very pleased with our results in our first quarter. We delivered revenue, the midpoint of our guidance and adjusted earnings per share at the high end of our guidance range in a market that continued to soften through the quarter.","Our results reflected resiliency, as well as the diversity of our portfolio, with our Industrial and Communications segments, offsetting lower than expected sales and transportation. And while our quarter one results demonstrated solid execution, softer market conditions are resulting in us having to reduce our outlook for the rest of our fiscal year.","I want to stress that the change in our guidance versus our prior view is entirely due to market softness that we're experiencing and if you look at this change by region, it is primarily driven by China, along with a slower global auto production environment than we anticipated 90 days ago.","We continue to be focused on content growth outperform these slower markets, while we execute on other non-growth levers in our business model to drive improvements and profitability as we'll move through this year. And with this on the backdrop, let me tell you how we\u2019re thinking about financial success in 2019.","As I just mentioned, we have a portfolio with content growth opportunities that will allow us to outgrow, as well as partially buffer the weaker market conditions we're seeing. We remain committed to our long term business model, we\u2019ll pull the non-growth levers to improve margin and EPS, while ensuring we invest in long term opportunities to drive future content growth.","When we look at earnings power, we expect to demonstrate earnings per share performance in the second half of 2019 that is above our exit rate in fiscal 2018, while absorbing the FX headwinds we're experiencing and that we'll talk about in the call.","And finally we believe this huge success will position the company to be backed the business model performance which we've demonstrated over the past two years when markets return to growth.","So with that as a backdrop let me get in the slide and I'll get into more details and highlight the quarter on Slide 3. Sales during the first quarter were $3.35 billion which was flat year-over-year on a reported basis and up 2% organically, driven by 5% growth in both our Industrial and Communication segments.","In Transportation, our sales were flat organically with a slight decline in auto revenue being offset by growth in commercial, transportation and sensors. Global auto production was down 7% in the first quarter, well below our guidance expectations.","In auto, our sales were down only 1% on an organic basis compared to that 7% decline in production. And it demonstrates the resiliency of content growth in our auto business even on a top production environment.","In the quarter we delivered 16.9% adjusted operating margins. Our revenue was down over $160 million sequentially as expected and I'm pleased that we could maintain operating margins that were essentially flat from our 2018 exit rate on a much lower sales volume. Adjusted earnings per share was a $1.29 in the quarter which was at a high end of the guidance.","From a free cash flow perspective, during the quarter we generated $69 million, which was in line with our expectations in similar to quarter one of last year and we returned $645 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in the quarter.","Now, let me turn from the first quarter and talk about our revised outlook. Back in October when we issued guidance for the year, we highlighted that we were entering a slower market environment. During the first quarter, our order trends were below our expectations with weaker global oil production, and lower order levels in China in our Transportation and Communication segments. Our overall orders in the first quarter were down 4% sequentially and on a year-over-year basis total orders were down 6% with China orders declining over 20%.","Based upon these trends, we now expect fiscal year sales at the midpoint of $13.65 billion versus our prior guidance of $14.1 billion. Versus our prior view, this is a change of $450 million at the midpoint in revenue. This reduction is primarily driven by China with some weakness in European auto as well.","If you look at the change by segment, approximately two-thirds of the reduction is in transportation with the remaining primarily in communications as both transportation and communications are being impacted by the weakness in China.","In our Transportation segment, we are now assuming that global auto production will decline 4% to 5% in our fiscal year compared to our prior outlook of flat production in our fiscal year. Our expectation for the industrial segment are consistent with our prior view with the ongoing strength that we're experiencing in the end markets specifically commercial, air, defense as well as medical.","With this revised sales outlook, we are adjusting our earnings per share is now expected to be $5.45 at the midpoint, and this is a reduction of $0.25 from our prior view. This change in our EPS guidance is entirely driven by the market change and the headwind on currency exchange effects that we highlighted last quarter remains essentially unchanged at $375 million in sales and $0.16 on EPS.","So if you could please turn to Slide 4, let's look at order trends. On this chart, you can find the details. But I want to highlight what has changed over the past 90 days. As I mentioned earlier, orders were below our expectations. When we got it 90 days ago, we were expecting that our orders in quarter 1 would be similar to our quarter 4 levels at $3.5 billion. But instead, orders declined sequentially by 4% and our book-to-bill in the quarter remained at 0.99.","On a year-over-year basis, organic orders were down 4% driven by declines in China of 22%, as well declines in Europe of 6% partially offset by growth in North America of 7%.","By segment, you can see on the slide we continue to see strong industrial orders that continue to support our growth outlook that is consistent with our prior view. However, as you can see in transportation and communications, you can see the weakness we\u2019ve experienced in orders which relate primarily to China and that's impacting our outlook.","So let me get into things by segment and if you could turn to Slide 5 I will start with transportation. Transportation sales were flat organically year-over-year. Our auto sales were down 1% organically versus auto production declines of 7% in our first fiscal quarter, and this was well below our production assumption that we expected when we guided.","We did see growth in the Americans which was offset by lower sales in China and Europe. China auto production was especially weak and it declined 15% year-over-year much worse than we expected. Even in this weaker environment, the 7% decline in auto production our results driven forcibly outperform auto production.","In commercial transportation, we have been expecting growth to moderate from the strengths we've had in the prior years. During the quarter we grew 2% organically versus markets that declined 7% driven by China, and our growth in this area also continues to be driven by content and share gains.","In our sensors business we grew 4% organically year-over-year with growth driven by industrial applications, and in auto sensors we continue to increase our design win value across a broad spectrum of sensor technologies and applications.","Adjusted operating margins for the segment were 17.9%, this was essentially flat sequentially as we expected. In 2018 as we discussed with you, we increased investments to support strong pipeline and new design wins including those in electric vehicle and autonomous driving applications.","With production falling considerably both in China as well as in Europe, we are continuing to balance near-term margin performance with long term growth opportunities and while we're running currently below our target margin levels in this segment, we expect that cost actions that we will be taking to enable our margins back to the target levels.","Let me turn over to industrial solutions and that's on Slide 6. Industrial segment sales grew 5% organically year-over-year as expected with growth across aerospace, defense, as well in our energy business.","Aerospace, defense and marine business delivered strong 13% organic growth with double-digit growth across each of its businesses. In commercial aerospace, growth was driven by content expansion and share gains and the ramp of new platforms and in defense over the past year, we've seen nice growth here being driven by favorable market, as well as some new product cycles.","In industrial equipment, our sales were down 1% organically with strength in medical offset by the expected deceleration in factory automation. And lastly, our energy business grew 6% on an organic basis driven by growth in North America.","Adjusted operating margins for the segments expanded 60 basis points to 14.9% and was in line with our expectation. Our plans continue to remain on track to optimize our factory footprint in the industrial segment to expand the adjusted operating margins to the high teens over time.","So please turn to Slide 7 and I\u2019ll get into our Communications segment. Communications grew 5% organically as expected with strong growth in data devices being partially offset by appliances. Data and devices grew 9% organically with growth being driven by high-speed connectivity and data center applications.","Our appliance business was down 2% organically due to weakness across Asia, partially offset by growth in North America. Adjusted operating margin for the segment was 16.4% in line with our expectations.","Before I get into guidance in more detail, I'm going to turn it over to Heath to get into more details on the financials in the first quarter.","Heath Mitts","Thank you, Terence, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 8, where I\u2019ll provide more details on the Q1 financials.","Adjusted operating income was $565 million with an adjusted operating margin of 16.9%. GAAP operating income was $484 million and included $75 million of restructuring and other charges, and $6 million of acquisition charges.","As a result of market weakness, we are broadening the scope of our cost initiatives across our business and accelerating cost reduction and factory footprint consolidation plans. You should expect us to aggressively pursue incremental restructuring to reduce our fixed cost structure, while balancing the investment opportunities which enable future growth. And we're confident that with these initiatives, we expect to exit the year with a more nimble cost structure, which will enable future margin expansion and earnings growth. We're currently working through these restructuring options and we'll update our estimates as the year progresses.","Adjusted EPS was a $1.29 at the high end of our guidance range and included $0.05 of headwinds from currency and tax rates. GAAP EPS was a $0.11 for the quarter and included restructuring and other charges of $0.16 and acquisition related charges of $0.01. The adjusted effective tax rate in Q1 was 18.1%. And looking ahead, we do expect a slight decline in our tax rate in Q2, for the year, we expect the full-year adjusted effective tax rate to be in the 18% to 19% range.","Now if you turn to Slide 9, sales of $3.35 billion were flat year-over-year on a reported basis and up 2% organically. Currency exchange rates negatively impacted sales by $73 million versus the prior year. We expect the full-year impact of currency exchange rates to be $375 million which is consistent with our prior view.","Adjusted operating margins were flat sequentially as expected at 16.9%. And as Terrence mentioned earlier, I'm pleased that we could hold operating margins flat in the fourth quarter with over $160 million of sequential revenue decline.","We do expect Q2 margins to modestly drop from Q1 levels as we adjust our operations to the lower outlook. In the quarter, cash for continuing operations was $328 million, that's up 16% year-over-year and free cash flows nearly $70 million, which is in line with our typical seasonality with $209 million of net CapEx.","Also we returned $645 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in the quarter. And of course this includes the return of proceeds from the sale of our SubCom business that we completed last quarter.","As I\u2019ve told you in the past, our balance sheet is healthy and we expect cash flow to be strong, which provides us the ability to provide organic growth investments to drive long-term sustainable growth also allowing us to return capital to shareholders and still pursue bolt-on acquisitions.","With that, I will turn the call back over to Terence to cover guidance.","Terrence Curtin","Thanks Heath. And let me start with the second quarter on Slide 10, build on some of the things he said.","With the slower market conditions we're experiencing, we do expect quarter two revenues and adjusted earnings per share to be roughly flat with quarter one, certainly building on the orders chart I talked about earlier. Second quarter revenue is expected to be $3.3 billion to $3.4 billion with adjusted earnings per share of a $1.25 to a $1.29 for the quarter. At the midpoint, this represents year-on-year reported and organic sales declines of 6% and 2% respectively.","Given the ongoing strength of the U.S. dollar, we do expect year-over-year currency exchange headwinds of approximately a $155 million on the top line and $0.06 to EPS in the second quarter.","By segment, we expect Transportation Solutions to be down low single-digits organically. Auto revenue is expected to be down mid-digits organically versus a global decline in auto production of 9%, driven by weakness in both China and Europe. Once again, our top line will outperform versus auto production as it shows the benefit we derive from content.","Industrial solutions is expected to grow low-single digits organically with growth in AD and then the medical applications being partially offset by softness in factory automation applications. And we expect a communication segment to be down mid-single digits organically driven by Asia.","If you could please turn to the Slide 11 and I'll get into more details on the full year guidance for fiscal 2019. Building on my earlier comments around market and order trends, we expect full year revenue of $13.45 billion to $13.85 billion. This represents flat sales organically and reported sales decline of 2% due to foreign currency exchange headwinds of $375 million. And as I said before this headwind is consistent with our prior view.","Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $5.35 to $5.55 per share. This guide includes a $0.25 negative impact from both currency exchange rates as well as tax. Excluding these headwinds, adjusted earnings per share would be growing low-single digits at midpoint and a flat organic sales top line.","Now let me get some color on our segments for the full-year. We expect our Transportation Solution segment to be flat organically. We also expect auto sales to be flat organically with content growth enabling outperformance to offset 45% decline in global auto production.","When we look at global auto production to be now 45%, we expect auto production in China to be down 10% in our fiscal year, Europe to be down mid-single digits, and North America to remain roughly flat. And when you think about, this is reflects our assumption that global production and units will remain around quarter one production levels which was around 22 million vehicles per quarter throughout our fiscal year.","We are also expecting continued growth in sensors in both industrial and auto applications driven by the ramp of the new auto design wins that we've talked to you about. In Industrial Solutions, our outlook is unchanged from our prior view. We expect sales to be up low single-digit organically with growth driven by aerospace, defense and medical applications, and clearly our 6% order growth in the first quarter support is unchanged the outlook.","In Communications, we expect to be down low single-digits organically, driven by Asia markets in both data and devices, as well as an appliance. So, as before we go to questions, let me just summarize some of the key takeaways and I'll reiterate some of the things I said at the front end. In the first quarter, you saw the positive impact of our diverse portfolio with revenue and EPS in line with guidance in quarter one, despite a soft marketing from our kind of motorman.","I\u2019ll revise 2019 guidance is driven entirely by weaker markets. This is primarily driven by China with some weakness in European auto as well and by segment, approximately two-thirds of the reduction is in Transportation with the remaining in Communications.","We also remain committed to our long term business model and we're going to be pulling the non-growth levers to respond to market conditions. When we have seen weaker markets in the past, we have taken advantage of the opportunity to aggressively go after cost reduction and consolidation activities, and we plan to follow the same approach and emerge with increased earning powers when markets return to growth.","And as I stated upfront, we expect to demonstrate earnings per share performance in our second half that is above our exit rate in fiscal 2018 even with our revised sales outlook. We are focused on ensuring the company will be back to business model performance when markets return to growth. And lastly, before I close, I do want to thank our employees across the world for their execution in the first quarter, and also their continued commitment not only to TE, but also our customers and a future that is safer, sustainable, productive and connected.","So with that, Sujal, let\u2019s open now for questions.","Sujal Shah","All right. Thank you, Terrence. Craig, could you please give the instructions for the Q&A session?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of David Kelley from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","David Kelley","Just a quick one on Transportation Solutions in autos. I guess if we look at your global vehicle production assumption for the full year, as you sit down 4 to 5, it seems like it\u2019s in line where I think both - most are expecting given the recent downturn in China and maybe your September fiscal year-end. How should we think about the regional cadence, you're building into the back half of the year? And then I guess more importantly, the softer macro in anyway changed your customers' approach to electrification and connectivity and the related orders you're seeing there?","Terrence Curtin ","So, let's take it - I\u2019ll start with the second piece and then I'll get into the regional if that's okay. Thanks for your question, David. First of all when it comes to electrification and autonomy or connected vehicle, I would tell you that nothing has changed. The amount of car rates that we have and it's one of the things we will balance to the softer environment to make sure we capitalize on those trends and you also see the benefit of those trends even in our first quarter, where our sales were down in a much worse production environment. And I think you're going to continue to see that content growth even in this weaker period where we outperformed production.","Now when you think about your first part of your question, so let me go back a little bit and talk about auto. Clearly production is slower than we expected. When we started the year and we guided 90 days ago, we guided to what we thought was going to be a flat environment. We thought relatively flat in Asia, relatively flat in North America and slightly down in Europe.","Clearly car sales in China were very weak in the first quarter, production adjusted in and we're also seeing production been adjusted here for the rest of the year. So, when we look at it, we do expect China production to be down 10% this year, European auto to be slightly worse than our prior guidance going to more mid-single digit down versus slightly down that we set the core, and North America staying where it is.","Actually when you think about how we see that going throughout the year, we\u2019re actually seeing and expecting from what we hear from our customers production is going to be more constant throughout the year than you normally would see. So with this week first quarter around 22 million units, we do expect that production is going to stay around 22 million units per quarter in our fiscal year plus or minus a little bit.","So one thing I do want to stress and you mentioned in your comment anything we talk about auto production is on our fiscal year basis, which is very different than how others talk about which is more calendar basis.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan from Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Wamsi Mohan","Terrence, really says that even in a 5% production decline environment, you're actually able to show auto revenues flat organically. Your fiscal 2019 guide obviously implies a 4 to 5 point like content growth over here. So can you just talk about what you're seeing within the pipeline that suggests that customers might not be mixing down or is this actually assuming that customers do mix down and that's why the content is 4% to 5%?","And just to clarify, Heath can you just talk about the magnitude of that restructuring charge that you are taking and maybe which areas of the segment that will impact because you are already doing some restructuring on industrial and I'm assuming this was incremental to that, so if you could clarify that'd be helpful? Thank you.","Terrence Curtin","Sure. Wamsi, thanks for the question and let me take the first half. Number one is let's go back to how we talk about content growth and how we\u2019ve talked to you about and how do we think about it. And it has been in a 4% to 6% content range. And over the past couple of years, we've had a constructive production environment. You saw us actually overachieved that 4% to 6%over the past couple of years.","And that also, you\u2019ll see a little bit of supply chain effect, take that up in a growth environment. When we look at it, you're exactly right. We're still towards the lower end of our content range this year. There will be a little bit of supply chain effect, as well as lower value vehicles but that's included in our guide, and that's why you see it more towards the lower end of the content growth.","I would say on a quarter-by-quarter basis, as supply chains adjust to a slower environment, you may see some separation that ounces around a little bit like we've always told you, but long term, the 4% to 6% and what we see the trends going and I think all of us who purchase new vehicles, you see the content around autonomy see, certainly the electric vehicle continues to pick up, no matter and it's also new product cycles and launches.","And those launches typically happen later in our year, and due to product cycles don't typically hit early in our fiscal year, they typically hit later in the year and there, assume that our guidance as well. So with that, I\u2019ll turn over to Heath.","Heath Mitts","Wamsi, it\u2019s a good question on restructuring. As you mentioned, we had already had some assumptions in with our prior guidance and consistent with what we had talked publicly about over the last year and a half or so, which is some of the footprint consolidation opportunities within our industrial segment.","We are broadening that as I mentioned in the opening comments, across portions of the rest of the other two segments, part of that is volume driven and part of it is taking advantage in this weaker revenue environment, opportunities to get after some things that we may not have been able to do, where capacity would have stood otherwise.","So in addition to Industrial, it hasn\u2019t broadened. And then the other thing to think about, we did sell the SubCom business and closed on that last quarter. And when you remove $700 million of revenue out of your P&L which is roughly what SubCom represented to the corporation, we do have some stranded costs in the middle of the P&L and operating expenses that you will expect us to tackle and we are going after those as well.","In terms of quantifying it, we're still in the process of several of these initiatives. We're not in the point now, where I will want to dwell with the number but certainly as the quarter progresses and we get this call back together in about 90 days, we'll give you an update in terms of both the magnitude of charge over and above what we guided, and what you should expect from a savings profile from now.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Christopher Glynn","Just had a question about how much you think you've been able to ring fence or de-risk expectations here. Does it feel like kind of stable at a weaker run rate or market is still kind of searching for what the lower levels might look like?","Terrence Curtin","No. Chris, I would tell you, you know order rates are staying right around this one book-to-bill. So, I would say other than China which was meaningfully weaker in our first quarter, it does feel, it's stable at a lower rate. And if you think about our guide change, we needed to step up and we sort of expected orders to stay around that $3.5 billion in our first quarter, and a little bit softer than due to China. So, we're looking at our order rate even in early January, does feel stable at a lower rate.","Certainly, we're continuing to watch it. And we need to focus on clearly what we can control that Heath talk about. So, and it's very - it is mixed, you see only orders, our industrial orders were up 6%, and we see very good strength in aerospace, in the medical. We also continue to see broadly, very strong growth in the United States. So, there are mixed views between different angles you look at it. But China was weak across the Board and the adjustment is primarily due to China that we're adjusting to.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Craig Hettenbach","Terrence, just a question on the broad-based weakness in China which has been evident kind of through the supply chain. But just you have end markets which are clearly slowing, but there's also likely inventory management happening. So any additional color you can shed on that in terms of your discussions with the customers and distributors as to how they're managing the weaker demand environment, and where you think they are at this point from an inventory perspective?","Terrence Curtin","Well, in China, as I said on the call, our orders were down 22% and auto was weak, due to the weaker decline. And we\u2019re planning the supply chain, you're always going to have some supply chain adjustment that's happening as people relook at their production to their end customer. So, whether that\u2019d be a car buyer or an appliance buyer, anything else that is happening and so, we are going to work through as they do it and that as the supply chain element to it.","Typically, they last three months to six months. So, depending upon the market, I would say we\u2019re sort of in the early innings of that is what we're going through. I would say that is not consistent globally in places we have a healthy environment like in industrial, like in North America. I would say we see pretty healthy demand orders. We don't see contractions, but certainly in China we are seeing some contraction as people it's just normal behavior.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Leiker from Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.","Joe Vruwink","This is Joe Vruwink for David. When I think about your orders in Asia since the middle of last calendar year, it's kind of gone from rising high-single digits to now down pretty heavily. And since the middle of last year obviously there's been escalating trade tensions and China's underlying economy has slowed. Have you given some thought, if we get maybe trade resolution or China explores a more aggressive fiscal stimulus, not just monetary stimulus, how quickly your business in Asia could potentially come back?","Terrence Curtin","That a question that's probably beyond me. So when we look at it, clearly there's a lot of moving parts in the world, we would like all the moving parts, because we're global free traders, might we able to give everybody confidence.","But when we look at it, we do not have stimulus in our guidance, is the way they should be thinking about it. And we would like constructive resolution to those matters but we've got to plan to what's in front of us and the environment we're seeing and that's what we\u2019re doing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line Shawn Harrison from Longbow Research.","Shawn Harrison","A question I guess specifically for Heath on capital return and buyback. So buying back was greater than - buyback was greater and all in the first quarter. I think that was mainly the tough comp proceeds. But you guys are, one could argue, under-levered right here, if this is going to be the bottom over the next couple quarters for your business, do you get more aggressive with the buyback in the year and is there a number to think about, and is it \u2013 is that in the guidance?","Heath Mitts","What's assumed in our guidance - first of all, Shawn, thanks for the question. You're correct. We\u2019ve returned $645 million in the quarterly, roughly $500 million of that was the buyback. And this proportion, remember that $500 million did come from the SubCom proceeds, which was about $300 million.","So we obviously put that to work in terms of getting that back to the shareholders as we had committed to when we announced that transaction. As you think about the year in terms of the buyback, we generally say about a third of our free cash flow goes towards the buyback. So let's assume that's about $600 million, you can layer in on top of that, the SubCom amount and that gives you up to about the $900 million number. I think that's probably a fair way to frame that out.","Now, in terms of, we are always looking at opportunities to intelligently deploy capital, that's not suggesting that we're going to do anything in terms of additional leverage, but we will flex from time to time in terms of where our capital is deployed and at times, when we look at the stock price relative to with the intrinsic of value of our company based on our strong free cash flows, that dislocation does create opportunity from time to time and we will flex a bit higher as it makes sense.","So we'll keep you posted, but I'd say from a modeling perspective, you can use kind of the normal one-third plus the SubCom proceeds.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Mark Delaney","Thanks for taking the question which is on data and devices segment, which I noted quite well this quarter and I think it is benefiting from data center. So if you can help us understand how much of data and devices is now tied to a particular data center? And it seems like in a go forward view of data and devices that there's maybe some weakness that's coming up in Asia for data and devices, if I read your slides correctly. So can you talk about what may be weighing on some of the incremental view in data and devices for the balance of the year. Thank you.","Terrence Curtin","Mark, it\u2019s Terrence, thanks for the question. First off if you\u2019d like we think about data and devices and a lot of the repositioning we've done at that unit it was really around making sure that unit has pointed to high speed. Certainly the hyperscale which is broadly when you think about that entire high speed market is very lever to Asia you know the whole supply chain certainly some of how the ODM elements tie into it.","But we look at hyperscale we do expect hyperscale to continue to grow nicely. We do see their capital being down slightly not down in dollars but the growth rate declining a little bit over last year.","And the other thing that we saw was during the quarter - later in the quarter due to how much of that supply chain around it, that we did see orders around that supply chain get conservative. So I do think the positioning of the business is very strong. Certainly we're experiencing the broader Asia weakness is touching that like our other businesses.","And what I would say it\u2019s more around what we're seeing in Asia which is well above 70% of the revenue in that segment - well above 50% sorry, the revenue in that segment is tied to Asia. So it is something that we're being caught up with some of the other weakness we are seeing in that region.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano from Cowen. Please go ahead.","Joe Giordano","Quick one for me. So just first in, in terms of China auto I'm just curious is to how like orderly that 15% decline has been and I know the landscape there are very different than U.S. and Europe with a lot of OEM. So are you seeing like some trying to be opportunistic and take share from others during this kind of environment.","And then I guess this - the second part of the question kind of spread more to communications too. But as we recover ultimately from some of these declines, do you think there's a fundamental change in the competitive position of non-Chinese companies and in those markets and as these markets start to grow again, will they gravitate more and more towards local producers of content than our Chinese own?","Terrence Curtin","Well, let me start with the automotive piece. Certainly, when you take our position in automotive and the share we have in automotive, no different than we did in our last week period we had. We gained share and while we will adjust our cost base. One of the other things that's very important is that we're also very much focused on winning at the same time and when you think about our coverage in China, where we cover the entire landscape of the 50 OEMs that are in China through broad technologies. We will focus on gaining shares.","So, I don't see some of the adjustments we're making impact and share there are actually very much discussions around how we gain share in these market environments, when other competitors typically scale back.","In the data and devices side, certainly there\u2019s an element which goes support China and then parts that support the globe. I don't think the competitive dynamic will change and what supports the globe certainly there is a piece that is very much around China OEMs. I think we just have to continue to watch with some of the dynamics to the earlier question. But right now when we think about the technologies we bring as long as our key competitors in that space.","I think we have a significant advantage in the high-speed area over local companies and we will continue to invest in that innovation to keep that competitive low well and trenched going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Fox from Cross Research. Please go ahead.","Steven Fox","My one question is on inventories. It looks like you guys built some inventories during the quarter even in the face of some of these declines. Can you sort of talk about your strategy going forward for your own balance sheet and how much it helped to hurt this recent quarter and then whether you\u2019re seeing any unusual inventory activity in this project? Thanks.","Terrence Curtin","Steven, given the severity of the slowdown particularly in the areas we've already talked about the call across China and parts of Europe in the back half of the quarter certainly, we did see some pressure on driving inventory up. Fortunately, that has in our model that comes out pretty quickly in terms of our ability to reduce inventory as we both correct our expectations both from a cost structure side as well as our revenue expectations around what's needed.","So, in terms of anything that's systemic there's nothing there and you should see amatory levels come down fairly significantly between now and the end of the year. There are a couple instances where we do have facility consolidations that we have talked pretty openly about within our industrial segment and in a few other places. And that does as we're in the middle of any type of facility consolidation activity that does tend for over a short period of time drive inventory a little bit higher in those cases where you're producing buffer in order to handle the transition into new locations.","So we have a little bit of that going on as well and that will continue sporadically during the year you'll see little bumps in terms of that. But otherwise nothing other than just the slowdown that drove some of that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Amit Daryanani","I guess, just a question on your operating margin guide, the implied guide, I guess. If my math\u2019s right, you guys are basically seeing operating margins go up by 50 basis points to 80 basis points in the back half versus the first half. Could you just touch on what is going to enable that?","And I get you don\u2019t want to quantify your cost reduction initiative but historically I think you\u2019re cost reductions have taken 12 months or higher to pay back. I'm assuming that's not a lever for back half but I\u2019m just curious what enables this margin expansion in H2 versus the front half of the year?","Heath Mitts","Amit this is Heath. I think as we think about the first half to second half, you've got a couple of things going on. We do have a little bit of normal seasonality in terms of first half to second half revenue and that has natural leverage that comes with it. That's not a huge number relative to maybe we've seen in the prior years, but there's a little bit of seasonality embedded in our revenue guidance, and that does have an upward impact on the margins. The very pointedly we've had restructuring activities going on.","Some of the things that we do benefit from particularly as we get towards the end of our fiscal year, are some of the activities that we've been undertaking in our industrial segment, as well as some of the things that we're going after non-facility-wise rather operating expenditure\u2019s relative to some restrained costs for the SubCom divestiture.","So there are some are structuring activities that certainly benefit us in the back half of the year. You are correct, some of the newer things that we're running now tackle don't have the \u2013 you don't get as much near-term help on that, but that will certainly set us up very well for the next several years.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Deepa Raghavan from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Deepa Raghavan","A follow-up on the margin question here, especially margin protection in the downside. It looks like there will be more cost cuts which is good but in the mean, does the guidance still assume auto margins will hit the 20% in second half, especially given that there was this mixed auto sense of a participation in Q1? And just longer term, will the SG&A and Industrial sales have helped margin ramp still be on track or will that be pushed out a little bit? Thank you.","Heath Mitts","Deepa, I think your question is a good one. In terms of our Transportation, we're running at about 18% here for the last couple of quarters and certainly that's below our target margin for that segment, which has a disproportionate impact on the overall margins for the company, given its relative size.","As you think about our Transportation business, the way I would think about it is, you'll see the margins begin to improve sequentially as we move through the year. And much of that is driven by some cost actions that you'll see that are under way right now. And as those prevail in terms of our end of the year exit rate, you'll be closer back towards that 20% number that historically has been our target for that Transportation segment.","In terms of the Industrial segment, that is really relatively unchanged. When we talked about 90 days ago on our call was that, this year, you won't -- we've seen significant step up in our Industrial segment margins over the last two years. And as you work your way through these footprints, consolidation activities and these are fairly sizable things that are underway right now within that segment.","You should expect that the margins are going to stay relatively flat, maybe modestly higher as we go through this year within Industrial, but you'll see another step function improvement as we go into the next several years, as these facilities come off line. So not a lot has changed on the Industrial side relative to margins in our expectations. Certainly, we would see a recovery towards the end of the year within Transportation.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of William Stein from SunTrust. Please go ahead.","William Stein","I believe the weakness in China generally and automotive as well is pretty well understood that\u2019s I don't think surprising anyone, what\u2019s a bit of a surprise was that the guidance for industrial at least for the March quarter looks a little bit better than what I was expecting and I think you're reiterating for the full fiscal year. Can you dig into what's triggering that that sort of guidance relative to the current environment is that all aerospace defense or these new programs, content wins, new technology, greater volumes, any clarity would be helpful? Thank you.","Terrence Curtin","Couple of things, first, let me just frame our industrial segment wallet it, it does have a China position, it's not as weighted to China and Asia as our other businesses, it is - it has a heavier weighting more to Europe and North America. So I do think that that\u2019s part of it versus the other trends. Also it is the mix that you should indicated, and I'll go back to if you look at our orders on the earlier slide I mentioned, our book-to-bill in industrial was above 1, I think it's around 1 of 7.","So it is having very good order trends and it goes back to the markets we talked about. It does go back to we're seeing a very strong commercial aerospace, we're seeing - also seeing very strong defense market that is pretty broad in our aerospace and defense unit, we also continually see the benefit of our investments in medical that where you look at while our industrial equipment which includes medical is down slightly.","Our medical business is offsetting what we talked you about even probably about nine months ago that we expected factory automation to get a little slower because of wells running well above trend line.","So, when we look at industrial it really has not changed. And honestly from an orders perspective you know was the one segment in the first quarter where orders came in where we expected for the year and working continuing to see good order momentum and industrial around those key markets I talked about.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Suva from Citi. Please go ahead.","Jim Suva","In your prepared comments, one of you made the comment about as you exit the year you expect to be stronger. Was that in reference to operating margins each and every segment, the company in totality or earnings per share or how should we think about what that was referring to?","Terrence Curtin","Jim, I made that comment. And that is you know a total company comment. Certainly, we have levers that are different by our segments. And when we made that comment that was truly made had a view point of earnings per share and at a total company level. And certainly as he talked about, we do expect operating margin to improve I think we did a good job highlighting the levers, but certainly our earnings power, we also viewed, we're going to continue to improve as we exit the second half versus when you compare year-on-year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Sheerin from Stifel. Please go ahead.","Matt Sheerin","Just another question regarding your auto guide. I know you're guiding you are sort of in between North America and in Asia down modestly. We should though I think have some improving year-over-year comps as we get through the year particularly given the WLTP testing that went on in Europe and slowed things down. So what's your perspective on that market relative to production, but also relative to the relationship between Europe and exporting into Asia?","Terrence Curtin","Well, a couple of things. When you think about it that you're right some of our incremental decline is around. WLTP has been lingering and we also have certain customers really get extended shutdowns that went into January. So we did see a weaker European environment due to WLTP and certainly shutdowns there.","And just the overall tone around Europe whether it's Brexit, whether it's WLTP, whether it's cars going from Europe or Asia, it is sort of reflected in our outlook. But what I would tell you we are sort of seeing probably off the point we were in the fourth quarter, you'll see you're sort of more normal your shape which is typically auto production in our third fiscal quarter takes off and then sort of gets in a little bit slower in the fourth quarter due to just traditional production bill schedules. But we are still expecting Europe to be down mid-single-digits with the bulk of that happening in the first three quarters of our fiscal year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Christopher Glynn","Just a couple on cash flow dynamics, sorry if I missed that, but curious on the CapEx outlook and then for working capital given the organic outlook would you expect working capital would be a source of cash this year?","Heath Mitts","Let's take CapEx first. So our CapEx as we guided last quarter was expected to be in the range of around $850 million for the year. We'll bring that down some as we've seen certain activities slow down. But you got to know that the vast majority of our CapEx fortunately is tied to customer programs. And we win a customer program and that's not just within auto or commercial transportation, that's really across the board.","When we win a customer a program that generally commit us to some level of tooling and fit-up in advance of production. So given the long-term horizon and the strength of that, we're still committed to because that's been - because that has the best return on capital, just about any other opportunities out - that's out there. So you should expect it somewhere in that $800 million, $850 million, will prune if necessary.","The other point is exactly right on target though. Working capital won't be a source of cash this year. Particularly as I mentioned earlier on inventory, receivables will have a natural impact coming down with the sales and payables. We\u2019ve a robust program to drive payables improvement, we're pretty good at that already. But you'll see inventory correct as well as part of - the needs to bring that down. So we would expect that as we make our way through the next three quarters towards the end of our fiscal year that will continue to be a source of capital.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Mark Delaney","Thanks for taking the follow-up question. About aerospace and defense, which I know did quite well this quarter, but given the U.S. government shutdown, just curious if there's been any change in the overall operating environment in terms of ability to win new programs or order rates or things of that nature? Thank you.","Terrence Curtin","No. Good question, really. How we do design and we're actually with the times and so forth. So that's really not having an impact on us just due to where we are and how we do our design work with the primes in that space.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Amit Daryanani","Thanks for the follow-up guys. Heath, I was hoping you could talk a little bit more on the sensors side sort of what do you think the growth trends or growth trajectory looks like in fiscal 2019 and then on the margin side is there a way to think about what sort of headwind with the sensor business to transportation margins in fiscal 2018 and how does that diminish I guess in 2019.","Heath Mitts","A couple of things on the latter part, it's pretty small due to the weighting of the total segment Amit. So I won't over focus on that. On your point around the pipeline what we really like about this year sensor business is - you sort of saw the growth rate go down a little bit and it is being impacted by the global macro because there is a big piece of it that those go into industrial transportation, those go into industrial applications today.","But as we go through the year you're going to see some of the auto wins that we\u2019ve had as those launches happen later in the year, helped the growth rate sensors. So we are getting the benefit of those there as we told you. They were later in 2019 events just due to have auto production hits and those launches hits, so you'll continue to see more positives on the auto side than the sensors as we go through the year and where we are today.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Deepa Raghavan from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Deepa Raghavan","Thanks for the follow-up. Two quick housekeeping questions, what's the updated tax rate assumption, it looks like the lower headwind is more than just of the Q1 event and to what's the embedded free cash flow conversion rate within the guidance. Thank you.","Heath Mitts","Deepa, as I noted in the prepared comments, the expected effective tax rate for the year is between 18% and 19%. So we did drop out modestly from our original guide, which was closer to the 19% level. As you would expect, given the complexity of our structure, you're going to have some quarters to swing around, particularly when you have statute explorations that hit us at different points in the year.","In terms of the cash conversion, I think you could still model it or it'll be up in that 80% to 90% range as we work through. We've increased our CapEx over the last two years as you can see in the numbers and there's still take - there\u2019s a little bit of lag for the depreciation to catch up on that in terms of how that math works, but it will be up in the higher end range would be our assumption for the year in terms of free cash.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Fox from Cross Research. Please go ahead.","Steven Fox","Not really a question, just a quick clarification. Your new guidance, does it assume more cost savings relative to your prior plan or is that more like fiscal 2020 help? Thanks.","Heath Mitts","Steven, there is some incremental restructuring that we will benefit from in the back half of this year, certainly relative to our original guidance and that's one of the reasons we're able to withstand on the lower revenue growth, a pretty low flow through down to our revised EPS, is largely tied to our ability to get cost out of the business.","Now having said that, there will be - part of what Terrence and I have had mentioned earlier in this call, we are taking advantage of the slower environments to much more aggressively go after the fixed cost structure of the business and that will enable us to have a step function improvement in terms of overall profitability in the out years.","So, we\u2019re focused both on preserving income and cash flow for this year, as well as what it sets ourselves up for to drive profitable business going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of William Stein from SunTrust. Please go ahead.","William Stein","Thanks for taking the follow-up. You talked about customer uncertainty relative to all the geopolitical risks that we're aware of, when you look at your customer orders or when you have discussions with customers, I'm sure it's different for many of them across the spectrum but what would you estimate is their assumption as to the resolution of the current sort of trade negotiations going on. We're asked another way, if we see tariffs tick up from the 10% rate to 25%, do you think that's already contemplated in your customers outlook or is that incremental to demand? Thank you.","Heath Mitts","Well you know how many customers we have, it\u2019s basically well over 0.5 million. So to sympathize that it's very different pending about where they are in the world, as well as other opinions they have. So I really can't answer that.","I think everybody has been planning and working around a tariff environment and I do think that creates uncertainty for all of us, so people go to the conservative side versus the aggressive side, and that's really the only color I can give you from our customer discussions.","Sujal Shah","Okay. Thank you, Will. It looks like there is no further questions. So if you have additional questions, please contact Investor Relations at TE. Thank you for joining us this morning. And have a nice day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be available for replay after 10:30 Eastern Time today through January 30.
