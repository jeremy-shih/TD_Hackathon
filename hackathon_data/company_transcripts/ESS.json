At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions, and beliefs as well as information available for the company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found in the company\u2019s filings with the SEC.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer of Essex Property Trust. Thank you, sir. You may begin.","Michael Schall \u2013 President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, (Robin) and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. Mike Dance and Erik Alexander will follow me with brief comments. John Eudy, John Burkart and John Lopez are available for Q&A. I will cover the following topics on the call: first, fourth quarter results and rent growth expectations; second, cap rates; and third, update on the state of California. So on to the first topic.","Last time, we reported FFO per share of $1.55 per share, an increase of 18% over the prior year and equal to the high end of our guidance range that was presented last quarter. I am very pleased with the focused effort in operations to the credit of Eric and his team. Eric will comment on portfolio results later in the call.","I'd like to revisit our longer term expectations for rent growth. Last quarter, I commented that we expect approximately 28% market rent growth in our target markets over the next five years. Our 2012 guidance contemplates 7.4% market rent growth, which is consistent with that five-year outlook. The following factors were important in arriving at our market rent estimates.","First, we have seen a slow, but steady improvement in the state of California and Washington economies since 2010 and we do not see this progress abating. Clearly, we expect the coastal areas in California and Washington to outperform as the inland areas have greater unemployment overhang from foreclosures and related issues.","Second, the West Coast was one of the last major U.S. metros to experience economic recovery. Rents fell further than in most markets and thus have greater growth potential before hitting normal resistance such as affordability. Overall, market rents in our portfolio are on average about at the same level as they were in Q3, 2008. However, personal and median household incomes in our target markets are higher now than in 2008. We estimate that current rents would need to grow by about 6.1% that are close to markets to hit the 20 year average rent to median income ratio of 20.2% and rents should grow above that average during improving economic conditions.","Third, technology and social media companies and the proximity to the Pacific Rim provided different and well-positioned engine for job growth. This differentiation was apparent in 2011 and will likely continue into 2012 and beyond.","Fourth, rent growth is not just about jobs, but rather the combination of job growth and limited supply of all new housing both rental and for sale. Historically, we have seen very strong rent growth for several years when these conditions are present as they are today.","Fifth, personal and median household income levels typically declined in recessionary times and accelerate during recovery periods. In 2009, personal incomes fell 5.4% in our target markets and have since grown by 10.8%. Looking at national averages for income growth can be misleading as areas with concentrations of employment in the federal government, energy and tech are the leaders in income growth. Economy.com estimates that personal income growth will average 5.5% over the next four years. This income growth is greater than the 3.5% use in our basic assumption.","Finally population and other demographic considerations continue to support strong rental growth demand. Obviously the world economy is in a vulnerable state and we expect external shock and additional volatility, which could affect our expectation. Still I suggest that a prolonged slow pace recovery amid low interest rate is the very favorable environment for the industry and the company.","Second topic cap rates, cap rates range from 4.25% to 4.75% for A property in A locations and in the high 4% to low 5% range for B property in A locations. Cap rates increased from there for lesser locations in property quality. Acquisitions still work in this environment due to low interest rate and strong market rent growth expectations. Our preference is finding value-added opportunities, with rents recovering aggressively in many places, market selection and timing is critical to accretive investment.","We have seen limited transaction activity as we approach the end of 2011, which was not unusual, as we enter 2012, we expect transaction volumes to increase and have guided to approximately $400 million in acquisitions in 2012. As you know development pipelines are rebuilding from negligible levels and we carefully track new housing. Our construction pipeline now consists of five projects under construction, aggregating $423 million and we will likely add at least two project starts during 2012.","There are significant number of potential development deals that are being actively marketed by other developers and owners, but are not underway largely due to lack of financing, many of them don\u2019t underwrite to acceptable return. Also some of the developers that could provide the financing that is needed are approaching their current capacity and thus are being more selective on new deals. It remains to be seen how many of the available sites will actually be started in the near future. Development cap rates based on current market rents continued to be in the mid to high 5% cap rate range and really haven\u2019t changed significantly, even though market rents have moved dramatically in some areas.","Third topic, State of California, as a general statement, the California economy has improved significantly in the last two years. The state\u2019s financial health is also significantly better given huge cost reductions implemented by Governor Brown. The annual budget deficit a couple of years ago, in California was approximately $26 billion. It is now been trimmed to roughly $5 billion.","To close the remaining $5 billion budget shortfall, several tax increase scenarios have been proposed and are in the qualification process for the ballot in November. This includes a proposal that is championed by Governor Brown, which proposes a combination of temporary increases and income tax on high income families and $0.50 sales tax increase. Other proposals are also targeting the ballot in November, including the proposal for a split role for property taxes, which would allow commercial property to be reassessed every three years, while leaving the Prop 13 mandated maximum 2% increase in property taxes in place for residential property. We believe that the Governor Brown proposed tax increase is most likely to be included on the ballot in November and thus Prop 13 will likely not be changed.","I would now like to turn the call over to Erik. Thank you.","Erik Alexander \u2013 Senior Vice President and Divisional Manager","Thank you, Mike. It is my pleasure to be here to report our fourth quarter operating results and share some of our views for 2012. After posting the best sequential scheduled rent gain since 2007 last quarter, we continue to execute our strategy of building occupancy during the fourth quarter. We were successful in gaining 120 basis points of occupancy during the quarter, while still achieving modest rent growth during this seasonably slow period. And that result with 6.5% year-over-year gain in gross revenues for the quarter. I too would like to offer my congratulations to the dedicated people of operations that made this happen. Well done team.","The quarter was characterized by good demand in all of our markets and healthy renewal activity throughout most of the portfolio. Current demand is at or above our expectations for this time of the year. By and large customers continue to report strong satisfaction, turnover remained low, move-outs due to affordability are in check and home buying is still not a major factor driving turnover.","New multifamily housing supply remains very low and largely concentrated in the few areas of our portfolio. Our 2012 delivery expectations are detailed on page S15 on the supplemental package. Based on the existing pipeline, total housing deliveries are expected to peak in 2014, where housing deliveries as a percentage of existing stock are expected to be 0.9% in Seattle, 0.6% in Northern California and 0.4% in Southern California. These estimates are based on total housing construction, which includes both rental and for sale product, and are in part based on limited development of for sale homes throughout our coastal market. So, couple these dynamics with a portfolio occupancy in excess of 97% and we believe we are in good position to push rental costs and are optimistic about the prospects for 2012.","As I said earlier, we believe the fundamental to deliver strong results are in place and we look forward to improving performance throughout the year. During the quarter, we completed almost 3,500 new lease transactions and signed nearly 3,700 renewals. As expected during the holiday season, new lease rate were lower than the peak of the third quarter, but we still recorded a 2% gain over expiring rate.","Renewal rates continue to be strong and average more than 6%, a 6% gain during the quarter. Average rental rates for new move-ins grew throughout the quarter and we\u2019re the highest during December as they approached capacity \u2013 as we approached capacity. In January, the average new rental rate for all transactions was $1,460 matching our peak month of August in 2011.","So, despite a seasonally slow our demand period, we have seen good results in the first month of the year and believe rent growth should be healthy throughout 2012. In January, our loss to lease for the same-store portfolio is 3%, but with offer pricing already moving higher in February, I expect economic rents to grow during the first quarter and our loss to lease to be closer to 4% to 5% by the end of the period.","First quarter renewal activities has been good so far with an average rent gain of 4.2% over expiring rates through yesterday, while average renewal offers for March and April ranged from 3% to 8% across the portfolio. As expected, operating expenses were down during the fourth quarter and under control for the year, utilities, property taxes and payroll increases will likely increase our expense growth 2% to 3%. In 2012, we will continue to be vigilant about gaining cost and pursuing initiatives and technologies that help us improve efficiency.","Turning your attention to our lease up activity, Essex was busy in 2011 as we stabilized seven communities during the year deal with the most recent to achieve occupancy above 95% as we stabilized the residential unit six months ahead of schedule.","Reveal in the Warner Center area of Los Angeles continues to lease ahead of plan and is currently 87% occupied and 90% leased. Although the end is near with this 438 unit project. We do face a fair number of lease expirations during the next two quarters so, we do not expect stabilization to occur until April. We only planned one new delivery this year, which is a 66 unit infill development at our Woodland Commons property in Bellevue. This project includes a new leasing office and amenity package for the entire community. Essex will be delivering more than 900 units next year.","Now I will comment on each of our regions beginning with Seattle. Market trends were down slightly 1% on a sequential basis but average property rent grew 7.8% over the fourth quarter of 2010. Depending on the submarket we are still within 3% to 6% of the previous peak in 2008 and up 18.5% from the drop. At the end of December, occupancy was 97.3% among stabilized assets with the 4.1% net availability. As of January 30, occupancy remained unchanged at 97.3 with the 5.2% availability.","The job picture continues to be strong in Seattle as we saw 2.7% job growth for 2011 and expect a 1.8% gain in 2012. Boeing added more than 1,800 jobs during the quarter, but more importantly, Boeing announced it will produce the 737 MAX in Renton. Office absorption was modestly positive this quarter, Amazon will occupy the last phase of its main campus in downtown and is reported that they are pursuing an additional 300,000 to 400,000 square feet of office space to satisfy their growing needs.","Expansions of eBay, Expedia and Microsoft that also been reported recently. Turning to Northern California, market rents were down 0.5% sequentially with the average rents growing 9.3% compared to last year\u2019s fourth quarter based on submarket location we are now at prior peak level to 3.5% above the peak and up 19% from the bottom.","At the end of December, occupancy was 97.5% with the 3.8% net availability. As of January 30, the occupancy inched up to 97.6% with a 4.2% availability. Job growth continues to be solid in Northern California and ended the year up 1.7% and was led by San Jose which posted a 3% annual gain. There are no signs of this changing as we call for 2.3% job growth in the submarket for 2012. This is highlighted on S-15 of the supplement along with all of our submarket job forecast.","Another strong sign of expansion for the region is the central capital flows reached an all-time high during 2011 with $11.7 billion committed to investment. Absorption of office space and R&D further supports our belief that the region will continue to experience a healthy economy and continued job growth. During the quarter, we saw another 1.9 million square feet of office space lease. San Jose alone took down more than a million feet of office and R&D space combined during the period.","Finally, in Southern California, market rents were up 0.4% sequentially and average rents moved 3.5% over the same period last year. Based on submarket location we have reached rent levels equal to the prior peaks in San Diego and are within 3% to 6% of our prior peak for the rest of Southern California. At the end of December, Southern California was occupied at 96.7% compared with 5.4% net availability. As of January 30, occupancy stood at 96.3% with a 5.9% availability. ","With respect to military presence in San Diego, there is a transitional reduction of troops due to budget cuts, military housing policies, and a temporary relocation of the USS Ronald Reagan to Washington, but the net effect of troop rotation in the region is expected to be positive for 2012. There is nothing dramatic to note on the job spread in Southern California during the fourth quarter as we saw year end with a 1% gain over 2010.","Greater job creation will be the key to delivering more robust revenue growth in Southern California, but low supply and availability, particularly in Los Angeles and Ventura counties should help us achieve the targeted rent growth in the region for 2012. We believe that Southern California holds the greatest potential to generate results more favorable than planned. Office space absorption saw the strongest quarter of 2011 with 1.2 million square feet absorbed. Orange County accounted for half of that leasing activity.","So, in conclusion, we are very pleased with fourth quarter results and our performance in 2011. As usual, jobs and housing supply are key drivers of our results. We continue to believe that Essex is located in excellent markets and that there are many positive indicators to suggest we will be able to build on our success during 2012.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Mike Dance.","Mike Dance \u2013 Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President","Thanks, Erik. Today, I\u2019ll provide an overview of the fourth quarter financial results and provide some comments on our 2012 guidance. During our third quarter call, we provided 2011 guidance for total net operating income of $307.5 million and our result exceeded those levels by $1.2 million or $0.03 a share.","As Erik described in his remarks, the leasing of the Via occurred much faster than our internal projections demonstrating the strength of the Silicon Valley rental market and contributed to the net higher operating income for the quarter. However, the increase in net operating income from Via has other accounting consequences, concessions in the lease up or the norm even in the strong rental market. However, there is a difference in the accounting for free rent between Essex and our peers and that we do not record rental income during the free rent period. The accelerated lease up also caused unfavorable variances in our interest expense and G&A expense. Once Via reach stabilization on the residential units, we ceased capitalizing interest on the cost of residential units and therefore we have higher interest expense.","As the development activity started to wind down, we also reduced the allocation of development overhead to the project and that increase our general and administrative expenses. While we had incrementally higher G&A and interest expense this quarter, it should not be lost that overall we saved $17 million on Villa compared to our original budget and approximately $5 million of these savings can be attributed to the accelerated lease up. It was the right decision to accelerate lease up of Villa given the opportunity to do so. Thus the related increase in interest expense and G&A expense of approximately $400,000 this quarter were attributed to the lease up of Villa and should not detract from our solid quarter.","Currently all the active developments are owned by joint venture partners. As now shown on S-14 in our supplemental material we now have higher management fees from development that are earned from our joint venture partners. These fees however are offset by the cost of development employees and their associate overhead. I think it is important to note that when developments are done on balance sheet all the associated costs are capitalized. During 2011, when we started development in the joint venture the overhead cost associated with the third party interest in these ventures have been allocated in G&A. Beginning in 2012, we will match these expenses to the management fee earnings instead of including them in our G&A expenses.","During the quarter the IRS completed every deal of a loss from a taxable REIT subsidiary that resulted in a tax refund of $1.7 million or $0.5 of share. With this increase in income from the tax benefit we achieved the high end of our range for funds from operations of $5.74 for 2011. I might now to highlight some of the changes we\u2019ve made to Page S11 in the supplement. We added additional detail on the components to make up our equity income from co-investments on the income statement. We hope this additional detail will help make modeling this line easier in the future.","For 2012, we expect co-investment income to be 27.1 mid volume. The breakdown for the 2012 guidance was roughly $14.6 million income from operations from our operating joint ventures and $12.5 million in preferred equity income. The $12.5 million preferred earnings includes assets with 50% interest in the Park Merced preferred equity investment. Although we can\u2019t disclose specific detail on the Park Merced investment, we have disclosed in FY \u201811 the information needed to forecast our 2012 earnings. The $123 million book value of preferred investment multiplied by the weighted average preferred return of 10.2% approximate the $12.5 million used in our guidance.","We expect interest expense to increase over 2011 as a result of the full effect. The financing activities related to the 2011 investment and the reduction of taxable variable rate exposure of 19% of total debt at the end of 2011 to roughly 6% of total debt at the end of \u2013 19% at the end of 2010 to roughly 6% of total debt at the end of 2011. We intend to maintain adequate capacity on our unsecured bank line which can be done by either exercising accordion feature available on the current line or by paying down the line with proceeds from another unsecured bank term loan similar to the loan closed last month and private placements of unsecured debt or a debut public debt offering.","Our guidance assumes that the majority of our \u201812 guidance or \u201912 acquisitions will be done on balance sheet with 40% unsecured debt and 60% common equity from our after market equity program. Once we file our 2011 10-K we plan to increase the size of the existing ATM program.","That ends my comments and I\u2019ll now turn the call back to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will be now conducting the question-and-answer session (Operator Instruction). Our first question comes from the line of Swaroop Yalla with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Swaroop Yalla \u2013 Morgan Stanley","","Yes, hi. I\u2019m looking at S-14, same-store NOI growth shows the change of 7.7% slightly different from 7% to 9% guidance which you gave earlier. Just wondering if that is the yield math or there has been some reassessment of conditions in the last two weeks?","Michael Schall","Swaroop, now this is Mike. No, it really wasn\u2019t that, it was just simply rounding off. We do budgets from September to November and we rely on them. We use a ground up budgeting process and then we decided that the range given, where we stood in December was better than to some of the ground up budgets and we decided to keep a range of 7% to 9%. So, we could get the appropriate.","Swaroop Yalla \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Great. And the acquisitions which you completed, can you talk about the cap rates there and also there seems to be sort of redevelopment component, where do you expect yields to come in after you finish some of those?","Michael Schall","I think the average cap rate of the properties that we acquired in 2011 is somewhere around 5%. As you point out, a number of them involved some kind of repositioning, which will increase the yields from there. The newer properties consistent with what I said in my prepared comments are lower than that. They are 4.5% to 4.75% range and the value-added opportunities are in the 5.25% to 5.5% range. So, over time, we are not in any tremendous hurry to complete these redevelopments. In some cases, it will take several years by the time we complete the exterior renovation and then the upgrade of the leasing office and amenities and then finally do the unit terms without drop in occupancies significantly. That process takes several years to play out.","Swaroop Yalla \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Got it. And just lastly on from California, you mentioned that this greatest potential to surpass guidance there, just wondering what some markets, I mean, if you can just talk a little about some markets and possibly Los Angeles and Orange County?","Erik Alexander","This is Erik. I think, again, consistent with comments with the low supplies and not just our low availability, but market availability is low. And really all four counties would have a major presence, where we have seen activity, more recently, rents moving up, offered rates being expected, new rents going higher, is that in Los Angeles in particular. Some parts of Orange County and Ventura has been actually strong over the last couple of months and so we are looking for that to go, to continue in the same direction. San Diego has been pretty consistent with the expectations so far.","Swaroop Yalla \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line Jana Galan with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Jana Galan \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Hi, thank you. I was curious in your guidance for acquisitions in 2012, are you looking at any opportunities outside of your current markets?","Erik Alexander","We are not, at this point in time, we are \u2013 I think I have commented on prior calls that we are adding some East Coast markets to our market research process, but we do not expect to make any changes in our geography in the foreseeable future. So, for now, it's just \u2013 it\u2019s just a point of reference or information to us.","Jana Galan \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Thank you. And then in regards to you mentioned developers or marketing deals that you felt that they were kind of underwritten. Is it more the underwriting difficulty or you just think that the returns aren't high enough for the risk?","Michael Schall","Well, if you think CEO math is in question, developer math I think is much more so. So, developer math and John Eudy is here, he lives with this everyday, but we just don\u2019t buy a lot of the performance. So, John, do you want to comment?","John Eudy","I think that said it Mike. No, just the expectations for \u2013 we all believe that rents are going up over the next couple of years quite a bit, but there is a bit spread as on what we think versus what some folks say.","Jana Galan \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Okay, thank you.","John Eudy","Price going in.","Jana Galan \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Eric Wolfe with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","Eric Wolfe \u2013 Citigroup","Hey guys, thanks.","John Eudy","Hello Eric.","Eric Wolfe \u2013 Citigroup","You\u2019ve always been very good about finding, I guess, what I'd call interesting investment opportunities to supplement your core earnings growth. I guess I was thinking back to 2009 when you were buying multi-family bonds, which obviously turned out to be a great decision. So, I am just curious today from your perspective what\u2019s the most interesting investment opportunities outside of your core business?","Michael Schall","","It\u2019s a great question Eric. And I don\u2019t think I have a simple answer. I think that finding well located properties that are that we can add value to continues to be the best overall return and I say that because in many cases just take a step back and you look at the apartment markets particularly in urban California, where you\u2019ve got less than 0.5% to 1% of stock being produced in any one year, that means that by definition the average age of the multifamily stock is more than 20 years old. Well, there are repositioning opportunities within that 80% to 90% of the marketplace that I think are really pretty interesting and so I think that is a key focus that we see this year. I think that we have come tremendously long way under John Burkart\u2019s direction in our redevelopment programs in terms. We\u2019ve now done a lot of full scale redevelopments and we\u2019ve been able to do them cost effectively and adding value along the way. And I think that those opportunities are really pretty exciting.","I also think that the preferred equity investments of the general statement given how low the underlying first mortgages are on a lot of these properties have Fannie, Freddie, debt in the high 3% range for 10 year financing, creates a lot of cash flow in these transactions, which is perfect for these preferred equity investments. So, I think it will be a processing involving careful selection. I think there is still pretty significantly good opportunities out there to choose from.","Eric Wolfe \u2013 Citigroup","Great and then you brought up the low, I guess the low cost on GSE data and I guess just thinking about, where interest rates are today versus also how well your stock has done over the last year. I mean does having that low cost of capital change your investment hurdles at all or are you still sort of staying firm and saying 8% to 10% unleverred is where we want to be even though our cost of capital has come down over the last year?","Michael Schall","","Our formula for determining whether to buy something or build something really starts with what is the value and the cash flow embedded in the share of stock from the existing portfolio and trying to determine, whether we are making the company better i.e., accretive to NAV, accretive to cash flow. And so we won financial models on the company trying to gauge into the key components and what we\u2019re trying to do is accrete to the shareholder interest. So, it changes almost daily. Obviously as the stock price changes then interest rates change and therefore it\u2019s really to be genesis of where the fund and third-party joint ventures come from. If we can find a cheaper cost of capital represented by them and a different risk reward scenario, we\u2019ll go in that direction otherwise we will be acquiring on balance sheet. But that is a iterative process and one that we will be pursuing as we look at each deal this year.","Eric Wolfe \u2013 Citigroup","Okay. That\u2019s it from me. Thank you.","Michael Schall","","Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alex Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Please proceed with your question.","Alex Goldfarb \u2013 Sandler O'Neill","Good day. As you guys see this tech boom resurge, I mean we heard Boston talk about in their call yesterday you guys have obviously outlined it. Are you seeing this expand to other market outside of San Francisco and the Peninsula Valley and what I mean is expand in a meaningful way, where you think there are other parts of the West Coast that could really get traction out of this?","John Lopez","This is John Lopez, Alex. Are you meaning outside of what the core markets we currently operate in or just?","Alex Goldfarb \u2013 Sandler O'Neill","No, no in your core market, there is a lot of buzz about how the tech boom has really exploded, having maybe I just don\u2019t read the Seattle papers enough or the L.A papers enough. But don\u2019t seem to hear as much buzz coming out of those markets I just curious last tech boom we had Seattle was hot that as well. So, I\u2019m just sort of curious if you\u2019re seeing it in some of your market?","Erik Alexander","Yeah, it\u2019s definitely happening in Seattle. I think if you look at the office space just checking to see what the vacancies in the office space at Downtown Bellevue of draw that building those were taken over. You got Microsoft expanding Downtown. I think the real key is most of the South Lake Union office space that was double last cycle\u2019s buildup with Amazon and so it\u2019s everywhere across the East side to Downtown the tech boom. It isn\u2019t just of East side tech boom in Seattle anymore. It's anywhere they can get Grade A offices.","Alex Goldfarb \u2013 Sandler O'Neill","I think John you would agree that certain other \u2013 parts of the Bay Area, biotech is in certain areas for example and even pushing up outside of Silicon Valley into Alameda County. We have Tesla and Solyndra not only in Fremont for example. So, I think it is as things become more expensive there is a tendency to push out these different \u2013 get a different types of technology and or submarket driven depending upon where each of these technologies are biotech versus software versus other types of things, wouldn't you say that\u2019s true?","Erik Alexander","Yeah after that I would add on to that, that I think what you might want to look at this time, Alex that maybe other than the last tech boom was the emergence of the health in biosciences and that is a very big component obviously in Northern California markets, but it is also has a big presence in San Diego, but that is an area where that will be expanding as it go on \u2013 if that\u2019s going to be a larger percentage of the expenditures that we see it in the increase in the amount of money spend towards venture capital in those life science areas.","Alex Goldfarb \u2013 Sandler O'Neill","","Okay, so you would expect to see that in the same sort of rent surge?","Erik Alexander","Yes.","Alex Goldfarb \u2013 Sandler O'Neill","","Okay and then specifically on Seattle, there is some talk that in South Lake Union especially there is a concern about potential oversupply, is that a concern for you guys?","Erik Alexander","There is a lot being build Downtown relative to what was being build a couple of years ago which was very little. Roughly right now there is about 6,000 units under construction in Seattle, roughly 5,000 that is Downtown, but it\u2019s a very big chunk, its about 40% of the overall metropolitan area and if you look at the number of jobs versus housing units that are available to live Downtown, it is one of those core areas where there is more workers than housing supply to them and over the last 15, 20 years its been more of a push for the higher income people getting jobs Downtown because it's more of the tech and more of the healthcare is going Downtown.","We are seeing people choosing to live Downtown versus commute to the far suburb, which is becoming extremely difficult. So if you look at \u2013 I would say that you have to also remember that initial boom was due to a abating of BMRs if you got it in during the year. So what I think you will see is a little less starts this year and so I don\u2019t think that is going to be a reason to think either the Downtown or the total market. In the end, we think it will always gets delivered, it still 1.1% multifamily are less than one on the total residential supply line, so, we are looking at \u2013 we are getting job worth of 2%, we expect that to continue for several years.","Alex Goldfarb \u2013 Sandler O'Neill","","Okay. So, the point is you are not expecting like repeat of what happened in Belvieu, what is\u2026","Michael Schall","I think what happened there was, it was driven by the incredible belief in the condos, you could sell anything in any price market which drilled, I would think way more than half of the deliveries that we saw and convert to apartment that\u2019s not going to happen this time.","Alex Goldfarb \u2013 Sandler O'Neill","","Okay.","Mike Dance","Not to mention that 2.5% to 3% job growth in Seattle became minus 10 in 2008 that had a small impact.","Alex Goldfarb \u2013 Sandler O'Neill","","Right, right, okay. And then just on the JV front just given the prospect of rates staying low through 14, pension funds they were trying to catch up, are you getting more calls from pension funds who want to partner with you to try and solve their long-term return hurdles?","John Burkart","Hey, Alex, this is John Burkart. Absolutely that is the case, we\u2019ve obviously long-term relationships, great relationships in the pension fund, private equity world, but we are getting calls certainly from people, they talked for a long time and many new calls interested investors as going through invest in West Coast multifamily.","Alex Goldfarb \u2013 Sandler O'Neill","","Okay. Thank you.","Michael Schall","Thanks Alex.","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Gautam Garg with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Gautam Garg \u2013 Credit Suisse","","Hi, guys. Obviously the Facebook IPO is going to pump a lot of capital into the system, I\u2019m just trying to gauge \u2013 better gauge the impact that could have on the Bay Area of rental market, is there anything you can talk about with regards to the fact the Google IPO had on the markets around 2004 and 2005 time period?","John Lopez","Well, its very difficult job, again this is John Lopez. It is very difficult to pair out across the entire MSA impact of the Google money that it had on the housing market. I mean, I think what it will probably do, it will solidify the single family market on the peninsula much quicker than you\u2019ll see in the multifamily of good change. But then again that will then triple down to a solid, solid single family prices shooting up is only good for a multifamily side.","Gautam Garg \u2013 Credit Suisse","Right, okay.","John Lopez","Yeah, I think it\u2019s more an indirect effect we know that it will just be a less alternative for people who are getting job from the future to buy.","Gautam Garg \u2013 Credit Suisse","Makes sense. And another question if I remember correctly I think on your last call you mentioned something about additional vacancies you do student rentals which a lot of the students moved out of your apartment unit went to an on campus option. What percentage of the portfolio does it represent now and is there any outlook you have on that front for 2012?","Erik Alexander","Yeah, this is Erik. I commented on that. I mean there is really three properties that are dominated by students, two in Santa Barbara and the small one in the Santa Cruz, one in Santa Cruz fully occupied during the fourth quarter and we made good progress actually in Santa Barbara by doing bed rentals and respectively the occupancy there is about 90%.","The \u2013 our outlook is better frankly we had two windows of demand one actually starts in February goes for a couple of months and then the other one towards the end of the summer before the semester starts and we\u2019ve already seen in Santa Barbara a big uptick in interest phone calls and visits including from freshmen that are already looking for housing for next year, so through a positive sign for us and in fact if I think we were still able to get rentals during a very good timeline it's difficult to do, so we\u2019re changing the approach a little bit now that we exchange some success with the bad rentals and so we look to be fully occupied before the semester starts in the fall.","Gautam Garg \u2013 Credit Suisse","Sounds good.","Erik Alexander","And that similar rent probably a little bit higher, I think we called for 3% increase on the rent based on the fact that we don\u2019t think there is any new supply threat facing us this year.","Gautam Garg \u2013 Credit Suisse","That sounds okay. Thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Derek Bower with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS","Hey, its Ross Nussbaum here with Derek Bower, I got a question regarding Prop 13, if I look at your same-store pool and if I am looking at the numbers right, in California you guys stayed somewhere around $29 million worth of real estate taxes in 2011, if did you have to take a guesstimate as to if you\u2019re effectively mark-to-market that number, what do you think the tax number might be?","Mike Dance","Hi, Ross, this is Mike Dance. Yes, about $20 million probably $22 million to $24 million.","Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS","I am sorry it would be another.","Mike Dance","Yes.","Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS","24","Mike Dance","Yes.","Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS","So almost double that you got, but.","Mike Dance","Right.","Michael Schall","That\u2019s correct.","Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS","And when you guys talked earlier about market cap rate, just want to make sure we\u2019re definitionally correct? Those are basically on if I will mark-to-market tax numbers so that\u2019s what the buyer effectively is paying?","Michael Schall","Exactly. We have a definition that we\u2019ve used for many years for cap rate and I realized can be different from what others use, ours is a standardized 95% occupancy, market rents today a normal management fee pre-capital, pre-CapEx.","Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS","Makes sense. Yep. Thanks very much.","Michael Schall","Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Harris with Imperial Capital. Please proceed with your question.","David Harris \u2013 Imperial Capital","Well hello guys, thank you for allowing my guest appearance.","Michael Schall","Hello, well welcome back David.","David Harris \u2013 Imperial Capital","I have a couple of old chessnuts to throw at you or at least to kick around as this with either rate of rental increases particularly experiencing in Northern California, are we anywhere close to a political response in terms of the rent cap?","Michael Schall","It\u2019s a good question David. And, I can\u2019t \u2013 I don\u2019t know with certainty what exactly is going to happen within the political scheme. We have maintained a process by eliminating our to one renewal option to 15% increase largely because of the some of the issues that have cropped up in the past as it relates to that issue. And, so far I don\u2019t know of any organized activity that is pushing on the rent control front, but we continued to monitor it closely, it\u2019s important to us, and so far so good.","David Harris \u2013 Imperial Capital","When we experienced this last time, was it more of a Northern California phenomenon or Southern or was it just above and down?","Michael Schall","It\u2019s one of those subjects and issues that is the pretty well-received by the people. So, it\u2019s everywhere\u2026","David Harris \u2013 Imperial Capital","Okay.","Michael Schall","And so I wouldn\u2019t limit it to any one market.","David Harris \u2013 Imperial Capital","And I think it was on a couple of calls ago, you made reference to the social network, obviously for Facebook and others sort of adding another dimension to tenants understanding of what\u2019s happening in the marketplace, how is that playing out in terms of sort of the tenants sort of, I mean, e-mailing one another, Facebooking one another with regard to chatter about rent increases?","Erik Alexander","There is some of that. And it actually works against us. And for us as we have a lot of the times can monitor all the activity you can see, but what people are talking about or you hear because somebody comes in to the office and we deal with it case-by-case. Thankfully I think we do a good job of providing service and housing and often times we have plenty of defenders which is the best thing. We don\u2019t have to get involved in it at all. We have the other tenants talk to me about how great their experience is at Essex and a lot of people that are in touch with the competitive market. They will tell you hey, you think that\u2019s bad you should go see X, Y, Z and how much their rent is. Nobody likes getting an increase, but you're still way better off here than there.","David Harris \u2013 Imperial Capital","Okay. On another subject, it was good to see property sale will be only $7.4 million could you give me the total of how many properties you sold last year?","Erik Alexander","Two.","David Harris \u2013 Imperial Capital","Two, for how much Mike.","Michael Schall","I think one was low 20 millions and the other was\u2026","Erik Alexander","15.7, yeah.","Michael Schall","So, low 20 million.","David Harris \u2013 Imperial Capital","Okay. And any idea what you might do this year, I don\u2019t think unless I have missed it, you have not included as a specific reference point in your guidance?","Michael Schall","I would say $50 million to $100 million.","David Harris \u2013 Imperial Capital","$50 million to $100 million. And if you will be upper end of that, would that mean that perhaps you did a little less ATM issuance?","Michael Schall","That\u2019s correct.","David Harris \u2013 Imperial Capital","Okay. So, we could see the two being as intangible one off or more?","John Burkart","This is John Burkart. We are pretty opportunistic about our sales. We have actually a very good portfolio overall. So, we are ending up recruiting a few things here and there, but the execution is very opportunistic. So, if the situation is right on the small office buildings with an absolute excellent execution by the team involved, so if you are an owner\/operator at what was probably low 2s in actual cap and an economic cap of about 4.25% assuming 20% office vacancy like the market currently has. So, that type of stuff will be all day long and it keeps for those opportunities.","David Harris \u2013 Imperial Capital","Okay. And could we assume that will be more second half of the year rather than front end of the year?","John Burkart","We actively market properties, so it will be when do the opportunities come up?","David Harris \u2013 Imperial Capital","But nothing imminent?","John Burkart","Yeah.","David Harris \u2013 Imperial Capital","Okay, alright great. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Rich Anderson \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Thank you and thank you for friending me.","Michael Schall","Always a pleasure.","Rich Anderson \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","So, to Ross Nussbaum\u2019s question in the NAV or the property tax impact from Prop 13, if I am doing this math correctly would that be $13 a share value roughly to your NAV?","Michael Schall","You mean, at the current multiple, if you just do the straight line on the multiple?","Rich Anderson \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Well, I mean, if I were to just take out, say add more cost to the NOI line item and then CapEx, I mean, in that range?","Michael Schall","Yeah, if you\u2019re just saying, yes.","Rich Anderson \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Something like that, I mean, depending on the cap rate I use it would change, but obviously\u2026","Michael Schall","I guess, the one comment I\u2019d make Rich is that if you\u2019re using trailing NOI, remember properties trade on a current market, not a trailing basis. And I\u2019d argue that, that number probably offsets pretty much the Prop 13 NAV impact.","Rich Anderson \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Okay, okay fair enough. And on the Prop 13 comments that you made at the beginning of the call, what is the risk that they might view multifamily housing as commercial property. Is there any risk of that it could be \u2013 they could further bifurcate residential in to single family and then the multifamily business that you guys run?","Michael Schall","","It\u2019s another good question and if you look at the history of Prop 13. It has been challenged in every conceivable fashion from the course to the initiative process, to the legislature; it\u2019s been attacked hundred different ways with a hundred different approaches. So, it\u2019s difficult to say this approach, the one you\u2019re suggesting is going to be the one that prevails. It\u2019s a political process Rich and as you know they\u2019re pretty hard to predict. I will tell you that largely this is a matter of dollars.","It\u2019s a matter of dollars supporting the path of least resistance to get tax increases in California and for the most part, whatever the donors, which are likely the state employee unions that are providing the big dollars to get most of these proposal served, they\u2019re going to pick, whatever they think is going to be the path of least resistance. After this point after what is been 30 years of Prop 13 its been tried a lot of different times and a lot of different ways, actually not been obviously the path of least resistance because taxes have gone up here many times over that period of time. So, it was why it was labeled the third rail of California politics and I don\u2019t believe that anything has changed that.","Rich Anderson \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","","Okay and then the last question, as you mentioned kind of the intelligent gathering in the East Coast to recovery. But I don\u2019t remember exactly, but how long have you been kind of just staying knowledgeable on the East Coast. Is that always been the case or did you just kind of start keeping your eye on the price our way?","Michael Schall","","Well you will recall that we\u2019re in a bidding process.","Rich Anderson \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Town and Country?","Michael Schall","Yeah, Town and Country and so we\u2019ve had some level of market research that we have just increased the intensity of that. So that it is similar to what we do on the West Coast in terms of market timing model trying to understand the supply demand relationships and hopefully looking for balances. And we believe that rents have great growth potential on the West Coast, which is why we wouldn\u2019t make that shift at this point in time. We think we have about the best locations that there are in nation and we don\u2019t want to dilute that presence. But the whole purpose of the market research review is to try to identify entry points and get the timing right. So that\u2019s what we are looking for.","Rich Anderson \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Okay sounds good. Thank you.","Michael Schall","Thank you.","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Paula Poskon with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Paula Poskon \u2013 Robert W. Baird","","Thanks very much. To follow-up on David\u2019s earlier question, what is the range of acquisition and disposition volume that is underlying your FFO guidance range for the year?","Mike Dance","Acquisitions we\u2019re looking $400 million to $500 million and dispositions between $50 million and $100 million. What we\u2019re targeting is kind of a net accretion of about a $1 million.","Paula Poskon \u2013 Robert W. Baird","And on the dispositions Mike, is it more market, submarket dynamics or the age of the properties that a CapEx might be needed. What\u2019s driving your selection process?","Michael Schall","","You had that\u2019s all of them, it\u2019s a variety of decisions, where we evaluate the portfolio and look for situations that we think we can improve the portfolio by selling the assets sometimes it relates to long-term rent growth, sometimes CapEx, a variety of items in here.","Paula Poskon \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Okay thanks. And then also for Mike Dance, I\u2019m sorry Mike, I just think I just missed some of this in your commentary and your prepared remarks. What drove the cost savings on via relative to budget? I know you still obviously with some of it was attributable to the earlier than expected lease up. Is there any other major contributors?","Mike Dance","$5.5 million of that was used interest expense, property tax expense, capitalized overhead, all of the stock cost, all the other cost were hard cost savings.","Paula Poskon \u2013 Robert W. Baird","And was that on product cost, labor cost and mix of everything?","Mike Dance","I will let John answer that.","John Eudy","Combination of things, it was acceleration to the job we got done six months ahead of schedule. So, general conditions were less. It was that the buyout occurred in declining market at the time the buyout was done on the material side as well as the labor side.","Paula Poskon \u2013 Robert W. Baird","And then finally, just a question on the development process, are you seeing you any delays in getting things permitted or approved given the workload that some municipalities are having overloaded. I just read today that San Jose is trying to take some action to lower fee construction taxes in the city per office development and requesting in the budget to add staff for the planning commissions. Are you seeing any challenges in that way?","Erik Alexander ","There are issues. All of the cities had some form of staff reduction 2, 2.5 years ago. We hadn\u2019t added much to staff. So, there is some friction there, yes.","Paula Poskon \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Thanks very much. That\u2019s all I have.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Salinsky with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Salinsky \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Good afternoon guys. Mike, I want to go back to the disposition topic. You talked a little bit on prior call about wanting to grow the size of the company too much. And it sounds like you are looking at many of the acquisitions on balance sheet. Yet the disposition plans fairly small. Can you give us an update as to where you stand on that front and whether it's more just a cycle timing or is there a plan to grow the portfolio at this point?","Michael Schall","Yeah, it\u2019s a little bit of each of those things. That is cycle timing and when you\u2019re getting big rent growth and amid low cap rates you\u2019re trying to get to the best of both world\u2019s and so we\u2019re trying to time our activity so that we maximize value. We hesitate to try to focus on a specific amount of dispositions in any one year because it can change over time. We have a choice of funding our acquisitions with dispositions proceeds for example or a combination of stock and debt or joint venture equity. So, we look at it holistically and we try to find the best approach to maximize value. So, it can change over time.","Michael Salinsky \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","And that\u2019s helpful. A question on operations, can you bifurcate within the portfolio kind of the performance of some of the newer Class A properties you\u2019ve bought some of the condos relative to some of your would you call kind of Class B type assets in terms of what you\u2019re seeing on rents in the Southern California markets. And also I\u2019m just curious if there is any markets, where you\u2019re starting as you are pushing pricing aggressively, if you\u2019re seeing any doubling up starting to emerge?","Erik Alexander","Hi this is Erik. We haven\u2019t seen or heard a lot about any of the double ups, if we go to the second part of your question with respect to As and Bs I think all of the property types that performed well in the stronger markets. So, certainly in the Bay Area and the Pacific Northwest, they performed equally as well. There is probably a little bit of difference in Southern California between the new condos quality stuff and some of the B products we\u2019ve seen they go up and down a little bit. So, I think the greatest potential is, with some of those As and gone down Orange County and so forth we expect greater performance out of those may be this year, but its pretty close.","Michael Salinsky \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","And the same is true in Seattle?","Erik Alexander","The same is definitely true in Seattle. We have a couple of properties out there, performing of As, performed very well and the Bs have as well. So I think certainly when you have the strong market conditions like you have in Seattle in the Bay area they all move. We see the malls are moving together, where you have maybe more modest growth in Southern California maybe there is a little bit more movement in the Bs at that time. But again when things tightened up in the submarkets we\u2019ve seen nice jump in the A products. So I think when you start to see more consistent overall market performance, the economy and the job situation improves. I think we\u2019re going to see the As maybe moving a little faster.","Michael Salinsky \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay, then final question, two- part. I apologize if I missed this. Mike you usually go through cap rates. Could you give us the update on those and IRR targets for acquisitions versus development and then also thinking on the dividend at this point?","Michael Schall","Sure. I did go through the cap rates A and A product and A location in the low to mid 4 range, B and A location sort of high 4 to low 5 range. We think those unlevered IRRs and 8.25 to mid 9 range depending on what we\u2019re looking at. I think that does it, right.","Michael Salinsky \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Development?","Michael Schall","Development, on the development side, yeah the comment that I made was the development cap rates based on today, market rents in place today are in the mid 5s really not all that different from the year ago. The difference obviously is that in some cases rents have moved a big number 20% or something like that. So, obviously, a deal before a 20% rent jump and after is not really the same deal. So, that is where market selection and timing really comes into play and something that John Eudy and I talk about a lot.","Mike Salinsky \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","","And then finally just dividend?","Michael Schall","Dividend we are \u2013 we propose that to the Board. I don\u2019t want to guess what the Board might say. I\u2019ll give you a little bit of historical precedent however and that is to follow the FFO growth rate of the prior year. However in this case, because we had a couple of years of declining FFO and we increased the dividend a very small amount we will play some catch up. So, I am guessing it will be in the mid \u2013 maybe little bit higher single-digit range.","Mike Salinsky \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay. Thank you much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dave Bragg with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question.","Dave Bragg \u2013 Zelman & Associates","","Hey, good afternoon. Couple of quick ones. Moving out to buy homes during the quarter, I've heard the portfolio and any movements regionally worth noting?","Erik Alexander","","No, region is really, this is Erik, worth noting. It\u2019s in the portfolio wise it\u2019s in that 9% to 12% range, which is consistent with sort of the long-term activity. It has been as high in the 15%, 16% I think for a couple of quarters during the boom. And I think it hit a low in the 8 \u2013 just over 8% range.","Dave Bragg \u2013 Zelman & Associates","Okay. And other question is I know that the topic of single family rentals has come up in the past as it relates to the expected impact on your portfolio or others from a competitive standpoint, but just given the continued headlines related to institutional capital entering the space, could you just talk about this from a multifamily operators' perspective in terms of the approach that one could take, should they decide to do this and what the opportunities could be on the revenue and expense side?","Michael Schall","","Yeah, Dave we \u2013 you and I have talked about this separately. And there are opportunities to buy portfolios in concert with local operators that are specializing in this type of activity. Several of which were actually at your conference sometime ago. The issue for us is the most of that is not in the markets that we are in. The typical market where that\u2019s going to make sense is going to be a market where the homes are deeply, deeply discounted. And we are seeing in most of our markets the value of for-sale property increasing or being relatively flat and you need a big reduction in price in order to make that work in our opinion. You find those opportunities in the Inland Empire of California, in the Sacramento Valley, and in certain other areas and we have certainly looked at some of those opportunities.","We struggle with how to make that a business. There may be a trade there or an opportunity to do a dealer to, but we just don\u2019t see it as a long-term annual business and that\u2019s why we have at this time in point its data on the sideline. There is just \u2013 there is no way that I see that in carriers where single-family homes and median price homes it's in $400,000 to $500,000 range to make that work from a single family rental standpoint. So, that is the question we continue to look at it and but at this point in time we are not seeing the fantastic opportunity.","Dave Bragg \u2013 Zelman & Associates","But, Mike, just putting the investment part of it aside and understandably still given your answer there, but just purely from an operational perspective in terms of revenue and expense synergies between the two businesses in appropriate market assuming that there is a concentrated portfolio with both multifamily units and single family, how have you thought about that?","Michael Schall","Yeah. I mean, again I think well even within our footprint. So, if you say okay, the three County Bay Area, the counties surrounding the bay, the areas that we are going to be able to buy homes that are discounted enough in order to make that work out on an investment basis are going to be areas that we all renters will not want to rent in and not want to live in. So, I am sure there are some areas where that will work and just not areas that we own property and I\u2019ll give you some examples. Maybe Hayward have some areas where within the \u2013 within Alameda County that where you could find housing in expenses enough to generate a positive cash flow a significant positive cash flow on the rental transaction.","The problem is we don\u2019t really want to be in Hayward. It\u2019s not one of our desired locations. We have one property there, it\u2019s up in the hills near Cal State East Bay has very specific reason why it\u2019s there and why it\u2019s a good investment. That aside, we just don\u2019t see, we don\u2019t see it as major competition. I know that it actually you went to Skyline and you were \u2013 you noted that you caught them on a very short-term period where they had a lot of move-outs, but I think that\u2019s an anomaly. I think that there are typically in the 20% to 25% move-out range right now to home ownership and that\u2019s the highest end product anywhere. So, again we are sensitive to it, I assure you, we just don\u2019t see it as being a major detraction from our operation.","Dave Bragg \u2013 Zelman & Associates","Sure. I will take it offline. I understand the answer from an economic perspective, but more so was thinking about just purely operational revenue synergies and expense synergies given your platform, but I'll follow up with you. Thank you.","Michael Schall","Very good.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Tayo Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies","Yes. I am just curious across your market, if you have seen any real change in demand for all your products, whether it\u2019s the one bedroom, two bedroom, or the three bedroom and if you are what you think is causing that or driving that?","Erik Alexander","This is Erik. We haven\u2019t seen any unique changes in product demands.

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.","Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs, as well as information available to the Company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found in the Company's filings with the SEC.","It is now my pleasure for introduce your host, Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you, Mr. Schall, you may begin. ","Mike J. Schall","Thank you, Rob. I would like to start by welcoming you to our first quarter earnings call. Mike Dance and Erik Alexander will follow me with comments. John Eudy and John Burkart are also in attendance. On the call, I'd like to cover the following three topics, our first quarter results, an update on the merger with BRE, and our future priorities.","On to the first topic, yesterday we were pleased to report continued strong operating results, consistent with the robust housing environment on the West Coast. We reported 7.2% revenue growth, which matched our Q3 2012 for the highest same-property revenue growth achieved since the great recession, and represents a reacceleration of rental growth that began a year ago.","The recovery from our seasonally weakest fourth quarter occurred faster than normal this year, allowing us to exceed the midpoint of the guidance range in each region and the high end of the guidance range in Northern California and Seattle.","The greatest outperformance was in Northern California, where our combination of factors has led to a substantial shortage of housing. Northern California has among the best job growth in America, recently reported at about 3.3% for the three primary metro areas surrounding the San Francisco Bay, with only 0.7% of existing housing stock expected to be delivered in 2014. ","Further evidence of the housing shortage is reflected in the sales prices of medium-priced homes in the Bay area, which have increased by 13% to 27% year-over-year. Accordingly, although apartment rents are up about 9% year-over-year, the cost of housing alternatives has increased even more to the benefit of apartments.","A key management objective is converting same-property NOI into recurring cash flow or core FFO growth. Timing of financing transactions, repayments of preferred equity investments and net dispositions in Q1 created drag on core FFO per share reported at 8% growth for the quarter.","As you know, we formed three joint ventures in connection with the BRE merger detailed on page S14 of the supplement. These joint ventures have a Southern California focus, with 2,900 of the 4,175 apartments in these ventures located in Southern California.","As a result, our ownership weighted portfolio allocations changed less than previously expected from the merger, with Northern California declining from 37% for Essex standalone to 34% post-merger and Southern California increasing from 45% Essex standalone to 47% post merger.","Recent regional job growth reports are more robust than currently reflected in our market forecasts included on page S15 of the supplement, which did not change from last quarter. Notably, our thesis for slow and steady improvement in Southern California appears to be on track.","Now to my second topic, a merger update. We are very pleased that the merger with BRE was consummated materially as planned. Throughout the process, many people at both companies, now one E team contributed a relentless, focused and dedicated effort to make the merger a reality. To those E team members listening today, please accept my warmest appreciation and thanks for a job well done.","As a result of the merger, 523 BRE employees have joined the Essex team, including three executives, with two of the three accepting temporary assignments, 82 joining a corporate department and 438 representing property staff and their management.","Our baseline financial assumptions noted previously remain mostly intact and Mike Dance will update guidance in a moment. Most of the expense savings were accomplished by reductions in staff at the closing. Going forward, we will continue to incur merger integration costs, as systems and processes are consolidated over the next 12 to 15 months.","Through this process, additional synergies will be realized attributable to consultants employees hired with temporary contracts, excess office space, and duplicate license fees on a variety of systems and processes.","In just a few years, Essex has grown from $6 billion to $16 billion in enterprise value. As a result, we view the integration process as an opportunity to completely reexamine how we provide our basic service while carefully selecting the best practices from Essex, BRE and others.","And finally, my third topic, which is our future priorities. You all probably know that we run a relatively flat organization, and clearly this is an incredibly busy time for the Essex team, requiring us to be careful -- requiring us to carefully prioritize our activities, which I would like to quickly summarize as follows.","In the short to midterm, three key priorities. First, reduce the growth differential between Essex and BRE portfolios while taking advantage of current conditions as we navigate our peak leasing season.","Already, we made significant progress in reconciling pricing practices and have implemented changes to reduce turnover, increasing pricing power and occupancy. Erik will comment further on the progress made in pricing.","A reconciliation of the 1.6% revenue growth differential between Essex and BRE in Q1 has the following components. 25% of the 1.6% growth rate differential is due to sub-market portfolio allocations. 25% is due to redevelopment contribution and other management-related factors. 19% is due to declining quarter-over-quarter occupancy within the BRE portfolio, and 31% is due to increases in other income.","Our second priority, short midterm, is to vigorously pursue the integration of systems and processes for BRE and Essex. And our third priority is to ramp-up investment activity for the combined companies.","In the first quarter, as you know, we were a net seller of property. The substantial improvement in cost of capital since year end now allows us to add significant value through acquisitions and other external growth to continue for the foreseeable future.","And then, the priorities in the mid to long term are, again there are three of them. Number one, look for opportunities to improve the financial structure of the combined companies from the perspective of risk, reward, cost of capital, NAV and core FFO accretion. This could include co-investments on future development opportunities, for example.","Number two; rethink how we provide our basic service given significant market concentrations within our portfolio. This could include a different management structure for our greatest concentrations of property, regional leasing centers with evening hours, and investments in our technology platform to improve marketing, customer relationship management, resident experience and efficiency.","And finally, third, continue to improve the E team by focusing on career paths that develop skills and create career opportunities and leaders, improve our hiring practices, provide greater regional coordination of staff and related topics.","That concludes my comments. Thank you for joining our call today. I'd like to turn the call over to Erik Alexander. Thank you. ","Erik J. Alexander","Thank you. As Mike has already highlighted, we are off to a very good start in 2014 and the next chapter of Essex's story looks promising. Both Essex and BRE turned in great quarters, and I wanted to take a moment to thank the property teams for maintaining focus during the merger. With the whirlwind of merger activity last quarter, it would be easy to lose sight of the customer and property needs.","Not only did they maintain their focus, they exceeded expectations and really helped Essex set up for a strong year. We have a lot of integration work ahead of us, but I am very encouraged how the regional leadership has brought the property teams together and concentrated on the fundamentals of property management. Thank you, E team. Senior Management and the shareholders sincerely appreciate your efforts.","So, five weeks into the integration, property operations is thriving. Culturally, the BRE and Essex teams have really come together to support the common Essex goals. I believe our early success can be attributed to purposeful outreach to BRE associates in January and February, and the fact that 90% of the regional management team from BRE has joined Essex. This group has been instrumental in leading their teams, encouraging important communications and delivering strong results.","One of the early objectives was to share our core philosophy of balancing the three-legged stool by fairly serving the representative legs, residents, employees and the shareholders. As some of you know, this philosophy includes very open atmosphere, where truth trumps title. We cannot improve as an organization, if we do not know where the challenges and opportunities are hidden.","There are some inconveniences with running parallel systems at this point, but we are making progress on our program evaluations. The positive aspect of this review is that we have the good fortune of choosing between excellent options. There are really no bad choices and we firmly believe that our commitment to review these alternatives will make Essex a better operating Company. Make no mistake we are committed to unifying the organization under a single platform. And to the extent we can accelerate decisions that lead us to that direction. We will take action to do so.","One of the most vital components is revenue management. While we continue to operate two revenue management programs, we\u2019ve taken important steps towards integrating Essex's pricing philosophy and our proven strategy of maintaining higher occupancy. Through the combined efforts of the revenue management team and the property operations group, we have increased occupancy among the BRE portfolio by 43 basis points in April alone.","We will remain focused on refining our pricing practices and stay true to our collaborative process. We expect to make further gains in occupancy with the BRE portfolio throughout the year, with the goal of having the entire portfolio operating at the same high level by the first quarter of next year.","Now, as for the Essex portfolio during the first quarter, leasing activity met or exceeded expectations in all of our markets, highlighted by better than expected occupancy, strong market rent growth, consistent renewal activity and scheduled rent growth ahead of budget.","Renewal rates grew at 5.7% during -- over expiring rates during the period, while April renewals improved to 6%. May and June renewals are expected to achieve rent growth around 6% as well. Market rents continue to grow throughout the quarter and have accelerated in recent weeks to a level 6.2% higher than where we began the year.","Given our low availability and improving demand, we should see strong, sustainable rent growth for new lease activity in all markets. However, the two areas in our portfolio that we will watch closely are CBD Seattle and the A product in Orange County, as both have shown some pricing resistance due to competitive options.","Turnover has remained within expectations during the quarter, and with rising home prices across our West Coast markets, move outs due to home purchases during the period were less than 10%, the lowest level in three years.","Heading into the peak leasing season, the portfolio's positioned right where we would like it to be, ending April at 96.2% occupancy with a net availability of less than 6%. Leasing activity at our new developments remained strong during the quarter and Dublin station stabilizing ahead of schedule and currently is 99% occupied.","Epic leased apartment homes at a rate of 45 per month during the first four months of this year and we are now more likely to stabilize this project ahead of plan.","Avery, Huxley opened in Southern California, while Mosso in San Francisco began pre leasing last month. All three projects, along with the BRE legacy project, Solstice and Wilshire La Brea have performed well and are leasing ahead of expectations.","Now, I'll share some highlights for each region beginning with Seattle. Employment growth in the region remains strong and well above the national average, with a year-over-year increase of 2.8% in March and unemployment hovering around 5%.","Amazon continues to consume office space in downtown Seattle, but the big news for the quarter was the announcement of a new 1 million-square foot distribution facility in Kent, which should bode well for our south end assets.","Boeing also committed to building a new 1.1 million-square foot wing facility in Everett. This will translate to nearly 3000 direct jobs at peak employment in the future.","Rent growth remains strong in the region, especially areas outside of the CBD, where much of the new supply continues to be delivered. However, with economic rents up 5% over the prior year, downtown isn't exactly struggling, but it is highly competitive and therefore, rents have been slower to recover from the seasonal slowdown in the fourth quarter.","As expected, we anticipate that downtown Seattle will lag other sub markets in the region in terms of rent growth, but should enjoy some benefit from accumulated loss to lease, as scheduled rents were up 6.6% year-to-date.","Improved leasing velocity in March and April, along with net availability under 6% at the end of last month, demonstrates healthy demand in the sub market. But we will have to remain vigilant, given additional deliveries throughout the year.","Turning to Northern California, job growth continues to improve in the Bay area, with year-over-year increase of 3.3% in March and 4.3% in San Jose. We have yet to see any signs of slowdown, as Salesforce, LinkedIn, Dropbox and Twitter all announced significant expansions or lease transactions totaling more than 1.7 million square feet in San Francisco, including hiring plans for 2014. San Jose is equally strong with 59% of Silicon Valley companies surveyed planning to hire people for new local jobs during 2014.","Office absorption in Silicon Valley was nearly 900,000 square feet during the quarter. Additionally Western Digital subsidiary HGST announced plans for a new 335,000-square foot expansion in San Jose, while Google plans to lease the Moffett Airfield to develop robotic, aviation and aerospace projects.","Furthermore, much talked about mystery Tech Company has committed to occupy a recently approved 2 million-square foot office project near the San Jose airport. This would be the single largest office project in San Jose and is scheduled to begin construction later this year.","The East Bay also continues to build for future job growth with software firm Workday announcing plans to build a new 430,000-square foot facility in Pleasanton.","Economic rents levels continue to outperform in all sub markets and consistent with expectations, San Francisco and Oakland are leading the way with year-over-year growth north of 10%.","Finally, turning to Southern California. Employment continues to grow at a more moderate pace compared to Seattle and the Bay area, but is improving, with Orange County, Los Angeles and San Diego all posting year-over-year job growth rates above 2%. Unemployment continues to decline in Los Angeles and now stands at 8.7%. This is down from 10.1% last year and is improved 50 basis points since December.","Not only is this overall employment picture continuing to improve in Los Angeles, the professional business service sector posted a 4.7% gain in March, so the quality of jobs is improving as well.","The year-over-year economic rent growth for Essex Southern California portfolio was 6.2%. The Los Angeles sub market posted encouraging results with a 6% year-over-year growth in economic rent and a 4.7% gain since the beginning of the year.","Orange County and San Diego are performing as expected, but Ventura is ahead of projections through the first four months of the year and may represent a favorable surprise for Essex, if job growth projections match our forecasts.","So overall, economic and rental market conditions remain strong across the portfolio, and solid performance through the first four months of the year gives us confidence heading into the peak leasing season.","I am encouraged by the early integration efforts and look forward to completing many of the fundamental system changes this year that will allow us to take advantage of the operational efficiencies that we believe are available with our more concentrated footprint.","Thank you for your time. I will now turn the call over to Mike Dance. ","Mike T. Dance"," ","Thanks, Erik. Today, I will provide comments on our first quarter results, followed by highlights on the recent balance sheet activity and close with new guidance for the full year, which includes BRE.","First, I\u2019ll start with the same-property expense growth in the quarter, which grew at 4.6%. While the growth was above the high end of our guidance range, it was consistent with our plan for the year. The cause of the above average growth was due to higher taxes in Seattle, the timing of scheduled repairs in maintenance and higher utility rates relative to last year.","For the second quarter, we expect our same-property expense growth to be around 5%. And in the second half of the year we expect the growth rate to moderate to approximately 2%. For the full year, we expect same-property expense growth to be within the 3.5% at the midpoint.","Merger expenses incurred in the first quarter total approximately $16 million and was comprised of local transfer taxes on the BRE assets transferred on March 31, professional fees incurred, and the cost of the commitment for the bridge loan, which was canceled on March 31. In total, we expect to incur approximately $70 million of merger expenses in 2014, which will reduce reported FFO, but be excluded from core FFO.","Next, I will comment on the capital markets transactions and provide a post merger update to the financial metrics of our combined balance sheet. Through the end of April, we issued $191 million in equity to fund our acquisitions and development pipeline.","In April, we went to the bond market and issued 10 year unsecured notes at 3 7\/8% or 128 basis points over the 10 year treasury rate. Given the outsized demand for our notes, we upsized the offering relative to our original expectations.","These capital market events, while very attractive long-term costs of capital, will have a short-term negative impact to our 2014 earnings of approximately $0.05 per share due to the timing and the magnitude relative to our original plan.","We have now waived the long-term debt, the equity and the joint venture capital originally planned as part of the BRE transaction, enabling us to avoid the extra costs of funding the bridge loan announced with the merger. We believe these post merger capital markets activity clearly demonstrates the cost of capital benefits we envisioned as part of the BRE transactions.","The Essex post merger pro forma April balance sheet continues to strengthen. While the debt to total market capitalization of 31% is relatively unchanged from the end of the first quarter, the unencumbered net operating income to total net operating income has increased to 63% and our secured debt to total assets has decreased to 18%.","While the net debt to EBITDA ratio has increased by approximately 1 turn, the forecasted growth and net operating income from the stabilized portfolio and the delivery of the development pipeline will improve this ratio to approximately 7 times by March 2015.","I will now highlight the changes to our new 2014 guidance. On page 6 of the press release, you will find the key assumptions regarding BRE, and on F13 of the supplement, we have provided the line item details for the original Essex guidance with the changes from the mergers' key assumptions.","We have increased the midpoint of our core FFO per diluted share estimate by $0.05. The $0.05 per share updates the Essex guidance for the capital markets activity I noted earlier, and includes the expected contributions from the BRE portfolio and the combined synergies from eliminating redundant public company costs and corporate positions.","To date, the achieved savings exceed our initial plan for 2014. However, the greater savings are offset by the negative impact from the Mission Bay 360 fire. We now expect to achieve the high end of our prior range for accretion from the merger on a full year run rate basis, as we are more confident than we -- that we will be able to exceed the synergies we originally underwrote.","In closing, I wanted to provide a quick explanation as to how the fire at Mission Bay 360 impacts our 2014 FFO guidance. Properties acquired in the business combination are assigned fair values as of the merger close date. Our original forecast assigned a fair value to the Mission Bay 360 development based on the assumption that leasing activities would begin in the second half of the year.","After the loss from the fire, the value of the damaged property is significantly below the historical cost basis and results in less capitalized interest beginning on April 1 and continuing through reconstruction. If the fire had not occurred, our 2014 guidance range would have increased by another $0.03 to $0.05.","That ends my comments and I will turn the call back to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions)","Our first question comes from the line of Nick Joseph with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","Nick Joseph - Citigroup","Great. Thanks. I was wondering if you could talk about the decision of which properties actually contribute to the JVs.","Mike J. Schall","Sure, Nick, this is Mike Schall. We do a pretty good ranking of each property. We looked at every property, underwrote each one of them and we tried to find properties that were consistent. In other words, we wanted to own over the long haul, but we tended toward the higher cap rate type of properties and tried to match that with the right investor. We think that that leaves us with a very, very strong portfolio, well diversified within the different marketplaces.","And I guess it's a little bit like painting a picture, in that you move through it piece by piece, trying to match the investor with the assets and coming up with something that you think is fundamentally attractive and appropriate, given our business plan going forward. That's how we approached it. So there's not a simple answer to that. It was an evolutionary process, and but I think the outcome worked out very well for us.","Nick Joseph - Citigroup","Thanks. And you mentioned one of your priorities going forward is the acquisition opportunities. Can you talk about the acquisition pipeline today?","Mike J. Schall","Sure. We just closed our first transaction post merger, Piedmont in Bellevue in the Pacific Northwest. And we are accumulating transactions. Actually, the deal flow going into the summer appears to be picking up and as you know, principally because John Eudy who's here with me today and Craig Zimmerman have so much credibility in the marketplace, we tend to get a look at virtually everything.","So I'm hopeful. As it stands today, we're looking at several transactions. We've committed to none of them. And -- but again, the deal -- within a deal flow volume that is picking up. I would say going back to our guidance would be our first step this year, which was $300 million to $400 million. We expect to achieve that level and whether we can go above that remains to be seen. We're working on it.","Nick Joseph - Citigroup","Great, thanks.","Mike J. Schall","Thank you","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Andrew Schaffer with Sandler O'Neill. Please proceed with your question.","Andrew Schaffer - Sandler O'Neill","Thanks. Continuing on the topic of investment activity, given the continued strength in Northern California, should we expect to see more acquisition dollars spent in this region rather than Southern California?","Mike J. Schall","That's a good question. And we like both right now. Northern California still has a lot of room to run, when Erik read through his script, every time I hear it, I marvel at how much positive news there is out there. And the economy once it starts clicking, it's a momentum thing and momentum does not generally change real quickly unless there's an asset bubble or something else materially changes to changes scenario. So that's what we like about Northern California.","Having said that, Northern California, if you look at price per unit, look at rent per square foot, appears to be becoming more pricey, although the rent to median income statistics are still well within the desirable range and that causes us to look to Southern California. So I'm going to say about the same thing that I said last quarter, which is, we like -- we like all of the markets. We would have a slight preference for Southern California, given lower valuation metrics.","Andrew Schaffer - Sandler O'Neill","All right. Thanks. That's it for me.","Mike J. Schall","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dave Bragg, Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead with your question. Mr. Bragg, please go ahead with your question.","Dave Bragg - Green Street Advisors","I am here. Can you hear me?","Mike J. Schall","Yeah. We catch you Dave.","Dave Bragg - Green Street Advisors","Okay. Sorry about that. Good morning. And thanks for taking my questions. The first relates to the operational synergies in the BRE portfolio. You -- it's -- I just want to confirm that in terms of narrowing the revenue growth gap between the Essex and BRE portfolios, it sounds as though you think you can get 75% of the way there and you can't really do anything about the 25% that you attributed to sub market positioning, is that correct?","Mike J. Schall","Dave, its Mike Schall and Erik may want to chime in here as well. Yes, I think that's what is achievable. I think that the Essex versus BRE scenario included they have about 10% more turnover of units and the way they price their renewals is fundamentally different from Essex. And what they view as the sweet spot with respect to occupancy and availability are different from Essex.","And so what Erik has done is he has consolidated the revenue management function. Actually, the person that's leading that is a BRE executive under John (indiscernible) leadership, or under his guidance. And so we're running both LRO and yield start. But we view both of those as being essentially tools and really the strategy is what's important.","And so we've changed the strategy. It's consistent going forward. And the only thing that you would think that we could not pick up would be, I agree, the sub market allocation, which will change over time obviously as the slow, steady recovery in Southern California continues to get better and we go through periods of time.","So even -- I'd say even that the 1.6%, 25% of the 1.6% was attributable to sub market allocation. Obviously, that'll change over time as the relationships between the sub market rent growth vary from market-to-market.","Dave Bragg - Green Street Advisors","That's helpful, thank you. And the second question relates to the full year run rate range of $24 million to $27 million that you provided for operating and G&A synergies. Of course BRE's G&A last year was $23 million. So can you please break that out between G&A and other operating synergies and talk a little bit about what those operating synergies are?","Mike T. Dance","Well, what you see on the $25 million, that is net of cost that they capitalize or allocated to property management. So it is not a simple exercise and rather than getting into the details, we can probably do that offline.","Dave Bragg - Green Street Advisors","Okay. All right. That's fine. Thanks.","Mike T. Dance","","Thanks, Dave.","","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Toti with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead with your question.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald","Hi, Good morning. You mentioned ultra low move out rates due to home purchasing. But could you comment on turnover and move outs around price and potential renter fatigue and is that some of the increase in activity in Seattle?","Erik J. Alexander","This is Erik. So the reason for move out due to call it costs, or whether some people describe it as they got a rent increase or it's too expensive or they've -- it's passed them up, has remained basically the same over the last four quarters. We're not seeing that in Seattle at this point.","Seattle does have the highest rate of move out due to home purchases in that average that's below 10%. That region's around 13%, but still well under where it has been in the past. So we still feel very comfortable with the relationship between the applicants that are coming in and what they make and where the rent levels are.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald","Okay, that's helpful. My second question has to do with the BRE integration. And I don't know if you've mentioned this, but is there -- have you defined the scope of potential redevelopment opportunities within the BRE portfolio, or is it too early? And if not too early, is there any kind of expectation for scale and time line and return?","John F. Burkart","Yes, this is John Burkart. We haven't defined that and released that, but the size of the opportunities we think are pretty significant. There is a slight difference in the portfolios between Essex and BRE in that their portfolio is a little bit younger than ours.","And therefore, as we look at the renovation opportunities, there's a little bit less infrastructure work that we will be doing and a little bit higher return of finished work that will be doing in that portfolio. But we are aggressively putting together a plan, similar to what we did to the Essex portfolio.","We'll probably have a lot more of that information available at the November NAREIT. At this point in time, we're working through, trying to make good decisions. We'd like to understand the marketplace and put a lot of time into that. It's not as simple as just looking at what we perceive as issues from a physical plan. It's getting in and really understanding what the residents will value and making that the right decisions there.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald","Okay, very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of David Harris of Imperial Capital. Please proceed with your question.","David Harris - Imperial Capital","Yeah. Hi, everyone. We're frequently told in the aftermath of a merger that everything exceeded expectations. I'm just wondering if I can pose the question, what's been the least positive development as we've gone through this process.","Mike J. Schall","Hi, David, it's Mike. Wow, way to put me on the spot on that one.","David Harris - Imperial Capital","We don't do soft questions in this department.","Mike J. Schall","As someone noted, one of the research pieces noted that we didn't have to deal with the polar vortex. Although we did have to deal with droughts, fires, earthquakes and other random events. The worst thing, I think that a number of people that are knowledgeable and have been through this process, including one of our Board members that was involved in several bank M&A transactions, said watch out for the cultures and integrating the cultures and integrating across different offices and a variety of things, is the most challenging event.","And I'd have to say that I think that is, that proved accurate. I think that we did a really good job of getting out ahead of that. I sent Mr. Burkart and Mr. Alexander on a mission to go to attend the BRE company meetings and annual awards ceremony and they answered questions for an hour plus at the BRE meetings before the merger. And so we tried to work that together so that the teams can come together.","But as you can imagine, there are fears. They're human beings with concerns about their job and what it means and how it could be different and who are the new leaders of the Company and how will they treat us, and so overcoming that I think was -- is challenging. It's not done by any means, but it's an ongoing process, and I think we've done well with it.","David Harris - Imperial Capital","Are you over the hump with that, Mike? You seem to be talking a bit in the past tense.","Mike J. Schall","Well, I don't think that we're exactly over the hump, no. I think that there is still plenty of issues to be overcome. People, for example, they -- all things being equal, people want to utilize the system. We talked about integrating systems. Well all things being equal, people want to utilize the systems they're most used to, and that obviously can't happen.","We need to become one company, and we need to merge these together. And so people need to work with us to both make the right decision, which sounds simple, but it's somewhat threatening to the people.","My view is we're going to continue growing as a Company. There's going to be plenty of opportunity out there for those that buy into the culture and love the company like I do and so that it shouldn't -- it won't be an issue. However, when you get into the nitty-gritty of that, what that looks like, it is a little bit problematic.","David Harris - Imperial Capital","Okay. If I can have a second bite, now we're with the big boys in the S&P, isn't it time to split the shares and make Essex a little affordable for grandma to own more than two shares?","Mike J. Schall","Well, I think as soon as Warren Buffett splits Berkshire Hathaway we'll consider that.","David Harris - Imperial Capital","Okay.","Mike J. Schall","No, I'm just kidding. The issue there is the cost of splitting the shares when you are in the high, what 90% institutionally held and typically you're charged are per share cost to sell stock. So it just seems to fit our profile and it seems to make sense to us so we probably will not split the shares.","David Harris - Imperial Capital","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Mike J. Schall","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Michael Salinsky of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","Good afternoon, guys. Mike, you talked about investment, I think you addressed a couple questions about how that's picking up. Can you talk about -- a little bit about what you see are the opportunities on the development side, whether development still makes sense at this point of the cycle? And then also, BRE had been going through a fairly extensive cleanup. How much of that's left to do on the BRE portfolio?","John D. Eudy","Hi, Michael, this is John Eudy. We probably hit our peak on April 1, the day of the merger in terms of the development exposure that we anticipate having, a little over 2,800 units, plus or minus $1.75 billion after we add the BRE assets to the Essex. Most of those deals were contemplated, underwritten and done two and three years ago, so we have the benefit of both the cost side, as well as the land basis side and fees to -- wind to our back.","On a go forward basis, we are and we've said this previously, lessening our development exposure in total. However, there are still a few deals that we are going to be doing over the next year that have some legacy advantages cost wise. It's very difficult on the ground to buy at expectation prices that sellers are willing to sell at and at costs where they are today.","So that's mainly the reason why I'm going to most likely see our portfolio average exposure go down. We have probably three more starts this year. By the end of this year, just for some color of our -- the 2700, 2800 units that we have in development, we will have stabilized about a third of them by the end of the year. They'll come off. Another third will basically be done, delivered to operations and be fundamentally well on their way to stabilization, so you can see the bell curve on exposure is going to go down dramatically, even with the three additions.","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","And then in terms of the cleanup on the BRE portfolio, I know they had been talking about selling assets. They sold three before the merger. How much cleanup's left to go on that?","Mike J. Schall","Hi, Mike, it's Mike Schall. There were two assets in Phoenix, plus a joint venture on a third asset in Phoenix that were being marketed by BRE in Q4 and Q1. Ultimately did not sell and we will look to sell those assets at the appropriate time? So we still have some cleanup with respect to those assets.","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. And then Mike, this is my follow-up question; you talked about the occupancy and renewal strategy. I'm assuming that's going to generate accelerating revenue growth on BRE. Is it an expectation that in 2014 you could see by the fourth quarter the growth rate in the BRE portfolio we've seen that of Essex, given the low hanging fruit there?","Erik J. Alexander","This is Erik. I think it's very possible that we could accelerate the occupancy and the rent growth faster than originally anticipated. Going back to Mike's comments about the culture I think that's the key and do the teams that have to execute this, you know buy into the plan and so far, so good from revenue management standpoint and property operations.","So we're encouraged by what we see. Some of the things we can't change with respect to lease expiration profile. That'll have to happen over time and renewals that have already been sent out. But that's a short term issue and, again, I think we're set up to take advantage of the peak leasing season.","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","(Operator Instructions)","Our next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies & Company","Hi, yes. Good morning, over there. Fantastic quarter. Just quick question, with Northern California doing even better than I think most of us expected. Are we any closer to condo conversions at this point?","Mike J. Schall","Tayo, yes, this is Mike Schall. We are ever closer I think as time goes on. The key metric there I think is the year-over-year increase in housing prices. And if you look at -- if you look at some of the specific metros, the closer you are to downtown San Francisco, for example, and really down the peninsula, some very interesting things are happening. And condo prices for well located properties are moving up pretty significantly.","And in fact, one of the Senior Executives here is listing his condo because he got an eye-popping number. And so I think we're getting closer and with respect to a couple of metros. But as a general statement, we have somewhere around 7,000 apartments that could be converted to condos. We're talking about a relatively small subset of the portfolio at this point in time and really focused on San Francisco and some of the other Northern California cities.","Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies & Company","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our question is a follow-up from the line of Dave Bragg, Green Street. Please go ahead with your question.","Dave Bragg - Green Street Advisors","Thank you. When will we receive the BRE first quarter financials?","Mike J. Schall","We're filing a Q hopefully Friday that'll show pro forma at a very high level. There is no requirement for them to file a Q, so there will be limited disclosure on those statements other than what we are required to produce for 8-K or pro forma going forward.","Dave Bragg - Green Street Advisors","So no actuals from BRE from the first quarter?","Mike J. Schall","There's no requirement to do so. So there's no -- again, what would be required for us you'll purposes, you'll see some net income on a pro forma basis in the Q that we file on Friday.","Dave Bragg - Green Street Advisors","Thank you.","Mike J. Schall","Thanks, Dave.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.","Haendel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley","Hey, good morning out there.","Mike J. Schall","Welcome Haendel.","Haendel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley","Hey, just one for me here. It's been a long call. Question on the Essex Management psychology going forward, Mike, Essex has historically been what a lot of people would deem an opportunistic investor, not only on the direct asset side, but also doing things that some of us would call non-core, some of your mezzanine type of investments. Given your larger size, your S&P inclusion, do you expect that to change? Will you perhaps become a bit more conservative, more core in your investment approach going forward?","Mike J. Schall","Hi, Haendel. That's a great question, thank you for that. Not as long as I lead the Company. So I mean my view is you can add -- we've added a zero or two to the Company over time and it doesn't fundamentally change anything. It doesn't fundamentally change my job or how we have learned to make money in this business and do the things that we do.","So it is actually the opposite of that. I would expect us to continue to be opportunistic to try to understand markets and I think that we will have greater resources to do so. And I think that if there's been one limitation that we've had as a Company, it's been because we're flat and G&A-constrained, let's say. We have a few more resources than we've had in the past.","I'll give you an example. BRE had a business intelligence unit that had several people and we've taken over that. We believe strongly in it. And we think that given, or having the ability to have that type of entity within the Company will help us make better decisions, help us understand the portfolio better, and so I think it's actually the opposite.","I think that the reason why we thought that BRE transaction made sense was, number one, because the real state made sense on a per share basis. But number two, we think that this business is -- there is an element to this business that is scalable and part of that is how we deal with problems and opportunities and having the required resources in order to maximize the ultimate outcome. So long winded, but I think that's what we're focused on and that's why we're very excited about both the short term and the long term of the BRE transaction.","Handel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley","Well, it's worked for you so far. Good luck and congratulations again.","Mike J. Schall","Thank you. ","Operator","Our next question is from the line of David Harris, Imperial Capital. Please go ahead with your question.","David Harris - Imperial Capital","Yeah. Hi, again. I'm looking for a little clarification on the merger-related expenses. You've expensed $16 million in the first quarter. And I'm looking at the guidance, and Mike Dance I think you made reference to $17 for the year.","Mike T. Dance","Yes.","David Harris - Imperial Capital","So million $70 million minus $16 million is the outstanding balance?","Mike T. Dance","Correct.","David Harris - Imperial Capital","Okay. What -- there's a footnote here saying excludes BRE merger costs of $35 million on the right-hand side of that -- these numbers on the S13 page.","Mike T. Dance","Yes. You're on a roll. You're correct, three for three.","Mike J. Schall","Right, exactly. The BRE went through the BRE books and records and they-- ","David Harris - Imperial Capital","I see.","Mike J. Schall","History, so it's not on -- it won't be on the Essex books, there were -- all the BRE related merger costs that have been incurred prior to the merger were expensed by BRE in the past. And the other component that doesn't show up there is the diluted share count, the impact of the change of control on option and RSU vestings, both the share count.","David Harris - Imperial Capital","Okay. So I've got a question with regard to the timing of this, then. Is it reasonable to think that most of that additional -- what was -- $70 million minus $16 million, that $54 million is going to be front end loaded, or is it going to be spread evenly?","Mike J. Schall","Yes.","David Harris - Imperial Capital","And then is it reasonable at this point in time to assume that we're then done or do you think there will be some run on it into 2015 of merger-related costs?","Mike J. Schall","I suspect that the vast majority of it will fall into 2014. And most of it, the attorneys, the investment bankers, the -- all those related costs have been incurred and will be part of the second quarter and that it will drop off. The merger integration expenses will be ongoing. We've made some comments about what those categories are and they will -- again, we're not going to be in a huge hurry to try to integrate the systems because from our perspective, we've grown from $6 billion to $16 billion in enterprise value and essentially taken our time to work through how we deliver the service and what the best options are with respect to the structure of the Company, are very important decisions and we're not going to feel like we have a gun to our head in order to make those decisions quickly.","David Harris - Imperial Capital","Okay. And then an additional question, sorry to take so much time up. But we're looking for the capitalized cost of disclosure. As you know, I think this is a rather important issue and I'm wondering whether I've not seen it or whether it's not been included for whatever reason?","Mike T. Dance","Yes, with the merger integration costs, there's a lot of noise going through that schedule. So starting in 2015, we'll continue to provide that, but we want to get the merger and integration costs through the system to make that disclosure more meaningful.","David Harris - Imperial Capital","So we're not going to have it for the rest of this year, Mike?","Mike T. Dance","That's the plan.","David Harris - Imperial Capital","Okay. When you bring it back, can you bring a new and improved version including G&A capitalized costs?","Mike T. Dance","That was in the old version. So that we would continue, not to say it can't be improved on, but your input will be valued. ","David Harris - Imperial Capital","Good. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Karin Ford, KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.","Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Hi. Good morning. Just a technical question. Will the BRE same-store pool be in Essex's same-store pool starting next quarter?","Mike T. Dance","Good question. This is Mike Dance. We have not yet decided, so we are kind of working through the options and we'll come up with what we think is the best presentation.","Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay. And when you give revised guidance, presumably you'll give us revised core on both in the second quarter?","Mike T. Dance","Depending on which will partially take, that would be if we do the pro forma as if we bought BRE out of a pooling of interest, we would show the combined. But that's -- again that will part of the decision making process.","Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay.","Mike J. Schall","And Karen, can I add one other thing?","Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Yes.","Mike J. Schall","It's Mike Schall. Mike's comment is from an accounting standpoint. From a Managerial perspective, we are very focused on trying to close that gap between our growth rate and BRE's growth rate. That is one of our primary internal metrics, so we're going to be looking at it primarily from that perspective. But what Mike said about the accounting side also very relevant. So, wanted to give you pieces of both. ","Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets","That's helpful. And my last question is just on the fire at MB 360. Do you expect that to have any material impact on the long term viability of that project or the neighborhood or do you think once you get it cleaned up and rebuilt that that project's going to be as good as you expected it to be before the fire?","Mike J. Schall","It's Mike Schall and if you drive out there in that Mission Bay Area, San Francisco, it is truly an amazing place. And so we think the long-term viability of the asset is every bit as good, if not better, than it ever has been.","And so we're very excited about the project and obviously disappointed with the fire and all the outcome. And by the way, there's a longer process there with respect to testing the podium strength and the PT cables and a variety of other things. So that's an ongoing process and it's still way too early to comment about exactly what's going to happen there. ","Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets","And the second phase that's going to start leasing in the fourth quarter of 2014?","Mike J. Schall","Yes, yes.","Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. At this time for closing comments, I'll turn the floor back over to Mr. Mike Schall.","Mike J.

As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded.","Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs, as well as information available to the company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found in the company's filings with the SEC.","When we get to question-and-answer portion, management ask that you be respectful of everyone's time and limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you. Mr. Schall, you may begin.","Michael Schall","Thank you, April. Thank you for joining us today. And welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call. John Burkart and Angela Kleiman will follow me with comments. John Eudy and Erik Alexander are here in attendance for Q&A.","This part quarter John Burkart assumed leadership of our Asset Management and Operations functions, and thus he will provide commentary for those activities today and in the future. Also as you know, Angela became CFO on October 1st upon Mike Dance\u2019s retirement. Please join me in welcoming both of them to their new roles on the quarterly call.","I will cover the following topics on the call. First, Q3 result and activities, second, an update on rent control discussions, third, review of investment market, and fourth, comments on our 2016 preliminary market forecast.","On to the first topic, yesterday we were pleased to report another impressive quarter driven by strong West Coast economy. As expected, demand from robust job growth led the continued high occupancy for apartments and significant increases in for-sale home price. Thus our reported results for same property revenue, NOI and core FFO per share growth exceeded our expectation and led the multifamily industry.","As to the quarterly results, I would like to recognize the Essex team for their tremendous effort and for exceeding expectations once again. With the few exceptions, rents at the B quality property and locations are growing faster than As, exemplified in the Oakland Metro with 12.7% same-property revenue growth, the highest in our portfolio.","Despite the fact that Oakland -- the Oakland Metro generated only 2.2% year-over-year job growth for the nine months ended September that significantly lag San Francisco and San Jose at 4.6% and 5.5%, respectively. These occur because affordability and commute time are two critical considerations for most apartment figures.","With traffic congestion growing, the accessibility to major employment centers has become incredibly challenging and more people are doubling up living with relatives or moving to less expensive areas. Thus we believe that B location closest the job at public transit will continue to perform best in 2016.","In recent investor meetings, we have heard concerns about tech hiring and changing housing preferences favoring homeownership. As the tech hiring, we closely follow tech job growth, especially in the current environment given broader economic issues, such as the strength of U.S. dollar, weak commodity prices, weak global growth and the divergence and performance of key sectors of the economy.","The Essex portfolio will normally experience softness in traffic and pricing a month or two before slowdown in hiring is picked up by the data vendors. This is complicated to some extent by the normal seasonal slowdown that is typical in the apartment business this time a year. At this point, we have not experienced a slowdown beyond normal seasonal pattern and reported job growth has been excellent. Perhaps, the best way to demonstrate the current condition is the 2% improvement in loss to leave at the end of Q3 from 5% at the end of September 2014 to 7% at September 30, 2015.","As to the homeownership rate, we continue to focus on the relationship between the number of new homes, both rental and for-sale that are being delivered, compared to household formations estimated from employment growth.","We have heard some economist use national data, when discussing this relationship, which we believe is often misleading, apartments at our local business and therefore, our valuation of supply and demand is regionally focused.","For a variety of reasons, including the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 and related law, we continue to expect very muted production of for-sale housing in the coastal metros of California, as cities implement an urban village housing concept accessed by a robust public transit system.","This new concept is likely to take years to implement and will favor apartments and condos. Therefore we believe it is unlikely that there will be a significant increase in for-sale housing production that is necessary to materially increase the homeownership rate in Coastal California.","On to the second topic, rent control. I commented last quarter that proposed -- proposals for local rent control ordinances are being in discussed in several West Coast cities, particularly in California.","Cities are generally protective of their rental stock and voters that live in apartment, and there is a growing concern that high income tech workers will displace other resident that have not received large increase in the compensation.","I\u2019ve commented on previous calls about Richmond California, which is the first city to approve in preliminary form a draft of rent control ordinance. Opposition led by the California Department Association has been able to force the Richmond rent control proposals to the voters in 2016.","For context, California State Law supersedes city ordinances fortunately for landlord, state law mandates, vacancy decontrol and prohibits rent control on apartments completed after 1995.","We have also seen some cities and community organizations focused on the long-term impact of inadequate housing supply, particularly at lower income levels and acknowledge of rent control has unintended negative consequences and ignored the real issue, that is a shortage of housing production.","Our view is that there is no near-term solution to the housing shortages, especially in Northern California, because cities are generally not supportive of progress strategies, entitlements for new housing continued to be challenging and costly to obtain, and construction cost has spiked around 10% in each of the past two years. Therefore, we don't expect that rent control discussion to end anytime soon. We encourage landlords to self-regulate by considering these factors as part of their lease renewal strategies.","Third topic, investments, as commented previously, we will become more selective as to our external growth activities, although we continue to be very active in our search for both acquisition and development deals.","As noted previously, construction cost increases are pressuring development deals and some development deals are likely to solve. The flipside of a more selective acquisition market is the better market for property sale. You should expect to see the level of disposition increase modestly in 2016.","Cap rates remain lower throughout our markets. Using the cap rate methodology of the most active buyers, our best estimate is that the highest quality property and locations create around 4% cap, while B quality property and locations create around 4.5% cap rate, lesser quality properties trade at higher cap rates and periodically and aggressively underwritten or trophy property will trade in the high 3 cap rate range. Some buyers make more aggressive assumptions that can add 25 to 50 basis points of cap rate compared again to the yields underwritten by more active buyers.","On the fourth topic which is the -- our market outlook for 2016. Page S-16 of the supplement provides an overview of the key housing supply\/demand and economic assumptions supporting our market rent growth expectations for 2016.","As before, we assume each of the West Coast metros except Ventura will outperform the national average job growth assumed to be 2%. While we are not projecting the continuation of the exceptional job growth that we have enjoyed in 2015, we have no specific reason that hiring is going to moderate other than the concerns about the global economy noted previously.","Note that we do not need extraordinary job growth to generate favorable supply\/demand relationship and great results. Should job growth continue at the pace experienced in 2015, we are likely to exceed the forecasted results for market rents shown on our market outlook.","Finally, the 2016 same-property revenue growth expectation for the Essex portfolio are likely to exceed the forecasted 6% economic rent growth on S-16 due to our healthy loss to lease and other factors, all of which will be discussed as part of our 2016 guidance on next call.","This concludes my comments. Thank you for joining the call today. I will turn the call over to John Burkart.","John Burkart","Thank you, Mike. I really appreciate the hard work the operations and asset management team this last quarter executing our plan which enables our great results. Third was robust. We continue to have a positive outlook for all our markets, higher than expected job growth continues to be the primary catalyst for increasing rent and higher occupancies throughout the portfolio.","Strong demand pushed economic rents higher leading to our fourth consecutive quarter of 10% increases in same-store property NOI growth. Gains from renewal activity increased 6.6% portfolio wide in the quarter and a turnover was down across the portfolio from 63% in 2014 to 60% this quarter.","As of yesterday, the same property portfolio in all regions had occupancy at or above 96% with a 30-day availability of just over 4.7%. All of our markets are benefiting from the combination of strong job and income growth and insufficient supply to keep up with the demand.","According to Axiometrics, market rent growth was stronger in September 2015 year-over-year than last year at this time in each of our region, Seattle, Bay Area, Southern California. So while we are not giving guidance for next year, we conclude from this that our markets are strong or stronger than last year at this time, which bodes well for next year.","Ramping up our redevelopment pipeline has been a major focus for 2015, including the restart of the program for the legacy BRE property. Our renovations team completed over 1,000 apartment home renovations during the third quarter and an increase of 50% compared to the third quarter of 2014. A little over 30% of the unit renovations are currently focused on the legacy BRE portfolio, which negatively impacted occupancy during the quarter.","We continue to make progress on our merger integration phase II and phase III as outlined in the June NAREIT presentation available on our website. The resource management efforts, renovation, and refinement of the revenue management unit amenity pricing are ongoing efforts that will continue for the foreseeable future. We are making good progress on phase III which is focused on improving our customer experience, growing our employees and increasing our efficiency, the results of which will be realized after 2016.","Now I will share some highlights for each region beginning with Southern California. Los Angeles, Orange County and San Diego continue to be strong performers this quarter, driven by job growth of 2.3%, 3.3% and 3.2% respectively, all exceeding our initial expectations and U.S. averages.","Personal income growth continues to grow well above the national average in all three metros. Northern California continues to perform above expectations due to exceptional job growth in San Francisco and San Jose, which was reported for September at 4.6% and 5.5% respectively.","The robust personal income growth in the Bay Area forecasted to be 4.6% San Francisco and 6.5% in San Jose. It is enabling strong market rent growth with a limited impact on affordability.","Oakland continues to perform well due to its strong income and job growth as well as its proximity to both San Francisco and Silicon Valley. Uber purchased Uptown station in downtown Oakland and is expected to accommodate 2,500 to 3,000 employees beginning in 2017.","Several other tech companies are following Uber\u2019s path, having announced their moving or expanding to Oakland to take advantage of the lower cost office space and shorter commutes for their employee, a trend that we expect to continue over the next several years. The exceptional demand at the Bay Area is evident by the strength of our lease up.","One South Market in downtown San Jose has averaged over 40 leases per month. Epic has averaged about 39 leases per month and MB360 Phase II in San Francisco which is close to being rebuilt following the tragic fire in March 2014 is already 26% pre-leased with the first move-in scheduled for the fourth quarter of this year upon completion.","Finally, in Seattle, the employment growth in this region continues to be strong at 3.3% and personal incomes are expected to grow 5.7% for 2015, maintaining rental market affordability. CBD Seattle continue to perform with revenue growth of about 4% quarter-over-quarter while the other markets, East Side, Snohomish and South King grew at approximately 8% quarter-over-quarter.","25% of the 6 million square feet of office development in the region is being delivered into downtown Bellevue with the first tower expected to be completed in the fourth quarter. Sales force has announced that it signed a lease for 75,000 square feet in Bellevue and it plans to double its current workforce in the area.","We expect housing supply to decline quietly in 2016 as rising construction cost began to limit apartment development. We're very pleased with our results year-to-date and I think our momentum should position us well into 2016.","Thank you. And I will now turn the call over to Angela Kleiman.","Angela Kleiman","Thank you, John. Today I\u2019ll discuss our third quarter results, the revised outlook for the year and provide an update on our balance sheet. For the third quarter, we exceeded in this point of our core FFO guidance by $0.06 per share. $0.03 of the outperformance resulted from higher revenue, primarily driven by the strong job growth in our markets which accelerated the rate of lease-up absorption at higher than projected rents.","$0.02 of the outperformance resulted from lower expenses within our consolidated properties, although part of the favorable expense variance is timing related. Therefore we expect our year-over-year same property operating expense growth to be between 3% to 4% with the combined portfolio in the fourth quarter. Following two previous revenue guidance increases totaling 115 basis points at the midpoint, we are reaffirming our same-store revenue growth forecast and are pleased to report that we are currently tracking slightly above the midpoint of that range.","Now turning to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet remains strong. Our net debt-to-EBITDA has now declined to 6.1 times, which is one quarter ahead of our target due to stronger than anticipated growth in EBITDA.","Based on our market rent growth outlook, we expect this metric to decline to the high five\u2019s in 2016. In addition, we are currently evaluating our options to refinance $114 million of Fannie Mae credit-enhanced bonds in the fourth quarter.","In doing so, we anticipate potential fading of $1.4 million annually over the 7-year term. And we would incur approximately $6 million in write-off, of which $4.25 million is non-cash. These costs will be excluded from core FFO but included in total FFO and are shown as non-core adjustment on S14 in the supplemental.","As for our plans for the $350 million debt maturity in 2016, we have good flexibility with access to multiple options. For example, our $1 billion revolver has virtually no outstanding and if we leave this debt floating, our variable-rate debt exposure will only increase to approximately 10% on a low average balance sheet.","Although this is not a preference, if we were making this decision today, we favor refinancing most of the maturity, returning debt with a five to seven-year term loan and\/or a 10-year unsecured public bond execution, depending on the interest rate curve and the related risk.","Lastly, we have classified one property as held for sale, our corporate headquarters in Palo Alto, which we expect to sell in the fourth quarter. We will be moving to a newly leased space in San Mateo. We\u2019re presenting the final steps in the office relocation plans which will consolidate the BRE corporate office in San Francisco with the Essex corporate office in Palo Alto.","I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions.","Michael Schall","Are you there April?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Nick Joseph of Citi.","Nick Joseph","Thanks. One of you can frame the 7% loss in the lease in a historical context. You mentioned last year it was 5% but is this the largest loss to lease that you have seen at the end of September?","Michael Schall","Nick, hi. It\u2019s Mike Schall. I don\u2019t have that statistic going back each year historically for a long time. But I know that as of July that typically is the high point of loss to lease as you go through the year and the low point is in December. So July \u201814 was 8%, July \u201815 was 8%. The low point was December. So December \u201813 was around 4% -- I\u2019m sorry December 14 was about 4% and 13 was up 4%. So gives you some idea.","Those are obviously during a very strong periods of time. I\u2019ve seen loss to lease at zero at the end of December and at 5% to 6%, I would guess is the probably the more normal high for loss to lease in a typical year. Again, these are, from my view extraordinary years. And that metric, I think at 8% in July is near the most -- near the strongest that we\u2019ve seen historically in my almost 30-year career.","Nick Joseph","Thanks. And just staying with that. The 6% economic rent growth outlook for next year is actually higher than the 5.6% you had predicted at the same time last year. So what gives you the confidence to make that prediction today?","Michael Schall","Well, a couple things. If you go back to our original guidance that you noted for 2015, it was based on 2.5% percent job growth. And if we are tracking, if used in September, year-to-date numbers are at 3.3%. So, we pretty dramatically outperformed that number and so we are carrying momentum into this next year. And our view is you add limited amount of supply and supply-demand relationship is moving in your favor, you will build pricing power. So there is a little bit of an incremental pricing power just from the supply-demand situation and consequent impacts on market occupancy levels then the place where people want to live most.","Nick Joseph","Thanks.","Operator","Next, we will hear from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc.","Austin Wurschmidt","Hi guys. It\u2019s Austin Wurschmidt here with Jordan. You commented that conditions are strong as they were last year. Is it conceivable to think that you would be able to push rents at a pace that was higher than what you achieved this year?","Michael Schall","Again, this is Mike Schall. I would just go back to the job question and if we exceed the 2.5% job growth that is the basis for our 6% market rent growth and I would say, yes, again, we will exceed it once again. We are concerned about affordability. We are concerned about all the issues with the global economy that were noted before, although one compelling factor is the personal income growth that we are seeing, especially in the tech markets, which is in the 5% to 6% range.","So if you're getting 5% to 6% personal income growth and rent sort of let\u2019s say growing at 8% or 9%, it doesn't have that bigger impact on affordability. And again, not everyone is going to get the big increase in income. The personal income growth is driven largely by people, the new tech worker coming in, making a lot of money and displacing someone that is not getting a big increase in their compensation who has been forced to move to a place that\u2019s further away from their deployment center. So this transition is ongoing through the rental pool. But if we bring in high income tech workers in greater numbers than we have projected on F-16 then yes, we would expect rent growth to be higher.","Austin Wurschmidt","Thanks for the detail there. And then you mentioned in your prepared remarks also about a decline in housing supply in 2016. And I was wondering if you could expand on that a bit and give a little bit of detail by market.","Michael Schall","I don't think that we actually have much of a decline in supply. So, I'm not sure exactly what you're referring to. I think it\u2019s very nominal. Who has those numbers? Let\u2019s see \u201815 versus \u201816. I think the supply decrease is somewhere around like 0.1%, so overall. So, we are not expecting supply to decrease. Again, we don\u2019t have complete certainty. We have some factors that would lead us to believe that supply could decrease, i.e. construction costs going up at 10% in each of the last two years.","And John Eudy is here and he is looking for development deals every day and he's having trouble with the underwriting because costs have moved so quickly and pro forma, it sometimes don't reflect the most current cost structure. So, when John and I talk about new deals, we are finding it more difficult for us to underwrite it. And if we are having trouble underwriting them, I can pretty much assure you, others are having trouble as well. John, do I have that right?","John Eudy","Yes. Any interactions that we are seeing, cities are getting tougher and tougher. Nothing is going in the favor of oversupplying market.","Austin Wurschmidt","Thanks. And then just on your comments there about the aggressive bidding going on for new deals. You mentioned being a net seller next year by a little bit amount about. Are there any markets that you are looking to lighting up and how should we think about the assets that you're taking to sellers, are this more BRE assets or they legacy assets?","Michael Schall","I don't know -- just to be clear, I don\u2019t think that we will be a net seller next year. But I don\u2019t have complete clarity on that. I think what I said was that we will likely sell more next year than we sold this year. And so to be clear, the way we look at this is there are other two sides of this coin. One is what\u2019s going on, on the capital slide. In other words, what\u2019s the relationship between where REIT stocks are valued and the private real estate markets?","Is there a disparity there between the two? And if REIT stocks should trade at valuation above where private real estate markets or then we want to be buying real estate? And the flip, we want to be selling real estate and our view is that we are currently somewhere around parity, which means we call the portfolios. So that\u2019s that the capital slide.","On the real estate side, we have very few assets that we put into the two bottom categories. Those two categories we are most motivated to sell, which are substandard operating properties and marginal properties that\u2019s trading like good properties for whatever reason that people are forced to take substandard properties. But we don't believe when the economy changes that they will be the beneficiaries.","So those are the calling assets and then the other categories of properties that we would be more interested in selling, again if this relationship between REIT stock values and private real estate values is appropriate, would be the properties that have some other maybe some minor physical or operational impairments and\/or the properties that we consider to be market performers.","About half our portfolio, just by way of background, we consider to be within the irreplaceable category, which we are unlikely to sell almost at any price. So, we have a ranking process that ranks the properties in terms of our desirability of sale, again within the constraints of how we look at the capital side and that\u2019s how we run our disposition function.","Austin Wurschmidt","Great. Thank you for the clarification and the details.","Operator","Next, we will hear from Dan Oppenheim of Zelman & Associates.","Dan Oppenheim","Thanks very much. Was wondering -- relates to the dispositions, would you have more of an emphasis on the pre-1995 entities where they would be subject to rent controls if they are to be passed as per my knowledge?","Michael Schall","Hi, Dan. It's Mike Schall again. It comes up as a consideration. But I don't think it's one of the key considerations primarily because of California State Law. Again in California, State Law, vacancy -- there is vacancy decontrols mandated. So even though you may have rent control upon move out your -- moving people\u2019s market at that point of time, we operate in several rent control cities including San Francisco, Los Angeles, Tennessee. So, I don't think that that would necessarily change things.","Our experience in San Francisco, for example in our rent-controlled buildings in San Francisco is that fewer people move outs, so your turnover rates are lower, which means you can\u2019t capture the loss to lease as quickly and you think that might be a real problem. But the flip of that is there are people that otherwise would have moved out of that building, if not for the subsidy and bought a home or move somewhere else and those people now are occupying a unit, which effectively makes the availability of units that are vacating smaller and giving us more pricing power on the other side. So again, rent-controlled cities are not necessarily horrible for us as long as state law remains in place.","Dan Oppenheim","Got it. Okay. Thanks. And then I guess other question, wondering about the magnitude of the rent increases and the turnover which clearly was down year-over-year. But just wondering in some of the areas Santa Clara, San Jose where you\u2019ve seen the high levels of rent growth, are you also seeing more move-outs on account of those rent increases? Or is actually lower because of the strong income growth in those markets so that it\u2019s initially a function of the rent growth, but it\u2019s more of the income growth that\u2019s driving into that if those rent increase aren\u2019t an issue.","Erik Alexander","This is Erik. I would say no, that we haven\u2019t seen an increase due to or significant increase due to financial reasons. If you look back over the last couple of years, that number is bounced around between 15% and 18%, that people are citing financial reasons. And so that\u2019s where it\u2019s today as well.","The one caveat is that there has been some uptick in people citing relocation out of their area as the reason. And we believe that some of that is probably related to financial reasons, but again that hasn\u2019t moved enough for me to believe that it\u2019s significant.","Dan Oppenheim","Thanks so much.","Erik Alexander","Thank you.","Operator","Alexander Goldfarb of Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander Goldfarb","Good afternoon, or I guess good morning out there. And Angela welcome to the hot seat. Just quickly a few questions here. The first one, Mike, is you said that you\u2019re considering increasing dispositions for next year. If we look going back, you guys have harvested some of your funds over time, unloading of meaningful parts of the portfolio. There is also a focus I think of Essex to always grow FFO. So would you guys ever contemplate a transaction where if you thought that the pricing so dramatic that you think that to do a sale of property that would result in earnings coming down, because you saw the significant part, even though you may generate huge gains for shareholders. Or the view is to always prune in smaller amounts and leave the larger portfolio stuff to joint ventures.","Michael Schall","Yes, Alex, good question. No, I think if there is a compelling opportunity to sell assets and distribute through a special dividend, I think we would absolutely do that. Again, right now, we are in this I just described in the sort of the parity base on the capital side where the stock obviously bounced in all over the place, so maybe getting out parity. But we\u2019re at that point where there is no compelling arbitrage between the REIT stock price and the private real estate values.","And so our motivation in that environment is not -- is great as it would be if I would say share prices and private real estate values diverging in as they have over the last several years. So there is some concern about, whether people will remember, whether ambassadors will remember that we paid a special dividend and that will probably get factored into our track record, but that\u2019s a relatively minor concern. And since that is the only reality with respect to selling assets with large gain and distributing money, we obviously can use a 1031 exchange. But if that\u2019s a reality and that\u2019s a right thing to do, then we are going to do it.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. And then switching to Oakland, last cycle you guys did some investments over there, there is a high-rise tower that you guys got involved in. And then if memory serves I thought you guys sort of exited the market or weren\u2019t as be pleased with the results that you\u2019ve got. But at the beginning of the call you guys spoke highly if the market as far as just the accessibility to San Francisco in the low cost option. So is this a market that we should see guys increasing invested, or is it still, even though maybe attractive right now, you maybe hesitated to put longer-term REITs there?","Michael Schall","Yeah, I think there is maybe a little definitional issue here. The City of Oakland is different from the Oakland Metro. The Oakland Metro includes Fremont and Pleasanton and Walnut Creek, etcetera. And so we\u2019re seeing that the Oakland Metro, which is -- what generates the 12.7% same-store revenue growth is the broader metro and there are places within that metro that are very high quality and are accessible to San Francisco and some of the major job hubs.","The one thing the Bay Area really got right was the Bay Area Rapid Transit District, which essentially has train to go from a variety of locations into San Francisco and many, many people, including myself, are living in Fremont, which is in the Oakland MSA and getting to San Francisco is a heck of a lot easier than driving. So it\u2019s the one thing they got -- I think that they got very right. And so there are locations within the Oakland Metro area that we think are high quality durable in the San Francisco etcetera.","We also believe, as John said, that as cost on the office side increase that some employers will start looking at different options that will benefit some of the other metros, including Downtown Oakland in this case, but I wouldn\u2019t limit it to just Downtown Oakland. There could be some businesses or some parts of businesses that will move up and down the coast and\/or potentially other markets as well as the cost of business increases.","Alexander Goldfarb","So as Downtown Oakland is not something you may revisit or right now it\u2019s not on the radar?","Michael Schall","To be clear about just Downtown Oakland, we have a high-rise building that we built down the street from the one you\u2019re referring to. And I don\u2019t think that we\u2019re looking at anything else than Downtown Oakland. It has to be so specific because there are some areas in Downtown Oakland that we really, really don\u2019t like. And so we would avoid them, but we would be highly, highly selective in Oakland, maybe less on so some of the other locations within the Oakland Metro, the broader metro.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. Thanks, Mike.","Michael Schall","Thanks.","Operator","Next, we will hear from Tom Lesnick of Capital One Securities.","Tom Lesnick","Hey, guys. Just quickly on the same-store guidance range, obviously on the 443,000 units, the ranges were unchanged, but on the 28,000 units OpEx was revised lower kind of implying that on the DRE portfolio, there was a revision higher and hence the range was unchanged. I was just wondering what was driving that.","Angela Kleiman","No, it\u2019s not because of that. We revised the Essex same-store because we have realized the savings from the first quarter. And so we have not revised it for the combined portfolio, because we are still waiting primarily the taxes, the biggest component of expenses. We\u2019ve only received 75% of the taxes from the DRE acquisition. And so although that has come in slightly favorable, there is still a quarter of a less, so we are just waiting on that first before we make any decisions.","Tom Lesnick","Makes sense. That\u2019s helpful. And then on the insurance reimbursement accounting, so there was about $3.1 million on the income statement and then call it 1.8 was backed out for FFO and then another cost, 600 was backed out for core and fine that there was a piece in there that was considered core. Could you clarify what that was?","Angela Kleiman","Yes, happy to. And we did move the geography a little bit this quarter and so, but the net, net is all non-core. And we added a line in our -- I think it\u2019s in the one of supplemental, S-2 that showed insurance reimbursement and so, and there were because of that we did a prior period adjustment. So it looks like some got ended in four, but it\u2019s not in Q1. We can now talk after the call and I can walk you through the math.","Tom Lesnick","Sure. Happy to follow up on that. And then quickly, what was the recurring CapEx number for the quarter?","Angela Kleiman","The recurring CapEx is about $18 million for this quarter and you will see that in our Q3 that\u2019s coming on next week.","Tom Lesnick","All right. Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Next question from Greg Van Winkle, Morgan Stanley.","Greg Van Winkle","Hey, guys. Going back to your market forecast from the last page of your supplement. You talked about how job growth versus supply growth still really get all your markets, which is waiting to the strong rent growth forecast between '16. If you had to think about the risk though and where you might be wrong, where you the least certain about your projections, are there any of those markets that forecast where you think the more risk and others, whether it would be the upside or the downside?","Michael Schall","Hi. This is Mike. That\u2019s a good question. We think about risk in really two different ways. One is the risk that in a major economic blip. It seems like all the job growth across the nation goes to zero and so the market with the highest overhang of new construction as a percentage of stock is the greatest hit.","So, Seattle from that perspective at 1.3% has the most overhang with respect to deliveries, potentially in an environment of, again, if demand or job growth goes to zero across the nation. It would have the greatest impact.","In terms of the supply side of the equation, we expect to do enough diligence to have very high degree of confidence that the supply numbers in this document are accurate. The one piece is you can throw up or build single-family homes relatively quickly if you could entitle them, whereas the apartments and condos it takes a very long lead-time and it takes couple years to build those building, so we should be able to get them 100% right.","So we feel very confident as it relates to the supply estimates, which leads us with, of course, the job forecast. And on this, obviously, no one has the right answer. None of us have a crystal ball. We try to take a middle of the road type of approach and maybe with an element of conservatism.","And again, last year if you look at how we approach the same document, we were pretty conservative. This year we\u2019re not estimated that. We\u2019re going to continue with this incredible job growth that we\u2019ve had in 2015. We\u2019ve moderated it somewhat. But the reality is we don't know.","We think this is our expected case scenario, so therefore we expect the West Coast coastal metros to outperform the nation, the nation at 2% by -- what is that around 20%, 25% and I think that\u2019s a rational relationship over a longer period of time.","So we put this as a -- maybe it tends to be a little bit conservative and we hope to outperform it, but we view this essentially a balanced forecast. And I think the risks are really the economy and what happens with the economy.","That\u2019s going to drive whether we hit these job growth forecast and whether the nation hit its job growth forecast and then you would rank this and say, Seattle would be your greatest exposure if you end up with the major economic issue.","Greg Van Winkle","Okay. And absent any nationwide economic slowdown, there are any of the three major geographies for you that are more or less risk in the job growth side, just from kind of market specific issues?","Michael Schall","Well, you say, I mean, Southern California is a more diverse economy, so you would say, the chances are that if you\u2019re going to have widespread dislocation in Southern California, it has to come from a variety of factors. Obviously, we have more tech focus in Northern California and Seattle. So you would say, if something happens to the technology, we have somewhat greater exposure there just as relates to the components that drive the economy.","So I would say, same is true, I mean, all of this divergence within the economy, where certain sectors are doing really well and others are doing poorly, look at what happened with energy, for example. So anything that has a greater concentration of any part of the economy, I guess, potentially is more exposed.","Greg Van Winkle","Yeah. Sure. That makes double sense. And then last one here is, if we think about upside from, I mean, redevelopment and also optimizing lease expiration in the BRE portfolio, how much of the tailwind you think that could be the same-store revenue growth in \u201916?","John Burkart","This is John. The -- on the theory on the renovation side will probably add about 50 basis points to the growth rate towards the second half of \u201916. It still take a little while to ramp up and that\u2019s the impact hit the bottomline.","As it relates to city in the expiration in better order and the amenity in [indiscernible] better order, that\u2019s an ongoing process that that took us several years for our revenue management team that was very hard to make adjustments in the systems for the Essex assets. We see that continued on for the next couple of years.","I can\u2019t quite quantify the impact other than to say that as we mentioned earlier, we had some issues earlier on this year because of the expiration. And it\u2019s not as simple that you just solving it at that point in time. The most people in the marketplace want a 10 to 12 month lease and so by trying to force a new expiration schedule, you don\u2019t get -- surely get the best results so you solve that types of problem. We\u2019ve couple of rental renovation and it will take few years.","Greg Van Winkle","All right. That\u2019s great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll hear from Drew Babin of Robert W. Baird.","Drew Babin","Hi. Great quarter. Looking into next year, I mean the BRE portfolio integration, it terms your expense line items. Any visibility at this point on which line items we may see kind of shift one direction or the other, as different cost savings initiatives take deeper effect. And also kind of what G&A run rate expectation is the same factors?","John Burkart","Yeah. This is John again. I\u2019ll be careful not to get into forward guidance but just to give some flavor. Right now Erik and his team, they\u2019ve worked very hard [indiscernible] over the portfolio and we ultimately have our expenses and BRE expenses on it due to per unit basis pretty close. So from the go forward basis, we don\u2019t expect large changes that relate to one portfolio and the other.","We are working as I\u2019ve mentioned on our Phase III of the merger integration which includes procurement. And we do expect to see some savings there. We don\u2019t have our hands around all of that this point in time. We also have better set of resource management as we mentioned previously and that is really largely focused on the BRE portfolio.","We expected something else that to save as much as a $100 a unit in utilities as we implement that. That\u2019s pretty tedious. It takes several years to implement each of the programs and to do it well. So that will work its way into the BRE portfolio over say a three year period some of which we\u2019ve already completed.","Drew Babin","And any impacts noticeably on the G&A front with the office consolidation?","Angela Kleiman","We are in the process of rolling up our 2015 budget. And so on the office front -- that\u2019s play this way, I think G&A as a whole, probably would expect in modest increase but its not going to be materially different from what we\u2019re seeing right now.","Michael Schall","I think there will be a little bit of geography difference because we\u2019ll take the proceeds from the sale of the office building and reinvest them and that will offset some of the G&A that were coming from the office relocation. So we expected the net core FFO impact to be modest but the geography will be a little different.","Drew Babin","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Wes Golladay of RBC Capital Markets.","Michael Schall","Wes?","Operator","Wes, if you can release your mute function, we are unable to hear you.","Wes Golladay","Hey, sorry about that. Good quarter everyone. Here we go. Real quick on the job forecast, how did you derive that? Was that a third party or you looking at that individual office leasing day that you\u2019re seeing and coming up with your own forecast? How granular does it get?","Michael Schall","This is Mike. Wes, we use a variety of data vendors, economy.com, Rosen, and variety of others. And so we try to build a consensus as to the U.S. job growth. And from there, we look at historical relationships that the U.S. is doing this, what is the likely impact on the West Coast on our metros? And we\u2019ve given consideration to specific sector. So it isn\u2019t granular in the sense of we've got an estimate for what\u2019s happening at HP but it starts with the broader macro expectations for the U.S. and then it looks true to the sectors and tries to predict what is going to happen.","And then of course, we take that information and we create a supply demand model for each of our metros, our 25 submarket and then we rank them from the perspective of what we expect rents to do over the next four years and that\u2019s how we make our capital allocation decision.","Wes Golladay","Okay. And then you mentioned more about rent control this quarter as well. Quick question for you on that. How much of your tenant base is that customer that you don\u2019t want to displace the teacher, the police officer versus the tech port of course, which is growing their income faster than you\u2019re growing the rent?","Michael Schall","This is going to be completely anecdotal, but I think it is significant part of our rental base. So I am guessing in Northern California, Seattle, it\u2019s somewhere in the 40% range, 30% to 40% range. And again, those people -- this is an ongoing process, essentially people come in and make in a lot of money, able to rent that expensive unit and displace into someone that doesn't get a huge increase in compensation and they move to next wrong out let say.","So it\u2019s hard to tell. I mean, we\u2019ve seen this play out many times in the Bay Area. It's not nearly to the extent that I saw in 1999 and 2000, this one on maybe three or four more years, and therefore that transition area effect continues to happen. But it is not limited by any means to California or San Francisco, it goes on a New York City for example.","So this is the ordinary operation of the rental pool and incentiving the people that make the most money and therefore get the choice of where they want to live. So my view it is entirely again normal part of the marketplace, although I do believe that California would benefit itself and the employers and the whole economy would find a way to increase more housing.","Wes Golladay","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Next, we will hear from Nick Yulico of UBS.","Nick Yulico","Thanks. Mike being that it\u2019s in Palo Alto, the hard of venture capital land. I was wondering what you\u2019re sort of hearing from people on that and about, there has been some data showing venture capital funding, number of deals has been coming down, fewers are start ups. How is that -- are you looking it as leading indicator for the economy out there and kind of what is your take on this discussion?","Michael Schall","Yeah, it\u2019s a good question. And we are somewhat concerned about venture capital and we do track it. We\u2019re less concerned about the valuations and whether there's an exit into the public market and liquidity as it relates to those entities. We are more concerned about how many people do they have, how many employees do they have, how many people need housing.","And in that light, I can\u2019t express how different the current environment is from the internet boom in the late '90s. If you take the top 20 unicorns for example, I believe that they employed somewhere around 26,000 people. If you take five public companies Oracle, Apple, Cisco, Google, Facebook they employ 367,000 people.","We are obviously much more concerned about the big tech companies and what they are doing. And it's amazing, we\u2019re looking at what for example Google is doing with the Alphabet company and all the different technology related spin-offs and combined with the fact that they have an enormous amount of capital to deploy into those entities.","It gives us some comfort that the tech hiring is not going to follow fall off quicker. And that is why we feel pretty comfortable with our expectations on F'16 and our market outlook, because it seems like there's a lot of activity out here and there is a lot of money out here that pursuing that activity both we see and some of the major corporate entities.","Nick Yulico","All right. Good points. I guess turning down to Hollywood, the Nickelodeon site you guys have, can you just remind us what sort of ultimate cost on that project and little bit more about where you think maybe land value is to equity, there has been a lot of site change around there recently and on the market right now for sale. And then just lastly, I want to be clear, I don\u2019t -- whether or not that site is actually listed in your land held for development or if it\u2019s still some other piece of real estate because at one point there was lease on it?","John Eudy","This is John Eudy. In general, you are aware of the specific location in Hollywood. It is a ground zero for Hollywood locations. It has been in a number of other transactions in the Hollywood address area that are completely different. As far as it being, let\u2019s take it as future, it still has an investment I believe. Is that correct Angela? The Hollywood asset is an investment because we kind of lease with the Nickelodeon.","Angela Kleiman","Yeah.","John Eudy","In terms of our basis where we believe, well below what we would be able to trade it for today if we choose to go in that direction and we are under the radar in terms of the height of the building that we are going after and less visibility in terms of pushback on the entitlement side. So, long and short is we expect sometime late next year is when we would transfer it over from a leased investment to an active land development transaction.","Nick Yulico","Okay. I guess, I mean that\u2019s helpful. But anything what you can tell us on just sort of the ultimate, how to think about SAR and because there are -- I know, we can look at land comps in the market but some idea but how much you could actually build on that site?","John Eudy","Approximately, 200 units is what we are going forward and it fits within the SAR fairly nicely. Until we get it all done, we don't like to do a lot of projecting assumptions until we are ready to announce so.","Nick Yulico","Okay. Got it. Thanks, guys.","John Eudy","Thank you.","Operator","Our final question today comes from Conor Wagner of Green Street Advisors.","Conor Wagner","How meaningful is factor, the low market tax is due to Proctor\u2019s keen in ranking your potential dispositions for next year?","Michael Schall","Hi, Conor. It\u2019s Mike Schall. It is a factor. Procter team gives us a fair amount of wind to our back relative to what buyers will have to pay if they purchase an asset. And so, I say number one is the factor. Number two, we are looking for a variety of different transactional approaches to avoid a proper team reassessment. So it could involve selling less than half 49% of portfolio of assets for example to an institutional investor. So there are some ways to manage that we believe but the management of Procter team is a factor for sure.","Conor Wagner","And then on the dispositions for next year, is there any thought to condo yet or is it still too early?","Michael Schall","I think it is still a bit too early. Again, we can only pull that trigger one time. And so we targeted a 30% to 40% premium to apartment values in order to make it worthwhile to convert from an apartment to a condo. And we are not seeing that 30% to 40% premium anywhere.","Although in San Francisco and actually a couple of the other Bay Area cities, we are starting to see 10% to 15% premiums of condo values over apartments. So, we are starting to see that divergence, taken longer, not necessarily that those condos have done poorly but because apartments have done so well. So the work we continue to monitor it.","Conor Wagner","Okay. Thank you very much.","Michael Schall","Thanks, Conor.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time.","Michael Schall","Okay. Thank you. Well, in closing, I want to thank you once again for joining the call. We wish you and your family the safe and enjoyable Halloween and look forward to seeing many of you at the NAREIT Conference in a few weeks. Good day.","Operator","That does conclude today\u2019s conference.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Barb Pak, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may now begin.","Barb Pak","Thank you, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference Call. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that certain matters discussed on this conference call contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to several assumptions, risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events. Please refer to the forward-looking statements section of the earnings release issued yesterday.","Today, management will be making some prepared comments related to the proposed merger of Essex and BRE properties. At the advice of counsel, management will not be taking questions related to the proposed merger, given that the merger is subject to approval of both Essex and BRE's stockholders. Comments related to possible financing sources such as property sales and joint ventures are in a preliminary stage, and we cannot assure you that they will be consummated. Essex has filed a joint proxy statement\/prospectus with regards to the proposed merger with the SEC on January 29. We refer investors to the information in the joint proxy statement regarding the merger and related transactions and any other relevant information that we may file with the SEC.","The question-and-answer session at the end of the call will be limited to matters related to the fourth quarter earnings results and the 2014 guidance, assumptions and outlook provided for Essex on a standalone basis.","I'll now turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Mike Schall.","Michael J. Schall","Thank you, Barb. I would like to start by welcoming you to our fourth quarter earnings call. Mike Dance and Erik Alexander will follow me with comments. John Eudy and John Burkart are available for Q&A. I'll cover the following 2 topics on the call: fourth quarter and annual results and our outlook for 2014; and secondly, the update on the merger integration process.","So on to the first topic. Yesterday, we were pleased to report continued strong operating results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 2013. The core FFO per share result for 2013 represents a 11% growth from the prior year and is $0.05 per share above the midpoint of the initial 2013 guidance range. In the 3-year period from 2010 -- from the 2010 recessionary trough, we've grown core FFO per share by 51%. We ended 2013 with 6.3% same-property revenue growth near the high-end of the initial guidance range, led by our Northern California region. Southern California was the only region that performed below the midpoint of our original 2013 revenue guidance range missing by 15 basis points.","With respect to Southern California, our expectation of slow but steady improvement in revenue growth proved accurate in 2013, as each of the 4 quarters generated slightly higher sequential growth, with Q4 achieving a respectable 4.7% revenue growth rate. Looking back over the past several years, however, Southern California has fallen short of our higher expectation for rental revenue.","With respect to job growth, 2013 remains strong. And at 2.1% in our target markets was just above our initial forecast, with each MSA, except Oakland and Los Angeles, beating our estimate.","Turning to 2014. Our overall market outlook is reflected on Page S-16 of the supplement and is based on U.S. job growth of 1.8% and 2.8% U.S. GDP growth. Both of which are near the middle of the range estimated by our economics data vendors. This information is materially consistent with our 3-year outlook at our Investor Day presentation in November. Our 2014 revenue guidance is very similar to our original 2013 estimates. Overall, the midpoint of our revenue guidance range of 5.6% is only 15 basis points below the comparable estimate for 2013. And each of our 3 primary regions are assumed to generate rental growth within 50 basis points of the comparable 2013 estimate.","Overall, 2014 supply is estimated to be -- multi-family supply is estimated to be 1.1% of stock, up from our estimate of 0.8% for 2013. The higher level of supply in 2014 is offset by higher job growth, consistent with an improved U.S. economy, leading us to expect that the overall demand-supply relationship remains favorable to landlords.","Apartment demand continues to be anchored by job growth, demographic factors and limited and expensable [ph] alternative to rental [ph] housing. Medium priced homes are expensive on the West Coast with median prices ranging from $389,000 in King County, Washington to $813,000 in San Francisco County. In addition, for-sale housing values are increasing substantially faster than apartment rents, making apartments a more affordable -- making apartments more affordable relative to homes.","We believe that Southern California will continue to report good job growth and solid results. The dilemma of Southern California jobs versus rent growth is depicted in an AXIOMetrics chart for Los Angeles that we've reproduced with permission as Page S-17 of the supplement. While we believe that Southern California has the potential for higher rental growth, we don't see the catalyst for that to incur in 2014, and thus, it assumes the continuation of solid, but relatively flat revenue growth rates.","We completed approximately $462 million in acquisitions in 2013, down from nearly $800,000 2012. Overall, we expect to acquire approximately $400 million again in 2014, with emphasis on well located B property, and on Southern California, but adds in a way that maximizes accretion. We have 11 development communities that are under construction or in the initial leasing phase. Going forward, we will continue to be selective for new apartment development opportunities. There are many development deals being discussed and most of the merchant builders need equity to satisfy lender requirements.","Other impediments to new apartment construction include concerns about the economy, future rent growth expectations, construction cost increases and the need for concessions from reluctant local governments. With this in mind, we continue to believe that new apartment deliveries will peak in late 2014 to early 2015 in Seattle and in Northern California.","Now to my second topic, the merger integration update. Since signing the agreement to merge Essex and BRE on December 19, 2013, both companies have worked with great focus and effort to make the transition as smooth as possible. Earlier this week, we filed Form S-4 with the SEC, in connection with the proposed merger and necessary shareholder votes from both Essex and BRE shareholders. If the process proceeds without delay, we could close the merger in March. We have enjoyed working with Connie Moore and her team as we seek our common objective of forming a preeminent West Coast apartment REIT.","We appreciate the incredible effort of both the Essex and BRE employees in realizing this vision and offer them our continued thanks. Merger integration planning remains in full swing and significant progress has been made.","The merger agreement provides for a cash component of $12.33 per BRE share or roughly $1 billion. The financing of the cash component is supported by $1 billion financing commitment from UBS and Citigroup, which can be relied upon if our preferred funding sources, which are a combination of institutional joint ventures, property sales and borrowings does not occur.","We currently have nonbinding term sheets related to the formation of institutional joint ventures, involving properties valued at -- between $800 million and $900 million. In addition, we believe that $100 million to $200 million in property sales could occur before or shortly after the merger, and that most of the cash required to close the merger can be generated by these activities.","We realize that the market desires greater visibility into our long-term expectations for the merger and has asked for additional information. As noted on the call following the announcement of the merger, we cannot provide the details of our underwriting and assumption, as advised by our attorneys. We refer everyone to the investor presentation, previously filed with the SEC and posted on our website, and to the Form S-4 recently filed for details of the transaction.","We recognize the importance of articulating our vision with respect to the merger. Recall from the conference call announcing the merger that our baseline financial assumptions were that the merger would be NAV neutral, accretive to core FFO in the range of $0.05 to $0.08 per share in the year following the merger closing, and that the annual synergies will approximately equal the impact of Prop 13.","In the Q&A, we noted that the vast majorities of the assumed synergies are on the expense side of which property and corporate level expense reductions were roughly similar amounts. We continue to believe these assumptions are achievable. A key question is what opportunities are available over and above the baseline scenario outlined above. As previously noted, we are in the midst of evaluating these opportunities and so conclusions have not been reached. However, we'd like to share with you our list of priorities related to synergies and efficiencies to be pursued following merger consummation as follows:","First, we will reconcile pricing philosophies which are materially different despite our geographic and portfolio similarities. Based on that reconciliation, we will adopt one company-wide standard best practice to include the renewal process, targeted turnover rates and costs, traffic and traffic sources, amenity charges and occupancy\/availability ranges.","Second, we will look for opportunities to improve the financial structure of the combined companies from the perspective of risk, reward, cost to capital and core FFO accretion. This could, for example, involve new institutional co-investment relationships for development communities and, possibly, existing properties.","Third, we will implement best practices identified during the merger integration process. Detailed recommendations and opportunities have been compiled as we evaluate each functional area to be the basis for action plans. For example, we expect to implement BRE's RUBS [ph] reimbursement methodology, website and procurement practices at Essex communities. Similarly, we expect to implement Essex's approach to Craigslist promotion, resource management, redevelopment and asset management plans at BRE communities.","Fourth, we will use our larger footprint and community proximity to negotiate lower cost relationships with vendors, create on-site operating savings and revenue management synergies.","And fifth, we will kickoff a major human resource initiative focused on creating career paths that will develop talent from within the company, improve hiring practices, provide greater regional coordination staff and related topics.","We believe that these areas will significantly improve the overall efficiency and results of the combined entity.","That concludes my comments. Thank you for joining in the call today. I'll now turn the call over to Erik.","Erik J. Alexander","Thank you, Mike. The strong fourth quarter in operations helped Essex cap off another good year and set us up for continued growth in 2014. The Bay Area and Seattle continued to record strong economic growth, which resulted in healthy demand throughout the period. Leasing activity met or exceeded expectations in all of our markets, highlighted by strong renewal activity, improving occupancy and better than expected scheduled rent growth. For the quarter, renewal rates grew at 5.5% over expiring rates, while January renewals improved to 6%.","With higher expiring rate comps ahead, February and March renewals are expected to achieve rent growth around 5.5% for the portfolio. Given our low availability and improving demand, we should see strong, sustainable rent growth for new lease activity in all markets.","Turnover remained low and within expectations during the quarter. But we did see a seasonal pickup in move-outs due to home purchases during the quarter as this metric hit 12.2%. However, this is consistent with the last 2 years. Solid fundamentals helped sequential scheduled rent growth improve, and we believe our tempered focus on occupancy during the period allowed us to realize scheduled rent growth double that of December 2012.","We are off to a good start in the new year and scheduled rent in January outpaced December's growth and occupancy stands at 96.6% with a 5.4% net availability for all stabilized assets. Activity at our lease-up projects, Epic in San Jose and Connolly Station in Dublin, reflects strong market conditions. Both projects are leasing ahead of expectations and are expected to be stabilized in September and March, respectively.","Leasing activity at the new developments in the broader market also demonstrates strong demand as the average monthly absorption for all projects north [ph] San Jose was 38 units per month for 2013.","Next quarter, I will comment on Avery, Dylan, Huxley and Mosso, as we begin pre-leasing activities for all 4 projects over the next several weeks.","Now I'll share some highlights from each region beginning with Seattle. While new buildings continue to come to market in the region, we believe that slower absorption and moderating rents are more a function of seasonality than too much supply. Deliveries are largely concentrated downtown and we remain vigilant in our strategy to maximize revenues by meeting market expectations and proactively managing lease explorations. Economic rents on the east side, the north end and the south end of Seattle, where the majority of our portfolio is located, held up better than downtown during the fourth quarter, and we expect these submarkets to outperform the downtown in 2014.","Employment growth in the region improved to a year-over-year rate of 3% in December with unemployment below 5%. The most important employment news of the quarter was the labor resolution between the machinists and Boeing that will then allow the world's largest airplane manufacturers to keep 20,000 direct and indirect jobs in Seattle working on the 777 Dreamliners for the next decade.","Office absorption moderated during the fourth quarter with 313,000 square feet lease, but 2.9% of total stock was leased for the full year. Office vacancy remained low and deal flow continues to be brisk, including Amazon's purchase of yet another significant property in downtown.","Turning to Northern California. With the year-over-year job growth of 3.4% in San Jose, and 2.2% for the broader regions, the Bay Area continues to lead the way for Essex, with the highest growth in rental rates and revenue for the portfolio. Office leasing and development continues to be strong in virtually all parts of the Bay Area with another 1.5 million square feet absorbed during the quarter. Additionally, other significant build-to-suit projects like Apple's 2.8 million square foot headquarters and Netflix expansion began construction during the quarter.","Investment in transportation and infrastructure also continued to grow. The new eastern span of the Bay Bridge and the fourth floor of the Caldecott Tunnel opened in the latter part of 2013. BART's Oakland Airport Connector is set to open later this year and the first phase of the Transbay Terminal (sic) [Transbay Transit Center] remains on schedule to open in 2017.","All of these projects and others will continue to help fuel economic growth in the Bay Area.","Finally, in Southern California. Southern California continues to grow at a more moderate pace compared to Seattle and the Bay Area, but Orange County and Ventura have shown signs of accelerating. All overall job growth in Los Angeles was 1.2% during December. Orange County job growth was 2.4% and Ventura hit 2%. Orange County boasts the lowest unemployment in Southern California at 5.2%, but Los Angeles has dropped below 9% for the first time since November 2008.","Encouraging news is that the 1.4% year-over-year decline in employment in Los Angeles -- unemployment in Los Angeles was due to employment growth and not shrinkage in labor force. The impact of the military in San Diego essentially remains unchanged with our resident exposure hovering around 13%. However, with federal funds flowing again, there has been an increase in shipyard activity and military contract work.","Commercial leasing activity in the region was positive during the fourth quarter with another 850,000 square feet absorbed mostly in Los Angeles. Orange County was flat, however, Hyundai and PEMCO delivered their headquarters facilities during the period.","So overall, economic and rental market conditions remain strong across the portfolio and a solid December and January give us good reason to be confident about 2014. Thank you for your time, and I'll now turn the call over to Mike Dance.","Michael T. Dance","Thanks, Erik. Today, I will provide some color to the assumptions behind our 2014 guidance. Then provide a brief update on the proposed merger with BRE. For more details on our guidance assumptions, please read Page 6 of the press release. And on S-14 of the supplemental package, we have provided a detailed roadmap, how these assumptions are expected to impact our 2014 financial results. The assumptions and projections are for Essex on a stand-alone basis and exclude any impact from the proposed BRE transaction and the merger-related costs associated with the deal.","For 2014, we expect consolidated same-property net operating income to grow by 6.5% at the mid-point, driven by a 5.6% increase in same-property revenues. The 2014 same-property portfolio will increase by over 2,000 apartment homes and will exclude the 6 properties that were acquired in 2013 and those undergoing major redevelopments. We expect our same-property operating expenses to increase 3.5% at the midpoint. The biggest factor driving our expense growth is higher property taxes. Our budget assumes property tax increases by $3.7 million or 7%. This tax increase relates to higher assessed values in Seattle, which are 18% higher than last year's assessed value.","In California, we still had favorable Prop 8 adjustments in 2013, totaling $1.2 million in tax savings. And we expect $600,000 of additional California property taxes in the second half of 2014 as a result of losing these Prop 8 savings on July 1. The controllable expenses for the same-property portfolio are expected to grow by less than 2%.","Now, I'll provide an update on the proposed BRE merger. Assuming the merger closes in March, we expect a benefit from the operating efficiencies of adopting the best practices that Mike outlined in his prepared remarks after a 6-month integration period. The operating platform accretion will begin to add accretion to our 2014 core FFO guidance in Q4, and continuing in to 2015.","In connection with our financing plans for the cash component of the proposed merger, we expanded our unsecured credit facility from $600 million to $1 billion at the end of January, and added an accordion feature pursuant to which we have the flexibility to expand to $1.5 billion. We reduced the pricing on the expanded facility by 12.5 basis points to 95 basis points over LIBOR.","In addition, we renegotiated the pricing on our $350 million term loan reducing the spread over LIBOR by 15 basis points. We believe, this demonstrates some of the initial costs of capital advantages we can achieve with the larger platform.","At the closing of the merger, the net debt-to-EBITDA of the combined company will increase by one turn as the result of creating a joint venture which will form the cash component of the deal. At this time, we do not expect to use the $1 billion bridge loan to close the merger. We expect the debt-to-EBITDA ratio will return to approximately 7x in the first half of 2015 to grow the net operating income and stabilizing the development pipelines of both companies. As a result, after the merger, we will maintain the strength of our balance sheet and will be opportunistic when considering alternative sources of capital, including asset sales, additional joint ventures, unsecured debt and common equity to finance the buildout of the development pipeline.","As disclosed in our press release, our Board of Directors declared a first quarter dividend of $1.21 per share to shareholders of record on March 14. The timing of the first quarter dividend is coordinated with BRE's first quarter dividend pursuant to the merger agreement. The board will review any increase to the annual dividend during its February board meeting, and an increase, if any, approved by the board will be effective for the second quarter dividend payment.","I'll now turn the call over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of David Toti with Cantor Fitzgerald.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","I just have -- [indiscernible], I just have one question with regard to kind of the company's philosophy on dispositions, and the forecast for the year looked relatively light compared to volumes that some of your peers have been disclosing of. And if we think about your capital needs broadly and where we are in the pricing cycle on apartment assets, especially in your market, why not dispose of more? What's the rationale for keeping that relatively limited?","Michael J. Schall","It's Mike Schall. The main rationale is just trying to find the right source for putting capital to work. We tend to be very focused in terms of what we buy or what we build. Therefore, we don't have a large portfolio of assets that we want to dispose of as a general statement. And so we're looking for arbitrage. We're looking for, if we sell these assets, what we do with the money, what's the best source of funding the development pipeline and a variety of things. And we will be become more aggressive at selling assets when that becomes the most favorable source of capital to fund other future activities.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","So effectively, it sounds like the cost of that capital is still too high in your mind?","Michael J. Schall","Exactly.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then I just have one follow-up question for -- maybe, for Erik, and I might have missed this, but what's the occupancy assumption embedded in the revenue forecast for the year?","Erik J. Alexander","This is Erik. It's a range across the portfolio similar to what we experienced in 2013. So I would say, then that goes from the high 95s to the mid 96.5 depending on submarket.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","So am I hearing sort of flattish for the year?","Erik J. Alexander","Yes.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","In aggregate. Okay.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","First question is, as you guys look at the -- as you guys laid out the strategy for this year in integrating BRE, it seems like the core business is sort of business as usual. There is a lot of activity, a lot of investment activity and such. Do you feel like what we're going to see on the core is what we would normally see from core Essex or have you guys sort of -- is your intention to dial it back to make sure that more of the resources are focused on the integration. Just -- and the angle that we are coming at is over the past year or 2, we've seen 1 or 2 situations of company mergers where a part of the operation was dropped as a company acquired or integrated various platforms. So just want to get your take on that.","Michael J. Schall","It's Mike Schall. Certainly, we expect to continue with business as usual throughout our portfolio. So we don't expect a drop off. Obviously, we haven't been through this process before. And so there's a certain amount of uncertainty there. But all of us are confident that we will be able to work together to basically continue the business as it's run now. I think, one key factor here is that we are so similar as to geography, as to staffing ratios, as to a lot of the systems and processes that I think it's going to perhaps make this a little bit easier to integrate relative to some of other transactions you are referring to.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. And the second question is on Southern California, assuming the other apartment folks that we've heard from were more bullish on Southern California than previously throughout last year. You guys obviously spoke about Orange County and Ventura picking up. Has something occurred more recently in the past few months that people are a little more positive on Southern California? Or it's pretty much consistent with what you guys expected, but the fact that it's now sort of seeming to pickup is just a positive refreshment that everyone is focused on?","Erik J. Alexander","This is Erik. I think there has been some pickup in Southern California in areas, and I didn't comment on San Diego. But we've seen some improvements there as well and spots in Los Angeles. I think it's -- we've always done is tied this to what our economic forecast is or the jobs picture and so, until we see that sustain in the meaningful way. I think it's hard to be too bullish, so we have seen that before where we've have had spurts of -- we think that it has taken off and then it sort of flattens out. So we will see, but right now, we're feeling pretty good.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","So what you've described is sort of broad-based throughout the region. It's not just one industry or one geography. I mean, it seems pretty positive that it should continue, right? Or is your fear that there is something that could derail it?","Erik J. Alexander","That's right. I think it's our view -- across Southern California is positive.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Rich Anderson from BMO Capital Markets.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","So I don't know to what degree you can respond, but I'll just ask and you can say shut up if you want, but when you kind of started this process and when it became known to everybody in November, December timeframe, a lot of moving -- a lot of things were going on at that time -- didn't envy you with all the moving parts inside and outside of the transaction. But when you look at it now, having a couple of months under your belt, can you say if the merger analysis looks even better to you now or maybe about the same or you're feeling more -- even more confident about the opportunity here?","Michael T. Dance","It's Mike. I think I need to steer clear of that question. I was expecting that someone would ask hypothetical, just general merger related questions, how do we look at things, et cetera, et cetera, which we maybe can venture down that road, but I think anything is related to this merger, we've been told by our attorneys that we are not allowed to discuss [indiscernible].","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I apologize, I won't take it any further then. I guess, maybe, if you could, when you look at the kind of the 3 markets, is there anything specific about Essex or BRE that is a standout in Northern California, Southern California or Seattle, or is it like you said so similar that it's just kind of doubling down on those 3 areas?","Michael J. Schall","Once again it's Mike Schall commenting. I think it's very similar. We made that comment before, that more than half of BRE's communities are located within 2 miles of an Essex community. And so we think that there are a number of positive things that can happen as a result of that, which I outlined on my comments.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay, and then when you think about that issue about being so close to one another, the assets, how do you manage situations where one asset wants to do well from a bonus comp perspective and I assume that it's better to have this kind of synergy situation, but there could also be some in-fighting amongst folks, do you -- how do you manage that process, so that it actually is a win-win for everybody? In other words, if one asset is doing well and the other...","Michael J. Schall","It's tough for me to talk about any Essex\/BRE type of activity because again our advice is that if it is in the S-4, it's important to put it in the S-4 and everything in the S-4, basically represents the bounds of which we can talk about. So if you want to talk more generically, just talk more generically about the competition in the marketplace between us and someone else [indiscernible].","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay, then let's take it there. I don't mean to push too hard on this. I just wanted to see if there could be anything about a general view about how the 2 companies would look once it's all said and done, but...","Michael J. Schall","Okay, let me take a step back because I think, the point -- one of the points in my prepared remarks was intended to address this, that every competitor within the marketplace has a different view of the world. The price optimizer software is a generic statement, approaches it in a number of ways, but there's 100 switches or 1000 switches within that, that allow you to customize how you look at things. Different companies pursue marketing in a variety of different ways and a lot of that is becoming much more sophisticated over time. I think back of 20 years ago when it was a mom-and-a-pop that we're operating a lot of these buildings and it is really very sophisticated set of circumstances now. So everyone is different. And really what our objective is, and I think that the -- yes, this is both generic and very real within the marketplace, is to try to find the right balance of different marketing programs. I know that we excel, for example, at Craigslist. Others excel at other things. Mobile is becoming more important as time goes on and the technology surrounding the web and drawing traffic through the web is changing dramatically. And so our view is that you need to have some scale here to make the investments that you need to make, in order to maximize that marketing effort and the traffic to your buildings. So going back to the original premise, if you are larger organization and you can make the right investments, I think you can draw traffic that some of the smaller organizations that can't afford to make the investments might have. And I think that the other piece of this is, what impact does that have on future investments? Well, our hope here is that the -- on the merger-related call I talked about a 30 basis point sort of average accretion number over our cost of funds. Well, the hope is that if we can drive down our cost that -- between the cost reduction and cost to capital reductions that we can be more competitive with respect to transactions and actually generate more accretion from the investments that we make going forward. So that's the big picture philosophy.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","That's perfect. And then just quickly on the joint venture, would you say, I think you probably said this some place, but would you say that the nature of the assets might be on the older, kind of, redevelopment variety or core or some combination?","Michael J. Schall","I can't -- let's see, how do I answer this? You may want to look at some of the 8-K filings that the BRE has made and that will give you some idea.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Omotayo Okusanya with Jefferies.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I just wanted to narrow in on Seattle for a little bit, again, I think your assets -- BRE's assets are in slightly different markets in Seattle, I'm just kind of giving you comments about supply in Downtown, I was just kind of curious how your kind of thinking about both portfolios and synergies between both going forward, especially in that market?","Michael J. Schall","It's Mike Schall. Actually, we think that we are very similarly located in Seattle as well. I would agree with you that the downtown has most of the development, and therefore, it has most of the supply coming onto the market, and it will be most affected by that new supply. So in another words, our belief is that the east side and the area surrounding Seattle, the suburban markets will outperform for the next couple of years the downtown. Overall, I think that everything I said earlier about the physical locations, they are very similar. We have significant exposure in the downtown urban market. We also have a significant exposure in the suburban markets. We don't view it as much different.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I was under the impression that BRE had a little bit more downtown exposure, but I might be wrong.","Michael J. Schall","Maybe a little bit more, but again, looking at the broader portfolios, we think they are pretty similar.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from the line of Michael Salinsky with RBC Capital Markets.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just in the guidance for '14, can you talk about what's your development assumption and CapEx, assumption with regard to '14? And also does that change materially with BRE introduced? I'm not asking for specific guidance, but is there -- does that BRE make a significant impact on that, adding that into the portfolio?","Michael T. Dance","Very slightly, but not much. This is Mike Dance. Good question on the CapEx. They are spending very similar amounts for door. So I don't -- of the recurring CapEx, I don't see that changing. And then on a combined basis, the timing of it is a little bit different. Some of their properties are in front of ours and some are behind. So we're not seeing a major change in our results as -- from bringing that on. They do, do some things like straight-lining concessions. We'll probably adopt that accounting policy, that's GAAP. There'll be things like that, that -- we look at accounting practices about companies and pick the practices that are mostly corporate or aligned to GAAP as a part of this process.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, just a clarification there. So you are talking about changing accounting policies to move to a straight-lining as opposed to expensing of concessions upfront, do that -- did I hear that correctly?","Michael T. Dance","Yes, that's correct. So we'll start adopting, that's GAAP, we have that on our list of things that we monitor from a GAAP versus a non-GAAP compliance standpoint. So that is something that we're likely to adopt. As part of the processes that Mike reviewed, we're also going to be reviewing your best practices in accounting policies.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. That was -- I also asked about development strategy, I don't think you addressed that for '14, what's on the docket?","John D. Eudy","I didn't understand the question. This is John Eudy, Mike.","Unknown Executive","Development starts for '14.","John D. Eudy","For 2014? Right now, what you see in the S-9 [ph] is, is it. We don't have anything anticipated beyond it. And their portfolio as well. It's possible a couple of their deals -- that I don't want to get into -- we could start, but we can't comment at this time.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Fair enough. Just Mike, as my follow-up question is right on the [indiscernible] looking at raising JV capital, any change in IRR targets from your joint venture partners at this point?","Michael J. Schall","Mike, this is Mike Schall again. No, I don't think so. In fact, I think, cap rates for the most part have remained within a pretty narrow band over the last year. And I'd say that maybe there is -- there are fewer institutions than maybe there were a year ago that are interested in JV activity, but I don't think the thresholds have changed materially.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Brian (sic) [Ryan] Bennett with Zelman & Associates.","Ryan H. Bennett - Zelman & Associates, LLC","I just wanted to drill down just on the acquisitions of $300 million to $400 million that you mentioned in the release. In turn, I think last call you had talked about some opportunities with developers in your regions for potential acquisitions, I was wondering how that was tracking, whether there are more deals kind of like Slater 116 in pipeline?","Michael J. Schall","Brian, this is Mike Schall. There are deals that are similar to that. I'm not sure that those will be the ones that we are able to do this year. I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we will have a Southern California bias this year, and we will try to pick the best funding mechanism for the deal, but I'd say, if anything, it's a Southern California focus and we do run across transactions that were recently developed by someone and they need to be -- they need liquidity and it becomes a great opportunity for us. And in fact, in San Diego, we announced the acquisition of Domain, which is exactly that -- a brand new property, condo-mapped, solid market and a price that we thought was attractive to us. So we continue to see that. I'm not sure how much of that will be -- will represent our $400 million plus or minus in acquisitions this year. I hope it's a lot.","Ryan H. Bennett - Zelman & Associates, LLC","All right and then in terms of the disposition assets that you might be targeting. Just how does it look in terms of your expectations for NOI growth for those assets and the potential pricing that you get in [ph] transaction markets today versus where your stock is trading at, given, I guess, that you sold some stock around $162 last quarter?","Michael T. Dance","I missed that. I'm sorry, could you repeat one more time, Ryan, sorry about that.","Ryan H. Bennett - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Sure. So I was just wondering how you weighted the acquisition opportunities versus the cost of capital, specifically the assets that you have, potentially lined up for dispositions, how do they look on an NOI growth basis and potential cap rate you could get for those assets versus where your stock is trading at today?","Michael T. Dance","Yes, in terms of where the stock is trading at today, we believe that the co-investment joint venture capital is more attractive. And so we would gravitate there as opposed to issuing more stock and you're right, the stock issuances were at a higher price, which -- that's what we're trying to do. We believe that tracking the different sources of capital, which would include dispositions, JV capital or on balance sheet capital, is sort of fundamental to making money in the business, and those relationships are constantly changing. And so our model for how to acquire is constantly changing depending upon those variables.","Ryan H. Bennett - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Got it. And then last question. I'm not sure, if you'll be able to address this, but in the S-4 filing, I guess, they put out estimates that you guys had had for BRE -- now on 2015 basis, so they look fairly bullish, and I guess, basically, I'm more curious what that kind of a incorporates for your overall view for Southern California in 2015 and what sort of acceleration you guys are thinking about right now. It's, obviously, early, but it looks like you do have some sort of view on the acceleration in those markets?","Michael J. Schall","Again, this is Mike Schall commenting. Our belief is, if you look at the relative relationships from this point going forward, that Southern California is still attractive. If you look at the cost per unit, their relationship between rents in those marketplaces versus the pretty incredible rents that we've seen in the north, we think that there will be an opportunity over the next couple of years to -- for Southern California to do better. We think that Northern California and Seattle, depending upon what happens with the tech world, there will be some deceleration and -- but we also recognize that if tech continues to be as robust as it has been, it still -- we still don't want to discount the possibility that the boom in Northern California and Seattle will continue for several more years. So we're trying to play the best of both worlds. Our overall belief is from a -- just a pure value basis, Southern California represents a better value. And therefore, we will likely focus more of our acquisition time and effort and, ultimately, development on Southern California, all things being equal.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from the line of Paula Poskon with Robert W. Baird.","Paula J. Poskon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Just one question on a totally separate topic. The national press, obviously, has been covering the severe weather in various parts of the country, including the severe drought that you all are experiencing out there. Is that causing you to manage the properties differently or even, perhaps, dictating or adjusting how you think about where to invest in certain submarkets or greater markets?","Erik J. Alexander","This is Erik. I don't know that it changes the way that we manage, other than using the tools that we have developed through resource management, which focuses on consumption. So where we have opportunities to reduce irrigation, for example, we're going to continue to do that. Something like a drought, if there were things put in place that made it more difficult to use or access water, or it costs more, maybe we would do some improvements, capital improvements, consistent with what we've done before. As to investment, I don't think it plays a role in what we are looking at.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of David Harris with Imperial Capital.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Here's an old favorite: any view or any update on where we stand with the rent control across California?","Michael J. Schall","It's Mike Schall commenting on this. Really, it's been quiet on the rent control front. And we've done, as I've reported in the past, some things to work with some of the local government entities, the California Apartment Association and a variety of other groups, to try to mediate issues that may come up from time to time. So all is quiet on the rent control front at this point.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Yes, just a point of detail on that. Is that been more of an issue historically in Northern California than Southern California?","Michael J. Schall","No, I would say that it's an issue everywhere in California. Wherever rents are high and housing values are high, and therefore, choice of housing with respect to housing is limited, I think that the political environment is to be -- something that we should be concerned about.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","And then this is a question related to opportunity cost and your time around the BRE transaction. My question is this, is it -- how many times, if at all, have you said, \"Come back and see me in 2 or 3 months' time\" to your development or redevelopment colleagues?","Michael J. Schall","You mean the one sitting right across to me, Mr. Eudy, for example?","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Yes. I mean, can you -- I mean, I guess, another way of asking the question is, is how much can you continue to run business as usual whilst you're putting all the time and effort you are into moving forward with the BRE merger?","Michael J. Schall","Actually, I will answer that. This is Mike Schall again. We've actually been able to continue, I think, business as usual on the investment side reasonably well through this period of time. I know that we, even though we are -- our 2014 starts will be limited, we have been active in terms of looking at future development sites. And in fact, during the last couple of months, we have committed to pretty significant development on the Peninsula. So we have not abandoned our existing external activities at all from my perspective. Practically speaking, we're all working a lot harder and a lot more hours, I'll give you that. But I think that we're -- yes, we're pretty excited about the opportunities both because this gives us a variety of other portfolio management opportunities, but at the same time, I think with can still remain active in the marketplaces looking at new opportunities. So I don't think it's been a big cost at this point.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Morgan Stanley.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So, Erik, I guess for you. Can you talk a bit more about your outlook for San Diego? The market where we've seen, I guess, few head picks there in recent years, and any compare\/contrast comments that you can drive for San Diego versus, say, Orange County, and maybe LA too?","Erik J. Alexander","I wouldn't be at all shocked if there are head picks again in San Diego. I think I've ranked the -- those areas in Southern California before about expectations for growth and San Diego was either third or fourth in the comparison. I still like Orange County and Los Angeles the best. Ventura seems to be more stable and growing as of late. We've had good results in the last couple of months in San Diego. But we're going to need continued job growth there that is helpful to maintaining occupancies and lowering availability and driving price. So again, we like San Diego. We've seen some good months. But I'm going to wait to see some more months before I get too excited.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Fair enough. One more. As -- A-property assets tend to underperform; Bs later in the cycle -- something we've seen supported in recent AXIO data. So if you look at your portfolio in the revenue growth outlook for 2014, how are you thinking about the relative performance of your As versus Bs, and where do you think that gap can be most meaningful or most wide? How does that potentially play into your thoughts on [indiscernible] activity?","Michael J. Schall","It's Mike Schall. Our belief has not changed from many years. And our belief is that when the economy goes south, people make a more conservative choice which -- and as things pick up, they decide to be less conservative and they rent more A-quality-type units. So we think that, that has mostly played itself out, and we think that the Bs represent the value proposition within the apartment space, and ultimately will -- they have a strong position in all markets. So we still believe that well-located B property is -- will represent most of what the company will focus on, and it will from time to time focus on As, principally through development, and we think that, that's an attractive mix.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. And one last one on that, if I may. Have you talked about... Maybe I missed it. I joined a bit late. But spot cap rates in your core markets for As and Bs today or during -- in recent weeks?","Michael J. Schall","It's Mike again, Haendel. We have not -- we did not discuss that. I don't think cap rates have changed materially over the last year. I think that A quality product in very solid markets is still in the 4 to 4.25 cap rate range. And B, well-located B quality property are in the 4.75-plus or minus cap rate range, and then lesser quality, lesser locations are above that.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Dave Bragg with Green Street Advisors.","David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","To what extent does this merger process cause you to reevaluate your existing portfolio? I was unclear on the points made earlier on JV conversations if you're considering including your existing assets in those conversations as well?","Michael J. Schall","It's Mike Schall. At the Investor Day discussion, we talked about looking at the portfolio really in 3 components. The -- sort of the irreplaceable component, others call that gold. We have variety of different ways to refer to this. Then we have the middle category, which is we call it tradable at a price. And we have then the final piece, which is, we need to sell these assets eventually. It doesn't mean we are necessarily going to sell them any time in the near future. And we continue to look at the company the same way, whether or not we're a bigger portfolio. And so we're going to look at those components. Roughly, say, 40% to 45% we think is irreplaceable and around 40% is tradable. So we will look at the portfolio irrespective of whether it was an Essex asset or a BRE asset or any other asset with the one difference that Prop 13 is a material consideration in all transactions that we look at. So I don't think it changes how we'd look at world at all. We've talked about -- and again, at the Investor Day, we talked about the possibility of additional joint ventures as it relates to the well-located properties that are maybe a little bit higher cap rate assets. And we'll continue to look at that. But I wouldn't expect any dramatic change. We're not going to go out and joint venture a huge part of the company by any means. And we're just trying to look at what the right portfolio of management is. It will be applied to both companies.","David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And the second question is: Although we have seen some M&A over the last year, I believe that portfolios have been on the same revenue management platforms. Can you talk in general terms, if you'd like, about transitioning a large portfolio on the LRO to YieldStar?","Michael J. Schall","I don't think that the technology provider is really the key to that. I think the key is, what I refer to in the first of the 5 points that become priorities going forward, is reconciling the entire process from what is the desired availability level at different points throughout the year; what are -- what's the relation between traffic and the number of units that you have net to lease; and therefore, what is the right renewal process. So it's really a holistic approach to all the components. And I think that the technology is more the delivery mechanism than it is the strategy. Again, there's 1,000 switches within both and you can customize whatever you want out of them. So I don't think -- I think the technology organizes the data and allows a good conversation between the price-optimizing people and the people that are active in the local marketplace and the people that are meeting with the customer. But it don't think it's in and of itself that's where the key is.","Operator","We will take one additional question from the line of Nick Joseph with Citigroup.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","At your Investor Day in November, you guided to annual same-store revenue growth of 4% to 6% for the next 3 years. How should we think about that relative to 2014 guidance of 5% to 6.2% with the top-end range above that initial range?","Michael J. Schall","It's Mike Schall. I think we'll both agree that we have greater confidence in the year that's right before us than we do in the out year. So if you get further away from those numbers, that -- some changes could happen, and we're not sure what to expect. We presented a scenario at the Investor Day that if we end up getting decent but not great GDP growth and decent but not great job growth, that we could sustain somewhere in that 4% to 6% range throughout that period of time. Part of that belief is based on the relatively good recent outcome and information with respect to income growth and rent to median income, which we view as a core metric. So I think that if we get the same growth that we had in 2013, that we believe continues into 2014, if we continue to see those same relationships, I don't see anything on the supply side that's going to interrupt that. I would expect a similar year in 2015, if that all happens. But remember, I mean, we have less confidence as we get further out from 2014.","Operator","We have reached the end of our question and answer session. I would now like to move floor back over to management for any concluding comments.","Michael J. Schall","Thank you, operator. In closing, we'd like to thank you for joining the call and appreciate your interest in the company. We expect to have a busy and yet rewarding 2014. And we look forward to the closing of the merger in our call with you next quarter. Thanks again. Good day.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's teleconference.

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.

Further information about these risks can be found in the Company\u2019s filings with the SEC.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you, Mr. Schall. You may begin.","Michael J. Schall","Thank you. I\u2019d like to start by welcoming you to our fourth-quarter earnings conference call. Mike Dance and Erik Alexander will follow me with comments; John Eudy and John Burkart are available for Q&A. I'll cover the following two topics on the call, fourth quarter results and the outlook for 2013 and cap rates and the investment market.","So on to the first topic. Yesterday, we reported core FFO per share of $1.81, an increase of 20% over the prior year and near the high end of the guidance range that we presented last quarter. For the year, we exceeded the high end of our initial 2012 guidance range for core FFO by $0.02 per share. We\u2019re very pleased with these results which require the relentless and disciplined execution from the entire Essex team. I both congratulate and thank the E-team for this accomplishment. ","Our economic research discipline is designed to creating investment thesis that we utilize to guide our acquisition, development and disposition activities. We backed half our conclusions when we later received the actual data to evaluate the process and look for insights that can improve future investments. We believe the success in the real estate business requires timing and execution, which are aided by the research effort. ","A significant accomplishment over the past couple of years was predicting the surge in tech employment, which precipitated a greater portfolio rating in Northern California and Seattle. We've been rewarded for that insight. ","However, there was room for improvement with respect to our forecast for Southern California, which lagged behind our recovery forecast largely because of the implicit assumption that the recovery from the great recession would be similar to prior recoveries, that is the trajectory of the recovery period would resemble the rate of decline. That clearly didn't happen. The recovery was slow and lumpy with muted growth from a few sectors including tech. As a result, Southern California, which is a more diversified economy without an abundance of tech, has underperformed to our expectation.","However, as I will discuss in a moment, that appears to be changing. What does this mean for 2013 and beyond? Our overall market outlook is on the page S16 of the supplement and is based on U.S. job growth of 1.6% and 2.3% U.S. GDP growth, both of which are at the high end of the range provided by our data vendors. This information updates the same document that was part of our Q3 2012 supplement, although it generally assumes greater job growth consistent with that reported over the last six months and more apartment deliveries. ","We continue to see tech, life sciences, energy as leading sectors in 2013. Throughout 2012, we saw the breadth of the jobs recovery increasing as more economic sectors contributed to job growth. Private-sector job growth is now broad-based with jobs being added in trade, business services, leisure and hospitality. The consumer, especially those at higher income levels are rebuilding their balance sheets, are gaining confidence. We are in a world with a growing disparity between workers with skills at education and those without, and that will affect the types of jobs being created and the potential income. That\u2019s the good news. Lagging sectors in the recovery have been manufacturing and government, both of which will continue to have less employment in 2013 as compared to the pre-recession period.","Many economists believe in the resurgence of manufacturing in the U.S. following huge losses suffered during the great recession. While that may occur, we believe that the impact for manufacturing will be muted in the Coastal California and Washington markets with perhaps a few exceptions like Boeing near Seattle. There are other factors that have a bearing on our market forecast such as benefit from demographic factors including an aging population that requires housing without necessarily having a job, the estimated 23 million young adults living with parents they would like to become renters, and the trend of postponing marriage in children.","Finally, we are not seeing the strong resurgence for for-sale construction in the Essex investment market although the medium priced home has increased 21% in San Francisco, 25% in San Jose, 13% in Seattle, and 15% in Los Angeles. Large increases in housing prices will lead to more for-sale housing down the road, but it also makes the transition from a renter to a homeowner more difficult. Apartments and home building can coexist without major problems absent artificial demand created by lax mortgage lending standards and other anomalies. We conclude that new apartment deliveries will be absorbed with moderating but still strong rental growth. Once again, we expect the best job growth to be at North California and Seattle. New jobs and supply deliveries may not align perfectly throughout the year leading to some volatility in rents in areas with the greatest apartment supply principally downtown Seattle and North San Jose.","Our outlook for Southern California continues to improve. This expectation is supported by the continued acceleration in job growth. In the second half of 2012, the Los Angeles MSA produced twice the number of jobs as compared to the first half of the year, the best since 2009 and outpaced the U.S. with 1.8% job growth. Again, the growth was broad-based led by business services, leisure hospitality, education and health services.","Los Angeles also has the least amount of new supply of housing compared to all of the ethics MSAs projected to be only 0.2% of stock in 2013. San Diego also reported a significant improvement in job growth. The remaining Southern California MSAs have less job growth and more supply and that's lower expectations for rent growth. Erik will comment further on each of these submarkets.","While we remain confident in our outlook, it should be noted that economic and political uncertainty has greatly widened the range of outcomes that are possible for all businesses and the U.S. economy. A shock from the Middle East or a new chapter in the euro debt crisis could derail the scenario that we just outlined.","Now on to my second topic, which is cap rates and investment markets. Cap rates ranged from 4% to 4.25% for A quality property in A quality locations and in the mid 4% to low 5% range for B quality property in A quality locations. Cap rates increased from there for lesser locations and property quality. To add value, we have become more targeted with our acquisitions looking for submarkets with rental growth rates that exceed the average growth rate of our portfolio. Our preference is finding value add opportunities. As always, market selection and timing is critical to accretive investment.","We completed approximately 800 million in acquisitions in 2012 and expect solid transaction volumes in 2013. With cap rates increasing, we hope to find sellers desiring OP trade transaction. As we enter 2013, we expect around 400 million in acquisitions with greater emphasis on well located B property and on Southern California. ","Our development pipeline is now mostly under construction. We will likely start two additional development projects in 2013 aggregating from 200 to 300 apartment units. We have become more selective for new apartment development opportunities and are looking for locations that we expect to improve with rent that have strong growth potential. There are many deals being discussed although many of the merchant builders need equity to satisfy vendor requirements. ","Other impediments to new apartment construction include concerns about the economy, future rent growth expectations, construction cost increases, and concessions from reluctant local governments that are needed for projects to achieve financial hurdles. With this in my mind, we believe that new apartment deliveries will peak in 2014 and return to muted levels thereafter. Development cap rates based on current market rents continue to be in the 5% to 5.5% range or around 6.25% upon stabilization. ","Before turning the call over to Eric, I want to note that the press release summarizes the sale of $74.4 million in marketable securities represented the strategic investment that I referred to on the Q3 2012 earnings call. The decision to sell followed communications with the company that enabled us to conclude that we could not expect to achieve our strategic objectives.","Thank you for joining the call today. I will now turn the call over to Erik.","Erik Alexander","Thank you, Mike. Operations performance during the quarter was solid as expected. We enjoyed strong demand in all of our markets, continued to grow scheduled rent on robust renewal activity and we finished the period in a favorable occupancy position and are poised for another year of strong performance. ","New lease of renewal activity remained strong during the seasonally slow fourth quarter. 2013 is off to a good start with rents in occupancy improving each week throughout the month of January. Combined rents in January generated 7.8% growth over January 2011. Renewal rates in January were 5% above expiring rates while expectations for February, March and April, are anticipated nearby 5% as well. ","We also expect pricing on new leases to continue to rise on strong demand and limited availability. As of yesterday, the portfolio was 96.9% occupied. So while we expect the overall rent growth to moderate this year, we see acceleration in Southern California and expect strong job growth in all of our markets to drive revenue gains for Essex throughout 2013.","Turnover was within expectations and we ended the year with a portfolio wide ratio of 52%. The reasons given for move out by residents were consistent with last quarter\u2019s results, with affordability accounting for 13% of our move outs and home purchases representing 12% of move outs. Home purchases were slightly up for the quarter, but flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. We expect these rates of move out to increase modestly in 2013, but manageable and well within historical levels. ","With several submarkets introducing new products, we do expect to see turnover rates increase to the mid 50% range for 2013. Some of this turnover will be related to expanding our interior renovation program in an effort to meet market demand for fresh product and new features.","Expo remain our only active lease up during the quarter. Our early delivery continue to pay dividend as leasing remained strong throughout the period. Leasing activity remain ahead of plan and Expo now stands at 55% occupied and 64% lease. We are also pleased to see that many new competitors in this lively submarket are leasing apartments at a brisk pace as well. As called out in our economic forecast, we anticipate strong job growth to continue in Seattle and be more than sufficient to absorb the increase in new supply this year. We look to stabilize our occupancy at Expo at 95% during the second quarter.","Now I'll share some highlights for each region beginning with Seattle. We are calling for an overall market rent growth of 6.5% in 2013. However, our expectations are segmented. We expect growth of 2% to 4% in downtown Seattle and 7% to 9% in Bellevue in the Eastside. This is important distinction given that 70% of the new supply will be delivered in the city of Seattle, while 80% of our portfolio lies outside the Seattle CBD including more than 50% on the Eastside. ","The jobs picture in the region continues to be strong and shows no signs to learning up. We increased our outlook for 2013 from 2.3% to 2.8% job growth. Amazon continues to hire new employees at a furious pace, Boeing is ramping up production in an effort to reduce their backlog and Microsoft currently has 3,400 job openings for computer scientists and engineers. ","Office construction in the region continues to be about 1% of total inventory, but the pipeline is very large in major projects that we previously commented on including Amazon\u2019s expansion downtown remain on track.","Turning to Northern California, we believe that this region will again lead the way in rent growth for Essex in 2013. The primarily reason is the job growth expectations continue to be strong in the Silicon Valley with 2.7% projected at 2013 and a healthy 2.4% for the broader Bay Area. Office absorption in Silicon Valley also remained strong as 800,000 square feet was absorbed during the quarter with another 850,000 square feet leased in San Francisco, Oakland and on the peninsula. So all total more than 6 million square feet of office space was absorbed during 2012 or nearly 3% of inventory. Vacancy for the region is below 15% and nearly 4 million square feet of office is under construction or renovation. ","Partly due to timing, our multifamily supply projection for San Jose has increased slightly for 2013, but the total new housing supply for this submarket and the region remain below 1% of total stock. As we continue to make timely progress on the development of Epic in North San Jose, competing new projects are reporting strong absorption, stable pricing, and normal concession activity for lease-ups. We continue to believe that a impressive job growth in the region will support the delivery of all of these projects and thereby there is a sell as the property continues to perform well.","In Southern California, we expect Los Angeles to lead the results for the region. Already in January, we are occupied above 96.5% in new lease rates or 6.5% higher than last January. The jobs picture in Southern California continues to improve in all submarkets as new employment accelerated during the second half of the year; hospitality, professional, business and health services led the way. So there were also gains in entertainment during the past year with total jobs for this sector nearly returning to 2008 levels. ","Additionally, unemployment in Orange County fell below 7% for the first time in five years, while personal income growth in Los Angeles and San Diego reached nearly 4% during 2012. Job growth expectations for the region are ahead of the national average with Los Angeles and Orange County approaching 2% rate of growth for 2013.","Office space absorption for Southern California remains modestly positive with nearly 400,000 square feet leased during the fourth quarter. The West Side and Tri City areas continue to see the most activity. Office vacancy is hovering around 17% for the entire region and there is nearly 2 million square feet of space under construction or under renovation, mostly split between Orange County and San Diego. ","The region continues to plan for further growth as both the Los Angels International Airport and the Port of Los Angeles have advanced their expansion plans. Both transportation hubs saw increased traffic during 2012 and are expecting further growth in volume in 2013. Downtown Los Angeles and the West Side remain the best locations for us in Southern California; but Orange County continues to show improving rent levels.","So consistent with our view last quarter, we remain confident about growth and performance for 2013. Seattle and the Bay Area will still lead the way for Essex, but Southern California will be a more significant contributor to our overall results this year.","Thank you for your time. And I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Mr. Dance.","Michael T. Dance","Thanks, Erik. Today, I will highlight some of the key assumptions for our 2013 forecast. Our detailed assumptions are on page five of the press release and S14 of the supplement. For 2013, we expect consolidated same-property NOI to grow by 7% at the mid-point. For 2013, same-property portfolio will include the five properties we acquired in 2010 which require substantial lease up activity, as great properties acquired in 2011 and the Via development in Sunnyvale. ","Our acquisition strategy focuses on allocating capital to the markets we believe will have the highest rental growth. The acquisition property is being added to the 13 of same-property portfolio are forecasted to grow net operating income by 8% compared to the average of 7% for the entire same-property portfolio. Operating expenses during the fourth quarter and for the year ended were at the low end of our guidance. Over the last four years, the same-property operating expenses have not grown by more than 2%.","Clearly our portfolio benefits from the 2% limits on property tax increases in California. However, for the 2013 midpoint, the same-property operating expenses. We are estimating property taxes will increase by $2.2 million or a 5% increase. This estimate is based on new assessed values in Seattle and in California we\u2019ve assumed the temporary Proposition 8 benefits will lapse and property taxes will revert back to their Proposition 13 valuation. ","Our 2013 guidance assumes we\u2019ll complete the dispositions of our Fund II portfolio by the end of the third quarter. For the first three quarters of the year, we\u2019re estimating $500,000 per quarter in Fund II management fee. In the fourth quarter of 2013, we expect a reduction in core FFO of $2.1 million from the loss in management fees plus our share of Fund IIs FFO after the liquidation.","We expect we will receive between $3 million and $6 million of promote income in the fourth quarter. During 2013, we plan to begin leasing at Epic and the Dublin, California development and complete the lease up of Expo.","The net increase in dilution from the developments in 2013 compared to 2012 will be $1.8 million related to these projects. This dilution is the result of expensing all operating expenses once we begin operation and the cessation of capitalizing interest as apartments become available for rent, and down to the extent our lease-up incentives include free rent, it is our accounting policy to start recognizing rental income after the free rent period is complete.","Expo is expected to contribute to FFO in the second half of 2013 when it yields approximately 7% in Q4. We are forecasting a 5% increase in general and administrative expenses including acquisition costs due to general wage increases and additional hiring as a result of the growth of the company over the past few years.","That ends my comments. Operator, we are now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from David Toti with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please proceed with your question.","David Toti \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald & Co.","Good morning guys. I have a couple of just \u2013 couple of small detailed questions. Looking at the metrics for Santa Barbara in the quarter, it appears you had pretty good occupancy gain and rent growth was pretty flat. Was that a deliberate effort to build up occupancy and if so, why so aggressive in that particular market?","Erik J. Alexander","This is Erik. Yes, it was. Basically that building is a student dominated building and so the leases that you see in the fourth quarter are essentially the leftover from the pre-leasing done during the summer. So the sooner we get those, the better we are for the rest of the year.","David Toti \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald","Okay. So that just depends on the specifics to that market, not an overall expectation for the portfolio in general?","Erik J. Alexander","No, no, absolutely.","David Toti \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald","Okay.","Erik J. Alexander","The total specific to University of Santa Barbara.","David Toti \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald","Okay. Going back to NAREIT, you guys were talking about capping or potentially capping rent increases in Northern California. That doesn\u2019t seem to have happened. Are things continue to improve above expectation (inaudible)?","Erik J. Alexander","Yeah, this is Erik. We actually do cap the rents at the majority of the properties to stabilize the assets including Northern California.","Michael J. Schall","On renewals.","Erik J. Alexander","Yeah, thank you. On the renewals and so but again depending on what the resident chooses for a term, we\u2019ll dictate what the rent increase for the rate is.","David Toti \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald","Okay. And then I suspect you are not going to give us too much detail on the investment that was made. But can we expect more of those going forward. Is there something we will see this year?","Michael J. Schall","This is Mike. I assuming that you are referring to the strategic investment and yes, I really want to prevent this from being a discussion, a lengthy discussion about strategic investments. We do not expect many of them through over time. We've not had many of them over our history. And but I do maybe want to add one additional thought, which is that we promised the investment community that we would be disciplined throughout that process, starting from the accumulation of the position, and essentially the decision and execution of the sale, when these strategic objectives were not considered possible. So from our view that closes the chapter on that discussion, and again I\u2019m not going to make a lot of comments about what happened and the blow-by-blow type of stuff, because I just think it would be inappropriate to do so. ","So I'd like to move on. We have a lot of great things happening, internally, we need to focus our effort on the things that we can control and that what's we are doing internally and we'd like the call to sort of follow that same pattern.","","David Toti \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald & Co.","Okay great. Just one last quick one. The land parcel that you sold in Palo Alto; what was the thought process there given the ramp up in development overall?","Michael J. Schall","I didn't hear the last part of your question, I'm sorry?","David Toti \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald & Co.","In the context of rising development agenda, what was the rationale behind them selling that (inaudible) parcel?","Michael J. Schall","It was a great location obviously, but it was very small. It was only 50 units, and we were offered a price that made sense and we executed on it.","David Toti \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald & Co.","Self storage, operator, potentially. Thanks guys, I appreciate the detail.","Michael J. Schall","Thanks David.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Please proceed with your question.","Alex Goldfarb \u2013 Sandler O'Neill","Good morning out there. Mike, I appreciate your comments not want to make the investment a big part of the call, but just one question, because it's something that you have constantly came up with investors. If you guys were to do this again, how would you weigh just putting out to public, like a public bid? Do you think that would be helpful? Do you think that would accelerate a process or as you look at what happened, you guys are pleased with how it went, its sort of a Monday morning quarter-back thing, if you will?","Michael J. Schall","Alex, I think that every situation is a little different, and to make any generalized comments about what we might do differently, will depend, I think, on the situation, these things happen once every five years, let's say, and each scenario is a little bit different. They all have periods of activity perceiving them and then the activity itself, and it really depends. Your strategy is going to depend on that whole sequence of activity. So, I think it would be really difficult to make a generic statement about what might be different in the future. ","And again, what I'm hoping we don\u2019t do is turn this discussion into about the strategic investments, because \u2013 again from our perspective we need to focus our efforts on the things that are really important to us and we have a lot going on and we have a lot of opportunity in front of us. So rather than talk about something that is closed chapter in the book, we\u2019d really rather focus this forward on the things that we are doing and the results and 2013 all the stuff that's happening out here.","Alex Goldfarb \u2013 Sandler O'Neill","Okay, and that segues well into my second question then. You guys have made a number of recent deals including Pacific Electric. Were any of these deals sourced through your [mezz] portfolio and then as you guys look at making new mezz or financing investments at this stage in the cycle, is your view that those are more loan to own, the hope that you do get the property or at this point in the cycle most of those are more just getting attractive financing where you assume that you will probably just be paid off in the end?","Michael J. Schall","We did not source that through the mezz portfolio and the purpose of the mezz portfolio was legally and practically is to get the rate of return that we expect on the loan or whatever form it might take. Having said that, it does lead to the discussion, I mean you have relationship with the owner and that could lead to a transaction down the road and in a number of cases, it has at least led to a negotiation about whether we wanted to acquire the property. ","In all of those cases, part of the sort of strategic aspect of that is to make loans on things that we would like to own that satisfy our broader criteria and therefore we have had some situations where we\u2019ve been engaged in a discussion about buying a property. But up to this point, we\u2019ve not been able to actually make that acquisition.","Alexander Goldfarb \u2013 Sandler O'Neill","Okay. And just last thing is, as you guys ramp up the renovation program, are there any changes, are there any differences in tenant taste, this time maybe more price sensitive now versus pre-credit crisis or are the renovations sort of what we were seeing pre-credit crisis as far as like the granite and stainless and all that stuff.","Erik J. Alexander","Yeah, I mean I think people want nice new modern finishes and in a number of these communities, we are also adding the washer and dryer which I think is important, is an enduring feature. So again, modest changes and taste, but there doesn't seem to be any pricing pressure. People want to pay for the nice units in the nice locations.","Alexander Goldfarb \u2013 Sandler O'Neill","Great. Thanks a lot.","Erik J. Alexander","Thanks, Alex.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ross Nussbaum with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","Hi guys, good morning out there.","Michael J. Schall","Hey, Ross.","Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","I'm going to ask one quick one on the strategy front.","Michael J. Schall","I knew you would. I remember what happened last call, go ahead.","Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","Now that the whole thing is over, can you actually tell us what company was in?","Michael J. Schall","No.","Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","Is that because you are subject to a configure an NDA or you are just choosing not to?","Michael J. Schall ","This is to go a slippery slope, isn't it Ross? Just no comment.","Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","Okay, I\u2019ll move on.","Michael J. Schall ","Sorry.","Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","Prop 13, on Camden\u2019s call an hour ago, Rick decided to throw Prop 13 on the table as a risk if the State of California can\u2019t get its together. What\u2019s your view at this point?","Michael J. Schall","I\u2019m little surprised that Rick had that position. California given Prop 13, just got what was estimated is $6 billion in additional revenue and there have been recent statements that the State of California actually may have a surplus, which I tend to discount personally, but that's what's out there. Now, also with respect to the political reality, I go back to some of the conversations we've had with California Apartment Association and others who \u2013 they have a process that traced upon moderate Democrats that are concerned about business, as far as their endorsement, the candidates that they support. And there are actually several or many moderate Democrats and so the presumption that just because there is exactly two-thirds Democratic control of both parts of the government, it doesn't necessarily mean that the moderate Democrats are going to vote in favor of a Prop 13 overhaul. ","So, I guess I wouldn't agree with Rick on that. I think that there'll be there will be less support for that than you can imagine, given the number of moderate Democrats that are out there. And I also think that the voters sort of given the politicians (inaudible), which is fix the state budget problems and they've given $6 billion to do so. ","And I think that they expect that to be sufficient for the time being, not that there won't be some other proposals for tax increases and other things, but that go back to Prop 13 has been here for 13 years, and it's been challenged in a number of different ways, all the different ways you could imagine from judicial to legislative and other, and has pretty much survived that period of time. So I think that there will be more resistant than you might think.","Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Yeah, to be fair to Erik. I think his point was that if the surplus goes away, that there is increased risk to Prop 13 gets revisited?","Michael J. Schall","Yeah, I guess I would agree with that. But there is other discussions about vehicle license fees going up. There is a variety of discussions that are candidly easier to accomplish perhaps than a Prop 13 overhaul. ","Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Next question is San Francisco related and I think your comments on the office construction and the jobs picture is particularly relevant. I'm curious we are certainly a resurgence in the South of market area and we've certainly seen more tech companies going downtown than really we saw in the last tech cycle, if you will. How does that influence your view of where you want to be invested over the next five to 10 years within San Francisco? Does it push you to say we want to put more dollars downtown?","Michael J. Schall","It does. We think San Francisco is a place that we need to be. We, for many years, had a very small presence there given the difficulty of finding property there that satisfied our broader criteria. But we have been more active. We bought a couple of deals in the SOMA District and actually other parts of San Francisco and our interest continues there. So, over the 20 year horizon the CAGR of rent growth in San Francisco is highest in our portfolio and so the difficult has been trying to find transactions that hit our yield thresholds than our overall return thresholds while recognizing it's a very strong rent growth market.","Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And last question from me. Are you able to give us some sense of what the IRR on Fund II is going to end up there both to you as well as your partners and as I recognize those would be different numbers?","John F. Burkart","Yeah. This is John Burkart. We are in the 10% down on that, this 2004 through 2013 overall.","Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","To Essex?","John F. Burkart","Overall for the fund.","Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","Overall, so your numbers would be a little higher than with decent amount?","John F. Burkart","Yeah, of course.","Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","Okay. So 10%, okay, got it. Thank you.","Michael J. Schall","Thank you. ","Operator","Our next question comes from David Harris with Imperial Capital. Please proceed with your question.","David Harris \u2013 Imperial Capital, LLC ","Hi. If I look at the year-end balance sheet, it is got $93 million of marketable securities. $20 million went out after the year-end. So, if I am doing the math right, $73 million left on the balance sheet today, plus or minus. Could you cut the comment as to what those marketable securities are today if the strategic stake is going?","Michael T. Dance","Hi, David. This is Mike Dance.","David Harris \u2013 Imperial Capital, LLC ","Hi, Mike.","Michael T. Dance","After Katrina, we started a captive insurance company. That insurance company has over $30 million in marketable securities. That has worked out very well for us. And then back in 2009\/2010, we made some investments in the Freddie Mac type of a mortgage back securities and that are also in those numbers. So that\u2019s the bulk of it.","David Harris \u2013 Imperial Capital","Okay. Is that number likely to stay fairly stable now as we go forward?","Michael T. Dance","There is some accrual of interest on the trade securities, so that will grow just as we accrue interest on it. But and we get about $4 million a year in payments that the operating properties pay for the captive insurance, so that grows $4 million to $5 million a year with premiums and investment returns, so probably growth on the magnitude of $10 million a year.","David Harris \u2013 Imperial Capital","Okay. If I look back this time last year, we are a couple of weeks away from you declaring what your dividend is. Seems to be you've said it for the year on your first quarter. I mean you are one of the few REITs that did not cut in the downturn, so your dividend record is obviously quite outstanding. But could you give an indication as to what the level of growth we might look for this year or you might be recommending to the Board shall I say?","Michael T. Dance","Sure, David. It\u2019s Mike. We do our dividend increase as part of the next upcoming Board meeting and so that will be a topic for discussion. We expect that we will make a recommendation in the 8% to 12% range. I\u2019m sure there will be a discussion, but we are confident that it will lie somewhere within that range.","David Harris \u2013 Imperial Capital","","How much of that is discretionary and how much of that is being driven by rising net taxable income, Mike?","Michael T. Dance","It's pretty much \u2013 I would say, most of its discretionary. We had a return of capital this last year, so most of it will be discretionary based on cash flows. ","David Harris \u2013 Imperial Capital","","Okay.","","Michael T. Dance","Apartment REITs get a much shorter life on depreciation, but we have much more of our income sheltered by depreciation expense.","David Harris \u2013 Imperial Capital","Okay. I think you\u2019ve got one of the heaviest stock prices in this sector, and I know this is a subject that\u2019s come up before. But any thought as to splitting the stock to make it a little bit more manageable for [folk]?","Michael T. Dance","Yeah, David, again it\u2019s Mike. We\u2019ve evaluated that several times over the last couple of years and we conclude that with the very high institutional ownership that and typically the Southern stock is on a per share basis, the commissions or whatever are on a per share basis. And the listing fees and ongoing fees at the New York Stock Exchange make it unlikely that we are going to split the stock.","David Harris \u2013 Imperial Capital","This is (inaudible).","Michael T. Dance","Not exactly.","David Harris \u2013 Imperial Capital","All right. Thank you guys.","Michael T. Dance","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from Eric Wolfe with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","Eric Wolfe \u2013 Citigroup","","Hey guys.","Michael T. Dance","","Hey Eric.","Eric Wolfe \u2013 Citigroup","So forgetting about the strategic investment for a little while and I guess maybe thinking about M&A more broadly, most of the multifamily stocks really haven\u2019t performed very well over the last year, so your stock has obviously been one of the bright spots. But wondering if you think the fact that your peers are trading at sizable discounts NAV makes public-to-public M&A more likely or maybe less likely or public-to-private M&A, just wanted to get your thoughts on that?","Erik J. Alexander","","Yeah. Broadly speaking, I think the sector has an issue with M&A because there is just very little that you can do to make transactions work. You have I think a combination of impediments with respect to the tax rules that affect M&A. You have relatively similar pricing, some premium \u2013 small premium or discount to NAV, all the stocks trading within a band that really doesn\u2019t allow large premiums and you don\u2019t have \u2013 I don\u2019t think you have motivation in some cases with the management teams and boards. So I think you have a variety of impediments that really prevent M&A transactions from happening. So, I don\u2019t see anything changing that in the near term and thus I would say our appetite for M&A is pretty limited, because it seems like a bit of a feudal effort.","Eric Wolfe \u2013 Citigroup","Right. So it doesn\u2019t really I mean, I guess the answer then is, it really doesn\u2019t matter what the stocks are trading, because the same issues are going to be there, no matter what.","Michael J. Schall","Those are pretty much generic issues from our perspective. Yeah.","Eric Wolfe \u2013 Citigroup","Okay. And then just changing topics, one of your strategies over the last couple of years has been to buy condos that were trading before at least at big discounts, replacement costs (inaudible) under rental, now that you have seen condo prices increase pretty significantly in a number of your markets, people sort of kind of clamoring to buy in certain areas. Could you see yourself selling any of these assets or are you better up holding in this multifamily?","Michael J. Schall","Yeah, Eric, it's Mike. No, the intent was to acquire condo properties at apartment prices and when a condo premium, which throughout my career, I would say is close to 40% over a comparable apartment property that we would intent to try to realize that benefit in the case of Skyline, which is probably the largest and most notable example. It's really a lot better condo than it is an apartment building. And when you have wine lockers and snake-skinned couches, it's just really not an apartment building. ","So we would definitely seek to try and realize the gain on that from that investment activity when time is right and when you have, it's amazing how quickly the median price home has moved on the coast. When you have 20 plus or minus percent increases in the median-priced house, you become, it get you closer to that day, I don\u2019t think we are quite there yet, but I think it gets you closer.","Eric Wolfe \u2013 Citigroup","Got you. I mean would you could you venture a guess as to how long away you are from that or is that not, sort of not worth [the effort]?","Michael J. Schall","I think we are in a position that is, we have two good outcomes in life. If you have scenarios where you have a choice, both of which are good for you, that\u2019s \u2013 it gets no better than that right? And so I think in this case, it\u2019s exactly that and we have two good outcomes and we\u2019re just going to wait for the right moment. And it could vary from property-to-property or situation-to-situation because they are not all alike in the case of Skyline for example I think there is great potential. And actually it\u2019s optionality because we have the ability to convert one tower and not necessarily the other tower in a variety of choices along the way. So I think it\u2019s just a great business problem to have and we will look to realize or maximize the proceeds and on those transactions and we are very excited about them.","Eric Wolfe \u2013 Citigroup","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jana Galan with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","Jana Galan \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Good morning. ","Michael J. Schall","Hi, Jana.","Jana Galan \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I was wondering if you could comment on your expectations for your development yields and the Expo project came in nicely under budget or if there is opportunity for some of the other projects to have some construction savings.","Michael J. Schall","On Expo, I think Mike mentioned the stabilize will be in the 7% range in the fourth quarter this year. And in the balance of the pipeline, as you know we built over the last two years before we did spike in the land cost and before construction cost started moving up, we expect the entire thing to stabilize in that 7% range, $930 million that we have on our construction currently.","Jana Galan \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And when I look at your same-store revenue guidance midpoint at 5.75% and compare that with your estimated rent growth forecast for the markets overall at 6.1%. I am just curious are you expecting occupancy declines or are these numbers not really comparable?","","Michael J. Schall","Actually this is Mike speaking. I think our loss-to-lease was somewhere in the 4% range when we are going through that final budgeting process. So, you start with the loss-to-lease back then, and effectively F-16 is a market forecast, so these are market rents. And obviously for a market rent to be converted into a scheduled rental or into cash flow, we need to sign a new lease in effect or renew someone or sign a new lease. So there is a lagging part of the process there as we convert what happens at the market and to what is going on in the portfolio and so it's really just recognizing that lag.","Jana Galan \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Omotayo Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","Yes, good afternoon. My question is focused really on Southern California, LA and Orange County. You did make some very positive comments about that market turning around, but I think you also kind of mentioned that taken while for this to kind of happen in LA much longer than anticipated. I am just curious how confident you feel about LA really turning around or whether this is just a temporary thing and later on in the year there may be some downside risk to some of those forecasts?","Erik J. Alexander","","Yeah, this is Erik. I think we are more confident this year than last and the year before that, and I think the reasons are because the acceleration of job growth in the second half, as Mike had mentioned is one factor. The stability of occupancies and the rent levels, both on the renewal and the new lease side, is also a factor and over the last several weeks including part of December, we see improvements maybe a little stronger given the slow time of the year than we normally expect. I mean that\u2019s not massive but again we are in a good spot. I mean, we are almost 97% and so we have a lot of pricing power. We expect to be able to grow scheduled rent, particularly on the new side over the next couple of months and so I do have confidence and we are looking forward to hold up this year.","Omotayo Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","Good. So what\u2019s the key risk to LA slowing down again?","Erik J. Alexander","I think key risk is always jobs number one and supply number two, and since you have visibility or longer visibility on the supply given the numbers that we are looking at, we don\u2019t see that as a big risk and so it would take some bigger decline in jobs for \u2013 to hurt us there.","Omotayo Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","Okay. Thank you very much.","Erik J. Alexander","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Buck Horne with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.","Buck Horne \u2013 Raymond James","Thanks. Good morning gentlemen. Could you give us an update on your rent to income measures across the different kind of the three big markets there and relative to what\u2019s normal or typical cyclical peak. And then I guess also are you seeing continued increases in terms of \u2013 are you seeing rising incomes in your new tenants versus the ones that are moving out, is the average income of the tenant base still increasing?","Erik J. Alexander","Yeah, this is Erik, and the answer to the second part of your question is, yes, we have seen incomes go up. It\u2019s hard to measure the ones that are moving out, because I don\u2019t know what they make up to move in, and they don\u2019t share that with us. However, the ones coming in, obviously we will have on the application data and those levels are higher in all three of our markets. As to the percentage of income relative to the rents, the relationships with all remain the same in Seattle, the exact number in front of me. So I can't tell you that it is below 20%. It's like in the 17% to 19% range and in Northern California closer to that 24% range and then Southern California in between those two.","Buck Horne \u2013 Raymond James","Okay. And just for context \u2013 so how much further do you think that could be \u2013 could you go comfortably on some of those ranges in terms of your pricing power?","Erik J. Alexander","My opinion is, it can go a long way, particularly if we are doing our job and people like where they live. I think it's one of the more important decisions folks make about their life and where they spend their time, and when you look at some of the other markets in the United States where that ratio is much greater, that people choose to continue to be in those locations. And I think we see that the most in San Francisco. ","So I gave you the feedback on the three major markets, but obviously, if you separate that out by sub-market, you're going to have people spending less percentage of their income in the East Bay compared to some of the people in downtown San Francisco, all things being equal on average. I mean, again, you get some of these applications that come in and they have pretty phenomenal incomes and they could be spent than less than 10% on their rent. But I think there is \u2013 the point of your question, I think there is a lot of room to grow.","Buck Horne \u2013 Raymond James","Okay. Great. Thanks guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Karin Ford with KeyBanc Capital. Please proceed with your question.","Karin Ford \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Hi. Good morning. Just remind me, on Prop 13, to make a modification to that, does that require a general election or is that just a legislature that can make changes to it?","Michael J. Schall","You can change it with a two-thirds vote of both parts of legislature, which is why the concern is out there now that the democrats control both legislatures by the two-thirds majority.","Karin Ford \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Got it. Okay, so no general election needed.","Michael J. Schall","No.","Karin Ford \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay. Second question is just on your expectations for rent growth in 2013. It looks like renewal rates are continuing to stay relatively constant between 5% and 6%. New lease increases sort of peaked at like 8.7% last July. Is your expectation that those new lease rates will peak back up around the same level, go higher and then do you also expect renewal rates to continue to stay in that same range?","Erik J. Alexander","Yeah. So this is Eric. I expect it to follow the same pattern. We will see increases in those renewals and new leases as we go into the second and the third quarter. I am pleased with where the renewals are now and as I mentioned earlier with the strong occupancy and limited availability we have helped pricing power in \u2013 for the foreseeable future that we are at March for certain. And so when we start sending out those increases for the next groups which would be the back half of April and May, those are likely to go up as the new lease or the offered pricing goes up.","Karin Ford \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay. Great. Final question is just on Seattle. It looked like you lowered your rent growth forecast for the market from 3Q to 4Q, but Erik your comments were relatively bullish today on the call. Do you see potential downside to the forecast in Seattle?","","Michael T. Dance","Actually this is Mike. Let me just make a couple of comments, because we on the third quarter call we had fewer units in 2013, fewer delivery units. I talked on the call about 10,000 units under construction in Seattle, but we thought we had I think somewhere around 4,000 to 4,500 in 2013. We ended up pulling a bunch of the 2014 deliveries into 2013 and that softened the rent growth expectations for the downtown and that's why you saw that change.","Karin Ford \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay. That makes sense. Last question is just on San Diego, seems like we've gotten a couple of positive momentum trends out of that market from the public company reports recently. Do you feel like San Diego may have turned the corner?","Michael J. Schall","","Hard to say, I mean I am not scared about it, but unlike Los Angeles or Orange County where you\u2019ve seen some sustained momentum, it is probably early to call that for us. So I mean we are optimistic about it, but as the forecast shows we are looking for modest rent growth there.","Karin Ford \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Richard Anderson with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. ","Richard Anderson \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","","Hey thanks. Good morning out there. Sorry to keep you on, right. I do have a question Mike about the commentary you had on the earlier question about public to public merger. It is a quite different tone from you when I asked the question first quarter 2012, same question, how would I thought \u2013 what you thought about M&A in the space and you\u2019d say it is sounding interesting now. That was about nine months ago. So what happened, what changed your tune to today?","Michael J. Schall","I think we both know, Rich.","Richard Anderson \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","","I was trying not to laugh when I was asking that question. ","Michael J. Schall","","I think it\u2019s really troubling me to use my own words against me. How dare you? This has been a little bit of an evolution in terms of thought process, like, I still think that there are some things that make sense from a broader perspective. But actually realizing them and if we can \u2013 we can negotiate with ourselves all we want, but the real world comes into play. So, I think you got me on that one Rich.","Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets","","Okay. I\u2019m sorry, I know you wouldn\u2019t mind. Back to some more relevant quick questions here. You talked about spending more time from an acquisition standpoint Southern California versus Northern California; did you provide a cap rate differential between those two markets if you had similar assets in similar location, in the north and the south what the difference would be?","Michael J. Schall","We haven\u2019t, but we run essentially a model that price to look at the relationships between growth rate, our portfolio versus what we are acquiring cap rate or cash flow portfolio average versus what we are acquiring and our view on NAV, and that's what really drives our expectations. In this case, the really controlling factor typically has to do with the growth rate. So for one of the top growth rate markets, we shared with you what we think they are. ","So you kind of know we will be pretty much weighted into those markets as it relates to opportunity. We don't see a big difference in cap rate from Seattle to San Diego, and actually we see pretty significant differences in growth rate over that period of time. I think Seattle maybe has the lowest cap rate, just because there is some very wealthy people up there that like apartments. ","So I think that the determining factor is typically and will be no different in 2013 is going to be where can we get the best growth rates projected out from few years.","Richard Anderson \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Noticing that you\u2019re going to do $400 million of acquisitions or whatever the number is and your acquisition cost line item says, call it $1.6 million. It seems like people are getting a lower number on that line item lately, have you been able to manage acquisition costs down from what I think as rule some being 1% of total cost, is that a process underway or am I just imaging things?","Michael J. Schall","Yeah, you know, it\u2019s a little artificial to a certain extent because in that case, there was an \u2013 we agreed to pay a brokerage fee on a specific acquisition. Normally brokerage fees are paid by the sellers. If it\u2019s paid by the seller, it doesn\u2019t show up in there. It shows up in cost, right, somewhere. So, it\u2019s really geography on the financial statement and yeah, we try to make it so doesn\u2019t go in that line item. But in this case, we were unable to do that. It won\u2019t typically happen again.","Richard Anderson \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Okay, last question. You said development returns starting at 5.25% and stabilizing at 6.25%. What is the 100 basis point increase? Is that just trending rents once they stabilize or is that something else?","Michael J. Schall","That's comparing. You got it exactly right. It is the \u2013 the 5.25% is based on rents today. The 6.25% is rents a couple of years from now. So, it\u2019s just the normal trend in a rent.","Richard Anderson \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Does the 5.25% apply any concession?","Michael J. Schall","No, because the concessions, we think are pretty artificial. I mean the concession is really to get the volume during a lease-up.","Richard Anderson \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","","Okay.","Michael J. Schall","To be two times the normal turn that you would have on a stabilized apartment building. So, we view that as essentially a cost of development.","Richard Anderson \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Okay, great. That's all I have. Thanks.","Michael J. Schall","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Salinsky with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Salinsky \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","","Good morning guys. Just going back to Prop 13, what is the Prop 13 exposure and the portfolio estimate today?","Michael T. Dance","It\u2019s probably in the ballpark of $30 million to $32 million.","Michael Salinsky \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","","$32 million, okay, helpful. Second of all, Mike, you talked about cap rates in the transaction market. I just haven\u2019t been so active right now. What are you seeing more in the Coastal California markets? What kind of core or value-add type property and what is the buyer pool look like? I mean, has the competition increased in the last 12 months or you are seeing some people start to back off because of low cap rate?","Michael J. Schall","Mike, it\u2019s a good question. These markets are big enough that you pretty much see a little bit of everything. In the case of the Fund II sales, our Studio City asset had 50 something confidentiality agreements than other assets had. We had to actually mark it to get 10, so not that they were poorly located or anything else, it just varies by market. The institutional investments and the REITs tend to be very focused on that. Super high-end location at the corner of Main and Broadway let\u2019s say figuratively, and are willing to pay the price to get that. And so we see the greatest competition there. I\u2019d say as a general statement, cap rate spreads are pretty wide right now. In other words, a very aggressive cap rate in the let\u2019s call Main and Broadway type location. ","And then as you get further out in the periphery, it\u2019s a pretty significant spread and the interesting part is when you look at it relative to the cost of debt for example, there is still positive leverage even that for cap relative to a ten-year loan or seven-year loan. As you get out into the peripheral areas, you can have an enormous amount of cash and you can have a cash-on-cash return assuming interest only debt of somewhere in the 6.5 to 7.5 range. So, it\u2019s a very unique period of time I think, but I\u2019d say a lot of money is driven by the institutions. The institutions are very focused on location and typically pretty willing to pay for it. ","So, our acquisition approach and development approach is to try to find the locations that you get appropriate balance between cap rate and growth. We want most of the growth, but we want a little bit higher cap rate, and so we\u2019re probably not going to be competitive at Main and Broadway; we\u2019re going to be competitive somewhere else. We\u2019ve used the example of Fremont in Northern California, for example, because you have so much rent growth in the North San Jose area, Fremont is five miles away, haven\u2019t really experienced quite the same rent growth, and therefore, we target that as an acquisition opportunity. That\u2019s how we think of the world. That\u2019s how we try to implement our acquisition strategy.","Michael Salinsky \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","","That's very helpful. Final question, a little bit bigger picture. When you think about JVs at this point, many of your peers have been reducing their JV exposure. You are in the process of unwinding one and you also I believe started at Wesco III there as well. How do you think about JV allocation at this point? Is it more a function of where returns are versus where your cost of capital is today, or is it just at this point of the cycle, or just how do you look at that today? ","","Michael J. Schall","Yeah, exactly what you mentioned. We like having diversity of capital. It\u2019s not like if you decide you want to have JVs after not having any JVs, you can just go out and quickly raise some money, and therefore having the relationship are important. We\u2019ve been able to balance them with some other activities that are beneficial to the Company. ","So, for example, as we\u2019re trying to build our unencumbered pool on balance sheet, if we need to assume a loan we can do so in some of the JV formats which keeps our secured debt on balance sheet at a relatively low level. But the broader point is to have different types of capital so that as conditions in the economy change and we see opportunities we can react to it with different types of capital and which hopefully will help us create accretive investments.","Michael Salinsky \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Fair enough. Thanks very much guys.","Operator","Over last question comes from Paula Poskon in with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Paula Poskon \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.","Thanks very much. Two strategy questions also. One, if outmigration accelerates, how inclined would you be to follow those folks to new markets outside California?","Michael J. Schall","Paula probably not real excited about following them principally because we are looking for a couple of things. The broader strategy of the Company and I think the success over time has been going to areas that have relatively expensive single-family housing, not a lot of housing production. Over long periods of time, we like the constraints represented by mountains and waterways and difficult political structures and that type of thing. I think that that is what really creates the opportunity in California. ","We like really expensive single-family homes so that the transition from a renter to home owner is a difficult one. And we ultimately like job bases. I talked in my comments about the highly educated and highly skilled are doing very well in this economy and those that don't have those skills and education are not doing well. I think that the tendency is going to be to be the areas with the highly skilled jobs are going to continue to draw highly skilled people and high income people into those locations. I don't think you are going to see for example a math executive, engineers leaving Silicon Valley because this is kind of the hub in collaboration among engineers and talent pools are so important in this world. ","So, I think that there are certain pieces of what we have here that are not easily replicated elsewhere, and so we're happy in these types of markets. Now, if you ask me, are there some other markets that have the same price, same conditions or the same attributes as the coastal markets in California and Seattle, so I would yeah, there are some and they are typically on the East Coast.","Paula Poskon \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.","Thanks. And then, I guess that [ketch up] a segue to my second question, which is, given your comment in your prepared remarks about the growing income disparity, would you be more inclined to broaden or focused your product offering across price points?","Michael J. Schall","","We are pretty open to broadening price points. I mean, we've become more active in As. Again, if we get the location right, we want to earn from E or even B minus, so we can make into a B, to an A product. We have been pretty active developers to try, which will almost by definition, all be A in very high quality location. And so, we have broadened a little bit on, again, the B versus the A side, again trying to get location right. The Cs are just tough because the issue there is you are dealing with, a variety of tenant issues and occupancy issues that we really want to avoid.","Paula Poskon \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.","Thanks very much Mike.","Michael J. Schall","Thanks.","Operator","One last question from David Bragg with Zelman Associates. Please proceed with your question.","David Bragg \u2013 Zelman & Associates","Hi, good morning. Just a follow-up on an earlier topic. I think over 2011 and 2012, during the peak leasing season, your new move-in gains were about 150 basis points 200 basis points above that of renewals. But as this cycle matures should this continue or should that spread narrow as you start to work through new supply?","Erik J. Alexander","This is Erik. It can continue, I would expect again depending on the rate of growth that, you see some narrowing, as we capture that loss-to-lease, but clearly in areas where we expect higher growth like in the east side of Seattle and San Jose, and so forth. I still think that you could have a decent spread there.","David Bragg \u2013 Zelman & Associates","Erik, one other one, just on your earlier comments on Seattle with the supply pressure downtown, and relative to East side, how competitive would that supply be with the East side over a longer time horizon? I think many of us have been to the market and the distance itself is not that significant.","Erik J. Alexander","Yes, maybe it\u2019s a little hard to say, but I can tell you that we are tracking it all last year, and we track it from where the people are coming from at Expo, and we have nobody that we have put in a category of moving from the east side so far, yet not one person, they're all coming from out of the area to take their job at the Gates Foundation or Amazon or Nordstrom or any number of those places. Could that change I suppose. Stuff became super attractive. But again I think there is a lifestyle issue that people want in downtown and there is a lifestyle situation that people want on the east side and they are different. You are right. I mean, it\u2019s short distance. It\u2019s not necessarily a short commute in the morning given the congestion. So, I think that plays a factor as well.","David Bragg \u2013 Zelman & Associates","That's interesting. Thank you.","Michael J. Schall","Thanks, Dave.","Operator","One last follow-up comes from Eric Wolfe with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup","Yeah, it's Bilerman speaking. So, I guess, you didn't get to the 5% threshold, did you?","Michael J. Schall","No, Michael, we didn't use derivatives either.","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup","All right. Just going back to just thinking about privatizations rather than public M&A. If you go back to 2006 and even 2005, 2006, or 2007 timeframe, when you have the stocks trading at bigger discounts to NAV, so I can sort of appreciate your comment that, look, if two apartments are actually about trading at the same discount to NAV or one is a couple of percent higher than the other, it\u2019s hard to negotiate that from a public-to-public perspective. But I would imagine that when you look across the spring at the apartment stocks given how they have performed combined with the increases in same store, isn\u2019t that a recipe for privatizations in this environment?","Michael J. Schall","I think it could be and I think that might make sense. But I also think we had recent transaction here, the Archstone transaction. I imagine that that was considered at some source. So, I think as these companies become larger and larger, I think you have a capacity issue to extent in terms of the transactions just require an enormous amount of money. So, I think that it's probably difficult in that case, and I think that some of the other transactions would be difficult just because of their share size.","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup","","I think the majority of the companies are in that $5 billion to $8 billion zip code and even some below versus\u2026","Erik J. Alexander","","Yes.","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup","A $17 billion company just it would seem as though the private market is still extraordinarily active, the debt financing market has only gotten better. Rates are extraordinarily low, and fundamentals continue to get better. You have the publicly traded apartment sector trading almost to 6% implied cap rate. Something doesn't feel right about that.","Erik J. Alexander","Yeah no, I\u2019ve totally agree with you. I think you are under something there for that more right size companies. Yes.","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup","Okay. Thank you.","Michael J. Schall","Thanks.","Operator","At this time I will like to turn the call over to management for closing comments.","Michael J.

As a reminder, today\u2019s conference call is being recorded.","Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs as well as information available to the Company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found in the Company\u2019s filings with the SEC. [Operator Instructions]","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you, Mr. Schall. You may begin.","Michael Schall","Thank you, Dana. I would like to welcome everyone to our third quarter earnings conference call. John Burkart and Angela Kleiman will follow me with comments, and John Eudy is here for Q&A.","I will discuss three topics on the call today: Our third quarter results and preliminary 2019 market outlook; investment market conditions; and an update on the apartment industry\u2019s campaign to oppose California Prop 10.","First topic. Our third quarter results were mostly as expected, reflecting a solid economy and severe shortages of housing on the West Coast. We continue to experience strong demand for multifamily housing across the West Coast metros with periodic disruptions to pricing when multiple apartment lease-ups occur within a submarket, often leading to large leasing concessions and often impacting pricing at nearby stabilized communities.","Job growth has continued to outperform our initial 2018 expectations across the Essex portfolio. Job growth is slightly lagging in Southern California and strong in the tech market as demonstrated by greater than 3% job growth in both Seattle and San Jose. With tight labor market conditions income growth continues to outpace rent growth, which is improving rental affordability. Per capita personal income growth in Essex metros is expected to average 5.7% in 2018, up almost 1% from year-ago and compared to 4% for the nation.","As John Burkart will discuss in a moment, we have experience normal seasonal patterns in 2018, which is significantly different from 2017. Same-store revenue growth for 2018 troughed in the third quarter, mostly due to revenue strategy and year-over-year seasonal variation. Overall, market conditions are much better now as compared to year-ago and our portfolio remains well-positioned.","Consistent with the strong job growth reported in the tech markets, job openings for the top 10 public tech companies, all of which are headquartered in California and Washington, increased 26% year-over-year to nearly 22,000 open positions as of September. With the dearth of skilled workers, employers continue to face shortages of qualified personnel, pushing wages upward to track employees from other areas.","Turning to our market outlook for 2019. Today, we have a much better visibility into the year ahead, compared to last year. And thus, we have included our preliminary outlook for 2019 on page S-16 of the supplemental. We also provide the primary supply and demand drivers that shape our rent growth expectation. S-16 is intended to be a scenario based on the strength of the U.S. economy. We begin with the U.S. GDP and job growth estimate from third-party sources. And based on these key assumptions, we estimate job growth and housing demand in the Essex metros. As to housing supply, we drive each market to gain insight on apartment delivery timing to create quarterly estimates. Using historical relationships between housing supply, demand, and rent growth, we established our 2019 market rent growth expectations.","For 2019, the U.S. economy is expected to continue growing at a healthy pace with U.S. GDP and job growth of 2.5% and 1.3%, respectively. Unemployment rate for the Essex markets declined 50 basis points than the past year, to 3.5%. Over the past several years, falling unemployment has contributed to job growth, although this positive impact will likely diminish going forward. We expect the West Coast economies to outperform the nation as to job growth, which we estimate at 1.8% for the Essex metros in 2019. This was about 30 basis points below the September actual job growth of 2.1%, again reflecting the impact of tight labor market conditions.","For 2019, we expect 3.1% market rent growth in the Essex markets with California slightly outperforming Washington and the best results in San Jose and San Diego. Oakland is expected to lag due to increasing apartment deliveries. Reflecting the importance of economic growth in our 2019 assumptions, we produced a new graphic on page S-16.1 of the supplemental to demonstrate the outperformance of the Essex metros in terms of cumulative nominal GDP growth. Bottom-line, the Essex metros has outperformed the U.S. average and other major metros in the past five years and are well-positioned for continued leadership going forward.","Turning to Supply in 2019. Our preliminary forecast assumes that multifamily supply will be relatively flat in 2019 versus 2018 in the Essex markets with significant variances in some markets. Most notably, we expect a substantial increase in apartment supply in Los Angeles and Oakland, and significant reductions in Orange County, San Diego and San Francisco.","Construction labor shortages continued to be a major factor affecting apartment delivery timing, and this issue continues unabated. Thus in 2019, we made a notable change to our supply methodology on page S-16 of the supplemental by factoring delays into the estimated delivery timing of newly constructed apartments. Thus, our multifamily supply, shown on S-16 of the supplemental, has pushed roughly 8% of apartment units or around 3,000 units from 2018 into 2019 and from 2019 into 2020. For the next couple of years, we see little change in the number of apartments being built and the overall construction labor force. And therefore, there's no reason to believe that the delays will abate. With housing demand continuing to exceed supply, we believe the housing shortages on the West Coast will continue.","Now, turning to my second topic, investment market conditions. 2019 is likely to be another year where escalating construction costs, driven by labor shortages and entitlement cost increased at a faster pace compared to rental revenue and net operating income. Therefore, developer yields are being compressed, creating a significant headwind to apartment construction starts. This is a challenging scenario for our direct development activities and therefore, we have not materially added to our development pipeline. Instead, we are focused primarily on providing preferred equity to third-party apartment developers in the Essex markets. At the start of 2018, we had a strong preferred equity pipeline and hope to significantly exceed our $100 million target. As it stands now, we will struggle to hit our target in 2018. Angela will comment on guidance in a moment.","As it relates to acquisitions, we continue to see plenty of capital looking to buy apartment, leading cap rates relatively flat. Recent increases in interest rates have erased most of the positive leverage tailwind that we have enjoyed since 2007 as long-term apartment financing rates are now comparable to cap rate. A-property and locations continue to trade around 4% to 4.25% cap rate and sometimes sub-4 for exceptional property with B-quality property and locations generally trading 25 to 50 basis points higher. We will continue to monitor the transaction market closely.","And now onto my third topic, an update on California Prop 10. As we have highlighted on prior calls, we are part of a broad coalition to close California Prop 10, would seek to repeal the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act On November 6. We are joined by other apartment companies, trade organizations, unions, veterans and a variety of pro-business groups. I think it's appropriate to recognize the extraordinary effort of those involved in the No-On-10 campaign, especially its the executive committee and co-chairs, John Eudy, and Barry Altshuler. They have successfully united the industry around a worthy cause. We believe that passing Prop 10 will intensify housing shortages, making a bad problem worse. It will likely lead to the expansion of price controls for all types of housing, which will result in less housing being built. Price controls produce longer tenancies, which in turn reduce the number of available rental units for those seeking housing and those with limited means will be at an increasing disadvantage competing from paying for housing amid greater scarcity. Finally, apartment, condo and single-family owners will have a strong economic incentive to convert rentals subject to price controls to owner-occupied housing, thereby shrinking the rental stock.","Important to note that Prop 10 contains no funding for affordable housing and no requirements of additional housing be built. The state of California directs a process called the Regional Housing Needs Assessment to plan for sufficient housing supply. However, many cities don't want to create housing because of the related costs of services, including schools, police, et cetera. Gavin Newsom, a leading gubernatorial candidate, captured this issue on his website with the following comment, quote \u201ccities have a perverse incentive not to build housing because retail generates more lucrative sales tax revenue. The bigger the box, the better, because cities can use the sales tax for core public services\".","As a better approach, the state has recently passed many laws that support the Regional Housing Needs Assessment which we believe are critical to increase housing production, the only viable solution to the crisis today. We also believe that more funding is needed, targeted to affordable housing. And, thus, we support California Prop 1.","That concludes my comments. And I'll now turn the call over to John Burkart.","John Burkart","Thank you, Mike.","Q3 was a good quarter. It played out as we expected, following historical seasonal pattern with the rental market peaking in July and our operating team shifting our strategy from the focus of maximizing occupancy to locking in the seasonally higher rental rates. The result was that we allowed the occupancy in our portfolio to move down 30 basis points while we achieved rents on new rentals about 3.5% above the prior year's quarter.","For 2018, from a same-store revenue growth perspective, Q3 is the low point for the year due to the lower occupancy and the one-time payment in the third quarter of 2017, related to the delinquency collection from a corporate housing operator, which created an irregular comp. Adjusted for both occupancy and the one-time item, same-store revenue growth would have been 2.6% for the third quarter of 2018 or 40 basis points higher than our reported results.","Overall, our concessions in Q3 2018 were down approximately 20% from the prior year for the same-store portfolio. Our renewals in the third quarter grew approximately 4.2% and they\u2019re being sent out at approximately 4.5% for the fourth quarter. In September, our loss to lease was 1.7% versus 20 basis points in September of 2017 due to the stronger rental market we experienced this year, which positions us well for 2019.","We expect the same store portfolio revenue growth in the fourth quarter will be approximately 2.9%. Although, we're not providing guidance at this time, we look to 2019 -- as we look to 2019, we see the market slightly stronger than in 2018 and our portfolio is well-positioned with the 1.7% loss to lease in September. From a revenue perspective, we\u2019ll have headwinds related to higher occupancy costs in 2018, and we continue to face wage pressure in our markets, which is consistent with the past several years.","Now moving on to an update on our markets. The Seattle market continues to be supported by strong job growth, posting year-over-year job gains of 3.7% for the third quarter of 2018, the highest job growth in the Seattle MD in any quarter for over 17 years.","Looking at Amazon, job openings for the company in the market have more than doubled as of the third quarter of 2018 to a little over 7,000 open positions since the end of last year. Tech continues to be a major driver for the market during the period. Amazon, Google and T-Mobile leased over 0.5 million square feet of office space in Bellevue while Facebook has approximately 150 open jobs listed in Redmond for their virtual reality headset division and is rumored to be in the process of signing several expansion leases in the east side. With the light rail expansion into the east side scheduled to begin service in 2023, we will expect to see an increase in office leasing activity in the submarket.","Same store concessions increased in the Seattle region from 80,000 in the third quarter of 2017 to 197,000 this quarter. Concessions were spread across many assets in each submarkets and were largely used as closing tools. Revenue growth in our east side and Seattle CBD submarket was relatively flat at 1.6% and 40 basis points, respectively, while the North and South submarkets grew at 2% and 3.5%, respectively, for the third quarter of 2018. Our loss to lease at the end of the quarter was 1.2% for the entire market.","Moving down to northern California. Job growth in the San Francisco Bay Area in Q3 averaged 2.4% year-over-year with over 76,000 jobs added. San Jose job growth was robust for the period with 3.2% year-over-year job growth while Oakland and San Francisco were both up 1.8% for the period. Notable office leases this quarter include Amazon and PwC\u2019s combined 350,000 square-foot expansion in downtown San Francisco; on the Peninsula Facebook leased 800,000 square feet of under construction project in Burlington; and in the South Bay, Roku added an additional 250,000 square feet for Bay Area footprint while Splunk singed a 300,000 square-foot lease at Santana Row, with plans to hire 2,000 additional employees in the Bay Area.","Total office leasing activity is over 11 million square feet for 2018. This is greater than a combined total leasing activity in this market for the past two years. VC funding for San Francisco and Silicon Valley combined for the trailing four quarters through Q3 is at a new peak of $41.6 billion.","Same-store concessions decreased over 50% in the third quarter 2018 from the prior year\u2019s period. Concessions were spread across many assets in each submarket and were largely used as closing tool. Our year-over-year same-store revenue growth for the third quarter of 2018 was led by the San Mateo submarket at 3.4%, followed by our Oakland and San Jose submarkets which each grew at 2.4%m and our Fremont submarket at 1.8%, while San Francisco continued to remain flat for the period. Rents in our Bay Area markets were up approximately 3.3% and loss to lease was 1.1% in September.","Continuing to Southern California. Job growth in Los Angeles in the third quarter of 2018 averaged 1.3% year-over-year. Netflix continues to solidify the presence in the market, preleasing at an additional 330,000 square feet in Hollywood, likewise co-working companies, SpaceX and WeWork expanded their combined footprint by almost 200,000 square feet during the period. Year-over-year, revenue growth for the third quarter of 2018 was led by our Long Beach and Woodland Hills submarkets with 5.4% and 4% growth respectively, trailed by the West LA submarket with 2.8% growth and the Tri-Cities submarket with 2.4% growth. September loss to lease in LA County was 2.4%.","In Orange County, jobs in the third quarter grew 60 basis points for the year-over-year. This situation is similar to 2017 when the BLS showed 30 basis points of job growth in the third quarter which was increased to 2.2% when the revisions were completed. We will continue to monitor job growth in this market. Orange County loss to lease was 1.7% in September. Finally, in San Diego, year-over-year job growth remained at 1.7% in the third quarter of 2018. Amazon expanded their San Diego tech hub by 85,000 square feet, with plans to add 300 tech workers. Worthy to note that high-paying industries have accounted for more than 50% of the job growth in San Diego market. Year-over-year revenue growth in the third quarter of 2018 was 3.4% for northern San Diego submarkets while Chula Vista grew at 4.1%. Loss to lease in the market was 2.2% in September.","Overall, same-store concessions are down with Southern California region about 30% from the prior year's period. 65% of the concessions in the third quarter related to downtown LA and assets impacted by the supply in south Orange County. Currently, our portfolio is at 96.5% occupancy and our availability 30 days out is 5.1%.","Thank you. And I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Angela Kleiman.","Angela Kleiman","Thank you, John.","I\u2019ll start with a brief review of our third quarter results, then discuss the full year guidance, and conclude with an update on capital markets and the balance sheet.","In the third quarter, core FFO grew 5.7%, exceeding the midpoint of guidance by $0.03 per share. Details of the reconciliation to our original guidance are included on page four of the earnings release. Our favorable third quarter results enabled us to raise our core FFO per share guidance by $0.03 at the point to $12.56 for the full-year. This represents a 5.4% year-over-year growth, which is 90 basis points higher than our original guidance of 4.5%. ","Turning to our third quarter investments and funding plan. We closed $104 million acquisitions in the Wesco V joint venture and originated an $18.6 million preferred equity investment, which brings our total structure finance commitments to approximately $385 million. We plan to fund the new investments with two dispositions that are on track to close at the end of the fourth quarter.","As for guidance on investment activities for the full year. On acquisitions, we expect to achieve the low end of our range. On our $100 million preferred equity target, we currently have $45 million closed through October and believe that the majority of the remaining balance could close by early 2019 with funding up to six months thereafter. This is consistent with Mike's earlier comments and the headwinds regarding apartment construction starts.","On dispositions, we have several properties in various stages of the sale process in anticipation of funding needs for 2019. Depending on the timing of the sale, some properties will transact by yearend. Therefore, we are increasing the high end of our dispositions range from $300 million to $400 million.","Use of proceeds may include potential buyout, joint venture partner interest, development funding, stock buyback and debt repayment, depending on market conditions. As we have done in the past, we will seek to redeploy the proceeds into the most attractive investments in order to maximize the total insurance. Consistent with our original guidance this year, we do not start any new development. As it relates to our existing $940 million development pipeline, our share of unfunded obligation is $384 million, most of which will be funded in 2019, which means over 85% of our development pipeline will be completed and in lease-up by next year. Keep in mind that lease-ups are FFO dilutive until we approach stabilization. Consequently, our preliminary forecast anticipates a potential FFO per share impact of up to $0.10 for the next year.","Lastly on capital markets and the balance sheet. Our capital needs for 2018 remain de minimis. We look to 2019 as we\u2019re trying to repay approximately $590 million of secured debt, which was assumed from the BRE transaction and has an effective rate of 3.4%, but the cash rate is 5.6% rate. Therefore, this refinancing will be an economic benefit to the Company, but will create an FFO headwind of between $0.05 to $0.10 per share, depending on timing and market conditions, the current rate on our 10-year unsecured bond offering will be in the mid 4% range. However, we have a good amount of flexibility with access to multiple refinancing alternatives. And our balance sheet remains strong at 25% leverage with 5.5 times debt to EBITDA, and virtually full availability on our $1.2 billion loan of credit.","That concludes my comments. And I'll turn the call back to the operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria from Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","Juan Sanabria","Hi. Good afternoon. Just wanted to follow up on the supply data where you mentioned you changed up your methodology. Could you just give us a little bit more details around that? What would the numbers have been, had you not assumed delivery delays, which have been pretty consistent, like you said, \u201818 into \u201819, and \u201819 into \u201820, just to get a sense of comparing that to third party providers?","Michael Schall","Hey, Juan. It\u2019s Mike. Thanks for joining the call. I appreciate it. It\u2019s going to be difficult for me to reconcile these exactly because the supply estimates from the vendors have changed a lot. And I think there are some procedural issues. What we\u2019re trying to do is take a longer look at supply. So, we have gone back to 2017 and projected forward to 2020. And what we found in that analysis is that the total number of units produced in the Essex metros have ranged from 34,000 to 36,000 per year in all of our -- again, all of our metros. And essentially what we conclude from that is that construction labor is the main constraint. And even though construction labor can vary by submarket to submarket, in other words, can be transient. Some construction workers can go from LA to some other metro. What we think is happening is basically there\u2019s a cap on the amount of construction that can get done. And so, we\u2019re seeing pretty consistent total apartment units being delivered in each of those years. And that costs us to essentially take our best estimate at trying to guess or estimate how much was going to leap from one year to the next. And as I said in the prepared remarks, we think it is around 3,000 units from 2018 into 2019, and 2019 into 2020. And again within the context of -- that leads to about 36,000 units, plus or minus, in each of the last four years or four years preceding 2020.","Juan Sanabria","And then, I was just hoping you could talk a little bit about the expense side. I know this question -- who is best to answer. But, Angela gave some data points on kind of how to think about FFO impacts from occupancy -- sorry, from developments in some of the stuff you\u2019re trying to do. But any color you can give on the expense side, particularly around some of the bigger ticket items, like real estate taxes, as we think about \u201819?","Angela Kleiman","Sure. On the real estate taxes, I think with California, that piece is pretty straight forward. CRO continues to be more of a wildcard. So, for example, we had expected 2018 CRO capital to come in around, say, between 10 to 13%; it came in at 16%. And so, next year, we\u2019re going through that process right now, still working through it. But, it\u2019s probably going to be consistent and that it\u2019ll be high and it\u2019ll be more than 10%, but probably below, say, 16%, if you will. So, that\u2019s our current thing. We expect utility costs to continue to, one, add around that 4% or 5% range. And I think those were some of the largest non-controllable items.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Austin Wurschmidt from KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.","Austin Wurschmidt","Mike, you talked about cap rates haven\u2019t moved, but you mentioned that positive leverage has started to be eliminated. Historically, you\u2019ve mentioned that it\u2019s being kind of one of the supportive metrics of sustaining low cap rates. So, just curious, when you look back historically, what does your research tell you about the lag between perhaps when cap rates could begin to move higher as a result of the eliminating the positive leverage?","Michael Schall","Sure, Austin. I think in our experience, cap rates are pretty sticky; they don\u2019t change quickly overnight. Buyers and sellers need time to adjust to a new environment. I think that there is enormous amount of money out there looking for investments and looking for yield specifically. And I think that that is a one of the forces that is keeping cap rates at relatively low levels. So, I wouldn't expect any significant change in cap rates in the near term. I think what happens is, you will see buyers and sellers not agreeing and that will essentially cause a freeze in the transaction markets for some period of time, before cap rates would change. So, again, we haven't seen that now because there's so much money in the market, chasing deals. And we will see what happens going forward. I guess, it\u2019s going to take several quarters for this to play out.","Austin Wurschmidt","I appreciate the thoughts there. And then, can you just give us a sense how 2019 supply delivery stack up, is it more heavily weighted in the first half of the year or back half of the year?","Michael Schall","Sure. Overall, we think 2019 is, again, as I said in the prepared remarks, roughly the same as 2018. There are some regional variances. Supply for example, pretty significantly let\u2019s say, in LA and Oakland and then down in some other places that are essentially offsetting those numbers. In terms of quarter to quarter, I think it\u2019s been so challenging to get the timing right going into the outlook of the details probably too far into weeds. What we have right now for 2019 is the third and fourth quarters are a little bit higher -- actually, you know what, they are pretty consistent throughout. The third and fourth quarters are heavier in northern California but lighter in Seattle and Southern California. So, we have pretty even supply quarter to quarter throughout 2019.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nick Joseph from Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","Nick Joseph","How do you think about capital allocation nonorganic growth, given the current stock price? You\u2019ve been active in the past, either issuing equity through the ATM to fund growth or repurchasing shares when you\u2019re trading large discount. But right now, you\u2019re somewhat in between those two scenarios. So, how do you think about adding value to this environment?","Michael Schall","This is Mike, and that\u2019s a very good question, and we think it's pretty darn difficult to do that, to add value in this market. So, obviously, we have tried to focus on preferred equity investment, and I think that will continue to be something that we focus on going forward. We also, at this point in time, in prior cycles, have leaned more toward joint venture or co-investment type transactions. However, with interest rates up, they\u2019re becoming more challenging to make work as well. And then, finally, on the development side, Mr. Eudy is here, he can comment on this, or follow-up on my comments. We\u2019re just seeing a lot of low to mid-4 cap rate measure today untrended, so measured on rents in place today, throughout our portfolio. And we just don't think that\u2019s enough cap rate to get us excited about development. John, do you have anything to add to that?","John Eudy","Only that we\u2019re keeping our power drive for when the time comes and that will change.","Michael Schall","Yes, it will be interesting. And so, I will conclude by saying, I\u2019ve learned in this business that don't try to make some work that just fundamentally doesn't work. And so, essentially focusing on the balance sheet, making sure it\u2019s in pristine shape and being ready for opportunities when they arise, we don't know when or where they are going to be, but when that happens, we want to be ready. So, I think that's our focus now.","Nick Joseph","And then, you mentioned the headwind too, and compression in market development yields. Do you think that will have an impact on rent concessions during lease-ups due the product that is underway now?","Michael Schall","I think that we're expecting pretty consistent concessionary activity going forward. John, do you want to handle that one, concessions going forward, given development?","John Burkart","Yes, absolutely. In Q4, we see a little bit more supply coming at us for the year. And so, there would be the normal Q4 softer market. I'm sure, we're going to have some more concessions. But overall, our expectations are concessions are in check across each of the market. Again, as Mike has mentioned, LA, downtown LA is going to have more products. And so, there will be isolated cases with more concessions. But overall, as a company, our concessions are down in same-store portfolio, and we see things generally in pretty good order, 4 to 6 weeks, limited situations with 8 weeks, and often times concessions are going back, even back down to three weeks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Kim from BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","John Kim","On Proposition 10, some of the polls are going to be working in your favor as far as it not passing. I'm just wondering, how confident do you feel about this vote going in your favor versus a few months ago? And is there a particular poll that you pay attention to more than the others? ","John Eudy","I\u2019ll try -- this is John Eudy. We are cautiously optimistic that we are in a pretty good start and where we thought we were going to be at this point in time. But you never know. Polls have been wrong in the past. The messaging, I think you are referring to the PPIC public poll that came out a week ago that has it at 60% no, 25% yes, and the balance undecided. We see that in our internal polling as well. But the last eight days can change. But right now, we believe that we're in a pretty good spot to win or to push back under the deal.","Michael Schall","I'm going to add one thing to that, and that is Mr. Eudy does not give up and he is very focused on really pushing hard right through election day to make sure that the campaign is very focused on the ultimate result. And again, we have watched John do this for the last couple of months. And he's been incredibly focused and incredibly effective. ","John Kim","Best of luck. On your repairs and maintenance, the costs were down 1% year-over-year. And I'm wondering how much of this is due to low turnover versus capitalizing more or maybe some other factors.","John Eudy","It's not really capitalizing more, it is -- the turnover is a factor for sure. There is also some timing issues there as well. I think it will kick up in Q4 but all according to the original plan for the year. So, we are finding opportunities to create efficiencies and lower our cost to offset some of the wage pressures that we face and are coming in again with another good year as it relates to controllables.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Guinee from Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","John Guinee","Angela, I was noticing in your guidance, and this maybe old news but just clarify it for me. Insurance reimbursement, legal settlements et cetera, you've recognized the negative $2 million year-to-date but you've got a budget or you have 6.2 for the year negative. Is there a one-time charge you are expecting to get in the fourth quarter?","Angela Kleiman","Yes. That\u2019s all related to our Pop 10 campaign efforts. And so, that is a onetime charge. And it will occur in the fourth quarter.","John Guinee","Okay. So, $4.2 million get to FFO in the fourth quarter, and that\u2019s in your guidance or not?","Angela Kleiman","It is in our guidance.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Drew Babin from Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Drew Babin","Quick question on occupancy. I was hoping you could clarify how -- I think it was mentioned before just where occupancy was at the end of the third quarter, where it is today, and should we necessarily expect that things to get back on PAR year-over-year during the fourth quarter as you move into a less favorable season with maybe some more supply coming in at some unfavorable times? Just curious how to model that.","John Burkart","Sure. Our occupancy at this point is 96.5, and last year we were a little bit higher, we were about 30 basis points higher at this point in time exactly. I think this year, we will again be -- we continue to be a little bit under last year. If you\u2019re going back to the year, we started well above than occupancy; and then, as the market shifted, we shifted our strategy to favor achieving market rent over occupancy. So, we do have that headwind that we are facing Q3, as I mentioned Q4 will continue, will actually continue into the first half of \u201819. So, my expectation is our occupancy is a little tough to tell. We are obviously finding that in the marketplace, and as I mentioned, with more supply, that\u2019s going to hit Q4 during the low demand period. But, I expect we will probably stay close to where we are right now, maybe up 10 basis points or something like that.","Drew Babin","And then, quickly, on Seattle, kind of the characteristics for supply for next year. It looks like you are expecting less multifamily supply growth in Seattle next year versus this year. Is that construction delay impact noticeable there? And I guess, as you go on the next year, is the supply just this kind of downtown concentrated or this year, is it a little more spread out?","Michael Schall","Hey Drew, it\u2019s Mike. We think it will decline a little bit, maybe around 10%, Seattle will still have a plenty of supply in 2019 relative to 2018. But yes, to your second question, which is it will be more spread out; and the more spread out it is, the less we see that phenomena of multiple lease-ups competing against one another and offering very large concessions. So, the fact that it\u2019s spreading out should help us in 2019 relative to 2018.","Drew Babin","And then, one more for Angela, you mentioned the nickel to about a dime dilution potentially from paying down debt maturities next year. Does that include just 2019 secured maturities or is there some component of 2020 maturities that might be prepaid as well on the contributes to that number you provided?","Angela Kleiman","That\u2019s a very good question. And so, yes, it does include a component. So that $590 million of the debt assumed from the BRE acquisition, 300 is to this year -- I mean I'm sorry in 2019, and 290 is due in 2020, because we can't prepay it without any penalty; that\u2019s the right economic thing to do and that\u2019s why. So, in total, we actually can and are planning to pay about $900 million of debt of which 290 is optional.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Trent Trujillo from Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question.","Trent Trujillo","I appreciate the commentary in your prepared remarks about this, but what are your latest thoughts on voter support for Prop 10 and how it is or how has been impacting the transaction market? You mentioned cap rates are broadly unchanged. There\u2019s still healthy liquidity and capital chasing multi-family product, but what kind of depths in buyer pools have you seen? We\u2019ve heard that there\u2019s been less in institutional interest in California multi-family recently.","Michael Schall","It\u2019s another good question. I'm not sure I have the perfect answer for it. I think that the greatest sensitivities are the transactions are hitting the market in some of the cities with the most extreme forms of rent control. I know that there was transaction for example, in Berkeley that had very extreme forms rent control. And I think that the market is reacting to those by pushing the bids for them past November 6th. And so, you\u2019ll know the answer before people commit to it. So, I think there\u2019s been somewhat of a showing the fact in the marketplace as people wait for Prop 10\u2019s ultimate outcome. But I don\u2019t get the sense that it\u2019s had overall impact; in other words, some parts of the market areas that have less severe forms of rent control. I think it has a smaller impact on the market.","Trent Trujillo","And you alluded to having a handful of assets on the market as a source of fund. Can you perhaps speak to the type of product you\u2019re looking to recycle, and if these are perhaps in those submarkets that are being subject to the most extreme versions of rent control potentially?","Michael Schall","No, not necessarily. Again, this is Mike. We follow the same basic methodology with respect to both sides of our portfolio. We try to rank our submarkets by longer-term job growth -- I am sorry longer-term rent growth and as a function of job growth and supply growth, and then we try to identify the areas that will -- are the weakest level of that, and try to call the portfolio as a result of that. The domain disposition earlier this year is a good example of that. Also, it seems like we\u2019re getting more unsolicited offers. And when we get unsolicited offers, we will take them on a case-by-case basis and sometimes we will act on them if we get the right value. So, I\u2019d say, those are the two driving forces of our dispo program.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rich Hightower from Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.","Rich Hightower","So, most of my questions have been answered already. But, quickly, with respect to fourth quarter expenses, I think the guidance implies maybe high 3s, upwards 4% of same store growth in the fourth quarter. Is that driven by the uptick in repairs and maintenance? I think John to this. Is there something else going on there that we should be aware of?","Angela Kleiman","No. I think it\u2019s what you\u2019re anticipating. And so, on the expense side, we\u2019re expecting to land for full year at 2.6% and it\u2019s not atypical for us to run high in expenses in the fourth quarter. And so, there\u2019s definitely timing element with that in conjunction with what John Burkart said earlier as it relates to repair and maintenance.","Rich Hightower","And then, just backing up to the occupancy headwind, third quarter, fourth quarter and the next year. Can you help us understand, I guess the word for it would be cadence of the headwind, as we kind of progress through 2019. Is the impact is more impactful than the first half of the year and then kind of getting to a normal seasonal occupancy in the third quarter and fourth quarter next year, just so we kind of understand the quarterly sequential element there, as we model it?","John Burkart","Yes. You hit it exactly. The greatest impact is in Q1 and Q2 where we were running at significantly higher occupancy. Our Q1, we were looking at the numbers, January 97.1, 97.2, 97.2, very high occupancy Q1. And I don\u2019t expect to match that. As we move forward into through Q3, it\u2019s less, and then we get into -- I\u2019m sorry, Q2, it\u2019s less. As we get into Q3, we\u2019re probably right on point, and our Q4 will probably be right on point. So, the headwind is really, largely related to Q1 and Q2 occupancy. And that\u2019s it at this point. We\u2019re still in our budget planning process, but giving you a big picture. To the extent we see greater opportunities or reason to be more aggressive, we certainly will be. But at this point, those are most obvious headwinds.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rob Stevenson from Janney Montgomery Scott. Please proceed with your question.","Rob Stevenson","How significant is your current redevelopment opportunity across the portfolio, and how comfortable are you that you can achieve targeted returns for new projects at this point in cycle, given market and supply condition?","Michael Schall","Sure. So, big picture, we are renovating somewhere in the neighborhood of 2,500 units a year, and that implies a lifecycle of over 20 years, considering the size of our portfolio. So, we are pretty comfortable that process can continue. It moves around a little bit, depending upon of course the rental market strength. And we constantly are looking and making sure we are achieving our expectations. But, there is no reason to believe that our unit turn program would slow down in the coming years. As it relates to larger projects, we have several going that are listed that are doing well. And again, there is probably -- what, four properties that are specifically outlined, and that pipeline should continue as well. The asset\u2019s age, we look for opportunities to do more robust upgrades to the asset systems, et cetera., and increase value. So, I don't see our renovation program changing materially over the next couple years.","Rob Stevenson","And then, what\u2019s the current expected stabilized yield on the six properties in your development pipeline?","John Burkart","In the mid-five range.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb from Sandler O'Neill. Please proceed with your question.","Alexander Goldfarb","Two questions here. First, Angela, if we think about the comments you guys spoke about on the outlook for next year, there is $0.10 of lease-up drag potentially from the deliveries; there is other $0.05 to $0.10 of drag from refinancing. But, you guys are always pretty good on growing earnings. But, in total, it sounds like there is upwards of $0.20 of drag for next year. Is that the correct way to think about it or am I not looking at that -- did I not hear correctly?","Angela Kleiman","I think you are thinking of it correctly. What you are thinking of it is the same way I\u2019m thinking of it. And so, although, to the team\u2019s common, operating fundamentals are coming in as we expect, there are other sectors impacting FFO. And financing and dilution as it relates to timing of development and lease-up are two important factors. ","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. And then, Mike, on the supplemental page where you provide 2019 outlook, I don\u2019t if that's markets in general or you are specifically providing Essex revenue or rent projections. But, suffice it to say, you are looking at 3 -- call it 3% rent growth for next year on that age. And this year, rents are up 2.3%, revenues up 2.8%. It sounds like the environment for next year isn\u2019t going to be too dissimilar revenue-wide for this year, given that occupancy sounds like on the whole will be flat. Is that a fair way to think about it that revenue next year is really that 3% level or could we see occupancy improved that you might exceed that 3% level?","Michael Schall","Alex, this is Mike, and we're not going to morph into a guidance conversation here. But let me just clarify what we mean and our market forecast. So, S-16, our economic rent growth represents in these submarkets, not for Essex but for the broader submarket what we think market rents will do in each of these areas. So, our portfolio can vary from that by some amount. And depending upon where it is, depending upon its competitive within the marketplace et cetera, and so our actual revenue results can be different. And again, this is for the entire year. So, how it breaks down the rent growth curve, it's not a flat line straight up during the year. It tends to be strong in the earlier part of the year, and weaker in the end of the year. And so, there could be variations in these numbers. And I'll leave it at that. And I will be giving guidance at some point in time in late January, early February, and we\u2019ll talk about it in much more detail at that time.","John Burkart","And I would just add, Alex, I think you said that occupancy would be flat. That's not what I'm saying. I'm saying occupancy will be a headwind. So, the greatest headwind will be Q1 and Q2 with Q3 and Q4 basically flat. But for the year, it will be a headwind overall. Does that make sense?","Alexander Goldfarb","Yes. Thank you, John and Mike. Thank you for clarifying S-16. That\u2019s helpful on your comments.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rich Hill from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Rich Hill","Just a quick for me. Recognizing that you want to stay away from giving guidance. But if you could think about -- if you could consider the impacts of higher anticipated supply or slower than anticipated job growth as maybe the biggest risks your market forecast for economic rent growth, which one is that, both maybe to the upside and the downside?","Michael Schall","I think we have the supply pretty well locked down. We could be wrong from quarter-to-quarter, like everyone. And I know everyone has been frustrated with the supply forecast over those past couple of years. But, I think that now we're looking at over broader period of time and it seems to make a reasonable sense to us. So, I would say the greater risk is on the job side. And I would say again, this is -- our forecast on S-16 is a scenario. It begins with what's going in the U.S. and then we have a lot of history with respect to the U.S., the 2.5% GDP and 1.3% job growth. This is what will typically happen in the Essex markets. So, we try to make the jump from what the U.S. does and to what our markets do. But, as you know, given all the geopolitical issues and interest rates rising and other things, the U.S. assumptions can change pretty significantly over time, and they can change at any time really. So, it tended to be a scenario that begins with the strength of U.S. economy and it rolls down into what that means for the Essex metros. Does that make sense?","Rich Hill","IT does. That's helpful. And are there any markets where you think you might have greater variability than other, either to the upside or the downside?","Michael Schall","Well, I think that Seattle has always been challenging. I think that we have beat up Seattle historically over the last several years much greater, outperformed with what our expectations have been. But, it is more challenging just because if you look at the amount of supply that it produces, 1.8% versus about 1% in northern California and 0.7% in Southern California, there is a greater degree of variability there. So, we could be wrong. The higher of the supply number typically, the more wrong you could be. So, I would point to Seattle.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Hardik Goel from Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question.","Hardik Goel","In your supply outlook, you guys noted that you are adjusting for delays this time. Could you give us some insight into your process, just bottoms up, what it was before and how it's changed, and how you are actually accounting for those delays in supply?","John Burkart","Sure. This is John. So, on a process from process perspective, we drive every single site and we have been short where it's at, what we think is going to happen, and we do this on a regular basis. And we are obviously looking at all the other information that's out there. So, we feel we have a great database of the various sites and where they are at. What\u2019s been a challenge is really trying to understand where they are at, when they are going to actually finish, when they are going to come to completion. And part of that issue relates to the fact that if you look in the building from the outside, you can't tell exactly where things are, how far along the building is. And so, we are relying to some extent on conversations we have with developers or other people to try to gather information to really focusing on that side. What we\u2019ve done in the sense of our adjustments is we looked at how often we were right and where the -- how long the delays actually have been on an asset by asset basis and came up with the track record. And if that track record that we then applied to all these deals and so we look and said, if on average we are missing it by several months, which is really the case, we made those adjustments. So, that\u2019s what's going -- based on our track record, as we drive all the sites and are looking back and seeing how accurate have we been on the timing, what's the normal delay been, and we applied it equally across the board. Does that make sense?","Hardik Goel","That makes a lot of sense.","Michael Schall","Let me add one more thing to that. I think that what has typically happened, we\u2019ve seen out there and some of the data providers is when some doesn\u2019t get delivered in Q1, it gets pushed to Q2 and Q2 to Q3 and you end up with lump of supply that is going to ultimately get done in Q4. And then, of course, if that doesn\u2019t happen, it gets pushed to the next year. So, that's been sort of the process that started what John just talked about. You end up -- it ends up being very confusing because you have a very large number in Q4 which doesn\u2019t get delivered, which then makes to next year, start out with a very large number, and it confuses the entire picture. So, we are trying to cut through all that and create something that is hopefully more sustainable and more accurate.","Hardik Goel","That\u2019s really helpful. We can certainly appreciate the challenges. Just one follow-up to that. What is your radius like? I hope, John, you\u2019re not having to drive around all of Southern California and Northern California. How do you decide this asset is within our comparability set?","John Burkart","So, although I do a lot of driving, there\u2019s a whole team of people in the research department that do the specifics, and they have actually a mobile database that they log into, check things out. So, what they\u2019re doing is they\u2019re actually driving the entire MD. So, they\u2019re looking at everything out in that area to understand exactly what\u2019s going on. Again, we don\u2019t look at it and say, here\u2019s an asset that we\u2019re going to go within 3 miles, and different people have different ways of doing it. We look at the whole supply-demand picture, and we make an assessment according to that. So, we\u2019re looking at all assets that are 50 units and up, driving those assets in the MD, seeing where they\u2019re at and factoring that in. Obviously from an operational perspective, we have individual operational asset reports that research department creates and enables us to better understand what supply is going to impact what assets and therefore adjust pricing strategies. But from a big picture from the economic perspective, we\u2019re looking at the whole MD, each of the MDs, seeing there\u2019s a lot of work in this area.","Hardik Goel","Got it. That sounds really good. That actually tells about data. That\u2019s all from me.","John Burkart","We talked about it. You\u2019re looking at it right now for free on S-16.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson from Mizuho Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Rich Anderson","Hey, Mike, have you given any thoughts or plan B, say, Costa-Hawkins gets repealed, or are you not even going there right now? In another words, what do you do?","Michael Schall","We always have a plan B. But keep in mind that we operate in 70 different cities in California. So, we\u2019re more diversified than you might think. And as you know, probably the greatest risks are in the more urban type location. And we are a mix of urban and suburban, I think somewhere around 10% of our properties actually are in the urban core. So, we think that there\u2019s just an inherent sort of safety in the portfolio. And I commented previously about concentrations. There\u2019s only 4 cities where we have more than 2,000 units. And so, again, we\u2019re pretty diverse. And so, we\u2019re not hugely impacted under any scenario, although we do look at -- we do have a contingency plan that might target a few cities that we\u2019re most concerned about. So, I wouldn't say we wouldn\u2019t do anything, but I would say that our feeling is we\u2019re pretty well positioned overall.","Rich Anderson","No home properties in your future, I am gathering, use that as an example?","Michael Schall","Probably not. I mean, we did track other metros because we want to make sure that the West Coast is competitive with some of the eastern metros for sure. And like job growth in certain of the eastern metros or pretty appealing of late, but it's really trying to confirm whether our existing property profile is appropriate given the broader U.S. landscape. So, it\u2019s sort of confirmatory. And based on that, looking at supply and demand dynamics, we feel good about the West Coast.","Rich Anderson","And then, just related, what percentage of your portfolio is condo maps, just as a reminder? And is it concentrated in some of those urban areas where perhaps should Costa-Hawkins gets repealed that certain municipalities would be inclined to follow the rent control sort of mentality. Can you comment on how and where they are at?","Michael Schall","I can. Roughly 8,600 units in California are condo and then condo mapping in Seattle is easier than it is in California. In California, if you don't have condo map coming out of the gate, you\u2019re unlikely to get one unless -- may take you many years in order to get one. So, 8,600 of our California portfolio would be the condo map, 15% to 16%. And they tend to be in more of the urban core.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay from RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Wes Golladay","I was looking for an update in San Jose, more in particular that large lease at Santa Clara Square. Has that impacted the market and how do you model that delivery and job the next few years?","John Eudy","This is John Eudy. We open that right after the first of the year, as you\u2019re probably aware. And it\u2019s a pretty deep market, a lot of Sunnyvale product burned off on the inventory this year. And we think it's well-positioned to have a pretty good start, come late Q1. ","Wes Golladay","And then, going back to the condo mapping question, would you look to convert the condos as more of a defense for a potential repeal of Prop 10?","John Eudy","We have maps on, like Mike said, roughly 8,600 units, most of which are urban core units we have been developing last 15 years. And we\u2019re always looking at the metrics between NAV value, condo conversion versus as an apartment. So, that optionality is there. We\u2019ll make the right decision at the right time.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Pawlowski from Green Street Advisors. Please proceed with your question.","John Pawlowski","Mike, I understand your comments about the transaction market, only seeing a slowdown in volume, no impact on pricing and high-risk cities of rent control. There is a very real chance, this comes on Costa-Hawkins on a 2020 ballot as well. So, any conversations you and John are having that suggest that the transaction market slowdown cloud be more multiyear in nature and not exactly everything continues on after November 6?","Michael Schall","John, it\u2019s Mike. It\u2019s a good question. And honestly, we don't know the answer. As you guys actually pointed out, there is a lot of money in private hands looking for yield. And it\u2019s there, it\u2019s not going away probably anytime soon. So, how much we will transact given the amount of money, searching for quality apartment deals, obviously remains to be seen. I guess, I\u2019m -- I wouldn't be as maybe dire as you\u2019re suggesting as it relates to the transaction market. I mean, conditions can go on a lot longer than we might think before pricing or you see that for you. It would be a guess and I would be speculating. So, I think I will probably just leave it at that. I think that there is no reason to believe that things will change overnight. They generally take significant amount of time to change. And I would guess that it would be at the very earliest, sometime a year from now or something like that. ","John Pawlowski","Okay. On Seattle, and I know this market rent forecast. The acceleration you're calling for in terms of economic rent growth from 2% to 2.9%, are you seeing any leading indicators within your portfolio in Seattle that suggest market rent growth is stabilizing because the pace of deceleration we\u2019re seeing in Seattle you and your peers reports have been pretty persistent deceleration. So, wondering what really causes the conviction and the 100 bps acceleration in market rent growth next year?","John Burkart","What we're seeing to start with on the supply side is, we see the fourth quarter is being pretty heavy with, so that'll be a tough fourth quarter for us now. And then Q1 and Q2, also significant, little bit less and then lightening up quite a bit in Q3 and Q4 in Seattle. We also, when we're looking at where we were for, we're talking to acceleration we have in rent growth this year in S-16, just projecting into \u201819. We're seeing right now on job growth that as I mentioned earlier is that 3.7%, very high job growth this year for the third quarter compared that to last year, last year was a low point. Last year we were down by about 50 basis points -- sorry \u201817, we were down about 50 basis points in job growth and that impacted our \u201818 number. This point being up in job growth in \u201818 and doing -- being very strong, that will actually benefit the \u201819 rental market. There is a little bit of delay between job growth and the rental market. So, it's really that combination of better employment this year with declining supply that will get us to our rent growth numbers. It will be a little tough in the middle though. The fourth quarter is going to be challenge. I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be noteworthy.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Schall","We may have lost Tayo.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Karin Ford from MUFG Securities.","Karin Ford","I know we focused a lot on the occupancy comps for next year but I just want to make sure I understand the rent growth that's earned in from the past leasing season. You said new leases were up 3.5 and renewals were up 4.2 I think in the third quarter. Is that correct? And so, we\u2019re looking at high 3 I guess kind of level of earned in rent growth from the peak leasing season, heading into \u201819, is that correct?","Michael Schall","Well, Q3 was strong and that\u2019s what I was trying to articulate that, and part of that relates to the curve changing a bit. 2018 was a normal seasonal pattern and comparing that to 2017 gave us kind of a big pop in Q3. As we go to Q4, we will face more pressure. And loss to lease will largely dry up. And so when you look at \u201818 -- \u201819, we're not giving guidance but we're not in those -- in the high numbers that you talked about. We\u2019ll have the headwinds from the occupancy with the solid rental market, and we'll give guidance later on.","Karin Ford","And could you just remind us what percentage of your lease you signed in 3Q?","Michael Schall","Yes. I think we had roughly 14% turnover if my memory is right, 6,500 leases and something like that overall. It\u2019s the bigger percentage, it\u2019s meaningful but it\u2019s not -- we still signed quite a few in Q1 and Q4.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I would like to turn the call back to Michael Schall for closing remarks.","Michael Schall","Thank you, Dana. Thank you for your participation on the call today.

As a reminder, today\u2019s conference call is being recorded. Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs as well as information available to the company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found on the company\u2019s filings with the SEC. [Operator Instructions] ","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you. Mr. Schall, you may begin.","Michael Schall","Thank you for joining us today, and welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call. John Burkart and Angela Kleiman will follow me with comments, and John Eudy is here for Q&A. I will comment on three topics: our first quarter results and outlook for 2018, regulatory matters and investment markets. Our first quarter results were stronger than expected, with significant improvement from a challenging second half of 2017. As note at the Citigroup conference in March, these results were better than our 2018 plan because of higher occupancy and other income, which John will discuss in a moment.","Market rents for our portfolio grew 3.8% from year-end to the end of the first quarter versus 3.1% in the same period last year and are mostly consistent with our market rent growth expectations for the year. Job growth was relatively stronger in the first quarter, with Essex markets achieving 2.2% job growth on a trailing 3-month basis versus the U.S. average of 1.5%, with most of the outperformance emanating from the tech markets. This growth is notable considering the tight labor market conditions, which are demonstrated by ultralow unemployment rates, averaging 3.4% in the Essex markets and 4.1% for the U.S. We are encouraged by the strong start to the year and we\u2019ll reevaluate our MSA forecast on Page S-16 of the supplemental next quarter.","The positive job growth has been achieved in part from migration from other areas, indicating the ability of local employers to source and retain skilled workers. The Bay Area continues to be a net attractor of talent, especially from high-cost East Coast metros. This trend is highlighted in the monthly workforce report published by LinkedIn, which details migration patterns of workers within LinkedIn\u2019s network of more than 130 million users in the U.S.","On Page 16 S-16.1 of the supplemental, we have reproduced a visual from the report that illustrates migration in and out of the Bay Area over the past 12 months. This supports our view that the number of educated workers moving into the Bay Area continues to outweigh the number departing. The Bay Area and Seattle remain among the most innovative and dynamic economies in the world, which compete successfully for high skilled workers. Wage growth continues to improve as the skilled labor shortage intensifies. Estimated personal income growth for 2018 for our West Coast metros ranges from 4.6% to 6.5% compared to 4.1% for the nation. Affordability pressures are relieved when wage growth exceeds rent growth as it has recently. This has led to a reduction in rent-to-income ratios year-over-year in all of the Essex metros. As cited in the Wall Street Journal, a recent study by Up for Growth National Coalition analyzed America\u2019s housing shortage and proposed potential solutions. The study acknowledged the widespread nature of housing shortages for the U.S. in the 15-year period ending in 2015 affecting 23 states.","In total, the study indicates the nation has produced roughly 7 million fewer housing units than needed to keep up with economic growth over that period. California, in particular, has the largest shortfall, consisting of nearly half of the total under produced housing or roughly 3.4 million housing units. The chronic shortage of housing in California and related problems of traffic congestion and long commutes remain key issues on the West Coast.","Turning to supply. Our multi-family supply projections for the Essex markets remain unchanged on S-16 of the supplemental, and the impact of deliveries across submarkets vary widely. As a result, we continue to expect periodic disruption to pricing power and stabilized communities when the -- when multiple lease-ups in a submarket offer concessions exceeding 6 weeks of rent. At this point, we expect supply to be mostly flat in 2019 versus 2018 with an increasing share concentrated in downtown submarkets.","Factoring in shortages of labor, strict land-use regulations, construction costs rising faster than rents and more conservative construction lending, residential construction appears to be slowing even though permits have continued at a strong pace. We are seeing many examples of residential developments being put on hold as the economics don\u2019t pencil. This supports our belief that the construction pipeline has peaked in our markets and supply will slowly taper off over the next several years.","On to my second topic, regulatory matters. I wanted to provide an update on California\u2019s proposed referendum that seeks to repeal the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act that will likely appear on the November 2018 ballot. As you may recall, Costa-Hawkins, in part, restricts local jurisdictions from enacting rent control on any apartments completed after February 1995 and mandates that vacated apartments be priced at market rates.","When the law was created in 1995, a primary consideration was that cities with extreme forms of rent control, including San Francisco, Berkeley and Santa Monica, produced minimal housing -- minimal rental housing after enacting rent control ordinances in the 1970. In passing Costa-Hawkins, California\u2019s legislature thought to increase the production of rental housing to counter shortages and affordability issues, especially in cities that failed to contribute to the housing needs of the state. The California legislature recently considered Assembly Bill 1506, which like the proposed ballot measure would have repealed Costa-Hawkins. AB 1506 did not get passed the committee level in 2017 and again earlier this year.","We believe that the legislature clearly understands that abolishing Costa-Hawkins could result in even greater shortages of housing in California, which could be a major headwind to business expansion, and thus, economic growth. The significant issues and unintended consequences of rent control have been researched and documented in great detail by the academic community and California\u2019s government. This includes a 2017 study of San Francisco rent control by the faculty of Stanford University and a 2016 report by the Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office. These studies conclude that rent control is a contributing factor to housing affordability issues, mostly due to shortages of housing. Rather than elaborate here, we refer you to links to both studies on the Internet at savecostahawkins.org. We will continue to provide periodic updates on regulatory issues in the future.","And my third topic, investment markets. The demand for apartment property remains healthy. And as a result, we have seen no change to cap rates in our markets despite higher interest rates. For example, we are currently in contract on a disposition that is likely to close in the second quarter at a low 4% cap rate. This transaction and other recent sales support our belief that cap rates have not changed. A quality property and locations continue to transact around the 4% to 4.25% cap rate used in the Essex methodology. B quality assets and locations are generally 25 to 50 basis points higher, though often contemplate upside from redevelopment and\/or value-add activities.","As noted last quarter, we continue to see a slowdown in the preferred equity pipeline. This is consistent with my earlier comments that cost increases represent a headwind to new development. We continue to believe that we will be close to our target for preferred equity commitments this year. As of quarter end, our total commitments for preferred equity and subordinated debt investments aggregated 395 million.","That concludes my comments. Thank you for joining the call today, and I will turn the call over to John.","John Burkart","Thank you, Mike. We\u2019re off to a good start in 2018 with year-over-year NOI growth of 3.6% and revenue growth of 3.3% for the first quarter. Our strong revenue growth was favorably impacted by an additional 60 basis points of occupancy over the prior year\u2019s period and higher-than-expected utility reimbursements due to timing and increases in the underlying utility expenses. Strategic adjustments made by the operations team led to increased occupancy through the promotion of short-term lease extensions, which led to fewer move-outs and an increase in month-to-month leases.","Turnover in our portfolio dropped to 40% on an annualized basis in the first quarter of 2018 compared to 46% in the prior year. Part of the reduced turnover relates to the Executive Order signed by Governor Brown as a result of the devastating California wildfires, which effectively limited rent increases on all California housing to 10% above the price in place when the order was signed in October of 2017. It has been extended for selected counties directly impacted by the wildfires through the end of the year. We are working to ensure that we comply with the law where applicable, and we expect that it will impact operations in selected markets.","Our operations strategy will continue to change with the market conditions. As we enter peak leasing season, we expect occupancy to decrease while turnover increases, as is typical for this time of year. Preliminary April 2018 results already show that our strategy is playing out as our year-over-year financial occupancy is only 30 basis points over the prior year\u2019s period versus 60 basis point increase we achieved in Q1. In April, scheduled rent grew at approximately 2.3% and gross revenues grew at approximately 2.7%. April results indicate a sequential decline in revenues, a significant but expected slowdown from the first quarter. Overall, the Essex markets are performing as expected with Seattle a little weaker and SoCal a little stronger versus our expectations.","Moving forward, we expect to see more typical seasonal pattern in rent growth, which is assumed as part of our 2018 forecast. Now I\u2019ll provide an update on our markets. In Seattle, job growth continued to be the strongest in the Essex portfolio, posting year-over-year growth of 3.2% for the first quarter of 2018. This is the highest growth the region has seen since the third quarter of 2016. However, the impact to supply is evident in the rental market. Rents in March 2018 are slightly below where they were in the prior year\u2019s period, and there was a gain to lease of 1.1% as compared to a 3.1% loss to lease at the same time last year. In Downtown Seattle, WeWork signed leases totaling 250,000 square feet. On the east side, Microsoft continued to expand their footprint in Downtown Redmond. Seattle MD has roughly 4.8 million square feet or 5% of the space currently under construction, nearly half of which is already preleased. Seattle median home prices continued to gain momentum, increasing almost 17% year-over-year for the month of March, making it the second fastest-growing region in the Essex portfolio, only surpassed by Bay Area markets. Our year-over-year same-store revenues for the first quarter of 2018 were 4.8% in the CBD, 4.2% in the east side submarkets while the north and south submarkets grew by 5.1% and 5.4%, respectively.","Moving on to Northern California. In the first quarter of 2018, job growth in San Francisco Bay Area averaged 2.4% year-over-year with roughly 75,000 jobs added. San Jose led the way with 2.9% job growth while Oakland and San Francisco were up 2% and 1.7%, respectively. Market rents in the Bay Area were up 2.5% in March over the prior year\u2019s period leading to a loss to lease of 2.2%. In San Francisco, WeWork continued their growth trend, signing the largest year-to-date lease in the city for 250,000 square feet in the downtown area. Moving down to the South Bay. Facebook preleased 1 million square feet of planned office space in Sunnyvale. Google continued to acquire land near the Diridon Station, purchasing a site approved to build 1 million square feet of office space. In total, the company has invested roughly $300 million in that central San Jose submarket. Additionally, Google continues to expand in the Silicon Valley submarkets, having purchased 3 industrial buildings in North San Jose and 2 additional properties in San Jose and Mountain View. Silicon Valley and San Francisco markets have approximately 9 million square feet of office space or 6% of the total office stock under construction. Roughly two thirds of which is preleased. Median home prices in the Bay Area continued to soar, led by San Francisco and San Jose gaining approximately 20% and 33%, respectively, in March 2018 over the prior year\u2019s period. The San Francisco and San Jose median home prices are now over 30% higher than their prior peaks in 2007. During the quarter, we started a lease-up of Station Park Green Phase 1, located in San Mateo with six-week concessions on selected units. As of April 26, we are 40% leased. Our year-over-year same-store revenue growth for the first quarter of 2018 was led by our Fremont and Oakland submarkets with 4.8% and 4.0%, respectively.","Heading down to Southern California. Job growth in Los Angeles County in the first quarter of 2018 averaged 1.5% year-over-year, which was in line with the U.S. Market rents increased 2.3% in March over the prior year\u2019s period and loss to lease was 1.6%. Leasing activity by tech and entertainment companies remained strong in West LA with several leases from high-profile tenants, including another lease by Amazon Studios, expanding their Culver City presence for content production.","As discussed last quarter, the downtown CBD submarket continues to be challenged with elevated levels of supply, causing our same-store LA CBD revenues to decline 1.1% in the first quarter of 2018. However, other Essex submarkets less impacted by the downtown supply performed much better in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the prior year\u2019s quarter with revenue growth ranging from 2.7% in Long Beach to 5.1% in Woodland Hills. ","In Orange County, job growth improved in the first quarter to 1.9% year-over-year, a 20 basis point increase from Q4. The impact on supply on market rent is evident with market rents only increasing 70 basis points in March over the prior year\u2019s period and loss to lease was 40 basis points. ","Finally, the San Diego MSA continued to perform well, recording year-over-year job growth of 1.9% in the first quarter of 2018. Market rents increased 2.1% in March over the prior year\u2019s period and loss to lease was 1.4%. Revenue growth in the first quarter of 2018 was between 3.6% in Chula Vista to 5% in the Oceanside submarkets on a year-over-year basis. Currently, our portfolio is at 96.8% occupancy and our availability 30 days out is at 4.5%. Our renewals are being sent out at about 4% for the second quarter overall.","Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Angela Kleiman.","Angela Kleiman","Thank you, John. I will start by discussing our first quarter results and increase to the full year guidance, followed by recent investment and capital markets activities and conclude with a balance sheet update. For the quarter, core FFO exceeded the midpoint of our guidance by $0.05 per share. This is outlined on Page 4 of our press release. $0.02 of the outperformance is related to timing of operating and G&A expenses and is not expected to reoccur. The remaining $0.03 resulted from revenue growth realized during the quarter primarily due to our occupancy strategy, as John commented earlier. With this backdrop to our first quarter performance, we now expect the first half of 2018 property -- same-property revenue growth to be higher than the second half of the year. Also in the first quarter, we declared a quarterly common dividend of $1.86 per share, which is a 6.3% year-over-year increase. This represents 24 consecutive years of dividend growth and keeps us on track to become a dividend aristocrat in 2019.","Moving on to the 2018 guidance. We are increasing the midpoint of same-property revenue growth guidance for the year by 15 basis points, thereby increasing the NOI growth by 20 basis points to 2.7% at the midpoint. This increase is primarily driven by first quarter performance, which also enable us to raise core FFO guidance by $0.02 per share to $12.46 at the midpoint.","For the second quarter, we are forecasting core FFO per share of $3.05 at the midpoint, which is $0.04 lower than the first quarter. This is largely caused by two factors. First, interest expense will be higher in the second quarter due to the $300 million bond issuance closed in March, which had little impact to the first quarter results. And second, we are anticipating lower NOI growth in the second quarter as we shift strategy to favoring rent growth over occupancy coupled with higher operating expenses as we enter the peak leasing season. Note that both items are timing related and are consistent with our plans for the full year.","Turning to investments and capital market activities. During the quarter, we continue to enhance shareholder returns through our joint venture platform with the amendment of BEXAEW entity by realizing a $20.5 million promote income. Last year, we stated our plan to monetize the embedded value within our private equity platform. Since then, I\u2019m pleased to report that we have monetized nearly $60 million of promote income. This is consistent with our track record of structuring unique transactions to maximize value while maintaining a disciplined and thoughtful approach to capital allocation.","Lastly, onto the balance sheet. During the quarter, we issued $300 million of 30-year unsecured bonds at a 4.5% coupon. The proceeds from the bond offering were used to repay secured debt maturities in 2018. With this offering, we have completed the most significant refinancing needs for the year. ","As Mike mentioned earlier, we are under contract to sell one property. The proceeds from that sale will substantially provide for our 2018 development projects. Therefore, our need for additional capital in 2018 is de minimis, subject to new investment opportunities. With $1.2 billion of availability on our line of credit and 26% leverage and limited near-term debt maturities, our balance sheet continues to be strong and well positioned.","That concludes my comments, and I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions and answers.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Rich Hill from Morgan Stanley.","Rich Hill","I want to go back to one of the comments that you mentioned at the very beginning about population migrations. It\u2019s one of the first times that I\u2019ve heard you or your peers talk about this, and I\u2019m sorry if I missed you talking about it previously. But I was hoping you could elaborate on that a little bit more. We\u2019ve heard some comments that San Francisco just doesn\u2019t have enough people moving there, and so I\u2019m curious how sustainable do you think those population migration trends are. And obviously, it\u2019s probably a little bit of a zero-sum game. So are they moving from one market to another market? How are you thinking about this?","Michael Schall","Rich, thanks for the question. I think it was invigorating. And I\u2019m playing off of some of the other comments that were made on some other calls. But no, what we\u2019re trying to demonstrate is whether the West Coast metros are competitive with the East Coast metros, and that may be countering some of the facts that you see out there with respect to U-Haul rates in and out of California and similar type things.","What we think is happening is that we are attracting more than our fair share of the more skilled, highly skilled and highly compensated worker and perhaps losing some of the lower skilled and lower compensated workers, and we think that\u2019s a normal process, normal evolution. And we\u2019re obviously very concerned about whether our metros are competitive with other metros around the U.S. because employers have choices about where they\u2019re going to locate. And so the competitiveness of the U.S% of the California markets are really important. And so we look for evidence that supports that basic thesis, and the LinkedIn information seemed to make a lot of sense.","And if you go into the report we\u2019ve published on S-16.1, the San Francisco metro movement in and out, but they go beyond that and they look at some other metros as well. So you can go, on to that report. But it really comes back to are these metros, the West Coast metros, competitive, are people willing to come here. And obviously, housing costs matter, but also compensation and opportunity matter as well. And making sure that we\u2019re competitive with respect to that is something that we think is really important.","Rich Hill","And just one quick follow-up question. I think it\u2019s an important distinction, but are you guys seeing these population migrations because of jobs? Or is there job growth because of population migrations?","Michael Schall","Well, I think it\u2019s a bunch of different things. I think competitiveness of the industry is where the best opportunities are being created, and that\u2019s why we think that the West Coast metros and specifically the tech markets, when you look at the job growth that was created, the outperformance of jobs relative to what our expectations were this year, it\u2019s clear that the tech metros are attracting a lot of talent and bringing people here, confirmed by the commercial construction in the San Francisco, San Jose and Seattle metro areas, the office construction being a pretty good proxy for what\u2019s going to happen a year or two down the road. So again, we\u2019re looking for things that confirm whether the West Coast metros are attractive. And obviously, migration patterns, job growth, all these things put together to determine whether these metros are being successful and competing for talent.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nick Joseph from Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","Nick Joseph","Maybe just following up on that. Looking at out-migration from San Francisco, do the trends make you consider expansion in the Portland, Denver, Austin? And then what would you need to see to decide to expand?","Michael Schall","Clearly, Denver has -- is, I think, attractive. There have been a number of other multi-family companies that have made movements into that market. We have been invested in Portland, and we are looking at that once again. It\u2019s a relatively small market. And the cost of for-sale housing is less expensive, and therefore, the transition from a renter to a homeowner can be a little bit of a headwind, and actually, I\u2019d say both Denver and in the Portland market. I mean, our basic mandate is go to areas that have the don\u2019t produce enough housing and where the housing choices, for-sale housing versus rental, that the for-sale side makes it a challenge to transition from a renter to a homeowner. So that has been -- served us well over a long period of time. Those are the markets we primarily look for. And so there are a couple of markets that are interesting. But I think that they would be a step-down relative to what we have in the markets where we\u2019re currently invested in.","Nick Joseph","And then if Costa-Hawkins were to be repealed and I recognize that rent control is not immediately enacted, how do you think about your current portfolio positioning in terms of cities more prone to enacting rent control? And then is there anything you can do to proactively mitigate any impact?","Michael Schall","John Eudy is here. I\u2019ll make a couple of comments. And if John wants to add to it, that would be great. It\u2019s obviously virtually impossible to determine the financial impact of Costa-Hawkins. Obviously, Costa-Hawkins would enable local jurisdictions to adopt rent control measures. And we don\u2019t know which cities might do that nor do we know the severity of their rent control ordinance. So without those 2, it would be very difficult to determine the impact. I think that as the old saying goes, as California goes, so goes the nation. And we may be the leader with respect to some of these rent control issues, but I don\u2019t think that we\u2019re the end of that. There was a proposal in Washington as well to repeal the statewide ban on rent control. We\u2019ve seen that in a number of other states. So I think this is part of a broader trend. And so we\u2019re -- it\u2019s not something that is going to immediately cause us to change direction with respect to our portfolio allocations.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Spector from Bank of America.","Jeff Spector","My first question is on supply. I feel like your comments on \u201819, I think you said basically equal to \u201818, is that new? I thought previously you were saying down, maybe even last quarter you said down 25%. Has that changed?","Michael Schall","We worked down 25% last quarter. And so it was a smaller number but we did think it was declining next year relative to 2018. I think what happens is you get to the end of the year and we moved about almost 4,000 units from 2017 to 2018. And we have not yet moved units from 2019 to 2020 assuming that these delays continue, which is probably likely. And so again, we talked on the last call and have talked more recently about the difficulty in pinpointing exactly when the deliveries happen and how they play out. So we are -- so there could be a small decrease in 2019. We\u2019re just not sure. The numbers are really hard to pin down. And therefore, our best guess is that over the next couple of years -- we\u2019re looking at permits as well. Over the next couple of years that there will be a reduction, a slowdown, but it will be relatively small. We don\u2019t see any major drop-offs, although there are pretty significant increases and decreases if you look at each metro. And for example, the Bay Area will be down in \u201818 and it will grow a little bit in \u201819. And so those types of variations will happen. So we think the trend is still down. We think that a lot of the permits are likely to get pushed back given the comments we made earlier about the relationship between rents growing somewhere around 3% and construction costs growing in the high single, low double-digit range. That obviously is not a good thing for residential construction. And so we think the trend is down but probably not by huge amounts.","Jeff Spector","Okay. And then my follow-up is just trying to get a feel for 2Q and peak leasing season given the strength that you saw in 1Q. And I know you\u2019ve said in the past that 1Q typically sets up 2Q, 3Q. Would it be fair to say at this point are you driving rents in your markets as we enter April -- as we finish April and enter May? Can you say any general comments?","John Burkart","Yes. This is John speaking. So as I mentioned earlier, we gave out some information on April, and things are playing out as we expected. We are following the market. Now the market overall, big picture for the portfolio was up a little bit less than 2% year-over-year, so April \u201818 over April \u201817. And we\u2019re making the best of our situation there as we follow the market. It\u2019s working out according to plan. We reduced our vacancy as we\u2019re looking to optimize our position. The markets are solid. We\u2019re expecting that this year, we have a standard seasonal pattern whereas, last year, we had a -- the markets peaked a little bit early. So this year, we expect the seasonal pattern to be normal. We were benefiting a little bit by going into the peak leasing with higher occupancy, which was ultimately part of our plan to do what we could do to position our portfolio well to maximize our returns this year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Austin Wurschmidt from KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Austin Wurschmidt","With respect to kind of the expectation for the standard seasonal pattern in the back half of the year and you referenced significant improvement early in the year versus the second half of last year, how should we think about the deceleration throughout the year? And when would you anticipate stabilization in sort of the second derivative of revenue growth in the second half this year?","John Burkart","Sure. Let me try to address that. This is John again. So the big move that you\u2019re going to see is really related to our occupancy. We largely did very well in Q1 because we had higher occupancy, as I mentioned, 60 basis points over the prior year\u2019s quarter. We expect that to go down. Our plan is that our occupancy will be materially consistent with last year at about 96.6%, and so that will be the big change. Our expectations for rents really haven\u2019t changed in our S-16, which is 2% to 3%. And right now, we\u2019re at about 2%. The difference between last year and this year is we do expect the curve or the peak leasing to continue through the midsummer or late summer period as it historically had. And so we\u2019ll start to benefit, we expect, by locking in higher rents, but that really will benefit \u201819, not \u201818. Did that answer your question?","Austin Wurschmidt","Yes. No, I think that covers the gist. And then as far as LA, you mentioned it being a little bit stronger with weakness mostly in the CBD, which probably doesn\u2019t come as a huge surprise. When would you expect some of that supply to leak into West LA? Or would you?","John Burkart","You mean the impact of the supply to leak into West LA?","Austin Wurschmidt","Yes, correct.","John Burkart","Yes. It\u2019s been interesting to watch -- I watch the different submarkets. Obviously, downtown LA has tremendous demand. There\u2019s an awful lot of jobs there and more than there is supply. So the supply -- ultimately, everything will balance itself out. The quality of life in downtown LA continues to improve, and people like that. But there is a lot of supply going in that location right now. Small for the overall county, you\u2019re less than, what, 0.5% overall supply in LA, but nonetheless, a lot of downtown. So they are pulling from different markets. And we\u2019ve watched the impact in different submarkets. It\u2019s interesting that sometimes it will be Pasadena, Glendale area; other times, Torrance area; other times, out in Woodland Hills. It seems to move around. I can\u2019t explain that movement. This quarter, it happens that our Tri-Valley area and Woodland Hills are stronger and the Long Beach area is a little bigger. But it does seem to move around. So we\u2019re actually seeing the impact of that over the last 1.5 years or so kind of rotating in the different markets. But in the end, again, the demand is significantly in excess of supply for the overall market. So it\u2019s just a matter of people making adjustments in their lives and moving downtown, which is a very desirable place and getting better and better each day.","Austin Wurschmidt","So I think you referenced last quarter 77% of the new supply is West LA and downtown. How does your portfolio break out into kind of those two submarkets, I guess, and then versus the supply broken out between those two submarkets?","John Burkart","I don\u2019t have the numbers exactly in front of me, but it\u2019s -- a big portion of our portfolio is impacted by the downtown as well as the West LA. No doubt about it, and that\u2019s why I had brought that up last time. So yes, we are impacted. You see that in our numbers, no doubt about it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dennis McGill from Zelman & Associates.","Dennis McGill","First question, just want to go back to the comments on the same-store revenue growth. Last quarter, you had said that the first half of the year would be weaker than the second half of the year, and then that flipped today. But it sounds like the approach you took on occupancy is exactly what you expected going into the quarter. So can you maybe just bridge what drove the difference in the cadence for the year?","Michael Schall","Sure. So our expectations for market rents, we\u2019re just trailing a little bit in where we expect the market rents to be. Our expectations on scheduled rent, the rent roll, are really spot on. The real big change was in occupancy, and that all really came together at the end of the year as a combination of factors from concession strategy that we launched as well as working to ensure that we do whatever we can from a community perspective as it relates to the fires, related to the Executive Order that was signed and, of course, comply with the laws. So all that together meant that we ended up lowering our prices on a month-to-month and increasing our month-to-month about 1.3% across the portfolio as well as we restricted renewal.","And again, I mentioned on my comments that our turnover went from 46% down to 40%. So all of that kind of came together from the end of the year and then into the first quarter and gave us a benefit of the occupancy. But the market overall is really operating consistent with our expectations and our scheduled rent is. At this point in time, we\u2019re watching as we expect our occupancy decline. And so it\u2019s really not a change in our expectations for the year. It\u2019s just we ended up with some extra occupancy Q1 and adjusted our guidance accordingly.","Dennis McGill","And then bigger-picture question just on the supply dynamic. You noted the new supply not penciling or new opportunities not penciling, but at the same time, I think you purposely talked to some of those academic studies or I think just what we all realize is the shortage of housing in general. So those two things don\u2019t necessarily seem to go well together. If we have a shortage of housing and I\u2019m on the side of high cost in one form or another, it doesn\u2019t seem like I\u2019m going to lower my cost anytime soon. So what would be the breakage, what causes costs to go down in that environment? Or if I\u2019m a developer, said another way, why wouldn\u2019t I look past those short-term issues if I feel there\u2019s a shortage in front of me?","Michael Schall","We happen to have a developer in the room in Mr. Eudy, so he can answer that. But I would say, John, how many times in the 30 years you and I have worked together have we seen cost overall go down for new development? I mean, I don\u2019t think ever, right?","John Eudy","Well, in the recession, it went down dramatically [indiscernible] the growth in recession...","Michael Schall","Okay. So that\u2019s perhaps the only significant and that was driven mainly by the construction. The general contractors have very little to do and they want to get something started, so they\u2019re willing to do it at very low profit margins. I guess, I contrast that with what see now, which is commercial construction booming, various types of residential booming, dramatic undersupply housing. And that\u2019s driving construction costs again at around this 10% increase, which, again, there\u2019s an imbalance here. And it doesn\u2019t appear that the mend of that issue is anytime or is close to being at hand. So we would agree with you.","Dennis McGill","If you could look at that, those prior cycles, have elevated costs ever been the catalyst to slow supply?","Michael Schall","Of course. Of course. I mean, many times. Many times it\u2019s been -- it\u2019s caused supply issues. And in fact, it usually does when, again, we all realize the development is more risky than just buying buildings and putting a loan on them. And therefore, we require a premium because things don\u2019t always go as we planned them to go in a development deal. And so the question is and I think you\u2019re starting to see that now. When you start having some of these issues, rents don\u2019t grow as fast as you hope or as fast as your pro forma expected and costs are going up, then your margins are being squeezed. Some landowners decide to go ahead at what would be considered to be a subnormal risk premium on those deals that has put more equity into the deal and they make those transactions move forward; as opposed to the other option, which is essentially putting them on hold and hoping that things get better down the road. And so that\u2019s typically what happens. And we\u2019re seeing a number of deals that really from the market-clearing threshold don\u2019t hit the margins -- risk premiums that are typical in the industry, but they\u2019re moving ahead, anyway. I\u2019d say that in general, that is a limited -- that happens on a limited basis and pretty soon people run out of additional equity to throw into their deals to make them work. So I think we\u2019re in that middle ground where the market is trying to deal with these forces, again, construction costs going up faster than rents and NOIs. And so we see deal flowing. That\u2019s the primary reason that we\u2019re looking at preferred equity deals and we\u2019re looking at other development deals. It\u2019s pretty challenging to make a transaction work.","John Eudy","A couple of other comments. At this stage of the cycle, too, exactions and city requirements and takes on -- additional fees tend to go up. So you have that coupled with hard costs and items that Mike mentioned that make it more and more challenging to economic and make a deal make sense.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Drew Babin from Baird.","Alex Kubicek","This is Alex Kubicek on for Drew this morning. My question is a little bit of a follow-up to what we were just talking about with the general transaction market as a whole. It sounds like it\u2019s tough to make things taper and attractive for you. But where do you guys see the incremental opportunities that you guys can take advantage of to hit your 2018 targets for the rest of the year?","Michael Schall","Well, this is Mike, and that\u2019s a great question. It\u2019s a little bit unclear. In the first quarter, obviously, the stock traded off pretty considerably and we thought that the better transaction or the better capital allocation was to buy some shares back. Now that the stock has recovered somewhat, somewhere around NAV, let\u2019s say, ordinarily, we would look more to our co-investment platform in that scenario to make deals work. There were 20 deals in the first quarter that were in our marketplace that would generally have satisfied our overall transaction parameters. So there are deals out there. Again, when we have stock trading at a discount to NAV, we\u2019re going to pursue that as opposed to buying deals at market. And so I guess, where we are now is probably relying on the JV platform to make deals. And if there\u2019s significant changes in either direction, in the stock price, then our expectations can change pretty dramatically and pretty quickly.","Alex Kubicek","Kind of just as a follow-up, do you foresee this Costa-Hawkins uncertainty overhang causing any general shift in the next, call it, nine, 12 months in underwriting expectations on both the acquisition and the disposition side?","Michael Schall","It\u2019s hard to anticipate exactly what\u2019s going to happen there because you have interest rates that are thrown into the equation as well. And interest rates right now, let\u2019s say, where we\u2019ve gone from an environment we had, very strong, significant positive leverage on acquisition transactions to maybe a smidgen of positive leverage. So I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a negative factor, but it\u2019s not a positive factor. I don\u2019t think -- again, 20 transactions, most of them in California that closed in the first quarter, doesn\u2019t seem to indicate that Costa-Hawkins is impacting or concern about Costa-Hawkins is impacting the transaction market. As we get closer to November, perhaps a little bit. But again, it\u2019s still -- Costa-Hawkins does not mean rent control is going to automatically happen. And even if it does happen, the severity of rent control and which cities continues to be notable questions and important questions in the overall dynamics. So I think it\u2019s still a little bit early to tell. And again, I\u2019d just step back from it and look at -- California has huge housing shortage. You have the legislature in this AB 1506 that I talked about on the call that is pretty clearly not -- or concerned about the overall housing shortages in California, and it decided not to push forward with the repeal of Costa-Hawkins. And it seems like there are some forces out there that it\u2019s too early to conclude that it\u2019s going to have pervasive effects. But again, I don\u2019t know at this point in time, and we continue to monitor the situation closely.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb from Sandler O\u2019Neill.","Alexander Goldfarb","Mike, maybe just following up on the rent control. Just one, is it your understanding that single-family rentals would be -- are part of the rent control proposal or they would be separate? And also, from what you guys have -- in your speaking with folks out there in California, what\u2019s your sense if you had to handicap -- is your sense that enough people understand how rent control will actually be a negative as far as curtailing development and raising and increasing un-affordability? Or is your sense from how the polling is going that the sentiment is building to pass an overthrow of Costa-Hawkins?","Michael Schall","Yes. John Eudy is here and he spends a tremendous amount of time and has really led the industry in this discussion. So John, do you want to take that one?","John Eudy","Sure, Mike. First on your first question on single-family, the repeal measure that is going to the ballot, it appears, does include removing the exemption of single-family. So yes, if passed, single-family would be exposed to having rent control applied to it, which is a big -- one of the big proponents for us because it means the majority of the rental units, as you well know, in California are mom-and-pop owned and smaller local-owned entities and they have a lot to lose. And that brings the attention to the ballot measure in a wide way to be in our favor to oppose it. Generally speaking, we\u2019ve been working on this pre-campaign for about 9 months before it officially got put into play in January. And they just recently collected enough signatures to technically qualify this to the Attorney General right now office to get to the final legs by the end of June. ","But we believe from a policy perspective, clearly, the legislature gets it. That\u2019s why it never made it out of committee at AB 1506. And we also know that every academic study that\u2019s ever really been done on rent control understands the unintended consequences that it actually hurts those that it supposedly is intended to help. So we\u2019re pretty encouraged that -- with our initial polling and how we\u2019re going to be managing the campaign. We\u2019re actually going to push this back, and at the same time, come up with, at the tail end, ways to bridge the gap on affordability issues at the lower and middle end of the range because that\u2019s really where the problem is. Rent control per se, the reason Costa-Hawkins was enacted in 1995 was because it stopped housing and the last thing you want to do in housing production. So we\u2019re fairly confident that we\u2019re going to get there and message it through. And if it does go to the ballot, which it appears it will, that we will prevail.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. And then the second question is, you guys mentioned -- John, I think you mentioned that some of the emergency rent -- things are still -- in some -- in effect through the end of the year in some submarkets. But you also mentioned that your policy in the second quarter is going to focus more on boosting rent versus occupancy. So can you just sort of give a color for how much of your portfolio is still impacted by the 10% limit versus how we think about you guys boosting rents and having occupancy drop off in the second quarter?","John Burkart","Sure. Let me give a little bit of a broader answer to that, Alex. First off, the number one county that is impacted that we operate in is in Ventura. So it\u2019s less than 5% of the company that would be directly impacted. However, we\u2019re -- anywhere where we think there would be an impact, we would want to work with the community. It\u2019s what we do. Essex has always been interested in the work with the communities. So if there were assets -- we just haven\u2019t found situations where there\u2019s people that have been impacted by the fire that are moving in or around or near our assets. As it relates to the change, I wouldn\u2019t call it policy, but it\u2019s more of a -- how we operate seasonally. Seasonally, the rents in our market in the portfolio grow from January a low or December a low, up about 5% to 6% and then down -- back down. And so we modify our operational strategy based on the season. And so it\u2019s best to emphasize occupancy during the, you might say, slower season and emphasize meeting the market on rents at the higher season. But again, we\u2019re in a situation where our rents are moving overall, as I mentioned, year-over-year about 2%. We expect them move about 2% or 3% this year. So it\u2019s a minor adjustment, but it will impact our occupancy in Q2. Does that answer your question?","Alexander Goldfarb","Yes. So it\u2019s just Ventura County? That is the only one that is affecting you guys?","John Burkart","It\u2019s the main county. I mean, there\u2019s a few other bits and pieces here and there, but it\u2019s the main thing. Big picture, it\u2019s about under 5%.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI.","Steve Sakwa","A lot of my questions have been asked and answered. I guess, Mike, in Seattle, there\u2019s this head tax that is potentially coming through the legislature, and it seems like Amazon has put the brakes on some development and maybe that\u2019s just posturing on their part. But I\u2019m just curious how you sort of think about that and how you maybe think about some of the risks in Seattle over the next six to 12 months?","Michael Schall","Yes. Steve, that\u2019s a good question. And it seems that Amazon is pushing back pretty hard, has threatened to slow down construction of some office space in Seattle. We have the whole HQ2 thing. I think there was an announcement that they had moved 1,000 jobs to Boston and 3,000 Vancouver or BC. So there\u2019s been a lot of things happening with respect to Amazon.","However, at the same time, we try to track the top 10 tech companies and what they\u2019re doing and how many open positions they\u2019ve had. And they\u2019ve actually added a lot of positions. So Amazon at the end of last quarter had about 4,700 open positions, and that has grown to 6,700. These are in California and Washington only. So we still see a pretty good impact from Amazon. I guess, I\u2019d go back to the Boeing example and say that Boeing and Seattle had a give-and-take relationship, let\u2019s say. And I think that it\u2019s important for any major employer to have options and just so you can make sure that you keep the pressure on the local governmental agencies. I think they\u2019re doing exactly what any major employer would do. Does that help?","Steve Sakwa","Yes. So it doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re overly worried about this head tax, I guess, getting passed that\u2019s slowing job growth. It just sounds like a lot of posturing but ultimately doesn\u2019t maybe create any major headwind to the city?","Michael Schall","Well, I think it\u2019s part of again, just part of a negotiation, right? And so I think when you look at what they actually did, they actually added a couple of thousand jobs, there\u2019s a couple thousand more job openings now this quarter versus a quarter ago. So I\u2019d say that\u2019s generally a positive thing, looking at Amazon specifically.","Steve Sakwa","Okay. And then just to maybe circle back, I know there\u2019s a lot going on in the development side. And just to make sure I understand your views, so you still think supply will kind of be even in \u201819, but that by 2020, you kind of get a bigger falloff just given this rise in construction costs and more limited rent growth? Is that kind of the way you think about it?","Michael Schall","I\u2019d put it maybe a little bit differently. We think that permits can disconnect pretty significantly from what is actually started and delivered. And so we tend to -- because you can stretch out even if you pull a permit and the question is are you pulling a grading permit, are you pulling a zoning permit or a building permit. And we\u2019ve had examples our Hollywood deal, for example, that was picked up as a permitted transaction two years before we got a building permit. So the time lines are much longer on the West Coast. And so what we have learned is we look at permits and try to monitor starts, but we really get involved when something is under construction because we send our econ team out on a job-by-job basis and try to get a good handle for what\u2019s being delivered.","So it\u2019s difficult for me to talk about 2020 at this point in time. Again, I think what I said earlier remains our best estimate that the trend is to go down slowly for supply to come down slowly. But again, it\u2019s a little bit murky and it\u2019s hard to specifically address what\u2019s going to happen unless you\u2019re within that two year window where it\u2019s actually under construction and we can monitor its progress. Again, at the end of last year, we moved almost, what, 4,000 units across our footprint from 2017 to 2018. When you have that much movement, it\u2019s hard to say exactly what\u2019s going to happen when you have less clarity going a year or 2 out. Does that make sense?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay from RBC Capital Markets.","Wes Golladay","I want to go back to that LinkedIn study, just kind of curious what drove it. Were you more concerned about how the Bay Area with all those job openings, with all the office under construction impact labor market? Or you\u2019ve actually seen within your properties an outward migration?","Michael Schall","Wes, it\u2019s Mike, and anyone else can pitch in, too. Again, it was more -- it isn\u2019t anything that we have seen in our properties that\u2019s prompted that. Again, this is a research effort trying to understand the competitiveness of our metros versus other metros in the U.S., recognizing that over the long periods, companies have choices, people have choices, et cetera. And so it really comes back to trying keeping a handle on the competitiveness of our metros relative to other major metros around the U.S. And again -- so we found the LinkedIn study, you have job growth, you have a variety of other indicators that seem to lead us to believe that our metros are pretty competitive and are doing a good job of attracting talented workers, which is our mandate and which is what has allowed us to outperform over a long period of time.","Wes Golladay","And then, I guess, maybe what stood out the most? And it sounds like you feel a little bit better post-study. And I guess, one thing that stood out to me was that it looks like Los Angeles is losing people to the Bay Area. I actually thought it would -- might have done a little bit better concerning all the tech jobs that were going to the Southern California area.","Michael Schall","Yes. On the LinkedIn study, we reproduced what was there. So there\u2019s no -- we haven\u2019t added anything to that. We may have presented it a little bit differently. I guess, as we look at things -- just look at the level of job growth that we have, and again, back to the trailing 3-month numbers where we just did so well in Northern California and Seattle. We did a little bit better in Southern California. We\u2019re 0.2% better on job growth than what our S-16 estimate was, but we\u2019re 0.8% in Northern California and 1.1% better in Seattle. I mean, it just shows that the strength of those markets on the jobs front is pretty exceptional and a lot better than what we expected. And that\u2019s where these companies are adding people and they\u2019re producing the number of products. And it\u2019s a very vibrant situation and I think unlikely to -- that trend is unlikely to change over the next couple of years. It seems like that is where wealth is being created and where companies are really doing well.","Wes Golladay","And I just had one question on development, more so for the private developer. Can you give me an estimate, how much equity they have in the development? And are you starting to see them get squeezed at all with the delays, cost overruns, rising interest rates and probably a little bit below expectations on the underwriting for market rent growth? And if they are getting squeezed, have you changed your criteria for your preferred equity investments?","John Eudy","I\u2019ll answer the first part of that. Yes, the smaller developers are getting squeezed. The equity requirements are close to 50% with construction loans in the 50% to 55% range. And if they went into a deal, assuming cost was going to be X without having it bought out, they\u2019re going to have an equity squeezed n the backside because costs have gone up over the last 18, 20 months, 24 months, as Mike mentioned, in the double-digit range. As far as the preferred equity deals, we\u2019re seeing less opportunities, as Mike mentioned, because of the economics more than anything else, not necessarily anything beyond that. If expectations are development deal needs to be in the 5, 5.25-plus range and they\u2019re really 4 to 4.25, a lot less people transact unless they\u2019re in a position where they need to go. And that\u2019s preferred equity deals that we\u2019ve been focusing on because they are bought in and already funded. They\u2019re just a little bit short on the equity capitalization. We\u2019ll let them put us ahead of them and subordinate their interest and make it so it\u2019s a safer deal from our perspective and still a good transaction although skinnier return on their side.","Michael Schall","Well, I would just add that, keep in mind, these are in our markets. We use our underwriting, so we\u2019re not relying upon the developer\u2019s underwriting. We have obviously a direct development effort, and so we do our own underwriting. This program is enabled because construction lending, again, in the 55% loan, the cost area used to be -- most of our career are somewhere in the 75% plus or minus loan to cost. So that\u2019s what has enabled that program. And so we really haven\u2019t changed how we look at it. But I just want to make it clear that it\u2019s not like we\u2019re taking someone else\u2019s underwriting and then making the investment. We underwrite it based on how we look at the world and consistent with all the other activities around here. So I think we have a big advantage when it comes to deal selection.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Karin Ford from MUFG Securities.","Karin Ford","You mentioned that housing prices continue to soar in many of your submarkets. Has there been any more positive momentum on the condo conversion side for rental?","Michael Schall","Karin, it\u2019s Mike. Yes, we are incrementally more excited about it. And as that differential between apartment values and for-sale values diverges, it becomes more and more interesting. And we are working on transactions pretty diligently. And so the answer to the question is yes, definitely.","Karin Ford","And do you think we could see something potentially transact before the end of the year?","Michael Schall","I don\u2019t think so. I think early 2019 is probably the earliest it could happen.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Pawlowski from Green Street Advisors.","John Pawlowski","I wanted to head back to Nick\u2019s question around how you\u2019d approach your portfolio. Under repeal of Costa-Hawkins, not exactly exploring new markets right now, but within your current footprint, would on the margin perhaps shift allocations to Southern California where the political pressures may not be as high as the Bay Area?","Michael Schall","Yes, it\u2019s Mike. There is actually a significant number of cities in Southern California that have discussions about rent control. And so I don\u2019t think that, that necessarily offers us a great deal of relief. And I would also say that our expectation for rent growth and the greater shortages of housing are in the north. And so I think that there\u2019s some -- a couple of considerations. And then you have the cost of transacting and -- which is -- can be pretty substantial as well. So again, until we have greater clarity about where this is going to go, we are assuming that this will be part of maybe an effort over the next decade to reexamine the effect of rent control in the United States, not just California. And I think that we\u2019ll come back to the same conclusions that are in all these studies, including, again, the Legislative Analyst\u2019s report for -- which is California -- bipartisan committee in California and other areas. So I think that\u2019s where we\u2019re going. And again, I think that we are pretty good at transacting when we know a little bit more information. Now we\u2019re just -- we\u2019re guessing about what might happen. As we get closer to it, I think one of the nice things about the company is we are careful and selective and pretty opportunistic about using our capital on a thoughtful way. And I\u2019m pretty sure that there will be opportunities that present themselves.","John Pawlowski","Makes sense. And then I wanted to go back to the permitting discussion and zoning on Oakland, East Bay metro, in particular. I understand the permitting data is far from perfect, but the trend there has been consistent acceleration in permitting growth as a percent of stock. So John Eudy, just curious if there\u2019s been any on-the-ground inflection points in terms of zoning policies or pro-development or if it\u2019s just drafting off of the Bay Area and nobody can put the shovel in the ground in the Bay Area or across the Bay so they go to Oakland to get deals done.","John Eudy","There are a couple of things. You all heard about SB 827, the Wiener bill that was attempting to change at the state level how things get zoned around transit-oriented locations. Came out of the chute fairly optimistic and with a lot of political-backed support and then died about a month ago in the committee level because of local control and then, again, stopping what seemed to make sense on the surface. So it\u2019s not any easier anywhere to get developments today than it ever has been in spite of the 15 bills that were passed last year. On the margin, it -- the momentum is shifting in the direction to make it easier, but we haven\u2019t seen any real play on that. On the East Bay you were referring to, I assume its Oakland, Alameda County. It -- they have been more open to development, which makes sense because of the cost of housing in San Francisco. And we do think that will continue to be the direction that Oakland goes in the near term as long as the economics make it work. The problem again is the details of how the transaction economically is penciled, if you will, which is the biggest challenge we have in production across the Northern California market.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Buck Horne from Raymond James.","Buck Horne","I\u2019ll try to be brief. I just wanted to go back to the occupancy strategy during the quarter maybe relative to what you\u2019re seeing in terms of job growth and supply. Just I can\u2019t quite circle the -- why exactly you boosted occupancy so high and did things like limiting the renewal pricing in front of peak leasing, if job growth was coming in better and if you believe that supply is going to be down on a year-over-year basis. Can you just help me circle that narrative?","John Burkart","Sure. We look at it and say if you\u2019re sitting on a vacant unit, you\u2019re not collecting any income. And so if we can create a scenario where our residents are benefited and we\u2019re benefited because we keep that unit occupied during a slow season, we think that\u2019s a good thing. And I think we were able to accomplish that objective very well. We had, again, our turnover go from 46% down to 40%, which really means the majority of the boost in the occupancy was fewer move-outs, which is a great thing.","In doing that, it enables us to be positioned well to meet the market as the peak season leasing comes upon us. And so we\u2019re not looking with buildings that have occupancy issues and struggling with our market rents. We\u2019re able to try to meet the market wherever the market is. And again, our expectations are that the market will move up in the 2% to 3% year-over-year range, but we\u2019ll be able to meet the higher end of the, meet the market where it\u2019s at. So the strategy makes sense from our perspective. Otherwise, we would have just ended up in the same spot but with lower occupancy for Q1 and, in essence, less income.","Buck Horne","Okay. Yes, I hear you. But it kind of reduced your available inventory going into an ability to price higher with the seasonality, I thought. But.. ","John Burkart","I see what you mean. Our turnover increases. Our natural expiration of leases increases pretty significantly. And so that will open up potential supply of units. And again, remember, some of these situations where we have people on renewals and we allow them to stay at a lower premium month-to-month for a short period of time, they will move out. I mean, they have the option of doing a 12-month lease if they so choose, but they chose to go for a month-to-month. It\u2019s just extended their stay a little bit, but they\u2019ll move out most likely during the peak leasing season. That is our expectations.","Buck Horne","Ann just quickly, did I hear you, correctly, I apologize if I missed the quoting here. But I thought you might have mentioned something about April revenue indicating a slight sequential decline from the 1Q levels. And that was driven mainly by...","John Burkart","Yes, yes, no, no. Yes -- no, you didn\u2019t, not because of Seattle but because of occupancy decline. Yes -- no, that\u2019s exactly what we said. And I mentioned that scheduled rent was coming in at 2.3% and that our -- in April year-over-year and that our occupancy April year-over-year gain was 30 basis points. And I did that because I wanted people to understand that we\u2019re going from Q1 where we had a 60 basis point year-over-year increase rolling into Q2 and now we\u2019re at 30% and will ultimately -- our expectation is our occupancy will match last year. So again, the year is now playing out as planned and we\u2019re positioned well. But yes, there\u2019s no doubt, so that it\u2019s not that the market is not good. The market is performing as planned. The difference is really in occupancy and how our portfolio is positioned, kind of getting to your point, taking advantage of the peak leasing season.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I would like to turn the call back to Michael Schall for closing remarks.","Michael Schall","Thank you, operator, and thank everyone for your participation on the call.

As a reminder, today\u2019s conference call is being recorded. Statements made in this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs as well as information available to the company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found in the company\u2019s filings with the SEC. When we get to the question-and-answer portion, management asks that you be respectful of everyone\u2019s time and limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you. You may begin.","Michael Schall","Thank you and welcome to the ESS fourth quarter earnings call. John Burkart and Angela Kleiman will follow me with comments and John Eudy is here for Q&A. Today I will review our 2018 results, summarize our expectations for 2019 and provide an update on the West Coast investment markets. Before beginning, I would like to recognize John Eudy whose retirement was announced last month for his many contributions to the company\u2019s success over the past 30 plus years.","Turning to the first topic, 2018 was another solid year for Essex with 5.5% core FFO per share growth and 2.9% same property NOI growth both slightly better than anticipated at the start of the year. To put 2018 results into a broader perspective, ESS has generated a 16% compounded annual total return to shareholders since its IPO 24 years ago ranking us number 1 in total shareholder return for the REIT industry since the IPO. Over that period, we achieved an 8.5% compounded annual growth rate in FFO per share and a dividend that has grown for 24 consecutive years. Next month, our board will consider increasing our dividend for the 25th year, placing us among a select group of company known as Dividend Aristocrats. Achieving these results was as much about discipline as it was about being opportunistic, especially as it relates to capital allocation. We have found that avoiding major mistakes and understanding the local real estate markets has led to winning formula. To use a baseball analogy, our goal is to get many base hits while minimizing unforced errors. Although 2018\u2019s 5.5% FFO growth is below our historical average, it is consistent with later phases of an economic cycle and the challenges in finding investments that add to per share, core FFO and NAV.","While we are proud of our nearly 25-year track record as a public company, our team remains focused on continuous improvement of our platform for the next 25 years as it relates to residents, colleagues and shareholders. Setting the stage for 2019, we continue to see strong levels of housing demand relative to the national average across our West Coast footprint. We ended 2018 with trailing 3-month job growth in the Essex metros of 2.1%, which exceeded our initial expectations. The primary drivers of the out-performance were the tech markets of San Jose and Seattle, where we saw a strong increase in high-quality jobs during the quarter compared to 1 year ago. We believe this trend will continue as tech firms continue to expand in our markets.","Over the past year, job openings in California and Washington at the top 10 public tech firms all of which are located in Essex markets grew 49% to over 23,000 open positions, the highest level we have seen since we started tracking this data several years ago. While considerable recent attention has focused on the announced expansion of large tech companies in other areas of the country, we would like to note that these very same companies were pursuing nearly twice as much growth in their West Coast markets during the same time period as demonstrated on Page S-16.1 of the supplemental.","Turning to 2019, we continue to expect the tight labor markets and low unemployment will continue to push wages upward. In 2018, personal income growth was estimated at 6% in our markets compared to 3.9% for the U.S. We believe this outperformance will continue into 2019. As a result of wages growing faster than rents, we continue to see rent to income ratios decline in nearly all of our markets as compared to a year ago leading to improved rental affordability. Our supply estimates for 2019 have not changed from what we published in our third quarter supplemental. Overall, we expect a similar level of supply deliveries in 2019 as compared to 2018 although there are significant differences by market such as large increases in apartment deliveries in downtown LA and CBD Oakland offset by reduced apartment deliveries in Orange County and San Diego.","Last quarter, we discussed the change in methodology for estimating apartment supply by factoring construction delays into our forecast. This resulted in pushing the delivery of 3,000 multifamily units from 2018 to 2019 resulting in a supply delivery estimate of roughly 35,000 units for 2018. Looking back to our original supply estimates at the beginning of 2018, we overestimated multifamily supply by 8% primarily due to construction delays while third-party providers overestimated 2018 supply by as much as 65%. The improved accuracy of our multifamily supply estimates reflect several process improvements implemented by our research team who track and frequently visit apartment communities under development. Although we are monitoring several macro related risks to the economy, steady supply levels and healthy job growth support our expectation that rent growth will be mostly consistent with long-term averages for the Essex markets in 2019.","Turning to investment market conditions, a review of transactions on our West Coast markets since the last quarterly call suggests no change to cap rates. The heightened market volatility in December resulted in a few deals being dropped. However, conditions have since stabilized. Generally, cap rates do not move quickly and the first indication of changing conditions is often lower transaction volumes. With plenty of capital still looking to buy apartments and tempered Fed expectations for interest rates, we expect little change to cap rates in the near future. We continue to view the best risk adjusted returns on our investment dollars will be found in the preferred equity market and we expect to close a few more deals in 2019 given our current pipeline. That concludes my comments.","I will turn the call over to John Burkart.","John Burkart","Thank you, Mike. For the full year, we achieved 2.8% year-over-year same-store revenue growth exceeding our original guidance. I would like to thank all our associates for their hard work and focus on achieving these results.","Overall, our markets are stronger today than 1 year ago. In the fourth quarter, market rents were 3.5% higher at the end of 2018 compared to 2017. Consistent with my comments last quarter related to the strengthening of the market and our related operating strategy, we expect to continue emphasizing market rent over higher occupancy in 2019. Our 2019 guidance contemplates a reduction of occupancy of about 20 basis points to 96.6% for the full year.","Regarding expenses, we continue to see pressure in 2019 in utilities, taxes and wages with offsets in other categories largely controllables leading to operating expense guidance of 3% year-over-year for 2019 at the midpoint. The operating team continues to do a great job of identifying opportunities to increase efficiencies in the operating platform. In 2018, they had held controllable expenses to 1.6% year-over-year growth and in 2019 they are expected to do about the same. Office leasing activity provides insight into future rental demand. We are encouraged by the robust office leasing environment and continued office construction announcements in the second half of 2018, which we have illustrated for the major public tech companies on Page S-16.1 of the supplemental. I will provide more regional detail on this leasing activity in my market commentary.","In terms of supply, the focus of new apartment deliveries continues to be in the downtown locations. Overall in 2019, we expect that supply deliveries as a percentage of stock will be 2.8% in the downtown markets versus 60 basis points in the suburban areas surrounding the CBDs of the largest coastal cities. Essex\u2019s portfolio is not concentrated in the downtown locations and therefore should be less impacted by new supply.","Now, I will provide an update on our markets. For the full year of 2018, Seattle had its strongest year since 2000 with 3.4% year-over-year job growth. Although Amazon announced the second and third headquarter location, Amazon\u2019s open positions for Washington have increased over 150% from Q4 2017. In Q4 2018, there were almost 9,000 openings at Amazon and Washington. Other major employers in the Pacific Northwest hit major milestones in their continued plans to expand the Pacific Northwest offices, including Microsoft breaking ground on their 2.5 million square foot expansion in Redmond; Costco receiving city approval for their 1.2 million square foot expansion in Issaquah; and Facebook\u2019s new lease of over 1 million square feet in South Lake Union. Additionally, Amazon and Facebook continue to expand outside of Downtown Seattle pre-leasing 750,000 square feet office in Bellevue, Washington.","Moving to Northern California, job growth in the San Francisco Bay Area averaged 2.3% year-over-year in Q4 led by San Jose with 3.2% growth the vast majority of which occurred in high paying industries such as professional and business services and information. Tech companies, Google, Facebook and DoorDash, expanded their downtown San Francisco presence by over 2 million square feet. In the South Bay, Google was active in purchasing over $1 billion worth of land and property while expanding their Sunnyvale and Mountain View footprint by over 400,000 square feet. Our year-over-year same-store revenue growth for the same period was led by our San Mateo and San Jose submarkets with 4.2% and 3.2% growth respectively, followed by Fremont at 2.9%, Oakland at 2.1% and San Francisco with 1.7% growth for the same period. Supply in the San Francisco and San Jose MDs is slightly lower in 2019 compared to 2018. However, we see supply in the Oakland MD increasing to 3,500 units, of which 3,000 units will be delivered in downtown Oakland. Although the total supply in the Bay Area is still relatively low at 70 basis points, it will be impactful in downtown Oakland.","Continuing South, Southern California job growth for our markets averaged 1.2% in Q4, which was negatively impacted by Orange County. Los Angeles remained consistent with the region posting 1.4% growth for the period. Netflix continues to solidify their presence in the market pre-leasing an additional 355,000 square feet in Hollywood. Google and Facebook both completed deals to expand a combined 860,000 square feet in West LA. Year-over-year revenue growth for the fourth quarter of 2018 was led by our Woodland Hills and West LA submarkets, with 4.7% and 4.3% growth respectively trailed by Long Beach with 2.8% growth and Tri-Cities with 2.4% growth, while LA CBD remains flat.","Regarding supply, I have had similar comment for downtown LA as in Oakland. Although the supply overall in LA County is relatively low at 60 basis points, the concentration in downtown LA is significant. We expect deliveries in downtown LA to increase from about 2,000 units in 2018 to about 4,000 units in 2019. In Orange County, jobs in the fourth quarter grew 30 basis points year-over-year and actually turned negative when looking at December 2018 over the prior year\u2019s period. A similar situation occurred in the numbers last year and it was revised with the annual benchmarking in March, which we will review closely this year.","Finally, in San Diego year-over-year job growth was 1.9% for the fourth quarter of 2018. Most of the job growth is attributed to jobs added in high paying industries. In addition to tech giant Apple\u2019s plan for a campus in Austin, the company also announced goals to add over 1,000 employees in San Diego as well as Culver City and Seattle. Military activity will have a moderate impact in the market on the margins with one carrier having departed at the beginning of the year and the potential of two inbound carriers arriving later in the year, each carrier strike group has an estimated 7,500 crew members. Year-over-year revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2018 was 4.2% for our North City submarket, 3.9% for Oceanside, and 2.4% in Chula Vista. Currently, our portfolio is at 97% occupancy and our availability 30 days out is at 4%. Thank you.","And I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Angela Kleiman.","Angela Kleiman","Thank you, John. Today, I will focus on our 2019 guidance followed by an update on capital markets and the balance sheet. The key assumptions supporting our 2019 forecast starts on Page 4 of the press release and S-14 of the supplemental. We are guiding to a midpoint of 3% for both same property revenue and expense growth. The revenue growth assumptions is primarily driven by our expectation of a steady market rent growth near the long-term average and for our West Coast markets to continue to outperform the U.S. average.","On core FFO guidance, we are expecting a growth rate of 3.7% at the midpoint. You mentioned on the third quarter call that there are two key headwinds impacting this growth rate. First is debt refinancing as the effective rate on the debt coming due is below current rates in the marketplace. Second is the lease up of our development pipeline. When a building first opens, even though it is vacant, we recognize the operating and associated interest expense. This effect creates a temporary drag on cash flow. Since over 85% of our development pipeline will start lease up this year, we anticipate a more meaningful FFO per share drag of between $0.05 to $0.10 in 2019. Once the buildings are stabilized which typically takes 12 to 18 months per phase, we expect the drag to become a tailwind.","Turning to capital markets activities, for the year, Essex was a net seller of assets as we arbitrage between private market yields and our cost of capital. During the fourth quarter, we sold 8th & Hope in Downtown Los Angeles for $220 million, which represents a cap rate close to mid 3%. We purchased this property over 3 years ago for $200 million which we funded with common stock when we were trading at a large premium to net asset value. Recently, using the proceeds from the sale of this property, we have repaid debt and repurchased stock, because we have been trading at a discount to net asset value. Since the beginning of 2018, we have repurchased $108 million of stock at an average price of $243.44. Currently, our 2019 guidance does not assume any additional stock repurchase other than what has been completed through January. As always, we remain disciplined capital allocators and are ready to adjust our plan depending on market conditions to maximize shareholder returns.","Lastly, on the balance sheet, we plan to repay about $880 million of debt in 2019. This includes pre-paying a $290 million secured loan that matures in 2020 without incurring any prepayment fees. We generally favor refinancing on maturities with long term unsecured debt subject to relative pricing of course. As for the $290 million loan prepayment, we had discussed on our previous call that the average pay rates on this debt is 5.7%, while the effective rate used to calculate GAAP interest expense is 3.8%. So, even though the FFO impact will be negative, we will generate annual cash savings of approximately $3 million.","In summary, our balance sheet remains strong, with only 25% leverage, 5.4x debt to EBITDA, and over $1.5 billion of liquidity. We are well-positioned to take advantage of any opportunities that may arise in 2019. That concludes my comments. And I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Nick Joseph with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Nick Joseph","Thanks. Wondering if you can talk about the same-store revenue growth throughout 2019 given difficult occupancy comps seen at least in the first quarter and probably for the first half of the year?","John Burkart","Yes, sure. This is John. The first quarter is going to be a little bit tougher and part of it because of some noise that we had from other income, the benefit of other income last year. So the year-over-year comps are a little tougher. For example, in January, our rental revenue on preliminary numbers is 3%, but the actual revenue, overall revenue is 2.6%. So, it will come out looking less than desirable, but the reality is the market is actually stronger this year than it was last year. So overall, we are in a better position, but the first quarter numbers would be lighter and then it will pickup throughout the year.","Nick Joseph","Thanks. And then just on development, it looks like two of the projects were delayed by a quarter and I recognize that that could be a shift of only a few weeks. So are these projects actually seeing delays or is it more normal quarterly shift?","John Eudy","This is John Eudy. The labor issue delayed a couple of our deals. They are actually only pushed out about a 1.5 month, but it pushed it into the next quarter, so that was the reason behind it.","Nick Joseph","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Trent Trujillo with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question.","Trent Trujillo","Hi, good morning and thanks for taking the questions. I appreciate the commentary on supply in different markets, but it looks like there is a lot of supply that\u2019s scheduled to deliver in the Bay Area. So, how are you thinking about your ability to retain residents, perhaps maintain occupancy and drive rent growth, because I believe one of your peers cited recently that the new assets could have rents that are at 15% to 20% discounts to existing products? So do you think that will be a drawing point or do you see enough demand that it may not be much of an ultimate impact?","Michael Schall","Hi, Trent, this is Mike. Thanks for your question. Yes, we continue to see the Bay Area as the area that has the strongest job growth and the strongest economy. And if you look at overall levels of supply, we think 2019 will be somewhere around 1% of stock on the apartment side and 0.7% of stock on total supply in the Bay Area. So obviously we are growing jobs at 2%. Those numbers do not appear to be concerning. And the other point I would make is there is sort of a trend toward fewer for-sale units being built and a few more apartments being built and the for-sale component is impacted by higher mortgage rates and higher prices. I think California had a median home price increase of somewhere around 5% over the past year. So, the for-sale side is getting more expensive and I think that, that benefits the rental. But when we look basically at supply and demand, we think demand significantly outstrips supply as it relates to all housing and apartments as well.","Trent Trujillo","Okay, great. And then maybe one for John Eudy, this might be one of the last times we can ask about this with your transition, but you took a lead role in the Prop 10 campaign. So maybe can you provide your latest thoughts on affordability measures and maybe let us know about the efforts you have seen and been involved in and what you think could be a potential resolution to the housing shortage and affordability issues in California?","John Eudy","Well, that is a very long-winded question I\u2019ll do my best to answer it first off, as you know, Prop 10 was defeated handsomely 60\/40 by 20 points and I think the leadership of the legislature and our new governor understand that repealing Costa-Hawkins was not good for California and California housing so that\u2019s good as far as all the measures that are out there to create more housing, it gets back to the economic drivers and how we\u2019re going to make it work I can\u2019t speak to how some of the affordable housing solutions that have been bantered around at the legislature are actually going to get done, but there is discussion but as you well know, the economics have to work for anything to be built, and it\u2019s been tough the last couple of years to even keep up with the supply demands that we\u2019ve had so I don\u2019t see it blowing up, if you will, meaning unabated amount of construction beginning to occur it is going to be a long struggle in California and a deep hole for housing shortage, if you will, and it\u2019s going to take a long time to get out of it there is a lot of focus on post Prop 10, what can we do if anything and I think that\u2019s being discussed if there are any amendments to or call it reform to Costa-Hawkins, they would be very minor is my expectation.","Trent Trujillo","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Shirley Wu with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Shirley Wu","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So going back to your revenue guidance of 2.5% to 3.5%, how comfortable are you with that range? And what do you think it will take to get to the upper versus the lower end range in terms of rents and occupancy?","John Burkart","Sure. This is John speaking. We are very comfortable with our range and obviously with our midpoint at this point in time the markets right now are stronger than they were a year ago we mentioned at the last call, we had a better loss to lease position, which puts us in a good spot we shifted our strategy where we\u2019re favoring market rent as opposed to occupancy so all those things lead to a stronger market at the same time though there are some headwinds, because of the occupancy headwinds I mentioned about 20 basis points of occupancy headwind that will work against us what would make things better or worse is really jobs I would say if the jobs we\u2019re watching that Orange County jobs I mentioned that and if that turns out unfavorable that will hurt that market. It\u2019s not a huge market but will hurt that we are seeing some stronger job growth certainly in Seattle and the Bay Area so that would be the upside and the downside would be Orange County jobs does that answer your question?","Shirley Wu","Yes. So actually also on supply, you mentioned that right now you have a good slippage into \u201919 but it seems as if slippage is a consistent theme, so have you accounted for slippage from \u201819 into \u201820 into your projection?","John Burkart","Yes, this is John. What we made shift last year because you\u2019re right, it is a fairly consistent theme where we go out and we drive all of the assets and look and make an assessment as to where they\u2019re at, come up with our best judgment as to the timing but even then, there is errors just because of the labor shortage and the slippage so what we adjusted is we continued that process of driving every asset, but then we made a more of a macro adjustment based on our experience that we have over the last several years to modify that so we\u2019re more confident this year than in the past as it relates to our supply expectations, but, yeah, I acknowledge it\u2019s the last couple of years have been tough because of the delays.","Shirley Wu","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Austin Wurschmidt","Hi there. Question, when you look at your forecasts for supply versus third-party forecasts for 2019 are there still material differences? And do you think they\u2019ve got a handle on the timing of completions at this point?","Michael Schall","Hi Austin, it\u2019s Mike Schall. As John just alluded to, we spent a lot of time on the supply estimates and that\u2019s largely because there are such a high degree of variation out there in terms of estimates as I noted in my comments that some of the vendors had 65% more supply in 2018 than was actually delivered and typically that just moves into the next year and then the next year appears to be overstated so without making a systematic adjustment, like the one we made, to move 3,000 units from this year to next year and then do the same thing from \u201819 to \u201820, you end up with these huge numbers that are out there that are well beyond reality in our opinion so we think that similar to \u201817 and \u201818, there\u2019ll be around 35,000 units per year that are delivered in our West Coast markets unless something changes in the construction labor market, which candidly we don\u2019t see, it was the point we made last time on last quarter\u2019s call, that I don\u2019t know how you could expect a significant increase in the amount of supply when the labor market hasn\u2019t fundamentally changed and in fact, I would say that there are demographic issues within the construction labor market, because there are more people retiring and going into the trade and you also have, maybe as an anecdote, people, construction workers diverted to some of these fire destroyed areas that are taking people out of the labor markets in some of the metro areas and moving them into the areas that had these fires so without a fundamental change in construction labor, I don\u2019t see how you could possibly produce a tremendous number of more homes makes sense?","Austin Wurschmidt","Yes, that\u2019s an interesting anecdote. Thanks for that. Do you think once we pass peak construction or peak supply deliveries in a specific quarter and that pipeline begins to slow that there is I don\u2019t know if you call it a greater risk or greater likelihood that projects are completed on time?","Michael Schall","Yes, I think I\u2019d go back to what John Eudy just said, it\u2019s all about the economics so for the past couple of years we\u2019ve had rents growing at somewhere around 3%, 2% to 3%, and construction costs have been growing at the high single digit to low double-digit rate and so the net effect of those two numbers is to compress development yields and this is why I think it\u2019s unlikely that you\u2019re going to have a significant increase in the number of units developed from a from the perspective of just economics in terms of development economics and really this underlies our switch from direct development where we\u2019re buying land and for future start and concern therefore about that construction cost increase between when we commit to land and when we start and rather than that focus on our preferred equity portfolio where we\u2019re financing someone else\u2019s development deal and we are coming in at the point that we know the cost because they have a construction loan, they are signing a contract with the general contractor etcetera. so, we think that\u2019s a low risk, more appropriate way to approach development at this point in time.","Austin Wurschmidt","I appreciate the thoughts, Mike. And then last one for me is, you talked about downtown LA significant concentration of supply doubling in \u201819 versus \u201918 can you just speak to the concession trends you\u2019re seeing as well as what your guys\u2019 exposure is in the market now following the sale of 8th and Hope?","Michael Schall","John, do you want to do that? [indiscernible]","John Burkart","Sure, I\u2019ll grab that. Yes, so what we are seeing now as far as concessions in that market is it\u2019s pretty consistent with what we typically see in the fourth quarter because again reminding everybody that it\u2019s the lower point in the season so concessions are up a couple of weeks, they are now roughly 6, 6 to 8 weeks in the downtown LA market, specifically as it relates to lease-ups, not same-store but lease-ups and that\u2019s fairly normal we one might expect with the new supply coming on this year that it might get more aggressive, we\u2019ll watch that carefully as it relates to our exposure in the downtown market for LA, our exposure is pretty small. It\u2019s right now, a couple of percent of the whole portfolio, it\u2019s really not very big at this point after that sale does that answer your question?","Austin Wurschmidt","Yes, absolutely. That was very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please proceed with your question.","Alexander Goldfarb","Yes, good morning out there. So two questions. First, on the operating expense, you guys talked about your ability to really make headway on the controllables to offset the payroll utility and taxes, but it certainly seems Mike to your comments on labor shortage, seems like payroll wages is going to be a continuing pressure point so can you just talk ongoing you said that you could manage it this year do you think that\u2019s sustainable or do you think that expenses are going to rise in the future if you guys are unable to further control the controllables?","John Burkart","Yes, Alex, this is John. I will take a stab at it. I know you said, Mike, but I\u2019ve got the controllables in my bucket here so as it relates to wages, you\u2019re right, there is significant pressure out there let\u2019s not forget that one of our issues is affordability and so as wages go up, it does help the overall picture much, much more so if this was a long-term trend that would actually be very beneficial for affordability and therefore rents but getting back to your specific question, sure, in the end of the day it goes up forever, we will run out of potentially run out of opportunities but we continue to find ways to leverage the asset collections that we have with sharing of personnel to reduce total labor while we are still paying our people significantly more so everybody is winning in that equation we are also finding opportunities to leverage technology to automate various processes and in doing so improving the customer experience, making things much faster as well as our employee experience and again reducing labor or vendor costs so what we see for the foreseeable future is a lot of opportunity, but a tremendous amount of work with change management to try to implement the different things that we\u2019re looking at.","Michael Schall","Does that answer your question there?","Alexander Goldfarb","Yes, yes, it does and I was referencing Mike\u2019s comments on wage with construction labor but actually now I am going to turn to Angela on the guidance page it looks like capitalized interest is expected to be higher, if I\u2019m reading the guidance page correctly, and it so if you could just talk, are you guys anticipating increasing the development pipeline? I mean, it didn\u2019t sound that way, but if you could just walk through why capitalized interest looks to be higher in \u201819 than \u201818?","Angela Kleiman","Oh, sure and I am happy to Alex that\u2019s really just a function of our current development pipeline we still have about $250 million a little over $250 million of spend this year and because of that capitalized interest is going to naturally increase so it\u2019s nothing more than just how those numbers work out.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay, thanks Angela.","Michael Schall","Thanks, Alex.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","John Kim","Good morning. I think Mike in your prepared remarks, you mentioned preferred equity as your most attractive risk-adjusted returns for your dollar spend yet your guidance for this year anticipates only $50 million to $100 million which is less than what you\u2019ve invested last year and on top of that you expect to be a net seller this year. So just wondering if we should read into that that most investment opportunities are getting pricy?","Michael Schall","Yes, John, it\u2019s a good observation. Thanks for that. I think it has to do with the other point I made a minute ago which is construction cost increasing faster than rents and a lot of these deals are being pushed back in fact, most of our pipeline in 2019 represents the deals that we thought were going to close in 2018 and it just essentially has been pushed back so they require typically more equity than some of the sponsors originally thought they would and otherwise need to be reworked so basically it\u2019s taken us a longer period of time to get the preferred equity deals to the closing table and so we remain optimistic in 2019 we actually have a very good pipeline right now and so perhaps just a little bit of upside to the guidance assumption but again, given the inherent uncertainty, we are we want to make sure we had a level that we could for sure close.","John Kim","Okay. And then John mentioned Orange County and the slight loss of jobs that occurred in December, it doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re concerned about it too much at this point, but you\u2019re still maintaining your 20,000 jobs forecast for the year I\u2019m just wondering if you had to reduce that job forecast, how sensitive would that be to your market trend forecast?","Michael Schall","Yes, John, this is Mike and John will follow me. Job growth there is 1.2% and job growth in Southern California is about 1.3% so I don\u2019t think that we have been aggressive on jobs I think we\u2019re being thoughtful and realistic so all of these assumptions can vary to some degree and but I think if you look back historically, we have been pretty close on virtually everything and if anything maybe a little bit conservative.","John Burkart","Yes. And I would just add, you remember last year with Orange County, the jobs were pretty flat and then the revisions came through and they revised back a whole bunch of jobs. We\u2019re watching that situation. I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019ll happen again or not, but we\u2019re watching that closely. We\u2019re not seeing signs that the market is having great struggles. I just want to bring it up on the call so people are aware and seeing what we see that there was a negative print in jobs in December.","John Kim","Got it. Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Drew Babin with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Drew Babin","Hey, good morning.","Michael Schall","Hi, Drew.","Drew Babin","A question \u2013 hey, going into next year, obviously, there were quite a few markets where you had a pickup in kind of the second derivative of leasing in 2018. In your guidance, are you assuming that any markets has another second derivative improvement in pricing power for 2019 guidance purposes?","John Burkart","I wouldn\u2019t say it that way. I would look at it and say, we expect the markets to continue to stay strong. We had a \u2013 really a shift in the market and it goes all the way back to \u201817 when things were slow in the first half of \u201818 and then they shifted \u2013 clearly shifted. We see a continued strength in the market, but not necessarily something really taking off, but we do see continued strength in the market and we look at factors like the Northern California job growth, the Seattle job growth and consistency in the SoCal region again with the exception of Orange County and expect that things will continue pretty good over the next year, again, with supplies generally in check overall in the larger markets.","Drew Babin","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And I guess kind of converting that over to loss to lease language, it would seem based on your market rent forecast for \u201819, as well as some of the comments on loss to lease, towards the end of \u201818 that revenue growth would maybe be a bit higher than implied by the midpoint of guidance. I know you talked about the 20 basis points of occupancy decline. I guess, can you quantify the piece of that kind of caused by overall deceleration in property fee income growth or kind of what\u2019s the drag being created by that?","John Burkart","Let me kind of walk through big picture the way I look at it. Typically, again, and thank you for referencing loss to lease, to Essex it\u2019s one of the key metrics along with market rent and of course occupancy adjustment, that\u2019s how we look at it. And so, when looking at loss to lease, we typically like to look at it in September. It\u2019s after peak leasing and before things slow down in the normal seasonal slowdown. So, at that point we had about 1.6% for the portfolio loss to lease, and again, on average with 12 month leases, you\u2019re going to figure, you\u2019re going to get all of that over the next year. Then, if you look at our rent in S-16, it\u2019s 3.1% and if you look at that and say we\u2019re going to take a mid-year convention on how that hits the market, that gets you about another 155 basis points. And then if you take the 20 basis points of occupancy and subtract that out, that gets you into about the 2.95% range for revenue and we\u2019re pretty darn close to that at 3%. So that big picture how we kind of look at it and see it the year, so I think we are pretty spot on with our 3% midpoint guidance.","Drew Babin","Okay. The explanation is very helpful. And lastly just in Seattle, it would seem based on some of the data out there and some commentary that supply is beginning to kind of directionally shift from downtown out more towards the East side and also some news about tech firms possibly getting behind the creation of additional kind of lower and middle income housing out on the East side. I guess are you seeing anything in the market at this point in time any kind of disruption and what kind of visibility can you provide about some of those East side submarkets around Seattle?","Michael Schall","Well, yes, I think you\u2019re right, Drew. There is more development on the East side than there have been in West. It was \u2013 development was very focused on Downtown Seattle first and then Downtown Bellevue and then now it\u2019s moving more into the suburban areas of Seattle. And \u2013 but we see an overall trend of reduced supply in the Seattle area more broadly. So in \u201818, we had 9,750 units in Seattle being delivered 9,019 and then about little over 6,000 in 2020. So, we think actually that the supply side is actually going in the right direction. And then the other side is, obviously the demand side, which continues to be very robust. So \u2013 and maybe the other piece, which is affordability, which we were bit concerned about more in the California markets, Seattle is much more affordable. So, we still view Seattle as being an appropriate area to invest. And as you can tell from our 2019 expectation, it\u2019s just a small bit below our expectation for market rent growth compared to Southern Cal and Northern Cal.","Drew Babin","Great. Appreciate the explanation. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Wes Golladay","Yes, good morning to everyone. Go and look at that 8th and Hope transaction, it was described as an arbitrage, and I\u2019m just wondering \u2013 it looks like you bought all the stock in the last week of the quarter. Is it \u2013 was it conceivable that you guys could actually sell the asset and buy the stock in a one-week period or were you contemplating that maybe throughout the entire quarter?","Michael Schall","Yes, hey Wes, it\u2019s Mike. Yes, I guess we hope to buy the stock if we could. If we didn\u2019t buy the stock, we thought that debt rates could increase to a point that there was still positive arbitrage just kind of smaller refinance for example. So, it was going to be positive arbitrage no matter what happened in our view. But obviously the opportunity to buy the stock back was the better outcome and we\u2019re pretty excited about it.","Wes Golladay","Yes. Well, congrats on buying the bottom. Big picture though when you\u2019re selling assets at a 3.5% cap rate, which I believe you cited, do you think eventually if there\u2019s more transactions like that developers will start to lower their hurdle and then maybe this whole low interest rate environment could just be maybe negative long-term for overall rent growth?","Michael Schall","Well, it\u2019s pretty challenging on this side to respond to hypothetical type of questions, but because our view is, it\u2019s all a matter of looking at the landscape, a variety of different points of view. So, in that case, I guess what you\u2019re talking about is higher valuations of apartments are going to increase. The next question I would ask you is, hey, does that mean that the stock price is going to increase too and our cost of capital is going to decline, because again, we are constantly looking at what\u2019s better. The real estate portfolio or the value implied in the stock and trying to understand that so we make good capital allocation decisions. So, to ask a question that just focuses on one variable without the other variable is challenging to answer. Does that make sense?","Wes Golladay","No, that\u2019s fair point. And I definitely agree with the way you look at it from the relative value of your stock. That\u2019s it for me. Thanks.","Michael Schall","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Hardik Goel with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question.","Hardik Goel","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I was just wondering on the supply and adjustment there, obviously, you guys have the best view into the market, you guys drive around, you view these assets, I\u2019m just wondering, what\u2019s causing the delay beyond just the labor issues. So, if you look at assets that are maybe high-rise versus something that\u2019s more mid-rise, is the high-rise more likely to be delayed than the mid-rise, are there certain kinds of projects that are more likely to be delayed? What kind of color can you add on the delays, specifically?","John Eudy","This is John Eudy. I\u2019ll try to answer that. The more complicated the structure obviously, the higher likelihood that there could be more delays as everything stacks up on itself. The general labor issues that the industry has faced over the last year specifically has been the driver and the out-migration of the older construction folks that are no longer there like they were 10 years ago as part of the answer. So, it\u2019s a little bit of everything, Hardik, but yes, the more complex the construction, the higher likelihood there would be delays in this environment for the next 12 months, say.","Hardik Goel","And is that just on a construction basis or also complexity on the capital structure side that you notice?","John Eudy","Well, I was just referring to construction, but on the capital, obviously, the numbers have to work to want to do a deal, but you\u2019ve already committed once you start it, so it\u2019s in the pipeline. So, I was only referring to the pipeline when I responded.","Hardik Goel","Well, thanks so much, John, and best of luck as you retire.","John Eudy","Well, I\u2019ll never retire, but I\u2019m not going to be working 24\/7.","Michael Schall","We\u2019re not going to let John go that easy.","John Eudy","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Guinee with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","John Guinee","Great, thank you. First, John, we\u2019re going to miss you, it\u2019s been a great 30 years, boy.","John Eudy","34, just to be exact, not that I\u2019m counting.","John Guinee","34, wow. You have started there when you were 16, wow. Any 1031 Exchange requirements on 8th and Hope? And then other two questions, any promote income identified in 2019 and then refresh our memory and if you already did this and I missed it, I apologize, how you handle the Costa-Hawkins costs that you incurred in 2018?","Angela Kleiman","Sure. Thanks, John. On the 8th and Hope, there is a small piece of 1031 exchange, but it\u2019s not such a meaningful impact on the gains, because we had \u2013 we had sold back then. It was the last piece of share gain. So just a small piece. So really doesn\u2019t impact the ultimate gain numbers in a material way and we certainly have the ability to absorb that without impacting a dividend. And as far as the Costa-Hawkins and the G&A impact we pulled that off core and we actually disclosed it separately, and I think it\u2019s on Page 5 or 6 in the press release. But in any event the total cost, which is also public information for Costa-Hawkins is about $5.8 million for the full-year. And we don\u2019t expect, of course, such a significant one-time item to reoccur in 2019, and so we don\u2019t have a forecasted number.","John Guinee","Angela, any promote income expected in 2019?","Angela Kleiman","At this point, not yet, we\u2019re still reevaluating the platform because that involves conversations with the joint venture and market conditions and there\u2019s a lot more conversations that goes into just factoring getting a promote.","John Guinee","Great. Thank you.","Angela Kleiman","So, we certainly have a good embedded pipeline on the promote.","John Guinee","Great, thank you very much. Thank you.","Michael Schall","Thanks, John.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Tayo Okusanya","Hi, yes, good morning over there on the West Coast. Let me also add my congratulations John on your semi-retirement and Adam also congrats on the promotion. A couple of things from our end. I think we\u2019ve talked about the cap rate on 8th and Hope. Could you just give us a sense of kind of some of the other cap rates of some of the other acquisitions you did during the quarter, as well as disposition?","Michael Schall","Sure, this is Mike. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, I don\u2019t think cap rates have changed a whole heck of a lot for A quality property and locations, it\u2019s around a 4% cap rate. Sometimes you have very well located very high quality, let\u2019s say, A plus, A plus plus type property that will go sub-4 cap rates. And then for B quality or let\u2019s say, from A minus to B minus, you have a \u2013 you would add probably from 30 basis points to 60 basis points to the A cap rate. So again, very consistent with what we\u2019ve said in the past.","Tayo Okusanya","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And the second question, given the viewpoint on cap rates, is that one of the main reasons why you still forecast being the net seller of assets in 2019 similar to 2018?","Michael Schall","Yes, again it\u2019s what I said earlier, it really is the relationships between the stock price and net asset value of the Company and the different components that go into each of those. Notably, for example, our debt on balance sheet is lower cost and if we go and incur debt tomorrow, which gives our balance sheet a reason to buy it versus just transact in the marketplace. So, we\u2019re looking for the appropriate arbitrage and add value on \u2013 from the transactional side. We also need to fund our development pipeline.","Tayo Okusanya","Got it. Okay. That\u2019s it from my end. Congrats. Thank you.","Michael Schall","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors. Please proceed with your question.","John Pawlowski","Thanks. Let\u2019s say, go back to Orange County a bit and contrast it to I think it was a year ago in the Bay Area where you saw similar scary BLS job growth trajectories and that were restated. So, I understand the concern with restatements. Is it that your on-the-ground trends, which I\u2019m guessing could be better predictors of job growth and BLS. Those on-the-ground trends a year-ago corroborated BLS type numbers, at least as I stated and this time they\u2019re kind of telling you a different answer that on-the-ground trends and Orange County are actually a lot stronger than the BLS numbers?","John Burkart","No, this is John. So last year, it really wasn\u2019t the Bay Area, it was Orange County that was revised up pretty substantially. And last year we saw market rent growth in the context of everything that\u2019s going on in the sense of supply being delivered and everything else, which was pretty good. And so, it was not consistent with BLS and I would go back and say, this year it\u2019s a similar situation. We are seeing Orange County, say, the fourth quarter rents in Orange County were 2.9% year over prior year, yet the BLS has basically flat job growth for that quarter. We also expect lower supply deliveries going forward. So, the BLS is one number that\u2019s out there and we watch it but we look at many numbers and we\u2019re trying to make sense of it. Right now, on-the-ground, we\u2019re not seeing a significant deterioration. And so, we\u2019ll watch the revisions, but we\u2019ll continue to stay more focused on what\u2019s really going on in the rental market.","John Pawlowski","Okay. Could you share that 2.9% growth in 4Q? What it will look like in January and what was that trend? What\u2019s the trajectory of the trend into this year?","John Burkart","Sure. The \u2013 that is up from where it was earlier in the year and in January it\u2019s down a little bit from there as is San Diego. Both of those markets are down a little bit, but that\u2019s not unusual at this point in time. That\u2019s why I quoted the fourth quarter number as a whole because one-month there is a movement that can go on within our portfolio and certainly it\u2019s the low demand period. So not really a good reference point. That\u2019s why I use the whole quarter, but we only have January, so January is down a little bit from there.","John Pawlowski","Okay. John Eudy on the Governor Newsom\u2019s recent steps or planned steps to address the regional housing need allocations in certain cities. From your experience if he is successful and he does have bipartisan support, big yes, how quickly could we see starts starting to pick up in some of these cities that are forced to increase their allocation?","John Burkart","Well, as you know John in California, not taking that into consideration that 4 years to 7 years is the cycle from identification of site till you actually have a stabilized asset. And some of the ambitious things that he has said sound good, but the execution in reality by the time you go through the process and sequel even if there is some sequel reform, you\u2019re not really going to accelerate the timing that much and the economics drive the decision anyway. So, I don\u2019t see a near-term over the next 3 years to 5 years massive increase from what we\u2019re expecting to see.","Michael Schall","Hey John, John, it\u2019s Mike. I just have one more thing to add to that. And I don\u2019t know if you saw a strike in the backyard. But I think it\u2019s notable that the City of Huntington Beach is suing the state over some of these new requirements SB-35. So, I think that\u2019s something that we\u2019re going to be keeping our eye on as it relates to these matters.","John Pawlowski","Right. Okay. Thanks, guys.","John Burkart","Nimby attitudes in California are not going to change easily is what I think Mike says.","Michael Schall","That\u2019s the point, yes, exactly.","Operator","We will take our last question from Karin Ford with MUFG Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Karin Ford","Oh, hey, good morning out there. It doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re underwriting a recession in your 2019 outlook, but if we do end up going into one nationwide this year, how do you think the West Coast will fare and what do you think the downside risk could be to your job growth and market rent growth forecasts?","Michael Schall","Hi, Karin, it\u2019s Mike. I am not sure exactly how to respond to that, because obviously it depends on what type of recession, how deep it is what happens to employment, etcetera. So, I have a hard time responding to it exactly. I would expect at the end of the cycle, conditions continue to change, jobs will trail off, the development pipelines will continue to be delivered, because once you turn a stated work, they will be finished and you\u2019ll end up with a supply demand mismatch, but quantifying how that looks and exactly what that means I think it is virtually impossible to do at this point.","Karin Ford","Okay, fair enough. And then my second question is just on the preferred equity pipeline and book, you said in the third quarter press release that you had originated, I think an $18 million or $19 million investment in Burlingame, but the number of investments stayed at $17 million from September to December. Just I was wondering did something get paid off or did that deal just not happen?","Michael Schall","Yes. So, the typical duration of these preferred equity deals are 3 to 4 years. So yes, we are constantly having redemptions or repayments.","Karin Ford","Okay. Can you just give us a sense for what was repaid and what was the rate on it?","Angela Kleiman","Yes, it was a small deal, $6 million and the pay rate, I am just from memory was around 11%. But at this point, if you look at our total preferred equity commitment, it\u2019s still pretty darn close to what we had disclosed last time it\u2019s close to $400 million. So there is some inflows, there is some outflows, but net-net, we are still around that $400 million and we are well under our maximum capacity of $900 million.","Karin Ford","And is there anything \u2013 any new investment that you think is imminent in the first phase closing in the first quarter?","Angela Kleiman","That\u2019s really hard to say, because we do as Mike said, have a good pipeline and that we are working through, but the timing of the close is just difficult to predict.","Karin Ford","Okay, thank you.","Michael Schall","Thank you, Karen.","Operator","At this time, I would like to turn the call back to Michael Schall for closing comments.","Michael Schall","Thank you, operator and thanks everyone for your participation on the call today. We look forward to seeing many of you at the Citigroup conference in March. Have a great day. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and we thank you for your participation."],"8835":["Essex Property Trust, Inc.

As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.","The statements made in this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs, as well as information available to the Company at this time. A number of factors could cause these actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found in the Company's filings with the SEC. Through the question-and-answer portion, management does ask that you please be respectful of everyone\u2019s time and limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you, Mr. Schall, you may begin.","Michael Schall","Thank you for joining us today, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. John Burkart, Angela Kleiman and I will make brief comments and John Eudy is here for Q&A. Today, I will discuss three topics: our fourth quarter results and expectations for 2018, recent regulatory activities and update on investment markets.","On to the first topic. 2017 was another successful year for Essex with core FFO per share growth of 7.9%, exceeding the high end of our initial guidance range and mostly driven by the same property portfolio, accretive investments and opportunistic capital market activities. As always, we have focused on driving growth to the bottom-line which allows us to have one of the best track records in the industry for dividend growth.","To that end, later this month, we expect our Board of Directors to approve our 24th consecutive annual increase in the common dividend positioning us nicely to become a dividend aristocrat a year from now. Since the IPO in 1994, we have paid about $85 in dividends, 4 times the IPO price.","On the Q3 conference call, we expressed concerns about slowing job growth for both the nation and on the West Coast, noting that unadjusted total non-farm employment declined sequentially in most of the Essex markets in Q3 2017.","In Q4, job growth improved in the Essex markets with the three month trailing average job growth at 1.6% better than the 1.4% estimate reflected on last quarter\u2019s Essex gain. This significant volatility of job growth in the Essex markets and the improvement in Q4 is graphed on page S-16.1 of the supplemental along with historical information to provide contents.","Turning to our outlook for 2018, we published our key economic assumptions for the year on S-16 of the supplemental. In 2017 the U.S. economy experienced significant improvement in GDP relative to previous years and we believe the recently enacted Tax Reform bill will further stimulate economic growth into 2018. Thus, we have increased our GDP growth expectations in 2018 to 2.7%.","Turning to job growth, we expect U.S. job growth to remain relatively flat in 2018 at 1.4% primarily due to the tight labor markets and low unemployment rates both nationally and on the West Coast. Job growth in the Essex markets is expected to be 1.6% consistent with 2017 which should create about 201,000 jobs across our footprint.","This should be sufficient to drive housing demand above the 67,000 total housing units expected for delivery, both rental and for sale, thus continuing Coastal California\u2019s chronic housing shortage.","Office construction which often perceives job growth continues at a robust pace in the tech market representing around 6% of stock in the Bay area and 5% in Seattle. For several years, virtually all of the apartment supply has been focused on the luxury segment creating shortages at lower price points and stretching rental affordability.","When wages grow faster than rent as is expected in 2018, the affordability issue for apartments abates. Thus while wage inflation may negatively impact interest rates, it improves affordability and often rent growth.","In 2017 personal income growth has been estimated at 4.5% in the Essex markets compared to 2.8% for the nation. In 2018 both U.S. average and Essex markets are expected to accelerate to 4.3% for the U.S. and 5.3% in the Essex markets. As you might expect rent-to-income ratio is still or remain unchanged in six of the eight metros in which we operate including those in Northern California.","Improving economic conditions overall lower supply levels and better affordability underlie our expectation for better market rent growth in 2018 versus 2017.","Now onto my second topic regulatory matters. I have commented on prior conference calls about California bill 1506 proposing to repeal the Costa-Hawkins rental housing act which limits the scope of rent control enacted by local governments.","As in 2017, AB 1506 recently failed to obtain the required support to move out of committee make it unlikely will be inactive at least in 2018. The bill analysis available online references a 2016 study by the legislative analyst office states that \u201cexpanding rent control protections would not increase the supply of housing and likely would discourage new construction flow.\u201d","While we concur with this view it misses other important issues. Our recent study of San Francisco's rent control by faculty at Stanford Business School found that longer tenant fees and reduced supply growth citywide rents upward as apartment hunters had to compete for fewer available units.","As noted last quarter there is also referendum to repeal Costa-Hawkins which is currently in the qualification process for the November 2018 balance. In response to this effort a coalition named California's For Responsible Hosing was organized to oppose the effort. The coalition has strong support from owners, industry association and other impacted groups. We will provide an update on future calls as wanted.","Similar to AB 15016 California, there is a bill in the Washington state legislator to repeal the state\u2019s ban and rent control and it seems like the other states will follow California's lead. we are monitoring the situation and we will provide an update on future calls.","Turning to the Federal Tax bill that passed late last year. while there is been a lot of attention on deduction limits related to state and local taxes, it\u2019s important to distinguish between renters and homeowners. For renters who don't deduct property taxes of mortgage interest the lower tax rates are a clear bids to after-tax income.","These new limits also reduced the tax incentive to buy a home likely resulting in greater demand for rental housing. The tech market in Northern California and Seattle should also benefit from the repatriation of cash held overseas by large tech burns amounting to hundreds of billions of dollars.","Apple has already announced plans to repatriate cash and expand domestically. Overall, there has been a lot of negative press related to the tax law changes and it\u2019s a fact on California, which generally appear to be overstated certainly from the prospective of apartment ownership.","Finally my third topic investment. Regarding asset values recent transaction activity indicates that cap rates remain stable. A quality property and locations continue to transact around a 4% to 4.25% cap rates using the FX methodology. These quality assets and locations are generally 25 to 50 basis points higher although often contemplate up side from reevaluate and\/or value activity.","With the recent most other sideline due to the cost to capital and a meaningful increase in apartment mortgage rates, there are fewer motivated apartment investors in the market as compared to a year ago. Recent increases in interest rates have caused some noise and negotiation, but ultimately cap rates have not changed at this point.","In December, one of our co-investment entities completed the sale of two properties each about 28 years old at about a 4.1% cap rate which represents a lower rate and higher valuation relative to my previous comments about cap rates.","During the quarter, we started one development in Hollywood which is the legacy project where we have the very little land basis. As previously noted, it has become very difficult to make new deals pencil given double-digit increase of construction costs coupled with slower rent growth in the recent past.","Therefore, we have not assumed enemy starts as part of our 2018 guidance. Overall, we are seeing a general pullback in development stars in our market, which we believe will lead to lower levels of new supply in most of our markets over the next several years.","Finally, we originated three preferred equity investments during the quarter for $65 million as outlined in the press release bringing our total commitment at year-end to $394 million. We expect to bifurcate the program into two parts going forward; the first part will be for under construction apartment properties, which will be capped at $400 million.","The second part will represent investments involving completed apartment properties, which will generally have a lower preferred return and will be subject to an aggregate cap of $500 million. We are currently seen a slowdown in our pipeline of opportunity to originate preferred equity deals confirming our belief that apartment development starts are moderating.","That concludes my comments. Thank you for joining our call today. I will now turn the call over to John.","John Burkart","Thank you, Mike. Essex finished the year with another good quarter. Our fourth quarter year-over-year same-store revenue and NOI growth was 3% and 3.4% respectively. Our same-store results were slightly better than our expectations due to higher occupancy and greater growth in other income and [indiscernible].","These results are evidence of another strong year for the Company and I want to thank the Essex team for the continued dedication to our success. As we mentioned on our third quarter conference call, market net growth peaked earlier than normal due to elevated supply and slower than expected job growth.","The negative impact of the early market net peak will continue as a headwind for revenue growth in 2018 due to the volume of leases that we signed during this summer leasing month with little to no increase over the expiring leases.","Concessions in the fourth quarter of 2017 were approximately 700,000 consistent with the fourth quarter of 2016, however geographically the allocation was very different. In the fourth quarter of 2017, 70% of the concessions were related to Southern California asset compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 with 90% of the concessions were related to Northern California asset.","As the concentration of new highly competitive lease ups has decreased in Northern California, the concessions are declining for the new lease up and disappearing in the stabilized communities as expected.","Moving forward, we expect to see a more typical seasonal pattern in rent growth, which is assumed as part of our 2018 forecast. Therefore, we expect our loss-to-lease to rebound quickly as we enter the peak leasing season.","Regarding the executive order signed by Governor Brown as a result of the devastating California wildfires, which effectively limits rent increases on all housing to 10% above the price in place when the order was signed in October of 2017. It has been extended for all of California until mid April 2018 and for selected counties in Southern California through June 2018.","Although the market rents are now increasing at that rate, the application of the law leads to selected challenges such as pricing short-term premium, selected renovation, et cetera. We do not expect that the temporary law that\u2019s currently applied to materially impact our earnings in 2018, however we are watching the situation closely.","Our full year expenses came in below our original guidance at 2.7% over the prior year as a result of the various cost saving initiatives that we have been working on. We were able to hold our controllable expenses to about 50 basis points year over prior year which helped offset the impact of the 7.3% increase in utility.","Now, I will provide an update on our markets. In Seattle, job growth remains strongest in the Essex portfolio posting year-over-year growth of 2.5% for the fourth quarter of 2017. Amazon continued to expand their Seattle footprint in Q4 adding over 300,000 square feet of space and bringing the total expansion for all of 2017 to just under two million square feet.","Additionally Microsoft announced a multi-billion dollar campus renovation and expansion in Redmond that will occur over the five to seven years and add up to 1.3 million square feet of new space. Office absorption in Seattle continues to be robust. In 2017 net absorption totaled 4.2% of existing stock, the highest percentage of any metro in the U.S.","Seattle\u2019s medium home prices grew at 14.6% year-over-year for the month of December making it the third fastest growing market in the Essex portfolio only surpassed by San Francisco and San Jose. Our year-over-year same-store revenues for the fourth of 2017 were led by the CBD and north submarkets at 4.8% to 4.9% respectively while the east side and south submarkets grew by 3.6% and 4.2% respectively.","Turning to Northern California. For the fourth quarter, job growth in the Bay area averaged 1.7% year-over-year. In San Francisco [indiscernible] and Airbnb signed new leases which added over 300,000 square feet to the downtown tech footprint. In San Mateo an extraordinary development, Station Park Green, Guidewire Software fully leased an under construction office project that is scheduled to be completed in the first half of this year.","Moving south, Facebook extended footprint across the Bay in Fremont the market where Essex owns just over 3,000 units with the new 190,000 square foot lease. Tesla also announced that they were expanding their Fremont office to accommodate 1,500 employees in addition to the 10,000 employees already in the market.","And in the South Bay WeWork [Agnostis] (Ph) signed leases totaling over 8,000 square feet. Over 13 million square feet of office is under construction in the Bay area with San Francisco accounting for nearly half the pipeline and more than 70% of which is pre-leased.","Home prices in the Bay area continue to soar, as tenants lease their portfolio of 24% year-over-year growth in December with medium home prices at $1 million, over four times the national average. Essex continues to perform well in the Bay area during the fourth quarter of 2017 with year-over-year same-store revenue growth led by a Fremont submarket at 5.4%.","Moving down to Southern California, in Los Angeles, job growth lagged the U.S. with 1% year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter. LA\u2019s tech footprint continued to expand during the quarter as evidenced by several noteworthy leases throughout the region.","Tesla, Facebook and Apple all signed new leases in LA during the quarter totaling 425,000 square feet from West LA to Culver City, co-working companies we work and states these leased in additional 150,000 square feet of office space in downtown and West LA.","Our LA year-over-year same store revenues for the fourth quarter grew at 4.6% in Long Beach, 3.7% in Tri-City, 3.3% in Woodland Hills and 1.7% in West LA. We saw a decline of 2.2% in the LA CBD due to elevated levels of new supply, which is leading to highly concessionary market.","Looking forward roughly 77% of the projected LA market 2018 supply is concentrated in the West LA as downtown submarkets, where two thirds of FX of LA portfolio is located. In the Orange County, year-over-year job growth improved in the fourth quarter to 1%, a 70 basis point increase from Q3.","Almost half of the 550,000 square feet of office absorption for the full year occurred in the fourth quarter of 2017, which is consistent with a pickup in job growth noted above. In the fourth quarter, our north and south submarkets grew at 5% and 3.3% year-over-year.","Finally, San Diego posted 1.3% year-over-year job growth for the fourth quarter, similar to Orange County almost half of the total full year\u2019s office absorption occurred in the fourth quarter of 2017.","All those supplies expected to increase in San Diego in 2018 over 50% of the supply is coming from the downturn submarket, where we only have one asset. San Diego's supply outside of the downtown is actually projected to be lower in 2018 compared to 2017. Currently, our portfolio is at 96.7% occupancy and our availability 30 days out is at 4.7%. Our renewals are being sent out at about 3.3% for the first quarter overall.","Thank you and I will now turn the call over to our CFO Angela Kleiman.","Angela Kleiman","Thank you, John. Today, I will focus on our 2018 guidance followed by capital market and balance sheet activity. Starting with our 2018 market outlook, page S16 of the supplemental provides an overview of the key healthy supply and demand assumptions supporting our market rent growth expectations.","In our West Coast markets overall, we expect similar total multifamily supply deliveries this year versus last year. Although our differences within each major region are more pronoun; for example, we expect Southern California supply to increase by 11% due to LA and San Diego.","In contrast, Northern California supply is expected to decrease by 28%, primarily attributed to San Francisco and San Jose. We noted that our key vendor, Axiometrics has significantly higher supply in our west and north in 2018.","In addition, their 2017 supply was also higher than ours and higher than what was actually delivered. From reconciling with them, we learned that Axio moved all of the delayed 2017 supply into 2018, but they have not yet made any adjustment for the expected delays in 2018.","Just a quick review of our process. We approach our supplier research with both a top-down and bottoms-up due diligence, which includes driving individual sides to verify the construction progress and we also state the delivery is consistent with how we would approach delivering our own projects.","Turning to demand. Historically, job growth in our markets outperformed the U.S. as Mike commented earlier. We expect that front to continue in 2018 with the forecast of 126% for our market compared to 1.4% nationally. Given this economic backdrop, we expect market rent growth of 3%, which is in line with a long-term average with multifamily fundamentals remain steady.","We expect revenue growth to lag market rent growth, which led to our 2018 guidance for same property revenue and NOI growth of 2.5% at the midpoint. Our forecast assumes lower revenue growth in the first half compared to the second half of the year as we rebuild more cities.","There is one reporting change to highlight. Starting in 2018, we are moving property management expenses out of same property operating expenses to be consistent with the peer group reporting. Going forward, property management expense will be reported on a separate line item on our income statement. This change has no impact to FFO or same property expense growth as the prior period will be restated to conform to the new reporting method.","Moving on to core FFO guidance. I\u2019m pleased to report that we planned to continue on our long track record of driving operating results to the bottom line. We expect core FFO to grow a 4.5% at the midpoint, which is 200 basis points higher than our expected same property NOI growth. Other key assumptions supporting our 2018 guidance starts on page four of the press release.","Turning to investment activity. In 2017, we last funded our external activities using a combination of this position proceed, joint venture capital and common equity accessing the most attractive capital force at the time. As for 2018, our only required funding needs are 200 million of debt maturities and 250 million of unfunded development commitment, which is only about 1% of our total market cap.","So far this year, we have repurchased approximately $3.8 million of common stock under our $250 million stock buyback program. We continue to be mindful of current market conditions in order to thoughtfully approach capital allocation and we planned to continue manage funding our investment activities with most attractive cost of capital and on our leverage mutual basis.","On to capital market and the balance sheet. Last month, we amended an increase our line of credit by $200 million to $1.2 billion, which is expendable to 2023. The upsize is primarily a function of the Company\u2019s growth as it\u2019s been over four years since we last increased the line. We have also improved our unsecured debt from 58% last year to 65% today.","Our balance sheet remained strong to 26% leverage and 5.6 times debt EBITDA with the life debt maturities and horizon and ample liquidity. We are starting the new year in a solid financial position.","That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Austin Wurschmidt from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Austin Wurschmidt","Hi. Good morning. Mike, the midpoint of your same-store revenue guidance assumes a deceleration versus what you achieved in the fourth quarter and Angela mentioned that you expect revenue growth to be lower in the first half of the year, which would imply pretty significant deceleration I guess early in the year versus the fourth quarter figure. What is driving that sizable decel given the fact that you expect the market rent growth in 2018 will be similar to 2017?","Michael Schall","Yes, Austin. I will make a couple of comments and then may be John Burkart would want to follow-up. It goes back to what happened in Q3 of 2017, in that, we had a period of very weak job growth, which led to a low demand period significant supply coming in. We signed leases at little or no increase and we carried those leases obviously for typically about a year.","And so we are going to carry those leases into the New Year and it\u2019s going to compress our growth a little bit. And then that changes as we get into 2018, we expect a more normal peak leasing season in 2018.","But again, jobs can change pretty abruptly anywhere in the United States, and therefore subject to how the demand curve looks versus how many units of supply come on throughout the year. John, do you have anything else to add?","John Burkart","Yes, I will just add that. Again, we feel good. We feel optimistic about this year going forward. But a part of it is a starting point issue as Mike said, and to put some numbers around that, in December 2016, our gain to lease was 50 basis points; in December 2017, our gain to lease was 200 basis points. So, we are in a sense, starting in a little bit more of a whole, but the outlook is very positive going forward.","Austin Wurschmidt","And so what does that assume in terms of What is earned then I guess going into 2018 from a revenue growth perspective?","John Burkart","Well the gain to lease means that our rents in place are 2% below the market \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, it is 2% below, where our rents in place are. So it means we are upside down. But again, there is a seasonality to it, so I\u2019m quoting you as a low demand point, but I\u2019m just trying to give you compare of 2016 versus 2017. But in reality to answer to your question, yes, rents in place at December were lower.","As you go forward into January, that 200 basis points gain to lease moves to 130 basis points gain to lease, so it improves and that\u2019s what will happen, seasonally rents will move up. We expect them to peak in this summer and they have a solid year. But my point is that the reason why we can have stronger revenue growth overall expected for 2018 over 2017 when we are looking at this really related to our starting point. Does that make sense?","Austin Wurschmidt","Yes, I know, that\u2019s helpful. I appreciate the commentary there. And then just secondly, as focused I guess specifically on Seattle, which was a market last year that surprised at the upside. It has the most or biggest magnitude of deceleration assumed in your 2018 guidance. And I guess I was just hoping you could provide some detail on the range of outcomes there and What is really driving the magnitude of that deceleration as well?","John Burkart","We\u2019ve mentioned for some time that Seattle has in a certain sense, there is a highest risk associated to it related to the supply that\u2019s out there and then job, and clearly jobs had slowed down some. What we saw at the end of last year was that in a low demand period. Seattle is the most seasonal market that we have. It can move up as much as 10 plus percent at the peak and then back down.","So, Seattle at the low point moved down to a gain to lease situation, where was at 490 almost 5% and then we are pulling out of that. So Seattle market has slowed down in part because of the supply or the demand slowed down, but we are seeing a pickup in demand as we had mentioned and expect Seattle to have a strong year, but it doesn\u2019t have the same tailwind that we\u2019ve had in the past.","Austin Wurschmidt","All right. Thanks for the time.","John Burkart","Sure. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Nick Joseph from Citi. Please go ahead.","Nick Joseph","Thanks. I appreciate the regulatory overview. Just in terms of the referendum movement on Costa-Hawkins. What's the process you did in that on the ballet? And then theoretically if it does make the ballet and taxes, is Costa-Hawkins immediately repealed or are there additional specs up to that?","Michael Schall","Yes, it\u2019s Mike here and John Eudy is also here and he is spending a fair amount of time on this issue for Essex. There is a qualification process, which includes signature gathering, which is currently occurring and we\u2019ll go on for another month or two. And at that point in time, we will know whether it would be qualified or not.","The industry is assuming that it will be qualified and so we have amounted pretty strong support opposing the effort, but I want to make sure everyone understands that the repeal of Costa-Hawkins does not immediately mean rent control, it is enacted that requires cities or local governments to pass different rent control ordinances. And I think on the last ballot some around half of them passed on and several passed out.","John Eudy","Less than a quarter.","Michael Schall","I know San Mateo, [indiscernible] were defeated and then one or two passed. So, there is a process here, this is not an immediate thing, but there is a process here and we feel pretty good about the effort to oppose the proposal.","Nick Joseph","But if it is on the ballot, State [indiscernible] the municipalities, if it does pass that, is it repealed from a state perspective or their additional steps at the legislature or anything outside tax that recurred before it actually is repealed?","Michael Schall","Yes. They would effectively repeal, it\u2019s a referendum, so that would effectively repeal it. Keep in mind in my comments I talked about 1506, which was a legislative proposal to repeal of Costa-Hawkins, which did not get out of committee either in 2017 or 2018.","And previously on the Q3 call, I talked about these 15 bills that were passed in California related to housing created more affordable housing developers, requiring developers to produce more affordable housing and process reforms involving cities and that type of things.","So, none of those things involved Costa-Hawkins and except for 1506, which didn\u2019t get out of committee in either year. So, I mean we feel pretty good with the legislators not fully behind this idea of repealing of Costa-Hawkins, because obviously, they would have taken actions if they did support it, but the value proposition is a completely different thing.","Nick Joseph","Thanks. And then what was the average price of the $4 million of share buybacks?","Angela Kleiman","Well, we bought some heading into the blackout, but the pricing has been in kind of low 220-ish range, I read and I gave out specific numbers, as you probably can understand why.","Nick Joseph","And then just if you were to continue to execute on a larger scale, how do you think about the timing of buybacks versus asset sales?","Angela Kleiman","I think ultimately, our plan is to have the buyback on a leverage neutral basis. And so it\u2019s a little bit harder to exactly match the timing of the stock buyback and the asset sales, but we do have asset sales planned and so it\u2019s going to be match fund as any of our other investment activities and I think you guys put in that piece about overtrading close to that 5% by cap rate, it makes the buyback very attractive that should be when we were selling assets at close to a low 4% cap rate.","Nick Joseph","Thanks. Are you comfortable buying back shares before and taking on the execution risk of selling assets later or do you need to sell the assets before executing?","Angela Kleiman","No, no. We don\u2019t need to sell the assets for executing. We are comfortable reaching it with our line. We have ample amount of capacity there.","Nick Joseph","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from John Kim from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","John Kim","It sounds like you\u2019re accounting for a lot of 2018 deliveries to be the late 2019, but can you provide some colors where you see 2019 supply versus 2018 in the market?","Michael Schall","Yes, John. It\u2019s Mike and again, others made pitching here. I have to say the visibility about supply is problematic. So, we compare our information with Axio and some of the other sources. It would be pretty confusing. So we sympathize with all of you out there. As Angela noted on her comments, we go on drive the properties, we have a little bit different methodology than Axio.","And so we make them to a little bit different conclusion, but the marks that we are most concerned about is downtown LA or LA let\u2019s say. When we started 2017, we had around 10,700 units expected to be delivered in LA, it\u2019s now by the end of 2017, it was 8700, so there is not 2000 units that were moved.","I think Axio had a much larger number moved. I think they went from 18,000 units, 19,000 units in 2018, which is a huge number, but they moved a lot more units and this is pretty confusing, because trying to track what's moved and what's not moved and the different assumptions that we understand is very confusing to everyone.","So having said all that, our view is that 2018 supply will ultimately be somewhere around 3% to 4% reduction from 17% and there are some variations by geography there, but a little bit left supply, the regional differences will be pretty significant.","LA primarily because of the move to cut units from the 2,000 units from 2017 to 2018, we will have an increased supply will go from about 8700 units to about 11,000 units, and that\u2019s the most significant increase I think across the portfolio. But again, we understand it\u2019s a challenge to bigger front around these numbers.","John Kim","So, is 2018 to peak in Southern California?","Michael Schall","Well, and again I think what will happen it depends for example on how many units get move from 2018 into 2019 assuming these construction delays continue, because I don\u2019t think Axio for example, certainly have not moved any of beginners from the end of 2018 into 2019 and so this is what is causing I think the confusion because these construction delays are more significant than anyone expected, and therefore it\u2019s moving these numbers in significant amounts and it is obscuring the picture.","I know in our case we think 2019 will be a little bit less than 2018 but not substantial. I think we\u2019ve kind of hit the peak of - let\u2019s say we are leveling out is in Northern California so it looks like the peak is in the path there, Southern California depends a little bit by market but and it appears that LA will continue to have significant supply going into 2019.","And Seattle will slowdown over the next couple of years as well. But again I think there will be some challenges in Southern California but Northern California, Seattle probably get better over the next couple of years.","John Kim","And then as part of your guidance you are mentioning that you are not going to have any development starts this year. Why not deliver into 2020, 2021 year, is this related to Costa-Hawkins or?","Michael Schall","No it relates more to you having risk premium for development yield and it goes back to what is the multi-year effect of the things we\u2019ve been talking about mainly that construction costs are going up somewhere around 10% and rents are not going up anywhere near that.","So your cap rates are compressing and lot of cap rates out there that are in the 4.5 plus or minus range measured today and so you just don\u2019t get there. I mean all things being equal we would rather acquire and not take the development risk unless there is a risk premium for development.","So John Eudy is here, he underwrites a lot of development deals. What is interesting is, even deals that appear to have attractive land basis and have decent agreements with the city as to affordable units which we obviously lose money on every affordable unit and therefore increase of the cost relative to the recurrence of these assets. And as a result, we are just not seeing the yields that we need to make significant investment and development.","John Kim","Thanks for the color.","Michael Schall","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Nick Yulico from UBS. Please go ahead.","Nick Yulico","Thanks. Mike you talked about cap rates not having moved higher yet, but interests up sharply. Do you think it\u2019s reasonable cap rates increase this year? And I guess going back to the development question, is that also shaping your decision making and not starting more development projects this year?","Michael Schall","Not really, I mean interest rates are going up a little bit and I think as long as on the longer term obviously a lot of on the short end of the curve. But as long as there is positive leverage, I think it\u2019s a good thing for real estate. And so we are still seeing five to seven year mortgage somewhere in the 4% range.","So there is still a little bit of a positive leverage. And I remember back to periods of time when we had significant negative leverage and real estate did pretty well then as well. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily interest rates it is causing the problem here. You want to follow up to that?","Nick Yulico","Yes, just one another question here. When you give on S-16 where you give the market forecast for economic rent growth. can you just remind me does that number that\u2019s not just new lease growth like for example if you look at the recent actual data on Seattle its shown new lease growth for the whole market in 1% to 2% range and your number here is higher than that. So just trying to make sure I understand that. and then also if you could explain how you are thinking about new lease pricing in Seattle? Where is that right now? And whether it improves or gets worse as the year goes on?","Michael Schall","Yes, I will have john to handle the second part of that. the first part S-16 that is meant to be a broad measure of the marketplace really based on a scenario the scenario is how many jobs did we produce, how many units have supplied those for sale and rental, did we produce during that period of time and what does that mean for rents.","So as you saw last year these numbers can be wrong they represent a scenario what we think is going to happen and then we midcourse correct throughout the year. So based on 201,000 jobs being produced 1.6% we cover the supply about three to one on jobs the long-term relationship is typically two to one.","And as a result of that we feel pretty good about supply and demand, we feel good that California is going to continue to have a pretty significant housing shortage. And therefore we think the economic rent growth will improve in 2018. And that is what is reflected here.","So it's not meant to be us, it\u2019s meant to be the broad measure of the marketplace based on how we see supply and demand for the market. And what we do may vary a little by that but that goes back into the budget. And john do you want to kind of reconcile from the market forecast to what we budgeted.","John Eudy","Sure let me just step back for a second and the comment on the activity data that you are seeing. The information we see right now is relatively consistent, in Seattle our year-over-year I think it was probably close to 70 basis points year-over-year in December, but realize that that market is the most seasonal market. So as I said before, it will move up over 10% at the peak and then back down again.","So we really are sampling it at the wrong time, because what happens with supply deliveries, property management operating companies tend to a pretty focused on the absorption amount the number of units they want and when you deliver units into the slow demand period you end up having to push pricing down.","So that\u2019s largely what is occurred there and our expectations are as we move through the season things we will improve pretty dramatically. But going on to what we see housing for Essex in Seattle going forward again we're starting in a whole as mentioned 4.9 or 490 basis points gained to lease right now.","So even though we have an optimistic outlook our expectations are more in line well they are exactly in line with our guidance that we laid out for Seattle on revenue. So those won't be as strong as it has been in the past but still another good year.","Nick Yulico","So if I could just sum it up and it sounds like what you are saying is that overall you think Seattle is the market that\u2019s going to put up little over 3% rent growth this year and don\u2019t worry about the leasing numbers from January, December which are more seasonal that are showing new lease growth below that?","John Eudy","Absolutely, correct. If the demand fixed up you will see the rent starts to move pretty dramatically. I think what we saw in the fourth quarter was, the supply have an exceptional impact on pricing, but as demand picks, things will come closer to equilibrium and the rents will move pretty dramatically.","Angela Kleiman","Again, as they always do. I mean I think last year, we were up in Seattle from the beginning of the year about 12%.","Michael Schall","12% in the peak and then same thing in 16.","Angela Kleiman","These numbers move significantly. And when we talk about seasonality, what we're really saying is, jobs are not irritable throughout the year. They are very seasonal. You get into the fourth quarter and the colder markets are -- Seattle worse for this reason, jobs put to a trickle, and if you end up with bunch of apartments delivering during that period, you have a period of zero demand delivering apartments. So you\u2019re trying as a landlord to pull people out of the stabilized communities, which is where concessions pick up both on the lease ups and in the stabilized portfolio.","So, this is the way that the rental markets work, and so pricing to move around pretty significantly, certainly more with as job got slows and amount of apartment deliveries increases. When those don\u2019t connect timing wise, you end up pretty significant swings in rent as you would imagine, and then as soon as the apartment deliver or stabilize, the lease up to stabilize then you go back to a period of no concession.","So this is what's driving this market, that was causing the volatility of pricing that\u2019s what limits our visibility or anyone\u2019s visibility in the marketplace, we don\u2019t know exactly how many units are coming and exactly when they are coming. And so, there is a certain amount of just trying to understand market the best we can, and then reacting appropriately when things occur. So, this is a forecast, big picture forecast, and when you get into the market that will -- it will depend on exactly who is delivering and what type of concessions they are offering and how we react to that.","Operator","Our next question is from Juan Sanabria from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Juan Sanabria","Just hoping you could talk to where you see the best potential usage of capital, including a buyback with all the different options you have preferred redevelopment et cetera, acquisitions, kind of highlighted the feelings on potential preferred investments kind of above where you are today. So hope you could kind of outline where you see the best opportunities?","Michael Schall","Hi Juan, it\u2019s Mike. It\u2019s a good question and the scenario has changed pretty rapidly over the last quarter in terms of stock price. So, obviously we -- as Angela said, we completed some stock buyback, so we've done that attractive relative to acquisitions that we\u2019re seeing and we also liked the preferred equity program and that becomes how do you fund that, obviously issuing common stock at current prices doesn\u2019t make sense to us and rather beyond the other side of that equation.","And so, I think the disposition process is one that's kind of in full swing here, and I think that\u2019s the way that yours going to play out. It\u2019s interesting we had almost exact same comments about cap rates, interest rates a year ago. We had a plan that was much the same conference call that was much the same and it changed throughout the year because the stock recovered I think was started the year in somewhere around the 225 level and went back to 270. And so, these things are fluid discussions again reacting to changing conditions in a thoughtful way, and I think there\u2019s a good chance that 2018 will be one of those years.","Juan Sanabria","And just on the preferred breaking out now two kind of separate buckets. What\u2019s the strategy behind that? What drove that new line of thinking?","Michael Schall","Yes, the strategy is that you\u2019re trying to really separate the preferred because there\u2019s a different risk element with respect to an under construction project in, which you get a higher return for that. But we also think that let\u2019s say that you are in the 8% to 9% range for a stabilized community. Yes, we think that that is an attractive programs and in fact we had at least one deal last year that converted from a under construction to a stabilized community at a lower preferred returns.","We\u2019ve had acknowledged that that\u2019s an attractive business too, again relative to the opportunities that we are seeing on in the marketplace and we have wanted to create a bucket for the lower risk and a bit lower preferred return of properties that are in that area. We also depending upon what happens with rent growth, some of the refinances of the development deals may be a little bit short and that creates a bucket to continue to be involved in those transactions.","Juan Sanabria","And then you kind of talked about Seattle a bit in terms of your spot off the leased. Would you mind kind of hitting on the other two major markets?","John Burkart","Sure, this is John. In December '17, SoCal, we had a gain to lease of 90 basis points and that obviously improved in January, so now a 30 basis point. The NorCal, it was 190 basis points gain to lease and now it\u2019s also improved to a 130 basis point. I mentioned Seattle which was 490 basis points in December and it\u2019s improved to 420 now. So, overall the Company went from about 200 basis points gain to lease to a 130 basis points gain to lease in January. Again, right at signs, things are improving, the December numbers are the low point but things are going in the right direction as we\u2019ve planned.","Operator","Our next question is from Rich Hill from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Rich Hill","Just following up on a couple of comments that you made previously, I just want to make sure I understand. Why are seeing this construction blaze at this point? You mentioned rising construction costs, there\u2019s also a lack of available skilled labor. Why are these projects getting pushed out at this point in time? Or the delivery shut site, sorry about that.","John Eudy","This is John Eudy. You hit it on the head. Lack of skilled labor is the main reason and short of that in order to answer.","Rich Hill","Okay, great. It would enough answer then. And then just another follow-up question, you guys seemed to have a really good handle on job growth, so two parts here. Remind us about what happened in 2016, when job growth may be slowed more than what the market was expecting? What gives you confidence that that\u2019s not going to happen this time? And then secondly, I've heard a lot of discussions about job growth, but not a lot of discussions about income growth. And I am wondering as income growth starts to pick up. Is that more of a tailwind than it\u2019s been previously the rent inflation particularly, if household formations start to increase as people don\u2019t double up any more, people move out of the parents houses. How are you thinking about income growth going forward? And is it more or less important than it's been in the past?","Michael Schall","Great questions. So having a good handle on job growth, I don't think anyone in the room processes to have a good handle on job out here. It bounces around like crazy. We attached schedule 16.1 to demonstrate the volatility of job growth. And the problem that we talked about on last quarter call, which I think surprised everyone. But jobs are going to do what they are going to do, we don't have any particular insight into the jobs are going to whether going to go up or down.","And so, I'll have to distance myself from that one. We are just going to be a cog in the wheel. We do look at some of the broader indicators. I mentioned for example having 5% to 6% office construction or 5% to 6% of the office stock under construction for delivery in the future I mean presumably those landlords are not building the buildings and much are going to be occupied by workers that therefore we think that that's an interesting forward indicator. And it's interesting to look at 5% to 6% of the office buildings under construction versus the 1.4% growth job growth and 0.8% overall supply growth.","So again we try to determine whether we have a supply or demand in balance which we think is in favor of California ultimately however it can be messy in terms of how all that plays out. So that\u2019s kind of a job growth picture. We are going to have to wait and see what -- again F-16 is our planning mechanism. So, we are trying to understand the world in which we live and because some of these decisions that we have to make about asset sales which markets to select et cetera they require some template of what you think is going to happen.","So that\u2019s what F-16 really is useful for us to. It will change and we expect it to change but again for -- to have a good planning process you need to have a pretty good starting point. And as to the second point income growth, we totally grew with it. We think that is the key metric. And in my comments I mentioned that wage inflation is ultimately a very good thing for apartments.","And we think that is a pretty significant potential tailwind for us again subject to supply and demand. And these personal income numbers and the slow amending of the rent to income ratios are positive signs for us and those are really the things that we are planning to give us confidence that we are going to hit these economic rent growth numbers in 2018.","Operator","Our next question is from Alexander Goldfarb from Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.","Alexander Goldfarb","Mike, just a quick question on the peak leasing season. Last year, you guys mentioned that it peaked earlier because of supply and jobs. What are some other things that you would look for this year? It sounds like you think this year should be more of normal one, but what would give you pause that this year could end up being similar to last especially, if supply is being pushed into this year, and so far employers are having a tough time finding people to fill the spots?","Michael Schall","Alex, welcome to the call. It\u2019s a good question. Again, I think it\u2019s all about jobs and we have pretty good idea what's happening on the supply front. We send our people out to walk the buildings and try to understand as well as anyone what's happening. We keep track of each year\u2019s production of housing how many units that delivered in each year. And so, the good thing is, we don't have any confusion about what is going on the supply side. Here you know again, we look at where we started last year where we ended and that type of things.","The real issue comes back to jobs and as we said on last quarter\u2019s call which affecting the shape of the curve this year and how our rents grow and why we will decelerate into Q2 and then turn the corner this year, I mean all that is related to what happened last year in the third quarter which to remind everyone it was basically a job drive. We ended up with fewer non firm jobs at the end of the third quarter than we had at the end of the second quarter.","I think it was incredibly unusual and not something that we could anticipate, there was nothing in the numbers. If you look at open provision that various tech companies had or whatever data that we might have there was nothing that really indicated that that was going to happen. And so again we don\u2019t have any great inside into the jobs during the quarter and so like everyone else waiting for those specifics. So I can\u2019t help you more than that how lot our process what is mean to us and again we\u2019ll adjust to the world that we experience it.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. And then the second question is, on the rent control just a few things here; one, it almost sounds like the governor or whoever the governor end up being next election could almost [indiscernible] invoke sort of a rent control by capping price increase. But if they do repeal Costa-Hawkins, is there any sense that they would impose income limits on who can have rent control? And would they could see decontrol be eliminated as well, so you\u2019d be sort of locked in, you couldn\u2019t bring that unit to market, you\u2019d be capped and how much you did increase the price of a vacant unit?","Michael Schall","Yes, Alex, I mean you are way down the road ahead us on that. I mean I think that we are following up with respect to what's happening now. John, do you have something?","John Burkart","Just one follow-on, Alex. If the Costa-Hawkins did get repeal it just enables local peer rent control. And yes, it would not protect, if you will the vacancy control issue. But one important aspect in rent control orders that are in place, it does have a provision that requires a fair return to the owner, which basically if you took away they can see decontrol you just took their rate return away.","So, even if individual city decided to an act that control there would be other measures we could look to keep vacancy decontrol that\u2019s speculative in the future right now. We think we have a good choppy industry is organized at foot pushing back assuming that development does go forward in November. So we\u2019ll monitor closely and we\u2019ll report while a better update for you.","Operator","Our next question is from Drew Babin from Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.","Drew Babin","Two questions on east day, which we haven\u2019t talked about a whole lot. Looking there was a big sequential kind of pick up both Alameda and Contra Costa counties. In the fourth quarter, I was curious what specifically is happening there, if anything in those markets?","Michael Schall","That\u2019s a combination of a few things. As I mentioned in the comments on the call, there is clearly a pick up as it related to jobs, we noted Facebook and Tesla and others that are out there which is clearly a positive thing for that portfolio. There\u2019s also a year-over-year benefit in the sense that -- which makes the comp easier in the Alameda area due to last year\u2019s movement in pricing, we ended up with more vacancy a year ago. So we had a benefit from a year-over-year, but it\u2019s really both of those combined, the positive jobs that we\u2019re seeing out there, high gain jobs out there as well as the benefit from the easier comp.","Drew Babin","Okay. And then on the -- I guess taking the other end of the wage growth equation, as it pertains to end portfolio. I guess what\u2019s in there because it seems to extend the guidance for '18 in terms of payroll at the property level and it\u2019s becoming harder and harder to retain quality, recent pushing on this environment?","Michael Schall","Yes, it is overall. We struggle and we are working hard to pay all of our team fairly and we had increased wages, the wage rate goes up somewhat significantly. But we have been able to find offsets in other areas by operating more efficient way. One of the areas we mentioned previously was our asset collections. And so we\u2019ve found opportunities to reduce labor and vendor cost by bidding out the collected assets as groups and what not. And so that\u2019s enabled us to keep the expenses under control while we continue to push our wages and meet the market there. I think last year our wages were probably up 5% for our staff on the sites. But again it is a struggle, not doubt.","Drew Babin","That\u2019s helpful. And one last one just on kind of bread and butter acquisition whether they're current JVs or wholly owned. It seems from some of the commentary that I guess with potential. Acquisition cap rates could potentially exceed kind of the average disposition cap rate. Should they be in the low 4s kind of in some of the recent transactions have illustrated? I guess, can you talk about what\u2019s being assumed in guidance as far as acquisition and disposition cap rates more specifically?","Michael Schall","We are assuming that we will be in the 4% to 4.5% range on acquisitions. Dispositions, it depends on how we execute dispositions. You may recall a year ago that we did a -- we took several assets and contributed them into a joint venture entity and put some loans on it and took some capital out that way. That would be one of the things we\u2019re thinking about. But we are working on it and I don\u2019t want to give any more specific guidance because we have a variety of strategies that we\u2019ll work on and pick the best one. And we just don\u2019t have -- we are not at the level -- we are not ready to give that type of guidance and that level of detail.","Operator","Our next question is from Dennis McGill from Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead.","Dennis McGill","First question, just Mike your tone I would say sounds much more positive today than it did three months ago and you walks through kind of job, shift and the uptick in the government data there. But then, you also acknowledged that data can bounce around and at time it can be pretty volatile and sometimes follow over the things of the market though. So, is it fair to call you more optimistic today, and if so, is there anything else you would point to besides the job data that leaves you there?","Michael Schall","Dennis, that\u2019s good question. Today, 16.1 of supplement really outlines why we are so much more optimistic and it really is all about jobs. So, we feel like we have a good handle on supply. And we have a good handle on affordability. And we need these jobs I mean that really comes down to that. When we saw Q3 essentially not produce any job which is very unusual, and started thinking about well is this a trend or is this a data point? That was a distressing discussion, and obviously we didn\u2019t know. And so when Q4 came back and came back pretty darn strong when you look at the December over December numbers it gives us a lot of confidence.","Dennis McGill","And then, earlier timing as well about the shift in or the difference in first half versus second half for rent growth, how much variation is there around that 2.5% midpoint?","Angela Kleiman","Not a whole lot, I mean we are talking about somewhere in the low twos in the first half versus similar to higher high twos in the second half, so between say 25 to 50 basis points for the range.","Dennis McGill","And then just one last technical question. When you guys do your supply work on year end, do you draw a line as far as how big development needs to be before you considered it to be competitive?","Michael Schall","50 units, is our -- yes that was the -- we tried to conform because there were so many different assumptions out there that we are trying to simplify the data, and we are trying to conform to action. We have that comment on a conference call in the past year at some point and time. So again, we tried to take out senior student et cetera and then focused on 50 and above. And I think that the other difference that different people have is the denominator.","We are using I think everything I think it\u2019s a entire stock especially California has so must older housing that if you eliminate the smaller units out of the denominator in this calculation, you get some pretty whacko. So, anyway that\u2019s how we do it and that was conforming to active. And again, the acting numbers have moved so substantially that we are still trying to reconcile what Angela said, our number to their numbers.","Operator","Our next question is from Omotayo Okusanya from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Omotayo Okusanya","I just wanted to go back to the question on same-store OpEx and again with everyone really talking about big increases in payroll and taxes. Trying to understand what assumptions you are making about other payroll expenses just to kind of get to this 2% to 3% same store OpEx for '18?","Michael Schall","We do expect our payroll for a site level people to continue to move and I don\u2019t have that -- I'm not going to give up the details with the numbers, but it will move. It's an aggressive area. We are meeting the market as it relates the compensation there, but what we are finding again is offset and opportunities. So our controllable expenses we expect next year to also be down. We did a very good job this year. The team did an outstanding job as a matter of fact along the lines of controllable. And we expect that same thing to happen in the next year.","So at the end of the day even though we're increasing our competition for the site level people at market and market is moving rather aggressively, we are finding opportunities, we have done various things from restructure our call center to making adjustments in market even and elsewhere to offset cost. So, we expect control that the areas that cost are moving more that harder to control relate to utilities.","There is a lot of work that\u2019s being done in California certainly on utilities that relates to infrastructure it relates to accomplishing the objectives for the green requirement which require the utilities to buy certain amounts of energy from solar and other renewable sources which is increasing cost and we\u2019ve also done work there in the sense of installing TV panels and other things, but that utilities as a higher growth area on expenses.","Omotayo Okusanya","So what are the things that can come down? Is it like more of the office expenses, advertising? I\u2019m just kind of curious like what those offsets can be after as to look how much kind of control that last year?","Michael Schall","Well, I don\u2019t want to net to give away all of our playbook to our peer. But again, we are doing what we can to leverage technology. I've mentioned the call center, we recent restructures there in the last five, six months. And we continue to find opportunities to make win-win environment. I mean interestingly on the asset collections, it was really a win-win. It's not a grinding down vendors, it\u2019s a matter of us providing a package that reduces their communities from asset to asset and ultimately saves their labor costs and then that was driven through that came back to us. So, again, I don\u2019t want to go into extreme amounts of details, but we do expect to maintain a strong hold of controllable and keeping down to about 1% year-over-year.","Omotayo Okusanya","And then, I don\u2019t know if you answered this before and I may have missed it, but the big increase in things of OpEx for I think was Seattle for the quarter and then the big decline in Northern California. We do kind of talk a little bit about what kind of happened in the quarter?","Michael Schall","Well, actually, I allow Angela to go ahead with that.","Angela Kleiman","Yes, in Seattle, it\u2019s really property tax driven, no surprise there. And it\u2019s consistent with what we had expected and budgeted. So we ended up coming in, the year coming in line with that 2.7 as planned.","Omotayo Okusanya","And then Northern California to decrease?","Michael Schall","Just timing issues, I mean with expenses, they don\u2019t follow rents. We look at them closely of course monthly daily. Expenses are better looked that over the course of the year their ends up being timing issues there. So, the numbers move around a little bit, but nothing that indicates the change in the future.","Angela Kleiman","Yes and keep in mind there, something like repairs and maintenance, we have controlled as far as when those get implemented. But we don\u2019t specifically say, they are going to be done in second quarter or third quarter, we planned that we\u2019re going to do it over the year and it\u2019s really depend on what the focus for the operation team is at the time. And so when we focus under leasing that these were not going to distract by saying driven also have to get the repair and maintenance done.","Operator","Our next question is from John Guinee from Stifel. Please go ahead.","John Guinee","Great. John Guinee here. I guess Mike or maybe John, your Station Park Green, Phase III and then Hollywood looks like your 721,000 units and 500,000 units. Can you talk about I guess three things. One is what exactly you\u2019re building for 721 and 500,000 unit what kind of property type? Two, what that cost would be, if it was fair market land? And then three, what sort of yield are you expecting on these developments as your basis and then also at a fair market land basis?","John Eudy","This is John Eudy, I will try to answer all those questions. But just to start off with Station Park Green is core peninsula top of San Francisco and the building type, it\u2019s a tight high density type 3, if that means anything to you meaning expensive to build. Our land basis is just over 100 a door. It has a 10% affordable requirement. We just opened up our leasing ops about 10 days ago. And I can tell you we\u2019re having a very good reaction and there\u2019s a lot of construction around it obviously days two and three right next door.","The difference between that 720,000 versus Hollywood is rent driven. Rents in Northern California are in the high $3 square foot and Southern California, it\u2019s obviously less and in Southern California we have a much lower land basis as Mike mentioned. The legacy land basis of Hollywood is about 68,000 a door versus over a 100,000 in Northern California, and much higher up here as well. If we mark them to market on what the land would get sold for, in both cases it would be about 50,000 to 70,000 a door more in both San Mateo and Hollywood. Cap rates, we expect both to be right at about 5% and if we mark it to market that would under 4.5%. Those are the round numbers for it.","John Guinee","Okay, perfect. So what you are saying Mike is that the reason you are not developing is that has market rate land, the yield of development is 4.5%?","John Eudy","Okay. You asked a question on -- this is John Eudy again, on parking or land market, what\u2019s happened on both cases is the cost of production has gone up. So there\u2019s another quarter or two half way if we rebuilt those with the mark to market on the land and today\u2019s construction costs.","Operator","The next question is from Conor Wagner from Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.","Conor Wagner","May be Angela or John, could you give us some insight on the other income in the fourth quarter? It seem like it grew around 6% versus 2% and 2.8% for the rental revenue?","Angela Kleiman","It\u2019s a combination of once performing better than expected, we had anticipated kind of in that high twos range and it came in the threes and on the right on the scheduled rent piece of it. And other income also performed better than expected. So, it would be\u2026","Conor Wagner","What was the other income though? Is there anything -- so is any one-items there and may be as you segway and so what your expectation for other income is in the \u201818 guidance?","Angela Kleiman","Yes, it is mostly driven by rev and as you can see our utility costs have gone up so correspondingly the revs income has also increased. And so, we expect similar relationship in 2018.","Conor Wagner","Okay. And then you had I think bad debt payback in 1Q \u201817, is there anything like that in terms of the headwinds on the other income side? Or just again anything we should, that we done necessarily have visibility on outside of just the organic demand?","Angela Kleiman","Yes, to your point that was a one-time item and we don\u2019t see that recurring in 2018.","Conor Wagner","And then Mike on the regulatory front, it seems like things are moving more and more towards greater housing production or some sort of reaction to the chronic housing started what you spoke about the call. Could you give us some comments on first John maybe the impact of SP35, I think they released that. Most cities in California can now be subject to a streamline process on any development that has 10% affordable? And then if you could give us your thoughts on SPA27 the one that would allow reduce cities ability to enact zoning ordinances around mass transit development?","Michael Schall","It's Mike, Connor. Our experience and over many years and the recent activity and you may want to add Vision [indiscernible] County through that. All of these things that require prevailing wage or affordable unit mandates or density bonuses in San Francisco has once density bonus for more 30% affordable units. All these things have the affect generally of increasing cost, and when you increase cost, again you know what's happening with rents. When you're increasing cost to a greater extent, it just puts more pressure on the cap rate.","And the number of deals that penciled are fewer, which is I think part of these measures had been -- had the effect of actually having less housing being produced, which is why we are confident that when you look at starts that they are trending down, not that they are going to zero, we are not saying that. And as you look at northern California which has gone from somewhere around 10,500 units in '17 and it will be probably 7,500 in '18 and about the same in '19. That\u2019s a pace that I think probably level off that lets say.","And one of the factors here, again the construction cost increases these additional mandates from the cities to produce more housing, some of which as you point out come back to the developer, and what that means for the overall economics of the deal. I think it just continues to pressure the deals. Again, we all know there is a housing shortage here and California was first and we want there to be affordable housing. Unfortunately, most of these laws and rules and proposition have an unintended consequence of driving cost up and reducing our deals, which makes development difficult to pencil, hence my comments.","Conor Wagner","And do you see A27 is likely to get to the assembly?","Michael Schall","I think it will, but it doesn\u2019t really -- it does, you are talking about TOD high density residential state control.","Conor Wagner","Yes.","Michael Schall","Yes, it clearly I think it will. That doesn\u2019t change the economics again getting to Mikes comment on and I don't believe that there are that many barriers to those transactions going residential to be honest with you at a practical level when you get to TOD station to TOD station. There has been encouragement to develop residential. So, that\u2019s one more step to help make it easier, but it doesn't make it happen.","John Burkart","Yes, I mean they all do the same thing ultimately. And again, so I don\u2019t think you should focus on any one per se because truly the collection of all of them and that\u2019s what given us part of our confidence with respect to supply not going crazy in California. The one can bury that we have the most concern is really L.A. and really downtown L.A., which we also think is probably the long-term beneficiary of it as well because that basically transforms the downtown into it more and more of the 24 hour city. And right now, I recently took my wife down there for a romantic evening of visiting Essex Apartment communities at night and it\u2019s amazing, the amount of construction and just general activity there basically the downtown is not really arrived yet, but it\u2019s going to be I think a pretty special place setting down the years from now.","Conor Wagner","I hope you think you have better plans for next Wednesday?","Michael Schall","Yes.","Conor Wagner","Just again property that maybe just kind of follow up again knowing that this builds specifically aren't going to do much, but it seems like the overall direction in California is towards try to address this housing crisis and it seems to have major gap right now is the funding. What is your concern about the state enacting some changes to get the funding either through increased tax on landlords or again there is a proposal for the ballot to repeal Prop 13 on non-residential commercial building. What you guys are concerned maybe over multiyear period that the state is going to come after you in some way for more money?","Michael Schall","Yes, that's a good question and yes, as you point out is. There is a ballot proposition underway to create a split role. And but fortunately, it\u2019s clear in that case that multifamily is on the side of residential therefore we'd maintain the same rules. And in that deal, it was pretty filed pretty late in terms of the process. And so, we\u2019re not sure exactly where it\u2019s going to go, but we\u2019re keeping an eye on it and we\u2019ll continue to watch it as time goes on.","You do have, on this development side, you do have other things that come into play John mentioned whatever earlier which is we have the right to a fair return on our property and so there is a limitation, and there are also core cases that restrict cities ability to change the rules and require densely and let they give something.","So in other words if you require a zoning change or more density or any number of things from the city that triggers a variety of requirements, which could include prevailing wage, could include other items that will affect your cost. So, it probably is simple as the governments can and act whatever they want and we\u2019re just going to have to live with it.","There are some boundaries out there that I think are important here and we\u2019ll prevent it from getting completely out of whack. And I guess it maybe the final comment I\u2019ve made which I commented on earlier is, the 15 bills were passed in California in September that I commented on the Q3 call.","Again, they were trying to come up with process reforms panelizing cities that didn\u2019t produce housing, four cities to produce more housing and funding more affordable housing programs with the bond issue and other.","So that, those were pretty constructive from our perspective and we think those were the right direction with respect to trying to address the affordable housing issue and the chronic shortage we have here in California as to affordable housing. So, I think that good progress has been made and we just hope for kind of more of the same thing.","Conor Wagner","Yes, but those bills you know that the funding isn't there to do it and the bond issue into the -- a drop in the bucket compared to what's needed right, I mean that issues in last state forest land to re-price, most of the things don't cancel due to the affordability requirements or union wages. So it seems like the first step is getting these cities to rezone, to you know streamline projects, but the economics still aren't there. And so I guess my concern would just be, when the state takes the next step to tackle the economics, they're either going to have can they mandate land prices or they're going to try and find the funding to build the house, this housing through some other means.","Michael Schall","You know, Conor we're spending our effort on what is right in front of us. So we have -- the repeal of Costa- Hawkins, we have a number of issues that are here or we're pretty focused on, remaining targeting our efforts towards opposing those proposals. And we'll see what happens down the road. Again almost all of these things have unintended consequences which are put the burden back on the developer, which is going to compress their yield and actually are going to make the problem worse.","So I don't know what's going to happen, I've seen a lot of proposals come and go and you know at the end of the day you have to believe that there will be reason and\/or something will get passed and then they will realize -- they will realize the unintended consequence and then they will have to change it. So we have to assume that reason will prevail end of the day.","Operator","My next question is from Karin Ford from MUFG Securities. Please go ahead.","Karin Ford","Hi, sorry to drag this out. Just a couple of quick questions. First, on your 2018 disposition plans to, do you expect to sell any properties to condo convertors this year?","Michael Schall","Hi, Karin, it's Mike. I don\u2019t know, I mean that is out there is part of you know the opportunities that I've commented on this before that we're -- we've looked at several properties. And when you look at the for sale price activity in California there were some very large numbers there. California in total was up 9.5% and there were some Bay Area cities or areas that were up in the 15 to 20% median price home increased year-over-year. And that would be positive for the spread between condo values and apartment values.","However, as I mentioned on the call, we also have the new tax law which is probably part of the reason for pushing up prices in the fourth quarter, as people were trying to lock in the deductibility of their mortgage. So we may see that turnaround because actually we think that it'll be a headwind to home ownership going into 2018 given the new tax law.","Karin Ford","Great, thanks. And my second question is just on the preferred equity program. If memory serves, I think you talked on the last call that you might want to reduce the programs that was hitting sort of $400 million level. And now it appears you're pushing your cap up to that 900 million. Can you just talk about your decision to give on? Is it just because you are taking the risk level down on the program a little bit?","Michael Schall","We took further program and looked at it and we realized it really does have two very different components. And so, we would like to return on it. The question is what is the risk relative to that return and how does that compared to the other options that we have to invest money. And we decided in the current environment that both pieces of that business are important and attractive to us. Both the under construction piece, but then we should be separating is really separate piece be the financing on apartment buildings that are completed where essentially the risk is mostly out of the equation.","So, we found them both attractive and we wanted to have that ability, and so we went to the board, and they improved the program as submitted. In terms of can we get to the 500 million on the completed apartments, I'm not sure we are able to get there, certainly not going to get there any time soon. So I think practically speaking, we are going to -- the program will be probably in the 500 million plus or minus range, although we will see what happens because we wanted to have the ability to increase it from there if we saw the opportunity.","Operator","And we will take our last question from Juan Sanabria from Bank of America Merrill. Please go ahead.","Juan Sanabria","Sorry just a quick modeling question. Can you guys give us a sense of the new and renewal spreads you guys got in the fourth quarter in January as well as what's embedded in guidance?","Michael Schall","Let me give you this kind of summary here. So in the going forward Q3, I'm sorry, Q1 we are setting our renewals at about 3.3. If we go back to Q4, our renewals were at about 3.4. So they are down a little bit, our new leases in Q4 average at about 1.4%, so below the renewal.","Juan Sanabria","And do you guys expect any occupancy gains or declines or steady in '18 as part of guidance?","Michael Schall","Steady in '18 as part of guidance and you know we are major focused on how we can optimize revenue. So, the plan is steady and our occupancy is relatively high for the market, but as we see opportunities we will make adjustments, strategic adjustments to optimize the returns on the market by market basis.","Operator","This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Schall for any closing comments.","Michael Schall","Thank you, operator, and thanks everyone, really appreciate your participation on the call. Sorry for its length. And we look forward to seeing many of you at the Citi Conference in March. Have a good day.","Operator","This concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation.

[Operator Instructions] ","Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs, as well as information available to the company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found in the company's filings with the SEC.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you, Mr. Schall. You may now begin.","Michael J. Schall","Thank you, and welcome, everyone, to our first quarter earnings call. ","Erik Alexander and Mike Dance will follow me with brief comments on operations and finance, respectively. John Eudy, John Burkart and John Lopez are here for Q&A. I'll cover the following topics on the call: Q1 results and market commentary; second, investment markets; and third, disposition activity.","First topic, Q1 results and market commentary. Last evening, we reported FFO and core FFO of $1.63 per share for the first quarter of '12, which is ahead of our internal expectation and above consensus. We continued to see strong growth in Northern California and Seattle and a continuation of a steady recovery in Southern California, demonstrated by exceptional same-store NOI and revenue growth of 11.2% and 7.1%, respectively. ","This result reinforces our expectation for a strong 2012, driven by very limited supplies of housing and job growth that exceeds national averages in Northern California and Seattle and is near the national average in Southern California. We don't see a significant departure from this basic theme until at least 2014. Erik will discuss portfolio trends in greater detail. ","Our projections for rental and for-sale housing supply for 2012 are included on Page S-15 of the supplement. As expected, we see continued growth in multi-family deliveries in many of our target markets. We closely track the supply of both rental and for-sale housing and project deliveries through 2014. From now through 2014, the largest percentage addition to the existing multi-family stock occurs in San Jose, where we expect multi-family deliveries for 2012 to be 0.5% of stock or 1,100 units growing to 1.2% of stock, 2,600 units in '13, and 1.4% of stock, approximately 3,000 units, in 2014. ","Seattle has the second-highest multi-family deliveries, estimated for 2012 to be 0.5% of stock, or 1,800 units, growing to 1% of stock, 3,800 units, in 2013 and 1.1% of stock, 4,400 units, in 2014. All other West Coast Metro areas are expected to average less than 1% annual rental supply growth through 2014. L.A. and Orange Counties are expected to have the least multi-family supply, averaging 0.3% and 0.6%, respectively, through 2014. ","The other housing supply risk relates to for-sale housing production. We continue to believe that affordable for-sale housing is a significant threat to apartment rent growth. Our for-sale supply expectations remain muted in our coastal markets, largely due to high median home prices and restrictive lending practices, which should be beneficial to Essex. Seattle single-family deliveries are estimated to approach 0.9%, or 6,300 units, in 2014. However, both Northern and Southern California have very little for-sale supply, averaging less than 0.2% of stock in 2012, growing to 0.4% in 2014. As a result, even with the growing apartment supply, we expect very tight housing conditions in each of our targeted markets through 2014. ","Subsequent to quarter end, we completed the buyout of our partner's interest in Skyline apartments, located near Irvine in Orange County. I have commented previously that institutional co-investments provide an important alternative source of capital as compared to financing on Essex's balance sheet. In this case, we estimate that we issued 320,000 fewer common shares by acquiring Skyline initially with a partner and then the subsequent partner buyout as compared to the pro forma acquisition of Skyline on our balance sheet back in March of 2010. Obviously, the stock price performance was a major factor in that result. ","In development, we started 5 development projects in 2011 and started the second phase of our Epic community in San Jose during the quarter, all of which are outlined on Page S-9 of the supplement. The average cap rate on these construction projects based on current market rents is approximately 6%. ","Aside from these transactions, our Shadow pipeline, which is not included on S-9, consists of 3 potential developments in Northern California that could start in 2012 and have an expected cost of approximately $360 million. Thus, by the end of the year, we expect our construction pipeline to aggregate up to $870 million, of which Essex will own from 50% to 55%. ","We also have 3 smaller land parcels that are held in our land inventory that could be started within the next year and an operating retail property on 12.6 acres in Santa Clara that we acquired in connection with the bankruptcy amid the great recession that we are entitling for apartments. ","As suggested on the last call, the ramping of our redevelopment efforts continues as we once again are seeing residents willing to pay more for improved apartment homes. I am pleased with both the strategic direction of the redevelopment team as well as their growing impact on our overall results. ","Second topic, the investment markets. Cap rates continue to be aggressive in the coastal markets. Cap rates range from 4% to 4.5% for A property in A locations and from 4.5% to near 5% for B property in A locations. As with 2011, transaction activity abated at year end and is now rebuilding. We closed on -- we closed 2 small transactions in the quarter and continue to believe that total acquisitions will equal or exceed our $400 million guidance for 2012. ","In fast-moving markets, we have an information advantage given our economic research and historical data in our existing portfolio. We continue to find value in acquisitions through redevelopment, anticipating market trends and complex deals. Development deals on the West Coast underwritten based on today's rents generate development cap rates ranging from 5.25% to 5.5% or 6.25% to 7% upon stabilization. ","Third topic, dispositions. We announced 2 dispositions in the greater San Diego area during the quarter, both of which were acquired in connection with the merger between Essex and John M. Sachs Inc. in 2002. Both generated unlevered IRRs of approximately 10%. As stated previously, we look for opportunities to cull parts of the portfolio that have lower growth characteristics. Fortunately, we don't have significant numbers of property that are in this category, giving us flexibility to optimize the timing of dispositions. ","We will also begin marketing selected properties from our Fund II portfolio, which is scheduled to terminate in September, 2013, subject to an extension option. ","I'd like to thank you for joining us. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Erik Alexander. Thank you again.","Erik J. Alexander","Thank you, Mike. It's always nice to be here, especially when there's good news to share about another strong quarter for Essex. We're coming off a high-occupancy condition at the end of the fourth quarter. Essex was poised to make gains in scheduled rent during the first quarter of this year, and that's exactly what we did. ","We had solid results everywhere, but it should be no surprise that Northern California and the Pacific Northwest led the way. Los Angeles has strengthened and begun to contribute more to our results. We look for this trend to continue and are also optimistic that Orange County and Ventura County will be following suit in the coming quarters. ","The first quarter was characterized by good demand in all of our markets with the exception of San Diego. The current demand is consistent with our expectations for this time of the year. We experienced healthy renewal activity throughout most of the portfolio during the quarter and have finally seen some increase in our rate of turnover. ","We view this turnover activity as healthy because it provides us with more opportunity to grow rents. Additionally, we only saw a nominal increase in move-outs due to home purchases and affordability. Portfolio-wide, we increased rates on new leases by 5% during the quarter and over 6% during April. We expect turnover to rise during the second and third quarters, thereby decreasing overall occupancy. We still anticipate the annual rate of turnover to be just over 50% for 2012. ","The modest decline in occupancy, coupled with these higher rent levels, will help us achieve solid revenue growth throughout the summer and give us a better chance of achieving the higher end of our guidance for the year. ","As Mike pointed out, new multi-family housing supply remains very low and largely concentrated in a few areas of our portfolio. However, we have seen a few developers accelerate projects that we have been tracking and view this as yet another sign of strengthening in our markets. These favorable supply conditions will allow Essex to grow rents at or beyond expectations in the coming quarters. Again, our 2012 and '13 delivery projections are detailed on S-15. ","During the quarter, we completed nearly 3,300 new lease transactions and signed almost 2,700 renewals. Renewal and new lease rates continued to grow during the quarter and were 5% higher than expiring rates for the period. Renewals recorded during April were 5.3% better than the expiring rental rates, with the expectations for May at 5.6% higher than expiring rates. ","Now looking ahead, renewal offers for June and July averaged 4% to 6% in Southern California, 6% to 8% in Seattle and 7% to 9% in the Bay Area. So at the end of April, our loss to lease for the portfolio was approximately 4%.","Reveal is our only active lease-up at this time, and net leasing activity remains ahead of plan. Currently, Reveal is 93% occupied and 96% leased. ","Turning to operating expenses. These were down during the quarter compared to last year, as well as compared to our budgets. Repairs, maintenance, administration and utilities were all lower than the first quarter last year. We do anticipate some higher turnover costs during the second quarter. We do not see pressure on any other controllable expenses at this point, nor do we expect any significant variances with utilities to hinder our ability to manage costs. ","I'll turn my comments to each region, starting with Seattle. Market rents were up 6.5% compared to the first quarter of 2011. So depending on the submarket, we are now 4% below to even with our prior rent peaks. As of April 30, occupancy was 96.1% with a net availability of 5.1%. ","The job picture continued to be strong in Seattle. We saw more jobs than expected added during the quarter and have raised our forecast for 2012 to 2%. Property managers continue to report strong demand from employees of Microsoft and Amazon. Office absorption remains positive as another 650,000 square feet were leased during the quarter. We also saw a surge in industrial demand at the south end of the region. ","In Northern California, market rents were up 11% year-over-year. So based on submarket location, we now are above previous peaks by as much as 5.5%. As of April 30, occupancy for the region was 97.2%, with a 4.6% availability. Job growth continued to be solid in Northern California and is driving our rent growth. ","We saw the biggest gains for the quarter in the San Francisco and Oakland MSAs and have increased our forecast to 1.9% job growth for 2012. This is highlighted on S-15 of the supplement, along with all of our submarket job forecasts. ","Absorption of office and R&D space continues at a rapid pace and supports our belief that the region will continue to experience a healthy economy and continued job growth for the foreseeable future. During the quarter, another 1.5 million square feet of office was leased in the region, with the East Bay accounting for just over 1\/2 of that absorption. ","SanDisk, the global leader in flash memory, took down nearly 600,000 square feet of R&D space in Milpitas during the quarter, and vacancy for such space has dropped to 14%. ","Now turning to Southern California. It's the jobs picture in SoCal that's probably the closest watched economic factor. We were disappointed by the 2011 revision, particularly in San Diego, where we have lowered our growth expectation to 1% for 2012. This also translates to a lower-than-expected rent growth for the year, which now stands at 2.5% in San Diego. ","Los Angeles and Orange County, however, have fared better. The March posting of year-over-year job gains was 1.2%. These employments gains match our annual expectations for 2012. ","The military obviously has some impact on the San Diego housing market. The troop rotations remain consistent with our expectations for 2012. We shared on our last call that the USS Ronald Reagan had moved to Bremerton, Washington, in January. But at least 6 other ships have returned to San Diego since then, including the USS Independence which ported yesterday. ","Changes in military base housing policy have some impact on lower-ranking personnel's ability to live off-base. We will continue to monitor this item. During the first quarter, we actually saw an increase in our military leasing activity and now maintain overall exposure in San Diego of about 15%, which is within our historical range. ","Market rents were up 3.2% versus the same period last year. Based on submarket location, rent levels remain equal to or 3% to 5% below prior peak. As of April 30, occupancy stood at 96% in Southern California, with a 6.3% net availability. Office-based absorption for the region was modestly positive during the quarter, with transactions in parts of the San Fernando Valley, Downtown Los Angeles, and creative office space on the Westside leading the way. ","Commercial development has picked up in the region. Marriott is breaking ground on 2 hotels adjacent to LA Live, while the Glendale Galleria is expanding the regional shopping centers as part of a major renovation. RiverPark in Oxnard has resumed construction after suspending this retail development back in 2009. Developers of Plivis [ph] are proceeding with the construction of Phase 2 of their project. ","All in all, we are very happy with the results of the first quarter and are optimistic about the summer leasing season. I think we are in an excellent position to take advantage of strong fundamentals, and we believe that we will enjoy solid growth well into 2014. ","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Mike Dance.","Michael T. Dance","Thanks, Erik. Today, I will provide a brief commentary on our first quarter results and an update to our '12 FFO guidance. ","Before I begin on the quarter's results, I want to highlight a new line item we added to the income statement, which breaks out the costs we provide in the management fee income from our general and administrative expenses. This is an allocation of the direct and incremental costs of the employees and departments that are involved in providing, on behalf of our partners, the property operations, the asset management, the capital markets activity and the development oversight for the properties that are not consolidated on our balance sheet. ","With a near doubling of our management fee income, we felt it was important to break out these costs separately to show the operating margin from this activity. Overall, the gross operating margin on the management fee income was 33%, and our corporate G&A as a percentage of property revenues was 4.3% in the quarter. ","Subsequent to quarter end, we increased the investment capacity of our Wesco co-investment partnership, with the partners committing an additional $100 million of equity to the venture. This gives Wesco $200 million of additional buying power and is expected to increase  management fee income in the second half of the year. ","We continue to make progress on unencumbering our portfolio. We are on track to have 50% of our net operating income unencumbered by the end of the year as we are considering the prepayment of up to $200 million of secured debt on or near June 30. The cost of prepayment penalties and the write-off of unamortized loan fees from the early payment of secured debt is expected to result in a loss of up to $2.5 million, which will offset the $2.3 million income from the incentive partnership interest earned on the Skyline transaction. ","We are also in the process of negotiating an amendment to our current bank facility, and we expect to increase the line capacity to $500 million with an accordion to $600 million. This amendment should also extend the term to December, 2015 with 2 one-year renewal options at our option.","As mentioned earlier, we are pleased with the favorable variances from our internal estimates for both property revenues and expenses, resulting in the increase of the midpoint of our diluted FFO per share by $0.03 for the year. Yesterday, we also provided the second quarter FFO guidance of $1.60 to $1.66 per diluted share. For the second and third quarters, we expect financial occupancies to drop to 96% as resident turnover returns back to historical levels of approximately 55%. ","The estimated 90 basis points loss in occupancy will be offset by higher scheduled rents, and our estimate of the second quarter sequential revenue growth for the same property portfolio is an increase of 75 basis points. ","During the quarter, the lower level of maintenance and repairs expense is mostly timing-related, and we expect same property expenses to be higher in the second and third quarters, associated with the increase in resident turnover. For the second quarter, we expect a sequential increase of 5.5% in the same-property operating expenses or a 2.3% increase for the second quarter '12 over the second quarter in '11. ","The projected increase in same-property rent growth is more than offset by the expected increase in operating expenses, and the midpoint of our second quarter guidance assumes a sequential decrease in the same-property net operating income of 1.3%, or a $1 million decrease. And the second quarter's year-over-year increase in the same-property net operating income is expected to be 8%. ","As discussed on previous conference calls, our first half of the year's property operating expenses are still benefiting from the reduction in property taxes from the temporary declines in the Prop 13 assessed values. As of July 1, the new assessed values are reinstated to the maximum allowed under Proposition 13. Our property tax expenses will increase by approximately $400,000 per quarter, beginning in the third quarter of this year. Accordingly, we still expect same-property expense growth of 2% to 3% for the year. ","Also, we're expecting in the fourth quarter of 2012 that Expo, formerly known as our Queen Anne development, will open 5 months ahead of our previously disclosed schedule. The earlier-than-expected lease-up of this development for its opening in November '12 will decrease our income from co-investments as we expense the operating costs and the rent concessions during the property's lease-up. ","This ends my comments, and I'll now turn the call back to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Toti from Cantor Fitzgerald.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","I just quickly want to touch on a detail on rent growth. There was double-digit rent growth in San Mateo and Santa Clara with what looks like very little occupancy damage. How sustainable do you think those rates are? And where else might we see this type of pricing power in other parts of the portfolio?","Erik J. Alexander","This is Erik. I think you could expect to see pricing power really in all areas of the Bay Area. We've seen the strongest occupancies, as you pointed out, on the peninsula and in San Francisco, but it's also been strong on the East Bay and in San Jose. So when you look at the gains that we're making in both renewals and new lease rates, they're really happening across the board there.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Do you think these numbers are aberrational  for the rest of the portfolio or are we just sort of in the first wave of double-digit rent growth?","Erik J. Alexander","Yes, I don't know about operational aberrational. I mean, I'm not going to be surprised to see them occur in parts of the Pacific Northwest. And again, as we have tight occupancies in all of the submarkets, again, it puts pressure on pricing and gives us that pricing power wherever those conditions occur.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then my last question is just relative to the loss to lease being about 4% for the portfolio, so nearing the prior peak. Can you tell us where you are relative to the average portfolio rent as a percentage of resident income and how that compares to the loss to lease?","Michael J. Schall","This is Mike, David, and John Lopez is here. The rent-to-income relationship we use on a market basis, we think it's a lot less appropriate or meaningful if you do it on a property-by-property basis or our portfolio, which is, I think, what you're asking. We would rather look at the overall market when it comes to rent-to-median income relationships, and we track that very, very closely. We're less concerned on a property-by-property basis primarily because the decision -- the local decision is, whether you move into Apartment A, B or C, not what your particular income is relative to the rent that you're paying. So even though people may be able to pay more rent, given their income level, it doesn't necessarily mean they will because everyone is concerned about what are the trade-offs? Where can I get the value represented and the best apartment relative to its price? So that's why the pricing dynamics within a local market are so important, and rent to median income is really the measurement of the broader market -- the affordability of the broader market, which I think is much more meaningful. And so I have John Lopez here. Why don't -- can you talk about the rent-to-median income in some of these Metro areas?","John Lopez","Yes, David. Probably the market where we're closest to our long-run norm is in San Francisco. But having said that, that's after 15% rent growth last year. In the East Bay, in the Silicon Valley in particular, in Northern California, we're still significantly below those numbers. I would say also that the same goes for Seattle as well and Los Angeles. Probably San Diego is where we're pretty close to the long-run averages, and I think why, even with job growth, we're seeing less rent growth in that marketplace. So if you look sort of from a strata, San Diego and San Francisco are pretty close to their averages. Orange County's somewhere in between and Los Angeles, Silicon Valley and Seattle and Oakland significantly below.","Michael J. Schall","And David, actually, let me add one more concept which was we had talked about our expectation for 28% portfolio rent growth over 5 years, and one of the comments that came back was that our assumption in there, which was 3.5% median income growth, was too aggressive. And the reality is, I think we're seeing more like 4% to 5% or even higher in the tech markets, which is not unusual. Obviously, I've been here for a really long time. I've seen a lot of these cycles. And so when the tech markets do well, they tend to do very well. And obviously, the opposite is also true. But the point is, we're seeing, in the skilled labor, we're seeing a real dichotomy out there in terms of the tech worker with the skills that are demanded by the tech company. We're seeing great income growth rates, which are supporting higher rent levels. And then we're also seeing the other side, which is markets that don't have that tech component that are more price-sensitive and have less median income growth rates.","John Lopez","And David, I just wanted to follow up. That average, long-run average rent to income level, it's not a ceiling. And if you go back and look in the past, when we've expansion cycles, particularly in our tech sectors, that rent-to-income level typically runs well above the average. So although, as I mentioned at San Francisco, we're approaching that rent-to-income, long-run average, it doesn't give me any concern that we can't push the rents, given our expectations, because typically during expansions, it runs much higher than the long-run average.","Operator","Our next question comes from Swaroop Yalla from Morgan Stanley.","Swaroop Yalla - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","A question on Skyline. Do you still see a condo exit for this investment in the coming years? Or is the plan for this to be part of the core portfolio now?","Michael J. Schall","Swaroop, it's Mike Schall. Our expectation and our belief is that the highest and best use for that asset is a condo. It is a 20-something story high rise. It has Viking appliances. It has super high finishes. A number of us would like to bid on the snakeskin couch that is down in the wine locker area. And thus, and our thought about what the CapEx associated with Viking appliances might be gives us chills. So we know that its highest and best use is a condo. We look for a condo exit. But in a market that rents have not moved very much, we thought it was still a decent apartment addition in the interim.","Swaroop Yalla - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. And then just sort of a big-picture question, Mike. Recently, we've heard the Bay Area and Southern California local governments have indicated a preference for more multi-family housing, both condos and apartments, in the coming years. How do you see that long term for your business and for your portfolio? Are you concerned with your markets getting oversupplied by this competing product?","Michael J. Schall","Swaroop, we've been here for a long time, and I don't think that, that sentiment by the local officials has changed much in the last 20 years. And I'm looking at John Eudy here, who I'm sure he has an opinion on this one as well. But yes, we know that, but at the same time, these are also markets that are very difficult to entitle properties. The entitlement process is long. It's cumbersome. It's full of potential pitfalls. I mean, we have gravitated toward a, \"Let's find the deals that we can start construction soon.\" So we're not taking a huge amount of entitlement risk, unless we get paid a lot more for it in terms of cap rates. So if we can get -- there was actually one transaction that we did which was the -- I alluded to in my comments is the Santa Clara site that we bought out of the bankruptcy that we are going through an entitlement process. But that was underwritten at a -- what, a 6.75% cap rate. And in the midst of the great recession, and the cap rate is much, much higher now, potentially. So we try to make good value decisions. But to your point or to your question, we don't see anything that's going to fundamentally change the outlook for multi-family housing in the short term. It's just the process is too cumbersome and too difficult. And actually, I'll make another comment. Because I'm on -- I chair a nonprofit housing board, and California has essentially taken virtually all the funding away from the redevelopment agencies in many of the major cities in California, which has only gone to undermine the production of affordable housing in these marketplaces. And it's a -- that is an area that remains a dilemma and remains an issue for the nonprofit homebuilders, which are doing exactly what you're suggesting, because their primary funding mechanism has essentially been greatly reduced.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rob Stevenson from Macquarie Research.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Can you talk a little bit about where, given the strong rental rate growth in Northern California and Seattle were during the quarter, where new move-in rents were versus renewals in those 2 markets?","Erik J. Alexander","Yes, this is Erik. I mean, as you heard, they're very close to each other. The growth rates for both new and renewals were in that 5% range. And so now, like if you look at just April for the portfolio, the new lease rates and renewal rates are within $5 or $6 of each other on average.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","And what is the gap that you feel comfortable with in terms of having somebody move out versus what are you sort of want it to be to make sure that you keep somebody? I mean, if new move-in rents are X, what is an acceptable renewal rate in order sort of keep it in place and not drive that turnover cost?","Erik J. Alexander","Yes, I think you've obviously touched on something I think that's important to all operators, which is, you kind of want the good turnover. And the good turnover is the folks that are furthest away from market. And we've taken the position, and I think Mike has shared with everybody on several occasions, that we're not overly aggressive in trying to send renewals out above current offered rates or their forecasting months in advance. We find that to be a difficult proposition. Some people will accept that. Many people are offended by it. So again, when we're within the renewals and that being on the high end probably at the offered rate and within a couple of percent of the offered rate.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","What's your card [ph] costs on units turns today?","Erik J. Alexander","It varies greatly. I mean, you're talking about what goes as far as painting and cleaning and miscellaneous maintenance supplies, that kind of thing, it's...","Michael J. Schall","We'll throw vacancy in there too, right? So...","Michael T. Dance","Our card [ph] cost is about 400 and vacancy might be another 400.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then just one last question on San Diego Main. If you assume that the troop rotations continue the way that they've been for the last decade or so, I mean, what's the attractiveness of that market at a similar IRR or cap, going-in cap rate in growth expectations versus Northern California or LA Orange County?","Michael J. Schall","Well, yes -- this is Mike. I'll answer that. Yes, this is part of our process, which I think is fundamental to the company and its success, which is ranking these submarkets -- our 27-some-odd submarkets, up and down the West Coast from Seattle to San Diego by future expected rent growth. And the person that does that is John Lopez, who's here. And it changes pretty dramatically over time. And 2 years ago, we're buying everything that we could find in Northern California and Seattle. And right now, we have a more balanced program in terms of -- we're buying in selected places in Southern California and Northern California. I think our #1 market continues to be the east side of Seattle in terms of submarket. But again, it changes over time. We go through a semiannual process of reevaluating submarkets and reranking them and use that as acquisition and disposition decisions. In terms of San Diego specifically, its long-term value is, I think, still meaningfully attractive in terms of its -- it used to be a military and entertainment tourism town, and it's become much more than that. There is real dynamic job base there, including biotech and a variety of other things, and it's improving. But the other piece of San Diego that has historically been an issue is just housing production. Housing's a little more affordable, except in the coastal areas. And there tends to have a tendency to overbuild San Diego. And so affordability concerns have been there. The other thing that has happened more recently, as you'll recall, a couple of years ago, San Diego had less reduction in rent than most of the other markets. Our average portfolio reduction in rent was 14.5%. San Diego performed the best in the downturn. But if you flip that around and you say, \"Okay. Well, now you've suffered that loss in rent, who has the greatest upside?\" San Diego does not appear at the top of the list. So long term, I think San Diego is a decent market. We view this business as one of timing and making good decisions and getting the value creation pieces put together in the right order. And I think that there thus will be a time when we will re-enter San Diego. It's just not now.","John Lopez","Yes. And Rob, this is John. I just want to stress, one of Mike's points was that going into this recovery cycle, San Diego was at the bottom of our expectations list, primarily and solely because of the fact that the relative rents in the marketplace versus the incomes in the marketplace were relatively high compared to other markets. And so we didn't initially forecast lower job growth. What we do -- it would be at the bottom of our rankings, hence are typically [ph] down there on the buy and sell was concentrated in other areas.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Okay. I was just trying to figure out, like, whether or not the sales this quarter portended to additional sales there as you guys sort of cycle out, at least for the time being.","Michael J. Schall","We cycled out of Portland several years ago. We've cycled out of a variety of other markets. That's not our intent here. Our intent here is to pair a piece of the portfolio that is lower growth rate. It's interesting because I cited 10% unlevered IRRs, which is pretty good. But as Mike Dance has pointed out to me, when you started somewhere around an 8%, growing in yield, it's not that difficult to get to a 10%, which is a concept I agree with. So the reality is, it's more of the growth rate that we were concerned about in those particular assets. And again, we're going to be careful and thoughtful about the timing on exiting from the things that we consider non-core.","John Lopez","And just one last thing to add, Rob. In our core markets if you look over time, some markets are highly ranked. Some markets move up and down that ranking list. San Diego has been a good market, probably middle of our portfolio for long-run growth. So from a long-run perspective, this is not a market we would exit because of long-run low growth expectations.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jana Galan from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess following up on that kind of non-core or -- and I realize this is a small part of the portfolio, but can you speak to the lower occupancies in Riverside County? And could these or maybe the Santa Barbara assets potentially be disposition candidates, or do you expect longer-term revenue growth to improve there?","Erik J. Alexander","I don't think -- this is Erik. I don't think we expect a longer-term revenue growth from the Riverside asset. The Santa Barbara assets, as you know, are heavily dependent on the student population. So we're in the middle of that first demand window right now, and what we're seeing is, I'd say average demand with good results. We've seen it in years past pick up a great deal later in the year, so again, given the challenges we had there last year, we're watching it carefully and making sure we're addressing what the students want. But ultimately, there's just not a lot in Santa Barbara, and so there very well could be -- not a lot of choices, what I mean, not a lot of supply. There very well could be upside in those assets.","Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And just to confirm. The 2012 guidance assumption, is that still $100 million in dispositions?","Michael T. Dance","Yes. Mike mentioned earlier, when you include our pro rata share of the fund, it will likely be higher than that.","Operator","Your next question comes from Eric Wolfe from Citi.","Eric Wolfe - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I'm not sure if you tracked this, but I'm wondering if you've tracked the percentage of tenants moving into your Northern California portfolio that are in the tech field. The reason I'm asking is because if you look at the tech news sites, you find that there's just billions upon billions going to these tech startups, many of which are pre-revenue but are still using the funds to hire pretty aggressively. So I'm curious whether you're seeing this influx of capital into the tech space in your tenant space as well.","Erik J. Alexander","Eric, this is Erik. We don't have a specific measurement on those folks coming in as it relates to industry. Again, when there are big movements, whether it's in tech or anything else, as I commented on Seattle, with all the activity that Amazon has, we see an uptick certainly in that. We've seen an uptick in the Microsoft residents, particularly in the East Side, Bellevue and Redmond and in the Bay Area, certainly a component of the people that are moving in.","Eric Wolfe - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then the second question is, there's a couple of announcements today in terms of funds and REITs being formed to buy and rent single-family homes, the biggest of which, I guess, would be Beazer Homes. So I'm curious what do you think is going to be biggest challenge for these REITs and what sort of yield you would need to have in order to compensate for these type of challenges?","Michael J. Schall","Eric, it's Mike. And I recognized you and I have talked about this subject a few times. So I think the biggest challenge will be the discipline of buying the right property in the right location at the right time, and the concept of buying a vast portfolio where you don't have a choice as a buyer over exactly what you're buying. You're somehow going to manage this large, geographically decentralized portfolio. We think that's the peak of inefficiency. And we actually did buy a portfolio of single-family homes in the Sacramento Valley as part of the RTC in the early '90s, so we have some experience there. And it's a challenge. It's a challenge because of the decentralized [ph] nature of what you're doing. And I think that the ones that make the most sense, as far as we're concerned, it would be one that you can somehow control that process, which is a very local business. I think it's probably more suited toward private wealthy investors that are -- have the right combination of skill sets, from the real estate side to the management and operations side, to put together a comprehensive team that can deal with these things when you can control what you own and the price that you pay and have some synergy with respect to location and product that you own and control. So I think it's just a different business. It's one that we're interested in but have not taken steps to pursue given the difficulties I just mentioned.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","It's Michael Bilerman. I had just a question as well. Mike, I appreciate the disclosure as you broke out the management fee expenses now on the income statement so that we can better align what sort of that profitability of -- out of at least doing the fund business is. Is there a sense -- I know you're going to be selling some assets in the Fund, and you're obviously taking Skyline on. How scalable, I guess, if you were to add additional joint ventures, could that margin get, right? Because you talked it being about 33% margin. It was 25% last year. If you were to substantially increase joint [ph] ventures, could that margin grow substantially?","Michael J. Schall","Mike, it's Mike Schall. I don't know which Mike you were directing that at, but I'll take the question. The fund business is less about the margin on the fees, more about the promoted interest and the overall cost of capital. So our hope is that we will be marginally profitable, let's say, because we're not trying to skimp on the cost side of managing the -- our co-investment assets. In fact, to the contrary, we believe -- that's why we don't do fee management is because the dynamics of fee management is you're incented to keep the costs very low in order to keep your margin higher. We're not at all incentivized to do that when it comes to our co-investments because we're such a big part of them. And therefore, our focus is not on the margin on the fees. The focus is a how do we maximize the overall returns and the promoted interests, and we are -- we spend -- we need to spend on the fee side. In terms of how scalable could it be at? I think it can continue -- we can continue to grow that margin to some extent. I'm not sure that we will. For us, it's a -- we look at this as another source of capital, and we're constantly comparing, just like we compare our 27 submarkets up and down the Coast, we're doing the same thing on the capital side, trying to find the right mix of capital to buy the properties that we think are going to perform the best, having essentially no difference between what we would buy in our own portfolio versus what we would buy in these co-investment assets. So I don't want to -- and so there is some margin growth, but candidly, we're just not focused on that, more focused on how do we get the promote [ph] as high as it can be and how do we get the cost of capital as low as it can be.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And which -- how much of the assets are you selling out of the fund at the back half of the year?","Michael J. Schall","We haven't decided exactly. Again, we don't have -- we don't pressure to sell. We think it's a good environment to sell some assets. It could be approximately 1\/2 of the Fund II portfolio","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then are you in the process right now of trying to raise additional capital for opportunities?","Michael J. Schall","Mike Dance commented that we have increased marginally the Wesco venture by $100 million in capital. So we have done that. So the answer is yes. The reason why we're doing a relatively small amount there is to just keep our options open with respect to what we do in the future. And that's -- part of the advantage of having Wesco is that we can decide to commit a little bit more capital to an entity, which then, of course, allows us to be open with respect to how we finance stuff 6 months from now.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Right. So in case something else came across in your markets, or even outside of your current core markets, you could then find another joint venture partner and raise capital on that specific opportunity if it were to come about?","Michael J. Schall","Or just buy everything on balance sheet.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And issue equity.","Michael J. Schall","Exactly.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb from Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Mike Dance has been a little quiet, so I guess I'll start with him. Just -- I heard Erik Alexander's comments on the rents. It sounded like you guys are pretty bullish. But you beat strongly on the first quarter and yet you didn't raise the top end of the guidance. Sort of curious. Is it the real estate taxes or is it turn costs? What's keeping you from raising the top end of the guidance as well?","Michael T. Dance","We haven't done an in-depth analysis to justify at this point. I think we're coming into our heavier leasing season, and we'll reconsider that at the end of our second quarter.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. So it's nothing specific? It's just...","Michael T. Dance","No. If it's -- me being lazy. I have some other things to do and made that my priority for this call. Sorry.","Michael J. Schall","Alex, let me add something to that. I mean, it's our objective to not give up the 90 basis points of occupancy, obviously, in Q2 that Mike has assumed, right, in the guidance number. Our hope is that we can maintain -- we can do both. We can get good rent growth without sacrificing a tremendous amount of occupancy. We all know that this is a dynamic world and things change relatively quickly, and so it's just, we would rather wait and see, wait and have one more quarter under our belt before we commit to that. And just as a general statement, we just gave guidance in February. So I just think that it makes sense for us to take a look at it after the second quarter. I think that's just the appropriate way of doing things.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. And switching to development. You guys mentioned the Queen Anne development is going to come online early. Last quarter, you had a few projects that came on early. Is there -- is this a matter of just having a conservative development time table where you're able to bring things online sooner or is it weather conditions or maybe just better contractors who are working quicker? What's the driver that's allowed you guys to bring projects on sooner than anticipated?","John D. Eudy","Alex, this is John Eudy. Most of that surrounds the fact that we committed to that in the fall of 2010. We started it last spring before any meaningful construction started in Seattle. So the best of the best contractor subs were available, able to push the limits, and we were able to take advantage of it. The typical timeframe for that would be around 22 months for that complicated of a building. And obviously, we're doing it in about 18 months. I don't expect that will be the norm going forward. Historically, 20 to 24 months for that type of building is the range to expect. So going into next year, I don't think we're going to have that advantage. We've been able to take care of -- take advantage of the labor pool. That's the reason.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. And just as the final question is, as you guys stay in touch with institutional investors and you've seen cap rates compress a lot on the coast, are you seeing people who originally were interested in coast -- coastal apartments venturing to other sorts of maybe inland apartments or other asset classes? Or once the institutional investors and the consultants make the decision to go for coastal apartments, they stay in the queue until their number is called?","John F. Burkart","Yes, Alex, this is John Burkart. What we've seen is they are very interested in the West Coast apartments, and we're talking regularly with them, and we're not seeing people that have expressed an interest in investing with us looking to go elsewhere other than to the extent it's part of their normal business plan. But the focus is on the West Coast apartments. And in further, there really is a difference at this point in cap rates between the more desirable areas that we're in and the less desirable areas out there in the marketplace, whether it be Sacramento or whatnot, and the investors are pretty focused getting in the right spot, so they're willing to pay the price to get into the better locations.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rich Anderson from BMO Capital Markets.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","What's the difference between the rent-to-median income and the rent-to-property-level-income ratio?","Erik J. Alexander","Well, I think this is the question essentially that we addressed before. As Mike said, I don't want to contradict that, but to answer your question specifically, when we do look at a broader range for our individual regions, NorCal, the Pacific Northwest and SoCal, they're a couple of percent higher maybe for some of the applicants that we see coming in. So incomes have been increasing among applicants over the last year, and obviously, so have rents. And so I think, as John said, if rent-to-median incomes are in the 18% to 22% range, ours are in the similar range, maybe plus 2%.","Michael J. Schall","Actually, Erik showed me some demographic reports last night, which are measured upon move-in. I think beyond the move-in, we don't really know. But at move-in, I think the average income of our residents was slightly above the median income. So it was not materially different from the median, if that's where you're going.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","That's where I was going. The next question is, what do you think the over-under is on this Prop. 13 issue in July?","Michael J. Schall","I'm not sure what you're referring to because we reported last quarter, and I think this is not any different...","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","No, I know. I know.","Michael J. Schall","Okay.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Yes, I know it's not new, but I'm just curious, like, from a profitability standpoint, what do you think the likelihood is you'd be paying higher property taxes next year?","Michael J. Schall","Oh, I'm sorry; you're going back to Mike's comments.","Michael T. Dance","I think it's unlikely that we pay increases above [ph] $400,000. We have a cadre of experts that help us negotiate and appeal the assessed values. So they will definitely go up. The $400,000 per quarter is the worst case. I'm hoping we do better than that, but who knows? That's subject to appeals and negotiations ultimately.","Michael J. Schall","So chalk another one up to Dance conservativeness.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","So last -- yesterday, the other day or whatever, BRE said they had a weather benefit in the first quarter. Did you have anything like that?","Michael J. Schall","I don't think that the weather was a material factor. Erik, do you?","Erik J. Alexander","No.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Continuing on with my [indiscernible] of questions here. The rent peak number, I know people talked about this or that above or below peak. Is there any relevance to the peak rent? I mean, you have different people. The situation's completely different than it was back when you had that other peak rent. Isn't that just another number that doesn't really have any relevance to where things will go or not go in the future?","Michael J. Schall","I totally agree with you. I think the relevance of that is pretty much in the history books now. I think it was highly relevant when you were in 2009, 2010 timeframe, to know that Seattle rents had gone down 20%. I think that was very important at that moment because it was a key part of our -- the way we look at our ranking process, we look at, \"Hey, these rents are really low relative to what the income levels are and what people can pay.\" And so it becomes relevant at that point. Now that a lot of that has been erased, I think it's much less relevant and we get back into the more traditional measures of rent: rent to median income, the affordability trade-offs between the medium price home and rental rates and those type of things. I think they're much more relevant than prior peak.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And then...","John Lopez","This is John Lopez. I'll just add to one thing. When we were looking at these numbers, as Mike said, they were very relevant because we weren't sure what direction incomes were going and things like that. And what we've seen as we've popped out is we're a little bit behind to a little bit ahead. And in most of our markets, the median household incomes are above that level -- the previous peak level. So in and of itself it's not important, but when you put it in context of how our incomes have grown since that prior peak and you put those combinations, that's why it gives us confidence that the rent-to-income levels are still in our favor here.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","A big picture for Mike Schall. Do you think now is a good time for multi-family M&A, or do you think we're not at that point yet?","Michael J. Schall","Actually, we are -- as a historical statement, I've spent a fair amount of time just looking at the different combinations of companies, and I think it's starting to become a more interesting time. Not that there's anything that's happening that's specific, but I think its -- I think at the bottom of the cycle, every company is very reluctant to do anything because they perceive that they're at the bottom of the cycle, obviously. As you get closer to a top of the cycle or midcycle, I think it's just -- I think the opportunities present themselves. So that's a very generic statement, and again, there's nothing specific happening here.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I'm not suggesting there is, of course. And then the last question is kind of just that you guys are trading at almost $160 a share. Have you ever thought about a stock split, or you're going after Google?","Michael J. Schall","Yes, it's probably my philosophical biases as taught by Mr. Guericke, who preceded me. And we look at the listing fees and the ongoing fees associated with that, and we wonder why we should do it with an overwhelmingly institutional investor base, Rich. Trading costs are typically on a per-share basis, and we're 90-something percent institutional, so why do it? I mean, the reality is we could do it, and if there was a compelling desire among our shareholders, we would do it. But I haven't seen that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Karin Ford from KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Just one question. If you end up having meaningful sales out of Fund II this year, is there a possibility that you could get some Promode [ph]  income this year? Or is that a 2013 possibility?","Michael T. Dance","Yes, the way you account for that is based on how you distribute out of the partnership. And we have to return to all our partners the 10% hurdle first. And so the likelihood of reaching that from the '12 sales is not likely. So most all of it would be done near the end of the sales process, the disposition process.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies & Company.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just a quick question. If you could draw an invisible line through your portfolio and kind of put your A assets on one side and all of the other assets on the other side, could you talk a little bit about just overall operating trends you're seeing in these 2 buckets? Is one meaningfully outperforming the other or is everything just kind of going gangbusters at this point?","Michael J. Schall","Tayo, it's Mike Schall, and Erik may have some follow-up comments. But we believe that it is much more a locational issue than it is a product issue. And because of that or as an example of that, I would tell you that the lease-up of our brand-new Via project had rents that way surpassed our expectations. And from that, if you have a new property in Silicon Valley, we were able to get a very significant premium. If you go down into Orange County and look at other properties we've bought, a number of condo buildings that are rented as apartments, which are the nicest assets, the highest level A that you can buy within those marketplaces, and you were having trouble moving rents or generating any significant premium over the B quality assets in the marketplace. So it's very different by location, and I think that, that is why we focus so much time and effort on getting the locations right and the submarket ranking processes right, because that to us is much more important,  trying to understand where supply and income levels are and what people's -- I guess it comes back to consumer psychology -- how comfortable do they feel about their job, their income level versus the cost of renting and how willing are they to step up and pay significantly more in rent, and what do they get for it. So I think that, that relationship is what's most important here. And clearly in the North, we're seeing people willing to pay a lot more and having the ability to pay a lot more, less so in the south land. Erik, do you think that's right?","Erik J. Alexander","It's absolutely right. And then with respect to product, I mean, even in the strong markets of the Bay Area, I mean, some of the top performers end being properties that we've invested a little bit of money in, in prior years, like The Commons in Campbell, a solid product in a good market. I don't think everybody would classify it as AA. And April is picking up 12% rent growth on expiring rates and similar on renewals. And again, that's just not the result of a renovation, because that's been done for some time now. I just think it speaks to the value proposition for that group of customers. They want to be close to jobs and have good housing. And to the extent that people start to feel like they're paying more than they want, we're seeing the increases of people move to the East Bay. We're seeing good growth in Dumont and San Ramon. And we're excited about the prospects for those properties as well.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","That makes sense. One other question, and as a consequence [indiscernible] Fund II that would be of interest to you guys as a going out rate?","John F. Burkart","On Fund II -- this is John Burkart, on the Fund II assets, because of the nature of the ownership structure, we won't be making offers on those assets. Those will be sold. There are many assets that we love in that -- in the fund. They're great assets, but we won't be making offers on those assets.","Operator","Our last question comes from Mike Salinsky from RBC Capital Markets.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just 2 follow-up bigger picture questions. Mike, you talked about development stabilized yields being 6.5% to 7%, and you talked about acquisition cap rates being in the low 4s today. At what point does it make much more sense to start developing as opposed to acquiring, just in light of the $400 million of acquisitions?","Michael J. Schall","Mike, if we were buying those 4 cap acquisitions, and I think I would agree with the premise that you would favor development, but the reality is we found value opportunities within the acquisition area. There were a couple of assets, for example, that we bought in the Fremont area. I'll tell you why we bought them. We can do a exterior and some unit turns there and we can substantially improve the physical asset. We also believe that Fremont is a beneficiary of the Bay Area, or, I'm sorry, Silicon Valley, essentially having a lot more jobs and demand relative to its supply, so we think that the beneficiary will be Fremont and other high-quality cities that are surrounding Silicon Valley. So if we can put together a couple of those components, and I think that the cap rate going in there was around high 4, low 5 range, I don't remember exactly what it was. But if we get that combination of transaction characteristics, I think it supports a strong acquisition program as well. And so we're doing that. But the reality is we can do both. And so we've been active on both areas, and we built our development pipeline pretty significantly over time. And I think that we feel very good about where that sits, and we can simultaneously do acquisitions in the run. I'm blessed because I have John Eudy, who's been year for 20-something years, running development, and Craig Zimmerman, same amount of time, running the acquisitions. And so we have those -- we've got a machine on both those areas, and so we can pursue both.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","That's helpful. Can you remind us what your risk premium is on a development versus acquisition?","Michael J. Schall","Yes. We say around 20%, but I have to caveat that because that's 20% if we can start quickly. So without -- as we know, California entitlement processes can get -- could be a little bit cumbersome, and ultimately time is money, especially if you miss the window with respect to construction costs and some of these other things. So we're saying 20% if we can start the construction process almost right away. I also noted that in the case of that Santa Clara deal that we bought out of bankruptcy and have chosen to go through an entitlement process, and incidentally we own 100% of that transaction, that was bought at a 6.75% type cap rate. Again, you've got the entitlement process, which we expected at the time to take about 3 years. And so you'd need more risk premium to make that happen. So what John and I try to do is sit down and understand the risk profile of each of these development deals and make good decisions with respect to how much risk are we willing to take and how do we get compensated for that risk, how much a premium do we need for that risk.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And the second question for Mr. Lopez there, as you look -- I realize you guys are looking at some markets, but as you look at the gross prospects for Northern California, and you referenced that 28% growth. I think you quoted it on your last call for the full cycle. When does it -- when do you get more bullish on Southern California versus Northern California? Or is it really going to be -- is it market-by-market for the entire cycle?","John Lopez","Well, I mean, it's market-by-market for the entire cycle, but we definitely feel that probably sometime in the early mid next year is where we would expect potential acceleration in the targeted Southern California market to accelerate up to sort of the current run rates in Northern California and Seattle. So obviously going out over time, barring a 1999 5% job growth in Silicon Valley, naturally at some point, this rent growth in the Northern California and Seattle markets will slow below their current levels; that's probably a couple of years out. So we probably think that our target Southern California markets will approach next year and probably a year after that will be some of the leading markets.","Operator","I'll now turn the call back over to Michael Schall for any closing comments.","Michael J. Schall","Well, I guess in closing, we appreciate your participation on the call, and we look forward to seeing many of you at NAREIT in June. We're obviously pleased with the progress made during the quarter and believe that our outlook remains bright. Thank you all for joining us on the call today.","Operator","Thank you.

As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.","Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs as well as information available to the Company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from these anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found in the Company's filings with the SEC.","When we get to the question and answer portion, management asks that you be respectful of everyone's time and limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you, Mr. Schall. You may begin.","Michael Schall","Thank you for joining us today and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. John Burkart and Angela Kleiman will follow me with comments and John Eudy is here for Q&A. I will cover the following topics on the call. First, comments on Q4 and market conditions and second, commentary on investment activities.","On to the first topic. Yesterday, we were pleased to report continued strong operating results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 2015. In the fourth quarter, core FFO per share increased 17% compared to Q4 2014. For the full year, core FFO was $0.42 per share above the midpoint of the initial 2015 guidance range. For the five year period from the 2010 recessionary trough, we have grown core FFO per share by 96%, increased our dividend nearly 7% per year and led the multi-family REIT industry with an annual total return of 19%.","Angela Kleiman will comment on guidance in a moment which anticipates continued strength into 2016. As widely reported, an unanticipated slowdown in rent growth occurred in Q4 in northern California. Third-party research firms have reacted by lowering rent growth and occupancy expectations for 2016. We believe that the Q4 slowdown does not materially change the 2016 outlook for northern California for the following reasons.","First, we believe that 2015 rent growth in Northern California was greater than anyone expected. I'd say, 2015 was an extraordinary year. This context is important, when comparing results because any disruption can appear disappointing. In this case, we expect to go from extraordinary in 2015 to strong in 2016 which is a scenario that we outlined in our 2016 market forecast in connection with our Q3 2015 conference call and we're now reaffirming that forecast.","Specifically, we believe market rents will increase by 7.5% in Northern California in 2016, down from the 2015 average of 10.9%. Our second comment relates to the typical seasonality in Q4 which in my 30 years at Essex always occurs, although in varying intensity. Demand driven by job growth moderated in Q4 which is typical as many companies wait until after the holidays to add workers.","New apartment deliveries will also vary throughout the year. And so, above average deliveries in Q4, along with lower demand can cause temporary softness until demand recovers, typically by early February. We estimate that Q4 deliveries of apartments in Northern California represented about 44% of the roughly 10,000 apartments delivered in all of 2015, versus 35% and 25% in Q4 2014 and 2013, respectively. John Burkart will summarize January results in a moment, giving us confidence that the Q4 slowdown is not indicative of a trend.","Our final point relates to our estimation of excess demand relative to supply in 2016. In our market forecasts, again unchanged from last quarter, we project the three Bay Area counties to generate 2.9% job growth in 2016, significantly lower, but still strong relative to the extraordinary job growth of 4.1% for the comparable metros in 2015.","That 2.9% Bay Area job growth equates to around 95,000 jobs. Those 95,000 jobs will produce demand for around 47,000 housing units, assuming the typical two-for-one relationship between jobs and housing demand. In 2016, we expect the Bay Area to produce around 18,000 homes, both apartments and for sale which represent only 38% of the demand attributable to job growth. With market occupancy around 96%, expensive single family homes and demand well in excess of supply, we believe that great pricing power will continue in 2016.","Rental affordability is often mentioned as a possible cause for lower rent growth. However, these are high income and high cost areas and fortunately incomes in the Bay Area are growing substantially. San Jose, for example, has a median household income of around $102,000 and personal incomes grew by 7.3% in 2014 and are estimated to increase 6.5% and 7.1% in 2015 and 2016, respectively.","In Santa Clara County which includes San Jose, monthly rents in the Essex portfolio average around $2,500, as compared to median rents in San Jose of around $2,200. The median income will allow someone without a roommate to rent either the average Essex apartment or the medium-priced apartment in the metro area. Nothing in this discussion should imply that we lack concern about the U.S. economy, recent market volatility or the resiliency of tech jobs, all of which are risk to our market outlook. If economic conditions worsen, we may not be able to achieve the macro assumptions driving our forecast, including 2.8% U.S. GDP growth and 2% U.S. job growth.","We see nothing in our markets that would indicate that tech jobs are imploding. To the contrary, the tech markets continue to do well, as indicated by San Jose's 4.4% December over -- December year-over-year job growth. Further, our analysis of the largest tech companies indicates that they are growing in market capitalization and generating huge amounts of cash. Who would have thought 10 years ago that Alphabet and Google would be the world's largest listed companies?","A comparison of the top 10 U.S.-based tech companies against the top 10 non-tech companies shows just how much the world has changed. The top 10 tech companies are worth around $2.8 trillion, 21% more than the non-techs and have $556 billion in cash, more than twice as much as the non-techs. Approximately $1.8 trillion of the equity capitalization of the tech leaders was created in the past 10 years, over 3 times the non-tech. Finally, while only three of the non-tech leaders are based in the Essex markets, all of the tech leaders are headquartered on the West Coast. We clearly don't see the end of large investments in technology in the foreseeable future and believe that our portfolio is well-positioned for this continued growth.","To the second topic, investment activity. So far acquisition markets have experienced little impact from global economic conditions, cap rates have not moved much. At this point, A quality property and locations trade at around a 4.25% cap rate using the Essex methodology, but more aggressive buyers are often sub 4%. B quality property and locations typically have cap rates 25 to 50 basis points higher than A quality property.","We're seeing three significant headwinds affecting development in the West Coast markets which we believe will moderate apartment supply going forward. First, construction lenders are sizing construction loans based on loan to cost ratios of between 60% and 65%, down about 5% from a few months ago.","Second, cities continue to increase demands from developers in the form of low income housing units, higher fees and costly improvements. Finally, construction costs have increased around 10% in each of the of past two years despite declining commodity prices, as skilled labor forces are inadequate to meet related construction activity. Obviously, this lower housing supply is beneficial to the Essex portfolio overall.","As previously announced, we sold the 296 unit Sharon Green Apartments in Northern California for $245 million or $828,000 per unit, at a cap rate in the high 3% range. We used 1031 exchanges to reinvest the proceeds of Sharon Green into three properties that are detailed in the press release. We estimate that core FFO will increase by approximately $1 million in 2016, as a result of these transactions.","Our business plan for investments is outlined in the press release. We hope that economic uncertainty will bring more transactions to the market and that financing rates remain attractive. Depending upon the stock price, acquisitions may be funded as part of our co-investment program or on our balance sheet. We currently have two properties in contract to be sold. Similarly, the use of proceeds from dispositions will also be strongly influenced by the stock price.","That concludes my comments. Thank you for joining our call today. Now I'll turn the call over to John Burkart.","John Burkhart","Thank you, Mike. 2015 was a great year in the West Coast markets. Our results exceeded our initial revenue guidance in all three regions for the combined Essex BRE portfolio and expenses were favorable to guidance leading to an exceptional 10.7% NOI growth, the highest in 15 years. Our outperformance was attributable to job growth exceeding expectations and lower than expected housing supply.","As of December 2015, our markets added 361,000 jobs, compared to December 2014, 40 basis points higher than our original projection of 2.5%. A total of 63,000 new units of supply, both multi-family and single family was delivered into the market in 2015. That's about 6,900 units below our original forecast, largely for the reasons that Mike mentioned including, labor shortages, municipal delays, rising costs and more stringent lender underwriting.","The supply\/demand imbalance is the key factor behind our market strength. We estimate, assuming two jobs creates one unit of demand for housing, that the 331,000 jobs created is equivalent to about 165,000 units of housing demand, compared to only 63,000 units of new supply delivered, meaning demand exceeded supply by over 2.5 times.","The fourth quarter which is the low point in seasonal demand and rental rates in our markets, was relatively strong across all three regions, with the 7.5% increase in gross revenue, compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. Achieved rents on new leases were up 8.6% in the fourth quarter, compared to the fourth quarter of 2014.","We have made great progress in our management of the BRE portfolio. However, we still have more work to do with respect to refining unit amenity pricing, lease expiration management and renovations. Therefore, for the purpose of comparable sequential results, the Essex legacy portfolio provides the best insight. Adjusted for occupancy changes, the Essex portfolio achieved 1.6% sequential revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2015, the same as 2014.","We continued to find opportunities with our renovation program. We increased the number of units renovated in the same-store portfolio143%, from 254 units in the fourth quarter of 2014, to 618 units in the fourth quarter of 2015. The scope of the unit turns are site-specific based on opportunities in the marketplace.","Now I will share some highlights for each region. The Seattle market continues to absorb new supply and push rents outside of CBD higher. Revenues for our Seattle CBD portfolio increased 5.3%, while revenue for the majority of our portfolio which is located on the east side near Bellevue and Redmond, grew 8.3% for the fourth quarter, compared to the prior year's quarter.","According to Axio, the Seattle market had the strongest year since the Great Recession, ended the year with approximately 8% year-over-year rental growth as of December 2015. In the Bay Area, the successful technology companies continue to lease or pursue space to grow their companies. The technology-driven San Francisco peninsula and Silicon Valley markets absorbed over 1 million square feet of space in each -- in the fourth quarter of 2015 or 50% of the total absorption for 2015. Alphabet leased space in Alameda, North San Jose, Shoreline. YouTube, a division of Alphabet leased space in San Bruno. And Microsoft recently submitted plans for a new campus in Mountain View, with construction expected to begin next year.","Southern California region continues to be strong, just driven by solid job growth in each market. The 8.4% NOI growth rate achieved in 2015 was the highest in 15 years. We expect the momentum we saw in 2015 to continue into 2016, given the limited new supply in the Southern California region, although we do expect some challenges in the downtown LA, as that local market absorbs the planned deliveries. Rental increases in the San Diego market have increased each year since 2010 and ended the year up 7% over the prior year according to Axio.","I'm pleased with our 2015 results and although I recognize the real economic risk and concerns in the marketplace, the current conditions that we're experiencing in our markets, gives me confidence that we will achieve our plan outlined in guidance. Our portfolio occupancy as of February 2 is at 96.1%, consistent with our budget and our net availability out 30 days stands at 5.3%. We're positioned well to take advantage of the spring rental season.","Looking forward into 2016, we again expect demand to substantially exceed supply in our markets by over 2 times, leading to continued rental market strength. In January of 2016, our average achieved rent for new leases for our three regions was 2.4% above our achieved rent in December of 2015, consistent with our budget. I think our momentum positions us well for 2016.","Thank you and I will now turn the call over to Angela Kleiman.","Angela Kleiman","Thanks, John. Today I will briefly review 2015 results, then focus on 2016 guidance and provide a balance sheet update. For 2015, I'm pleased to report that our same-property revenue growth for the full year was 8% which exceeded the midpoint of our guidance. Same property revenue growth and NOI growth for the combined portfolio which consists of the last three quarters of the year was 7.6% and 10.1%, respectively. Both of these also exceeded the midpoint of our most recent guidance.","On to 2016. We anticipate another strong year, with 11% projected core FFO per share growth, primarily driven by same-property growth assumptions. Top line growth of 7% at the midpoint reflects our expectation of continued favorable supply\/demand relationship. For reference, this midpoint is 25 basis points higher than our initial guidance for 2015 which was 6.75%. We're projecting higher operating expense growth of 3.75% at the midpoint.","Controllable expenses are expected to increase modestly at around 1% for the year, therefore, the two key drivers to expense increases are as follows. First, higher utility costs. Note that 2015 utility costs increase was only 0.3%, so very muted, primarily due to water conservation and second, an increase in our allocation to property management expense. This is consistent with what we've previously communicated.","We will review this allocation on a regular basis, in conjunction with our transformation plans. The new management fee allocation equates to 2.4% of revenues which is less than 3% commonly used within the industry. The resulting bottom line is that we're expecting another strong year, with 8.5% NOI growth at the midpoint.","As for G&A, the increase by 5% of the midpoint is primarily due to our new corporate headquarters lease. The offset to this expense as discussed on the previous call, is the yield from reinvesting the proceeds from the sale of our former Palo Alto headquarters, thereby the resulting net impact of FFO is about a $0.01 per share. For the first quarter of this year, we're projecting core FFO per share at the midpoint to be $0.03 below fourth quarter of last year. The reduction is attributed to one-time items such as favorable variance in the fourth quarter in property tax for the legacy BRE portfolio, generating $0.04 of core FFO per share.","In addition, we have recently sold several properties, including Sharon Green and have not fully redeployed those proceeds. The result is a $0.01 per share drag on the first quarter, compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Other assumptions for our guidance can be found on page 5 of the press release and S-14 of the supplemental.","Moving on to the balance sheet, we repaid $150 million of private placement bonds in January and have assumed an unsecured bond offering in our guidance for 2016. The only noteworthy maturity remaining in 2016 is the $200 million term loan in the fourth quarter. We have several options available to refinance this debt which allows us to be opportunistic. We generally favor refinancing our maturities with unsecured debt that is 5 to 10 year in term, depending on the interest rate curve and the related spreads.","Lastly, we're ahead of our schedule in reducing our net debt to EBITDA to 5.8 times, due to substantial growth in EBITDA. Based on recent $215 stock price, our leverage or debt to market cap is at 27%. In comparison, heading into the great 2008 recession, our leverage was 35% at the end of 2007.","Therefore with our $1 billion line of credit extended to 2021 unfunded commitments of $230 million which is below 3% of total market cap and with a light maturity schedule over the next several years, we're well-positioned to be opportunistic and to weather any potential capital markets dislocation.","That concludes my remarks and I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Kris Trafton with Credit Suisse. Please state your question.","Kris Trafton","Just wanted to dig a little bit deeper into the same-store revenue growth guidance. It looks like you're modeling about 100 basis point decrease in the revenue growth rate, but since 2015 rent growth was about 70 basis points higher than 2014. Would it be safe to assume that maybe there's 50 or so basis points in higher loss to lease there? And then, does the -- I appreciate the San Francisco slowdown, but does that really get you all the way down, to the revenue growth rate guidance that you have for 2016?","Michael Schall","This is Mike and if I miss a piece of your question, please go ahead and correct me. But our general thesis has been that Northern California has obviously been the strongest market for a long time and Seattle right behind it. But over time, we expected Southern California to slowly improve, while Northern California which was hitting these double-digit NOI growth rates would slowly decline. I think that we're still anticipating that process to occur, although the resiliency in the tech markets has been a little bit surprising to us, obviously a positive surprise.","And so, I think the numbers this year, we have -- again, if you go to the forecast, the market forecast -- we have Northern California at about 7.5% and our guidance is marginally higher than that. And so, we're expecting a little bit of loss to lease usage. That would with the delta in the two different numbers. So does that make sense, as it relates to Northern Cal?","Kris Trafton","Right. It just seems like that would imply a pretty strong slowdown, given the loss lease is higher this time this year, than versus same time last year.","Michael Schall","Well, it was at the end of the year, loss to lease was 2.8% and so it decelerated a lot in Q4. Of course, Q4 was a dip and it is higher at the end of January than it was at the end of December. Again, you have the impact of what we think happened. Again as I mentioned in my comments, we had lumpy supply hitting the market in Q4 in Northern California.","And when that happens, some people that are trying to lease up their apartment buildings become more aggressive, with respect to concessions and\/or rent levels and when that happens everyone else adjusts along with it. And again, this is within a period that you always have a lower demand for a variety of reasons. And so, you have lower demand. You have too much hitting the marketplace and owners reacting very aggressively.","I think that, that as John Burkart has pointed out has largely run the course, because demand has returned to normal levels. Some of those lease-ups have adjusted in price. And as a result, the world looks like it's more or less on track for what we thought was going to happen.","So again, from my perspective, the fourth quarter is the least relevant quarter. And I know, seems like the analysts focus on it many times over the last 10 years and I think that they give it too much weight, in terms of the overall relevance of the quarter. It's the least relevant. Things can happen, just given the slowdown in demand and I think that's what happened this year and it's happened many times before.","Kris Trafton","And then second, looks like you're going to be a strong net acquirer next year too. And even though you have a near historic low cost of capital and price, private valuation in apartments hasn't probably peaked yet. Valuations are still pretty expensive. Is this mostly a function of your implied cap rate relative -- or your price relative to NAV? And then, I guess, generally what's the rationale for being a strong net buyer this year, when peers across the board are heavy net sellers?","Michael Schall","I think we're going to be a more aggressive seller and a more aggressive -- well, not a more aggressive buyer, we're going to be consistent on the buy side and we're going to be a more aggressive seller. The question is how we fund that activity? And we have a co-investment program, that if we don't like the stock price -- in other words, if we think the stock price implied return is higher than the asset that we buy, we're obviously not going to issue the stock in order to buy it. So we will go into a co-investment type function.","I think as I look back at many years of doing this, we do best when there's a disruption in the marketplace and assets can sometimes be mispriced. And if that happens, we want to be ready to do so. Again, I think the chances -- of exactly where we fund it, change every day, it's change with the stock price. Based on today's price, obviously I would not be excited about using our stock. But if you go back three months, our stock price and the markets in general have been all over the place.","And we can't tell you what's going to happen in the future. We just recognize it's a very volatile period of time. And I guess, we would ask people to trust us, to make wise decisions with respect to how we conduct ourselves in the investment markets. It is possible that we won't do nearly that much in acquisitions, if we can't find transactions and we -- relative to our cost of capital that makes sense.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nick Yulico with UBS. Please state your question.","Nick Yulico","Mike, I think at one point you had said that, back in November when you were looking at the sale of Sharon Green, you contemplated doing a stock buyback, instead you went to 1031 acquisition route. I mean, looking at your stock today, it's lower than in November. And presumably, you would still go out and do a sizable disposition and potentially buy back your stock. I mean, how are you thinking about that today?","Michael Schall","The answer is we can't possibly predict. It's all over the place. And it's hard to run a business and enter into transactions that take what, 60 days to close and expect anything with respect to your stock price. As it relates to Sharon Green, you're right. Originally, we had intended to1031 exchange around two-thirds of the proceeds, pull forward a dividend in order to create some money that we could use for a stock buyback.","We changed that plan when the stock was in the $230 to $240 range and decided to 1031 exchange everything. But that demonstrates how we think about the world. We try to again, make good decisions with our eye focused on building NAV per share and building cash flow per share. And it's worked out for us really well over a lot of years and we'll continue doing that going forward.","But to your point, it is incredibly difficult to plan exactly what we're going to do, when the world is changing so much. And I would say the same thing is true, with respect to our guidance. We issued our market forecast last quarter. Many may argue that the prospects for GDP growth are not nearly as good today, as they were just a couple of months ago. But the reality is, who knows? We're using a number that economy.com, the 2.8% GDP growth, with the expectation that the economy will improve as we go through 2016. But the reality is, we don't know that either.","We try to again, react to the business, keep our eyes focused on the transaction activity out there and then make the decisions. We expect this to be a challenging year, from the perspective of uncertainty and volatility. And again, I think that we generally do well in that type of environment. Certainly, with respect to transactions because things tend to become mispriced and\/or there -- it could cause sellers for example, the uncertainty often can cause sellers to become more interested in selling. So maybe we'll see more transactions hit the marketplace.","I know on the development side, the construction side, there cost increases and other factors have caused development deals to not pencil the way that developers had hoped that they would pencil. And that could lead to some other opportunities in that area. Again, I don't know what's going to happen this year. And to any great extent, there's so much volatility out there. But we think that we have produced a scenario that makes sense, given the broader environment and we will see what happens.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nick Joseph with Citigroup. Please state your question.","Nick Joseph","You talked about Southern California improving and Northern California moderating. When would you expect Southern California to actually catch up to Northern California, in terms of absolute revenue growth?","John Burkart","You're talking year-over-year, not in 2016, not likely -- this is John Burkart, I should say. But 2017, it's a little bit early to tell, but we're seeing good strength out of Southern California. We're pleased with what's going on out there and it's fairly solid across the markets down there.","Nick Joseph","And then in terms of maybe the relative strengthening of Southern California, versus the moderation in Northern California, would you expect without giving 2017 guidance, would you expect them to meet somewhere in between? Or would you expect Northern California to come down to where Southern California is or conversely the other way?","Michael Schall","Now you're going into the unknowables, obviously when you get into 2017. That's far enough away, that it's difficult to see that far, because the world is changing as you know rather quickly. But I will say that, the other point that I made in my comments what is the impact of wealth, this incredible wealth that's been created by Alphabet -- and I think I said Google, I meant Apple in my comments -- the tremendous amount of cash that's there, the wealth that's been created, et cetera. What is the long term impact of that on the marketplace, as you look out two or three years? And we don't know the answer to that. We think it's pretty positive.","And as an example, we can cite what happened when Bill Gates decided to move Microsoft to Seattle and really form that business in the Seattle market. I think it transformed Seattle in ways that we can't really understand. There are books that are written about this and we've talked about them before. But again, this incredible wealth generation will increase economic activity, we know that.","It will bring the best and brightest people into the marketplaces and those that own these companies will reinvest those funds, in ways that are generally very, very good for the economy. So that is part of the equation that's difficult to predict, as you get beyond 2017 and 2018. Although hey, I wouldn't count the tech markets out of the ballgame, with respect to growth rates in 2017 and 2018 because of this factor. Again, it's hard to understand it exactly right now. But looking at Seattle as an example, I think you'll see continued development in these markets for a longer period of time.","Nick Joseph","Then just, you talked about the loss to lease in the portfolio. So if 2016 plays out how guidance in your market growth assumptions assume, what would you expect the loss to lease in the portfolio to be at the end of 2016?","Michael Schall","Typically loss to lease will peak in July and the number will be roughly half in December, what it was in July. So last July it was around 7% to 8% -- I think it was 8%. And so, you would expect December to be around 4% and it was 2.8%.","So it was a little bit less. But again, we attribute that to the unique factors that occurred in Q4. I don't think that's a normal deviation. So but I would expect another good year. And I think that we will peak in loss to lease probably in July and somewhere around 7% is what I would guess.","Operator","Our next question comes from Greg Van Winkle with Morgan Stanley. Please state your question.","Greg Van Winkle","Just wanted to get a little more color on Southern California. If I'm not mistaken, I think your guidance actually suggests a little bit of deceleration in same-store revenue growth there from 2015 to 2016. So just want to understand that a little better. Are there certain sub markets driving that? If I look at some of your peers, it looks like some of them are actually expecting acceleration. So I don't know if that's a difference in sub markets or if it's possible you guys think you'll see some acceleration too, but you're just being a bit conservative for now?","John Burkart","This is John. We tend to be a little bit conservative and try to be thoughtful in how we're looking at the world. And so yes, 2015 was an exceptional year, no question about it. We think 2016 will be very strong. We've laid out the numbers as far as job growth and supply and the market is still very supply constrained. So we do expect 2016 to be a very good year and I think it's very positive. We're not anticipating that market slowing down. It's doing very well right now.","Greg Van Winkle","And then, being in the center of the tech world in San Francisco, I'm curious what your thoughts are on Airbnb? We're seeing some of your competitors, start to discuss partnering with them. And I'm just curious whether you're viewing Airbnb as potential opportunity at this point? Or more of a threat or something you're still trying to figure out?","John Burkart","Yes, I think with -- this is John again. I think with Airbnb or any of these sharing economy type entities, what they're trying to accomplish is really deal with one of their issues which is the prohibition of the leases to sublet space. So a lot of the discussion, people -- I think people think that they're trying to move the apartments into hotel-type situations. And that's not really the case or at least not what I've seen or heard. It's really a matter of trying to work with the landlords that -- to encourage the landlords to allow their residents to under certain circumstances move forward and sublet some space.","And that concept is in exchange for a very small fee to the landlord, that is really their goal. From my perspective, there's a couple of issues out there that are pretty important which includes municipalities who commonly forbid this. So that would be another issue. And really the biggest issue is, our resident satisfaction for our current resident. So weighing a relatively small fee, versus the resident satisfaction or the impact to the quality of life to our residents, really doesn't seem like a program that would make sense. We're aware of these things, we watch these things. But it's -- I don't think it's something that you're going to see anyone jump into in a big way.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please state your question.","Austin Wurschmidt","It's Austin Wurschmidt here with Jordan. Thanks for taking the question. Given your comments, I guess, on the dislocations you're seeing today in the construction lending market, I was just curious if you guys were looking at any mezz opportunities today?","Michael Schall","Yes, this is Mike, Austin. Yes, we're. It's one of the areas that we're looking at. In the development area, we all know that there's permits that are being pulled. And those generally speaking do not meet our underwriting criteria for, to get us excited about a development. But we're looking at some of them as it relates to a joint venture type opportunity which could include potentially a mezz type of transaction. So yes, definitely something we're looking at.","Austin Wurschmidt","And then in kind of in a similar light, I guess, given the credit market disruptions. And then you mentioned even some supply challenges in downtown LA, is that -- are you seeing developers bring market -- bring assets to market, just looking to kind of unload today, amidst some of the disruptions?","Michael Schall","It's Mike again. We just don't see that much transaction volume out there of the property that we want to own. There are transactions. If you look at broader transaction markets, there are plenty of real estate [indiscernible] trading hands, but we tend to be very focused on more of the urban and the higher quality suburban areas, suburban transit for example areas and so we're very selective.","And that product does not come to market often. And when it does, we're obviously very excited about it. So again, it's hard to anticipate exactly what is going to happen, given all this disruption. We hope for a more active transaction market going forward and if we find that, then you can expect us to be pretty active. But we just don't know at this point.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jana Galan with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. Please state your question.","Jana Galan","Just a quick follow-up on the investment market and acquisitions, as you're looking at potential market disruptions, are you considering any markets outside of your current geographic footprint?","Michael Schall","No, we're not. We have identified the markets that we want to be in and we're going to stay focused on them. And I think our reputation as a local sharpshooter is important to us and anything outside of our existing markets would be viewed as deviation from the plan. So no, we're not looking at anything else.","Operator","Our next question comes from Karin Ford with Mitsubishi U.S.J. Please state your question.","Karin Ford","Have the unique drivers that you described in Northern Cal that drove the rent weakness in 4Q 2015 already reversed in January or is it too early to tell?","John Burkart","Yes, this is John. Let me give you some insight there. I'm going to give you some rents here. This is year-over-year rents, so you can get a feel for what was going on there. So in November, our achieved rents on new leases were up about 10.4% in Northern California. In December, that number dropped to 4.9% and that's what everyone has noted.","In January, we went back up to 8.9%. So January turned around and was much better for us in Northern California. And those rents in January, of course, are above December rents and above year-over-year significantly. It's a little early to tell at this point in time, because again, there's still not a lot of transactions that go on in November, December and January. But what we're seeing is very positive. It's consistent with our plan for the year and we feel good about things.","Karin Ford","Would you say January's back to normal seasonality or is it a sharper snapback?","John Burkart","No, it was a sharper snapback.","Karin Ford","Okay.","John Burkart","Really mirroring the drop in December.","Michael Schall","And let me just interject for a second? Sorry about that. But consider, again, I think a lot of it was supply-driven, a lot of supply hitting the market in December and move-outs to buy homes. I think there was a piece of that in that -- with Fed interest rate increases, more people went out and bought a home. And so, we had more move-outs to buy homes. So there were a number of supply factors again hitting in the seasonally lowest demand period. So it makes sense -- what John said, I think makes total sense, that there was a relatively sharp snapback, as soon as those conditions normalized.","Karin Ford","And just lastly, can you talk about any trends you saw in your current lease-ups and give us any details on your planned new starts for this year?","John Burkart","I'll talk about the lease-ups and then I'll have John talk about the starts. But on the lease-ups, what we saw is really a tale of two stories. We have the MB360, where we continue to power-on with high lease-up velocity. In that particular case, we lowered our net effective rents a little bit to keep velocity.","In Epic, we kept rents a little bit higher. We have a Phase I and phase II leasing out of the same building. And in that case, our velocity went down a little bit, but again all of this is according to plan. So overall, we finished up the One South Market lease-up in the quarter. Epic, we're very close, we're over 90% and MB360 is flying along as you can see.","So the concern that people had, I certainly share. We read the papers and we listen. Reached out to an awful lot of people and of course, including the managers that are running the lease-ups and had good conversations with all of them. And their view was, this is really consistent with seasonal issues, with some level of -- as far as demand goes and then the supply impacting the rents. So hopefully that helps. And I'll let John talk about planned development.","John Eudy","We anticipate three starts this year, around roughly in the mid $400 million to $500 million range, all three of which have older land costs and entitlement costs, that were prior to the big spike that we've seen in the last 1.5 year. We're going to be facing the current construction costs, of course, but because of our basis is much lower, that's why the starts make sense.","I can say, if I was out to go transact on the same deals today or at least over the last six months, with current land prices and fees, exactions from the cities, we probably wouldn't be able to do the deals. Hence, we have what we have in the box and we anticipate it happening by the end of the year.","Karin Ford","Can you tell us which markets they're in and what your expected yields are?","John Eudy","Sure. One is in Southern California in a prime market and one is in Silicon Valley in a property, that you're probably aware of that we bought out of bankruptcy in, right after the 2010 meltdown, at a very low land basis. And then, the other one is in Northern California in a ground zero location.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tom Lesnick with Capital One. Please state your question.","Tom Lesnick","I guess, starting off, Angela, with regards to the balance sheet strategy, I was just wondered if you could kind of walk you through your rationale on putting out a preferred issuance to replace the redeemable preferred issuance this year? And also with regards to the Fannie Mae issue, I guess, just given the amount of capacity you have on your line of credit and the expectation for another unsecured issuance this year, what's your rationale behind all of that?","Angela Kleiman","First part of your question as it relates to preferreds, it's a very small amount. It's only $73 million. And so, in terms of the thinking potentially to refinance, it's really to keep the flexibility of having a preferred equity tranche.","We haven't decided that we would execute that plan, but it is a part of our guidance just as a base case. And as far as this -- I wasn't sure what you are referring to in your second question. Can you repeat that?","Tom Lesnick","Well, it's the Fannie Mae credit enhanced issue from this quarter, correct?","Angela Kleiman","Okay. The total return swap on the refinancing on that, essentially it just -- it was to lower our interest rate. It's $1.4 million in savings. The $4.3 million non-cash write-off was essentially the unamortized loan fees. So it was just an economical decision that was in our favor, in terms of the cost of debt. Is that what you were looking for?","Tom Lesnick","Yes, I was just trying to weigh that against the cost of having a more complicated debt stack, as opposed to one that's more simplified. But just keeping it to unsecured.","Angela Kleiman","Actually, the structure itself is more simplified. And so, if you want, we can talk a little bit more after the call. But this is a SIFMA plus 70 and the other one was a Fannie credit enhanced. So the trade-off in terms of structure, it's not more complex.","Tom Lesnick","Okay. And then my other question was just, can you provide an update on Phase III and the progress with BRE in that regard?","John Burkart","Sure. Yes, this is John. From the BRE perspective, as far as the legacy portfolio, we've certainly come along way. As I mentioned in my remarks, some of the opportunities we still have going forward, specifically with that portfolio relating to amenity -- refining the amenity adjustments and expirations. And the expirations have been commented on several times, but for clarity, clearly we can fix that within a 12 month period as the lease expires and force things into a certain bucket.","The problem is it's not the best thing to do economically. Typically you're better to work through that over a couple year period and not force people to take actions that are inconsistent with the market. So we just try to move it on the margin and that's what we're doing. As it relates to the amenity adjustments, that takes several years to get right.","And frankly, on the Essex legacy side, we're still refining that as well, trying to really connect with how the market perceives the different valuations of our similar unit types and make adjustments is an ongoing effort at our Company. It just needed a lot more work on the BRE side, as they really just started that revenue management process.","On the big picture, on the expense side, things are in pretty good order there. We now have the BRE portfolio, legacy portfolio performing on a controllable expense basis, maintenance, admin and those types of expenses, on a per unit basis below the Essex portfolio. And that makes sense, that portfolio's a little newer than ours. And so, we've done an awful lot of work and we have that in very good order. From a management perspective, we have great people and that is completely intermixed throughout the portfolio.","So there is no Essex or BRE assets. They're all Essex assets and how we manage them is almost exactly the same. There's a few nuanced items that are getting cleaned up, but basically almost 100% the same. That's come along way and we're very pleased with where that's at.","On the renovation, the last big piece, that piece takes time. Again, our renovation program, we're pretty focused on making sure our product meets the market exactly. It's a very asset by asset program. And so, we've mentioned we have launched it which we have. 2016, we'll have a greater focus on the BRE portfolio as a percentage, than we will on the Essex portfolio. And that's a switch from this last year and we'll continue to explore those opportunities. Hopefully that answers the question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Please state your question.","Alexander Goldfarb","So a few questions here. First, Mike, can appreciate your comments on tech and the jobs out there in your opening remarks. Looking, I guess, what was a little surprising is looking at your job forecast, the latest one in your supp today, versus the one a year ago, the job growth forecasts are sort of similar. And yet obviously, the news headlines today are clearly fresher than they were a year ago. But Twitter, Yahoo, you see some of these companies that are in the news, whether for business model issues or space giveback on their office use.","And just trying to reconcile the two, what would be the things that you guys would look for that would tell you something is happening -- a red flag out there that would tell you that things may be changing? Because the outlook that you gave in your job picture is a bit different than sort of the sentiment, if you read the newspapers or speak to folks? Not your folks, but speak to on this side of the country.","Michael Schall","Yes, Alex, it's Mike. The one point, is that we pretty dramatically outperform the job forecast last year. So yes, this year as a forecast is pretty similar to last year, but you had the large outperformance in the middle of that which we didn't expect, obviously. So we're going back to a, what we consider to be a more sustainable job forecast.","And so, going forward, how do we detect that things are different from plan? We would use our own portfolio as being a primary source. Typically what happens in the portfolio, when you look at 30 day forward availability and some of the other portfolio metrics, you will see dislocation happening more quickly than the data vendors will pick it up, generally by one or two months. So we would generally see that a hiccup happening right in the rental activity and the forward availability. So we'll look for that and that will be the primary trigger to focus more effort on what's going on.","In terms of what we're most concerned about, a lot of people talk about the unicorns out there. And we're less concerned about them, more concerned about the large tech companies. Because when you look at the number of employees, it's pretty dramatically different. Again, back to our top 10 tech public companies, there's about -- they have about 165,000 employees in the Bay Area, whereas the top 20 unicorns have about 11,000 employees in the Bay Area.","So we're clearly more concerned about the top 10 or the big tech companies. But we're also on the flip side, we also recognize that they have such tremendous financial capabilities, again the amount of cash that they have, the amount of growth that they've generated, the office space that they're leasing and the overall commercial activity. There's nothing to us that appears to be a hiccup in what their activities are. And that is what's really driving or anchoring our forecast for next year.","Angela Kleiman","And Alex, I just want to address your comment about office space. Because we saw the same thing which was Google and Apple, they were pulling back in their office lease in the East Coast. But when we looked at the whole -- the big picture, we also recognized that they expanded their office space here close to headquarters. So there's been a conscious decision to try to be more centralized.","But net office space as concerned, they've not decreased in that. The news about Yahoo laying off 700 employees. But what we also saw was Sony PlayStation Entertainment moving their headquarters from Japan to San Mateo and expanding obviously their office needs and which will bring in another -- what we would expect 700 -- or hiring 700 to 800 new employees.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay.","Angela Kleiman","So the context.","Alexander Goldfarb","The second question is you guys -- one of the 1031 properties was downtown LA. You guys had been investing in downtown LA for quite some time. So just sort of curious, now that you've had a number of properties there, how do you view that the properties have been performing relative to your underwriting?","Michael Schall","They performed generally in line with our underwriting. There is a pretty significant amount of supply coming into the downtown. And from our perspective that's going to require people that are working in the downtown, but living somewhere else to relocate to the downtown. And we expect that to be somewhat choppy.","But the overall supply\/demand of LA is incredibly positive to us. Los Angeles County produces somewhere around 0.5% or 0.6% of its stock every year. And it's getting demand growth that is well in excess of that, but that supply is focused really on the CBD LA, as that transitions from being a sleepy downtown to being a 24 hour city. And we believe that is on track and we believe that the long haul or long term potential is fantastic in that marketplace, even though there might be some bumps along the way.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim Sullivan with Cowen and Company. Please state your question.","Jim Sulivan","Mike, at the risk of beating this dead horse on the demand forecast, just to make sure I understand. In your prepared comments, I think you mentioned economy.com as the source of a, I guess, as the U.S. GDP forecast assumption and the national job growth assumption. For the individual markets, is that data also economy.com or is that based on your own research or some other local research source you look at?","Michael Schall","Do you mean the job forecast by market?","Jim Sulivan","Yes.","Michael Schall","Or the economic rank forecast?","Jim Sulivan","Well, the job forecast by market -- and I understood you to I say that the economy.com forecast was both job and GDP. Is that not right?","Michael Schall","Well, it really is a -- we use of variety of data vendors and again we prepared this forecast last quarter. So the world was a little bit different then. And we could go through the process of changing the forecast dramatically, but the reality is the world is changing so rapidly, that you can't change the forecast every month. It -- which would almost be necessary, based on the amount of volatility we've had in the marketplace.","But what our process is, is we use the macro data for the broad macro numbers which are U.S. GDP growth and U.S. job growth. And then we derive the more specific market forecast, based on our own supply\/demand analysis. And Angela has come up with a regression analysis, that takes into account various different factors, including supply and demand. It includes wage growth, for example, as one of the key items or affordability. And so, the economic rent growth in our market forecast is Essex proprietary, but it's driven by macro numbers that come from data providers.","I think 2.8% is the highest of the data providers, as I recall looking at the list. There are some that are in the 1.5% range. Again, we could change this on an ongoing basis, but to what point? I think that the forecast looks achievable.","If you look at last year, we missed the GDP forecast, but outperformed on the job side. So is this a perfect science? Obviously, it's not. And it seems like we had resilience on the job growth side, relative to historical relationships. And again, I think it goes back to that wealth -- the incredible wealth creation that we've had on the West Coast that is really driving economic activity, that is disconnecting from a lot of the data going back 5 or 10 years.","I think a lot of things are happening. It seems to us that these are achievable numbers and again we'll see. We expect a volatile year, as I know everyone knows.","Jim Sulivan","Sure. Yes and you mentioned that a few times here so. So the bottom line is, in the terms of the forecast that's contained at the end of -- at the back of the fourth quarter supp, it's basically as it was at the end of the third quarter. And it's -- I take the point, you don't want to be reacting to every zig and zag in the data. And the data has been volatile itself, of course, but the regression analysis that Angela does, presumably that gets updated quarterly? Or is that where you put it in place at the beginning of the year and if reality turns out to be a little different, you may readjust, but it's not like you redo the regression every 90 days?","Michael Schall","Yes, I mean, it's impractical to do that. Obviously, the market forecast drives our budgeting process. It isn't like we're going to change our budgets overnight or every month.","Jim Sulivan","Sure.","Michael Schall","So we try to do this in a thoughtful manner. We debate this -- we debated whether we should reduce the forecast and no doubt some people out there think that we should have. But ultimately, we felt comfortable with it -- with the caveat that I mentioned in my prepared remarks, that there's probably greater risk to the forecast than there was a quarter ago.","Jim Sulivan","Simply because the macro data and the announcements we're hearing from companies is indicating cutbacks in capital spending and other call it, general moderation across the economy?","Michael Schall","Yes, given that, but again -- you look at what we see out here which is, again, these amount of cash and wealth that these companies have. And looking at Alphabet specifically, I think they have the financial worth to do pretty much whatever they want to do. And in fact, are in a whole bunch of different businesses. And that I don't think is going to slow down a whole heck of a lot. It doesn't appear to be slowing down a whole lot.","And the financial wherewithal to purchase pursue multiple businesses at one time is absolutely assured. That's part of what we're thinking as well, is the ability to continue to push forward with expansion of these various businesses, is something that we're counting on continuing going forward.","Jim Sulivan","Sure. Just finally from me, if I could, the -- your supply forecast is presumably something that your team puts together, I guess, based on your knowledge of what's happening in the market? That's obviously a lot less volatile than potentially the demand forecast. But is that the source of that primarily, it's your own team's forecast?","Michael Schall","Well, again, we use data providers to give us the list of transactions. And then inevitably, you have the same project called three different things. And so you try to go you through and identify -- this is what our team does -- we try to go through and we identify where each project is. And then based on that, we eliminate the duplication in the data. And we think we get a much better forecast as a result of that, than a lot of the data providers have. We exclude from this student housing, senior housing and some of the other categories that others include in their data as well, as historically that has not proven that relevant to our overall activities.","Operator","Our next question comes from Drew Babin with Robert W. Baird. Please state your question.","Drew Babin","Quickly, I was hoping to isolate what you are assuming in terms of ROI from the resource management initiatives implemented already, particularly within the BRE assets? And whether increased activity, being able to touch more units this year may provide some upside to the expense growth guidance that was given?","John Burkart","I think regarding our expense growth guidance, we've factored things in appropriately. But just big picture for clarity, we have our resource management and we categorize that separately than the renovation. So on the resource management, those initiatives tend to have pretty high IRRs and they tend to be somewhere between the mid-teens,15%s to 25%s.","And we found some very good opportunities in the renovations. Those tend to be in the mid-teens or a little bit less and we're executing those as well. But the guidance reflects what our expectations are.","Operator","Our next question comes from Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets.","Wes Golladay","I just want to follow up on San Francisco. Can we fast forward to the next slowdown, how much do you see it playing out? I think it's always viewed as a boom\/ bust market, but you mentioned the well-capitalized companies. Its sounds like there may be pent-up demand and some good visibility for office leasing? So your thoughts on the next slowdown?","Michael Schall","Again, let's put this in the unknowable category. And when it comes to the unknowables, I have to go back and maybe summarize what I've seen in the last 30 years, as it relates to Northern California and I've seen huge dislocation and disruption.","Obviously, the Internet period was an incredible period, in terms of that. And for example, you had I think price to sales ratios were something like 49 times in year 2000 and they're more like 7 now. So you had an incredible asset bubble, with respect to these tech companies. And that went on for a lot longer than anyone expected it to go on and ultimately had a horrific impact on things. I think that really is the exception, though. When you look at 2007, 2008 or 2008, 2009 recession, actually the tech world did rather well.","It was construction, government, manufacturing, et cetera, that did incredibly poorly and tanked everything. I think that's actually more of my belief, with respect to the tech world. It's not necessarily the tech world that tends to be so volatile, in terms of employment. It's the broader economy.","So I don't have necessarily any great fear about tech itself. I have fear about just generally, what's happening in the economy on -- because I think actually tech, with the one notable exception of the Internet boom and bust period, tech has actually done reasonably well during the economic cycles and the downturns.","Wes Golladay","Okay. So on a relative basis, it could hold up the cycle. I think maybe fears may be a little overblown, at the moment on a relative basis at least?","Michael Schall","Well, I guess, I'd ask, where else are you going to go? I mean, what are you going to -- you can stay in cash at 20 basis points or something like that. But I mean, as we look at the industries and what's happening in the world, it seems like tech is actually pretty well-positioned, relative to some of the other choices. We know that Southern California, for example, is a more diversified economy and therefore will have less dislocation. But again, not the same growth rate either.","So if we see significant dislocation in the tech markets, we will obviously try to move more of the portfolio southward. There is a small bias toward that, as you saw in the Sharon Green transaction, where we sell Northern California and we reinvest two-thirds Northern California, one-third Southern California. I think you'll continue to see some of that again. But again, we're not in a mindset that we need to divest of tech, the tech market.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities. Please state your question.","Rich Anderson","So several years ago, I remember sitting down with Keith and he was complaining about his $100 stock price. And I thought at the time how crazy it was to think that, let alone say it out loud. Of course, had you known your stock would have gone up to $250 or close to it a few years later, you all would have taken that in a heartbeat and your execution has been outstanding. But right now, this long list as Goldfarb pointed out of things going on, to what extent -- a lot of people are asking what are the signals and you're not seeing in your fundamentals yet? But with all this in mind, what would you do?","Forget about what the signal might be, but what would you do? Would there be an idea of selling assets in bulk? Because one thing that you still have is fantastic asset value, you could sell assets today at incredibly low cap rates, maybe pay a special dividend, delever further and really hunker down. I mean, what kind of action would you take, if you do see something pop up in your fundamentals?","Michael Schall","It's Mike and Keith is still here. I talked to him this morning. He asked what happened to his $240 stock price? But yes, Keith is always with us. Again, it goes back to that relationship between asset values and the stock price and that has been changing, seemingly every day. And we sure would like to see some consistency in stock price before we make big, strategic decisions. And unfortunately, that's probably not going to happen this year. And so, but we will look for opportunities, much like Sharon Green, where we think we can sell an asset and either buy the stock back or pay a special dividend. Both of them are potentially attractive to us.","And but we want to see some meaningful pick-up, in terms of impact on NAV per share. So today, that is probably there, but it wasn't there last week. And again, the -- it takes, what 60 to 90 days to actually go through the transaction process and then you have got to work through the reinvestment plan. So we're trying to do the best we can.","I will tell you that we will sell more assets this year, than we've sold for the last several years. And I think that will continue to trend and we'll look for both -- really two different things. One, paring off the assets that we think will underperform over the longer period which will probably be in a higher cap rate type of area, but then the more opportunistic, much like Sharon Green assets that traded at a very attractive, very aggressive cap rate that we can redeploy at a positive spread. So we'll be looking at those.","Rich Anderson","Okay. And so, you said that the fundamentals tend to give you a month or two head start. Is it possible now that, when you look at just the craziness of the Bay area housing market, that maybe what's going on is being hidden from view? It's just a different set of circumstances right now? Is that something that keeps you up at night as well, that maybe the indicators that we've relied on in past cycles may not present themselves the same way this time around?","Michael Schall","Well, that's always the case and we're always concerned that we're missing something. And I'll say in the fourth quarter, there were more move-outs to buy homes and that caused some availability increase. Again, I think a lot of it was tied to the Fed action and the belief that you need to get into a house now, as opposed to wait which turned out to probably be the wrong answer. But that 30 day availability has really been the bedrock of our management of both price and where the market is going. And it's a pretty sensitive variable, that I think it captures appropriately what's going on in the marketplace.","So we're going to pay particular attention to that. And then if that moves, then the next position -- next point is hey, is this a one-time only or is it a trend? And so, we'll be trying to figure that out, right after there's some movement in that area. Again, as John has indicated, January bounced back so nicely, that we don't think that what happened in Q4, is anything other than an isolated occurrence.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dave Bragg with Green Street Advisors. Please state your question.","Dave Bragg","As you've discussed on the call, Mike, I think that Essex has earned a reputation as one that will adjust, as needed to the change in cost of capital. But just have a couple questions on specific things -- that I'd like to understand how you think about a couple specific things? The first is, I think that you suggested that if the stock price is unfavorable, you would shift away from wholly-owned acquisitions and more towards co-investment. But how do you think about co-investments, relative to just making no acquisitions at all?","Michael Schall","We have to be able to add per share growth, NAV and cash flow to the portfolio. And I don't know if we've shared with you, but we have an accretion model that we run for every deal, that tries to measure those against the portfolio. And again, we're trying to add value to the stock, not subtract value from the stock and our process is really designed around that. And so, we do not feel compelled to do transactions, just for the sake of doing transactions. And we certainly don't feel compelled to do transactions for quote, unquote, strategic reasons. We want to make deals that make sense and that are additive to shareholder value over the long haul.","And I go all the way back to 1995, 1996 and we talked about what our long term goals were and they are as relevant today as they were back then. And we said basically, hey, if we can grow -- effectively what's core FFO was FFO back then -- at somewhere around 8% or 9% a year and pay a dividend that's in the 4%, 5% range, that's going to be a really great thing for shareholders. And we've stayed true to that and we've added a little bit of NAV sensitivity to it as well. But that's what makes these entities do well over the long haul. And as you know, it's worked out pretty well for our shareholders and us.","Dave Bragg","Second question, it just relates to the logistics of hypothetically selling assets and buying back stock. Would you -- if you were to tee up assets for sale and you have maybe some confidence in the private market, would you take that private market risk and buy back stock immediately? Or would you wait the 60-ish days that it takes to close, have the cash in hand and then buy back the stock? How do you think about those decisions?","Michael Schall","We don't like them, Dave, to answer your question because the transactions markets, again they're all over the place and the ability to close with all the variables are -- make it risky. But then again, yes, we've seen this with the Sharon Green transaction, where roughly two-thirds we were going to exchange. And we're going to pull a dividend forward and do -- buy some stock back if we saw some weakness there.","And that was on the table for about 10 seconds and then off the table. So it's a really incredibly challenging thing to do to match this -- match these off in a way that is additive to the shareholders. Fortunately, I have Angela and it's her job to make that happen. So Angela, you want to add anything to that? Hey, it's challenging. It's one of the most difficult things I think we have to do this year.","Angela Kleiman","Well, I think the only thing that I would add is, yes, agree that it is challenging. But we can move generally pretty quickly and we do have a very flexible balance sheet. And so, if -- we have a track record of doing the right thing and we're going to continue to do that.","Dave Bragg","Okay. But on that specific point, it sounds like it's fluid. You don't have a hard fast rule, that you have to wait, get the cash in the door, before you go buy back the stock. You will evaluate it on a case by case basis?","Michael Schall","Well, it's magnitude, right, Dave? I mean, if cap rates go up 100 basis points and the stock goes down, then you're compelled to do it. And you feel like hey, under any scenario, we're going to be able to capture that difference in valuation. If the magnitudes are relatively thin, then why would you take the risk? The risk becomes more apparent.","So it's a question that really doesn't have an answer. We do not have any pre-set biases. As you know, we try to be pretty thoughtful about looking at things and keeping risk in mind. And not do things just because, the common wisdom is to do them, but rather do things because we can add value doing them. So again, it's going to be case by case. And it will be an interesting year and I hope the stock does well. But if it doesn't, we'll come up with another plan. I can assure you of that.","Dave Bragg","Okay. One last one if I may. To what extent have you analyzed your portfolio, to determine what share of it fits within Fannie and Freddie's current definitions of affordable multi-family assets, that are outside the loan -- the caps?","Michael Schall","I don't think that we've actually done that, Dave. And so, it's only relevant to the extent that we have co-investment transactions. And it will be something that we will have to look at as -- if we go down the co-investment path for funding our acquisitions.","Dave Bragg","Well, I thought more so, from a disposition perspective. There's more clarity on that debt capital's presence throughout 2016 than from LICOs [ph] or others, because there's no limits on the amount they can do on the affordable side. So from a disposition perspective, it seems relevant.","Michael Schall","Yes, I'm sure it would be relevant. Again, we have not seen that enter into the equation. We have two transactions in contract on the disposition side. That issue has not come into play for either of them. But it's a good point. It's something that we're going to have to factor in going forward.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Michael Schall for closing remarks.","Michael Schall","Well, thank you all for joining the call today. We appreciate your participation. And obviously, we're pleased with the results last quarter and the outlook ahead. And we look forward to seeing many of you at the Citi conference in March to continue the discussion. Good day.","Operator","This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time."],"8652":["Essex Property Trust Inc (NYSE:ESS) Q1 2016 Results Earnings Conference Call April 29, 2016  2:00 PM ET","Executives","Michael Schall - President, Chief Executive Officer, Director","John Burkart - Senior Executive Vice President of Asset Management","Angela Kleiman - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President","John Eudy - Executive Vice President of Development","Analysts","Austin Wurschmidt - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Nick Yulico - UBS","Nick Joseph - Citigroup","Rob Stevenson - Janney","John Kim - BMO Capital Markets","Ivy Zelman - Zelman & Associates","Tom Lesnick - Capital One","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets","Drew Babin - Robert W.

As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded.","Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs as well as information available to the company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found in the company's filings with the SEC.","When we get to the question and answer portion, management asks that you be respectful of everyone's time and limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you, Mr. Schall. You may begin.","Michael Schall","Thank you for joining us today and welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call. John Burkart and Angela Kleiman will follow me with comments and John Eudy is here for Q&A.","I will cover the following topics on the call. First, comments on Q4 and market conditions. Second, investment activities. And finally, an update on rent control proposals","Yesterday, we were pleased to report continued strong operating results for the first quarter of 2016. For the past several years, one of our primary operating goals has been to grow core FFO per share. I congratulate the Essex team for accomplishing that goal with over 100% increase in core FFO per share since Q1 2011.","Generally speaking, the West Coast economy continues to perform well and we are on track to achieve our 2016 market rent forecast shown on page S16 of the supplement. Recent job reports have generally equaled or exceeded our expectations. In Southern California, we have modestly increased our market rent growth expectations from 5.2% to 5.5%, again mostly related to better-than-expected jobs representing more evidence that our thesis for slow and steady growth continues.","For Northern California, we are lowering our economic rent growth forecast from 7.5% to 6.5%. As noted on our last call, supply deliveries during the typically weak fourth quarter caused lower rent growth in Northern California. Mostly focused on three submarkets, Dalston market in San Francisco, the Peninsula South of San Francisco and North San Jose, which combined account for approximately 7% of our same-store NOI.","As reflected in our Q1 results, we experienced a choppy but nicely down from Q4. March and April have bought renewed pricing pressure focused on these three submarkets in the form of greater concessions, often equal to six to eight weeks of rent as newly delivered apartments push rapid absorption in a competitive market. The greater concessions provide enough incentive to draw people out of nearby properties pressuring price for stabilized communities. Apartment supply deliveries and hiring are inherently lumpy and much like Q4 2015 and the past couple of months, conditions can change quickly. John Burkart will elaborate further in his comments.","Turning to Seattle. We have significantly increased the economic rent forecast for Seattle from 4.9% to 6.1% as its great job growth and strong economy has provided the demand to absorb Seattle's significant new apartment pipeline at higher than expected rents.","On to the second topic, investments. During the quarter, we originated a preferred equity investment on an apartment development consisting of 494 apartment homes located in Glendale, California. The investment provides a 12% preferred return on outstanding principal with a total commitment of $47 million. We are working on other preferred equity transactions as developers are finding themselves in need of additional equity given construction cost increases, more conservative construction lending standards and more challenging and expensive entitlement processes.","Market clearing cap rates for development deals typically generate around a 4.5% to 4.75% untrended cap rate, which is below our yield threshold. We continue to look for development opportunities that meet our underwriting criteria and we are not likely to lower our target in the near term. There has been widespread discussion of increasing cap rates in the West Coast markets. Two of our recent acquisitions, Mio and Enso, both in San Jose, were cited by brokers as examples of cap rates that are higher than comparable properties trading a few months earlier.","We take this as a compliment that we acquired property at a better than market cap rate. However, in our valuation, many deals that we have recently underwritten, the value of Mio and Enso did not change materially in the past several quarters. In our experience cap rates change slowly primarily because buyers and sellers don't change their pricing expectations quickly or easily, rather buyers and sellers need to be convinced that market conditions have permanently changed.","Financial distress often shortens this process for changing cap rate, but currently there is almost no distress in well located apartments. To the contrary, the amount of positive leverage available to buyers at existing cap rates represents a compelling opportunity in this yield starved environment. During the quarter and as outlined in the press release, we acquired two properties to facilitate 1031 exchanges and sold two properties as part of a portfolio culling process.","Similar to last quarter, A-quality property and locations traded around a 4.25% cap rate using the Essex methodology, but from time to time more aggressive buyers will pay sub-poor cap rates. B-quality properties and locations typically have cap rates 25 to 50 basis points higher than A-quality property.","Now on to my third topic, which is rent control. There have been several new developments with respect to rent control in various California cities, mostly in Northern California. Most notable, the City Council in San Jose has amended the existing rent stabilization ordinance to lower the maximum rent increase on renewals to 5% from 8% previously. The amended San Jose ordinance also contains a provision to bank or accumulate up to 8% of potential rent increases to be used during period that market rent increases are below the 5% maximum. Finally, the San Jose ordinance is applicable only to properties built before 1979.","Oakland, which also has been existing rent stabilization ordinance, recently passed an emergency 90-day moratorium on rent increases applicable only to properties built before 1983. In addition to the specific actions in San Jose and Oakland, we believe that tenants rights groups will attempt to win for vote of approval of referendums that will impose rent control in several cities. It is important to note that all local ordinances including the activity just described must comply with state law which mandates, among other things, that vacant apartments are prohibited from rent control and rent control can only be applied to property built before 1996.","We believe that these various ordinances will have limited impact on Essex, primarily because the vast majority of our properties are newer than the rent control cutoff date from the various stabilization ordinances. In addition, because rent control limits renewal rent increases, residents stay longer, which reduces turnover at tent control property. Reduced turnover means that fewer apartments are available to rent for people moving into the area, which likely pushes rents upward on the available apartment inventory.","Thus renewals will often occur at below market rates, but this impact is partially mitigated by higher rents on new leases reflecting the unintended secondary effect of rent control. I am incredibly grateful for John Eudy and many Essex team members for attending and advocating on behalf of the company and the industry at several city council meetings. The meetings contain a lot of emotions and often end well past midnight.","That concludes my comments. Thank you for joining the call today. I will now turn the call over to John Burkart.","John Burkart","Thank you, Mike. We had a good quarter delivering total same-store revenue growth of 7.3% and NOI growth of 8.8%. Our renovation team got off to a great start in 2016. We increased the number of units renovated in the same-store portfolio 229% from 247 units in the first quarter of 2015 to 813 in the first quarter of 2016. The increased unit turns negatively impacted our vacancy rate by about five basis points for the quarter in the same-store portfolio compared to the prior year.","Now I will share some highlights for each region. Strong demand in the Seattle market fueled by employment growth of 3.3% in March, which was above our expectations, enabled the market to absorb the new supply and continue to grow revenue. Our Seattle portfolio grew revenues 7% in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015. We made a strategic decision due to the market strength in the first quarter to emphasize achieved rental rate over occupancy and we will continue to do so as we enter the spring leasing season. That decision is paying off well with better-than-expected performance and it will position us well going forward.","The submarkets performed similar to last year with CBD growing rental revenue about 4% in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the comparable quarter and the East, North Seaside, North and South submarkets are all growing between 7.5% and 9% for the first quarter of 2016 compared to the comparable quarter.","In the Bay Area, as I mentioned previously, our expectations for the first quarter was that the market would be choppy and then it will be followed by the normal seasonal pattern. However, the market is currently softer than expected. Our same-store achieved rent in March 2016 was about 6% over achieved rent in March 2015 and the achieved rent in April of 2015 are roughly 4% over the comparable month, due to the difficult comps.","The BLS survey continues to show strong employment growth in the Bay Area. Industry survey reported March 2016 employment growth rate of 4%, 2.4% and 3.8% for San Francisco, Oakland and San Jose MDs, respectively, which are above our expectations. The household survey reported unemployment declined at average of 50 basis points in each MD year-over-year, which is consistent with strong job growth. Both reports indicates strong employment market, which should be able to absorb the total supply of multifamily and single family units and continue to grow rent.","It appears that in addition to the lumpiness of the multifamily supply deliveries during the low demand period, other factors are currently impacting the demand in the Bay Area market such as doubling up increase in renters to the single-family homes, which enables more roommates to share the rent, onetime impact of the crackdown of student Visa program which has reduced demand for outside the country and an increase in the flexible work arrangements enabling employees to telecommute from outside the normal commute zone.","We have noted a slight change in the geographic location of the open positions listed by the major tech companies with a sight increase in total open positions between Washington and California. However, California open positions have declined slightly while the Washington open positions have increased slightly. This shift maybe the product of a tight labor market and housing market that we have in the Bay Area.","Southern California region continues to perform driven by strong job growth exceeding our expectations. As expected, the momentum we saw in 2015 continued into 2016, enabling us to achieve a revenue growth of 6.1% in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the comparable quarter. In the LA MSA, LA CBD, which is impacted by popular supply, grew rental revenue 4.9% in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015. And the Woodland Hills submarket, which had the greatest positive impact from Porter Ranch Relocation performed at the top of the MSA with an increase in rental revenue of 8.6% for first quarter of 2016 compared to the comparable quarter.","We estimate that the increased demand for short-term rentals related to the Porter Ranch leases increased the year-over-year growth rate for the LA MSA portfolio by about 30 basis points during the first quarter of 2016. Currently our portfolio occupancy is at 95.8% and our availability 30 days out is at 5.4%. Considering the underperformance in the Northern California portfolio, we are cautiously optimistic about the spring leasing season.","Thank you. And I will now turn the call over to Angela Kleiman.","Angela Kleiman","Thanks John. I will start with our first quarter results and then provide an update on recent capital markets activity. I am pleased to report that our core FFO for the first quarter exceeded the midpoint of our guidance by $0.08 per share. Although $0.04 was related to timing of expense, the remaining $0.04 was primarily driven by stronger than anticipated operations, which led to another quarter of solid operating results. Also in the first quarter, we declared a quarterly common dividend of $1.60 per share, which is 11% year-over-year increase and represents our 20th year of consecutive dividend growth.","Moving on to recent capital markets activities. In April, we issued $450 million of 10-year senior unsecured notes at the rate of 3.375% per annum. The net proceeds from the offering were used to pay off the balance on our line of credit, redeem the Series H Preferred Stock and fund other corporate activities. While there is a temporary mismatch on the timing of the use for some portion of the proceeds, we believe it was an opportune time to enter the debt market.","Only remaining maturity this year is $200 million term loan which comes due in November. With zero outstanding on our $1 billion line of credit and limited near-term debt maturities, our balance sheet is well-positioned to be opportunistic as we evaluate future investments and refinancing alternatives. For the full-year, we are reaffirming our guidance for same property revenue, expenses and NOI growth and the midpoint of our core FFO per share of $10.92.","Lastly, I would like to highlight a new page S12.1 in our supplemental which provides additional disclosures on our revenue-generating and non-revenue generating CapEx spending. We hope these enhanced disclosures will be beneficial to the investment community.","I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Jordan Saddler from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question, sir.","Austin Wurschmidt","Hi guys. It's Austin Wurschmidt for Jordan. On the preferred equity deals, I was just wondering if you could give us a sense of the number of deals you are looking at and the potential magnitude of transactions?","Michael Schall","Sure. This is Mike Schall. We are looking at several deals. So somewhere between around five deals going forward. Previously, we have established an overall cap on what we would consider at 5% enterprise value. I think at the end of last quarter we were somewhere around 140 million funded on the preferred equity investments. And so we have quite a ways to go. I don't think we will get anywhere close to the cap.","Austin Wurschmidt","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks for the detail. And then just on the affordable housing, do you think at any point that it spurs, I guess, loosening and permitting or zoning for multifamily housing in the Bay Area?","Michael Schall","Again it's Mike Schall. And John Eudy is here and he may have a comment on this as well. It seems like all the forces are working against that. Number one, the entitlement process is just very challenging. If anything, there are some cities like San Francisco that would like to bump up the number of units that are dedicated to below market rate units. And construction costs are going up at double-digit rate. So it would be difficult to see, especially with rents moderating, a lot of momentum toward more apartment development going forward, at this point in time.","Austin Wurschmidt","Thanks for taking the questions.","Michael Schall","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Nick Yulico","Well, thanks. I just want to go back to the comment John made about, I was a bit confused about, April. I think, you said something about 4% year-over-year rents. Was that for the entire San Francisco Bay area?","John Burkart","This is John speaking. That was for Northern California. So effectively, what happened is rents between March and April were basically flat on a year-over-year comparison because last year normally seasonally rents move up in April. That means that our comparison went from 6% to 4%. And so that flatness is what I was commenting on which is unique in the context of the season. So it's a short window, but that's what we are at right now.","Nick Yulico","And that's your blended new and renewal rent growth?","John Burkart","No. That's new only. Our renewals are in the 6.5% zone in Northern California at this time.","Nick Yulico","Okay. Just wanted to clear on that. And then can you just remind us seen in the entire shore of Northern California region, where are your rents in place today are versus market?","Michael Schall","Do you mean loss off-lease?","Nick Yulico","Yes, right.","Michael Schall","I have that number. This is Mike Schall. Northern California loss to lease, so the difference between scheduled and market rent is 4.8%. A year ago, it was 8.1%.","Nick Yulico","Okay. Great. Thanks, Mike.","Michael Schall","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nick Joseph with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","Nick Joseph","Thanks. One question on guidance. I think for the last two years after the first quarter, you would beat in the first quarter and you raise for the full year 2016. I recognize that part of the beat in this first quarter was timing, what are your thoughts not revisiting overall 2016 guidance at this point?","Michael Schall","Hi. It's Mike Schall. I think John Burkart's comments cover that to some extent. It was that slowdown, from month-to-month actually through the first quarter and into April that was concerning and there was a couple of other pieces too. One is that our evaluation of apartment supply indicates further lumpiness in Q2 and Q3. So roughly in the San Francisco MSA, 3,600 units get delivered in Q2 and 2,700 in Q3. So roughly 70% of the expected annual deliveries will happen in Q2 or Q3. So we are concerned about that and the significance since we renew or turn around 50% of the leases in these next several months, that has a pretty significant impact on the overall result.","So I guess perhaps we are being overly cautious but those were the factors that led us to do that. And actually, let me add one more factor and that is overall supply and demand, as you look at the numbers, appears to be disconnecting in some way. As an example or to go through the numbers, the Bay Area is expected to produce about 93,000 jobs in 2016. That would ordinarily add a 2:1 looking at all housing, not just apartments, would give you 46,000 units of demand against about 20,000 apartments and homes being delivered into the marketplace. So about a 2.1 relationship.","So there should be sufficient demand to absorb the supply if it comes onboard yet what we are seen in the marketplace is that there is more concessions and the supply is not being absorbed as easily as we otherwise would expect. So that supply demand disconnect is of concern to us. It could be indicative of perhaps employment is slowing, but it hasn't really hit the numbers yet. And the last many years that I have been here, it seems that sometimes we see changes in the marketplace before they actually get reported in the numbers. So those would be the little bit of background on why we decided not to change guidance.","Nick Joseph","Thanks. I appreciate the color. And then the spread in terms of same-store revenue growth between Northern California and Southern California continues to contract for the reasons you have discussed. Do you expect at any point this year for Southern California to actually outperform Northern California?","John Burkart","Yes. This is John. It's hard to tell, right. We right now are expecting that the NorCal will follow seasonal patterns. As Mike laid out, there is a lot of strength if you look at the jobs versus the supply. But honestly it's not necessarily working out that way. So yes, there is a year that it happens. This year is Southern Cal is stronger than expected and is doing very well. It might happen somewhere down the line this year or into 2017.","Nick Joseph","Thanks.","Michael Schall","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Rob Stevenson from Janney. Please proceed with your question.","Rob Stevenson","Hi. Good afternoon guys. Can you talk a little bit about LA County results? Was it strong across the board? Or were there pockets of relative strength, relative weakness in the quarter? Obviously 7% plus relative weakness in probably a strong statement, but where within the portfolio was the best performance in LA County? And was it noticeable between some of the submarkets?","Michael Schall","Yes. Overall the submarket were fairly consistent. However, if we are really breaking it down, clearly the Woodland Hills area got some benefits from Porter Ranch. And so that moved it up. It doesn't really move the needle so much as it relates to Essex. But that enabled that submarket to move up a little bit. You might see it some of the AXIO numbers. And then of course the downtown area is a little bit on the low side, again we have supply going in, in that market, but still doing strong. Overall SoCal, as a big picture, is doing well as is LA County. Really, it is interesting. There wasn't a lot of changes. And if you look at the Bay Area, it's a little different. In the Bay Area, you clearly have San Francisco is underperforming and then you have other market, other submarkets in the Bay Area doing stronger. SoCal was much more consistent.","Rob Stevenson","Okay. And then in terms of the shadow development pipeline, how many units are you sort of working through entitlement process through that could start the next year, year-and-a-half or so out there versus basically exhausting your land supply at this point?","Michael Schall","Yes. This is Mike. And again. John Eudy may want to add to this. Our view is that we are more aggressive on development at the bottom of the cycle and we scale office, we go to the top of the cycle. And so we do not have a significant land inventory or land bank at this point in time. In terms of deal making, I know John is looking at deals that are fully entitled, ready to go, we are not taking any cost risk because again construction cost are moving so rapidly that we are concerned about committing and being naked with respect to when we commit to a deal and when it starts. So we have turned to become more conservative and again that really provides the opportunity within or for the preferred equity transactions where we can come in between somewhere sum around the 60% loan to cost to about 85% loan to cost and earn a 12% return there. We fundamentally like that business and we think it's a great time to do that relative to the opportunity in the marketplace.","Rob Stevenson","Are you looking at that business as a path to ownership? Or just basically a 12% investment at this point?","Michael Schall","Well, we would love to negotiate an option to buy at the end of that, but we have not really been able to do that. We could do it if we were willing to give up a significant amount of current return. We haven't made that choice at this point in time. So at this point in time, we are happy to earn that fixed return and get repaid and if there are some bumps down the road somewhere, perhaps we are in a position to buy out our partner.","Rob Stevenson","Okay. Thanks guys.","Michael Schall","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Kim from BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","John Kim","My questions have been asked. Thank you.","Michael Schall","Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Ivy Zelman from Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question.","Ivy Zelman","Thank you. Good afternoon guys. Can you talk a little bit about refinancing environment with respect to availability of financing for construction lending and just land development? And if anything, if we should be modeling more conservatively if the cost is increasing given some less desire from the banks? Or are you guys not seeing that?","Michael Schall","No. That's exactly what we are seeing. A number of our preferred equity transactions over the last several months have really come together because a construction lender is cutting back their construction loan commitment and becoming more conservative. In one case, the construction lender was at the 65% to 68% loan to cost, they cut it back to about 60% and actually in that deal, we went from essentially, there wasn't a place for us in the transaction, they could finance it themselves to creating this the tranche that we ultimately invest in between the 60th and 85th percentile loan to cost. So we have seen a pretty significant change, not just in one or two lenders but really across the board as construction lenders have become more conservative.","Ivy Zelman","Got it. Well, that's helpful. And then just secondly, I think you or Mike Schall was citing some numbers on expected deliveries and I really compliment you guys on being conservative with respect to the outlook. I think that's prudent. When you talk about those deliveries in 2Q and 3Q, Mike were you talking about deliveries in the Bay Area for all of multifamily or was it just the rental portion?","Michael Schall","Yes. Ivy, there are a couple of nuances there. We do not include student housing and we essentially ignore under 100 units and that's part of it. And I was referring to San Francisco directly when I gave out those numbers. So San Francisco, we have again 3,600 units in Q2 and 2,700 units in Q3. San Jose also has pretty significant deliveries in Q2 and Q3 as is Los Angeles. So again, relative to the total, we see Q2 and Q3 is creating potentially more lumpiness similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter and again in March, April.","Ivy Zelman","And just then keeping with the prudent more conservative guide, when you think about deliveries that are coming from condos and recognizing that many of those condos are being bought by investors that might want to cash flow and rent out those units, is there potential risks that could put more pressure relative to market because we are hearing about that, Equity Residential mentioned, they had someone come in below market against their rent by like $800 more than the cash flow. So how do you guys think about that as a rift to your guidance?","Michael Schall","Yes. In terms of how we approach it, we try to lump all housing together because we know that people move out of apartments and buy condos or homes and some will actually go the other direction as well. So our basic analysis is to look at all the jobs, try to determine what the total households are and really not distinguish between what's a rental home and what is a for-sale home. Having said that, the other thing that we pay attention to is affordability of rentals versus homeownership and in every one of our markets and Ivy, you know this better than anyone, the cost of these homes is pretty significant. I think the median priced home in San Francisco is over $1 million and so that transition from a renter to homeowner is really important to us and it's obviously very difficult in this marketplace. But in order to avoid this issue of, okay, how many of these demand units are going to go to for-sale versus for rent, we just look at the whole thing.","Ivy Zelman","No. And I appreciate that. I am sorry. I may have miss communicated the question, right. What we are hearing is that the condos that are being delivered, those that have already been purchased, has a for-sale unit, they may be an investor whether they are from outside the U.S. foreign buyer that wants to now rent it out. Is that a risk that you have incorporated into your outlook that they may be competitive now in the rental and I guess you are saying you just look at it overall and shelter and every delivery you view as a competitive risk?","Michael Schall","Exactly. It's a household. And so we don't care. Well, I mean we care but it should not effect us.","Ivy Zelman","Okay. No, that's great. Well, I got it. Great. That's really helpful and very conservative. Thank you. Good luck.","Michael Schall","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tom Lesnick with Capital One. Please proceed with your question.","Tom Lesnick","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple ones on development. I saw your new start this quarter went into the consolidated bucket of 100% ownership. Can you talk a little bit about how you make the risk allocation decision between placing development into a JV or keeping it on balance sheet?","John Eudy","This is John Eudy. That was a deal that we basically bought out of bankruptcy about four years ago. As you know, it was an operating property, took it through entitlement and have a substantial low land base of the little over 30,000 a door. We were able to get the entitlements without any increased exactions or inclusionary requirements. So the yield is very attractive and not replaceable in today's market which, the short story is, we are probably leave that on the balance sheet.","Tom Lesnick","Got it. I appreciate that color. And then one other quick one. Obviously with the Agora close to initial occupancy and not being a condo finished project, are you guys contemplating any other condo finished development at this point in time?","John Eudy","We map everything we can, just so you know, which is a majority of our deals. But by your question, it sounds like, do we plan on going to a condo program in it out of the shoe? No.","Tom Lesnick","All right. Great. Thanks guys.","Michael Schall","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb from Sandler O'Neill. Please proceed with your question.","Alexander Goldfarb","Hi and good morning out there. Just a few quick questions for you guys. There was a lot in upfront about, I guess increase in rental homes and people doubling up in the Bay Area. So two part on that. One, are you seeing any dynamic at the super, I guess where are these people coming from? Are they like super high-end renters who just got tired of it and said it's cheaper to rent otherwise? Or these are entry level people who just can't make anything else work and therefore they are defaulting to do this? So one, are you seeing more pressure at the high-end rental or at the low end price point? And then I will ask a follow-up after that.","John Burkart","Let me answer a little bit broad here, Alex. First off,, with the supply coming in and they are trying to get the units absorbed, they are naturally offering concessions and those have been increased and they are in at the start of the process as it relates to some of the concessionary activity and then of course others with the consumer, the empowered consumer and with the information age you have some concession jumpers. And so people are moving around and that causes some pressure then on the next level of the apartment.","As it relates to the doubling up, it's really happening at varies levels within apartment zone and you have people that are doubling up into twos, people are doubling up into one, just various things going on and it's all incremental, right. But that incremental takes the hair off the demand that's out there and again ultimately reduce this demand. And so you see it all over. The feedback that we get anecdotally is that the single-family market is very, very high occupancy right now and that again would have taken up some of the demand.","And it makes sense if you think about it, the larger unit in effect and you can put a couple of or two, three, four people in income earners and have a nice space. So I think people are finding ways to deal with the higher rent and some of those again means doubling up.","Alexander Goldfarb","So is it fair to say that, the high price point rents aren't the issue. It's more the lower price point renter is more the pressure point, not the high end renter?","John Burkart","It's across the whole zone.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. And then, Mike Schall, you had mentioned previously that Seattle and San Francisco coexist on the tech side and that you don't have a disconnect. Do you think that that still holds true? Or do you think that may be the affordability issues in San Francisco coupled with that supply means that the two markets could disconnect on the fundamental side?","Michael Schall","Yes, Alex. Just to be clear, those comments, I think I made in connection with Q4 and the point I was trying to make is that it did not appear to be a tech hiring issue. It appeared to be a supply issue, a supply lumpiness issue. I think I commented that around 40% plus of the supply in Northern California hit the fourth quarter during the seasonally weakest time. But again to the point, it appears that Seattle and San Francisco, i.e., both being tech markets are performing very well on the job side and therefore if we look at the supply side, the lumpiness of supply is being a contributing factor or a driver of this disconnect.","As we go forward, it's going to be interesting to see because again if you look at the overall numbers going from jobs and job growth to household formation to supply, it would not indicate that we should have weakness in the apartment area and the concessions seem to be going from roughly a month to six to eight weeks that would not be indicated, given the overall supply demand numbers. But yet here we are and so we are trying to make sense out of why that is occurring. We do not have any at this point.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. And then just finally, you made some comments in the opening MD&A about cap rate maybe softening a bit. Was that normal cap rate volatility? Or were you indicating that cap rates are in fact backing up on the West Coast?","Michael Schall","Yes, Alex. The comment I made was that there were comments in the marketplace from brokers. There was a couple of articles that I read where brokers in the marketplace were suggesting that cap rates were increasing. We have not seen that and the point I was trying to make is, we underwrite a lot of deals and we are always in the market, so we have a very good sense of what's happening in the marketplace. And so we disagree with those brokers. So if that didn't come clear, I apologize.","Alexander Goldfarb","No. Look, it's been a long week. So I appreciate it. Thanks Mike.","Michael Schall","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay from RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Wes Golladay","Yes. Hello everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. So looking at this dynamic of what appears to be still a favorable supply and demand market, yet you have a flood of supply in terms of submarkets. Is that what it is weighing on it and wants to be get through this flood and then we could get the more normal pattern up in rental growth?","Michael Schall","Hi Wes, it's Mike and John may have comments on this as well. Again, we are not quite sure. If you look at these overall supply demand ratios up and down the Coast, it would indicate that we would continue to have pricing power. And again we are seeing concessions on the newly delivered product increasing from a month to six to eight weeks. And I think it's lumpiness but we are going to let this next quarter go by and then we will reevaluate guidance and results at that point in time. So essentially we didn't, as a general rule, revising guidance at the end of the first quarter. It's something that is generally not what you want to do because it's only quarter. So we would rather be a little bit cautious and hopefully we blow right through this period and absorb begins and we are back into a very strong pricing power type of mode come at the end of summer. But we will have to wait and see.","Wes Golladay","Okay. So is that like the velocity is actually going pretty nicely on those new units. So it's just a matter of getting them through out of a little bit lower price point?","Michael Schall","Yes. But keep in mind that an extra month of concession is an 8% reduction in price and when you look at it that way people that otherwise wouldn't move might say, oh gee, at that price I am willing to make a change and move to a brand new apartment unit. And so that's the effect of concessions and it seems to me that concessions are prevalent in the marketplace and they have increased. And again, that's what's causing the softness. Again I believe that the concession can abate much like they did in January and February quickly, but we just don't know exactly how that's going to happen. It's a function of how many units do you have, how aggressive the owners are.","Obviously if you deliver new building, you have zero dollars coming in on your vacant unit. So you are highly motivated to rent them. And many of those owners are saying, hey, rather than leaving it vacant, I will try to hit really high absorption numbers and increase my cash flow. Again, they are incented, they have a different financial objective or a different financial view relative to stabilized apartments. But they have a dramatic effect on the stabilized apartment. So that process is going to play out and so we are going to be clearly under a bit more pressure than we have over the last couple of years and we will have to see how that ultimately turns out.","Wes Golladay","Okay. And just a quick follow-up. So is the concession enough to pull people in from maybe from the East Bay into the SoMa market? Or do you think people will still stay in their own submarket?","Michael Schall","No. I think everything will happen. People are looking for opportunity, I have been in this business a long time, as you know, Wes and people are smart. They figure out the opportunities in the marketplace and they go after them. Many of the renters just don't have that much furniture and so moving is not that big a deal. And so if you give them another 8% off their rent in the form of a concession, they are all over it. And so it's a very fluid marketplace and what I suspect will happen is we will go through this period of time and we will absorb the unit. We will get back in Q4 in San Francisco where we think roughly 1,300 units will be delivered and we will have much more pricing power. So it will be a temporary dislocation in the market, is what I suspect.","Wes Golladay","Okay. Thanks for clarity.","Michael Schall","Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Drew Babin from Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Drew Babin","Good afternoon. Just wanted to ask about the three submarkets you mentioned, the SoMa, Peninsula, North San Jose and what the supply outlook looks like in those markets for next year, once you deal with concession and everything going on now when it might be more sustained just drop off in new supply deliveries?","Michael Schall","That's a good question. I don't have that information with me. I think it will be slightly lower in 2017 relative to 2016, but I just don't have enough focus on those numbers at this point in time.","Drew Babin","Okay.","Michael Schall","Again, the dynamics, let me go back to the dynamics. With construction costs increasing, lender issues, et cetera, it seems like we are at the point where going to start seeing slower development deliveries going forward, just as a general rule.","Drew Babin","Okay. And then one question, going back to a topic that was frequently visited on the last quarter's call, prospects for share repurchase. Do you expect you are able to sell property at cap rates below the implied cap rate on your stock? Has anything changed in the market over the past few months that would maybe cause you view doing something like that differently?","Michael Schall","Yes. Our thoughts have evolved in that area and for background, we have a $250 million share repurchase program out there. Last quarter, we were trying to not use the balance sheet. We were trying to align sales proceeds from properties such as, I think I mention that roughly a third of the Sharon Green sale, we wanted to use for share repurchase. And when the stock price recovered and we were trading at a discount to NAV, we decided to just go ahead and redeploy that with a 1031 exchange. So the evolution of our thought process on that is to go ahead and use the balance sheet because it seems like the dislocations in the stock market.","And we had one in the first quarter, those dislocations are relatively temporary in nature and so I don't want to give you exact targets, but of the $250 million program, we have decided to take some balance sheet risk to the extent that the stock trades at a significant discount to NAV. And again, I am not going to share with you our targets and how that works, but practically if it's not 10% to 15% type of discount, it probably doesn't make much of a difference. So we will use some balance sheet and we will look for significant discounts and we will be ready within a relatively short period of time given dislocation in stock price.","Angela Kleiman","So as long as it is after that, as far as using the balance sheet, that will just be a temporary bridge because then we will look to sell assets in arbitrage, public and private market pricing. So ultimately, the goal was to just have it to be a balance sheet neutral transaction.","Michael Schall","Thank you. Yes.","Drew Babin","Understood. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Tayo Okusanya","Yes. A very good afternoon everyone. Just in light of some of the commentary you have made about lumpy new supply going forward and some of the market dynamics, does that change how you think about disposition activity especially if, based on your commentary, cap rates really haven't moved at this point?","Michael Schall","Yes. Tayo, this is Mike Schall. At this point, to the extent that we believe it's temporary in nature and again lumpy supply, I don't think it has a significant impact on how we allocate capital. However, if that changed, if we saw job growth dynamics change for example, I think that would be more fundamental in nature and that would change our thinking about how we want to allocate the portfolio.","So again, we have these exceptional job growth numbers that have continued in Q1, San Francisco at 4.1%, Seattle at 3.2% et cetera. That's a trailing three-month number. Those numbers are incredibly powerful when it comes to owning apartments. And so as long as those numbers remain as strong as they are and not to mention the amount of wealth that's being created within the technology area, I think we estimated that 10 top tech companies have produced about $1.8 trillion in wealth and obviously some of that is not of the West Coast, but a lot of it is here. Those dynamics keep us excited about earning properties in Northern California despite the lumpiness with the supply.","Tayo Okusanya","Got it. And then just my second question. Again you guys are well known in this space for being data junkies and I know you are kind of doing a lot of analysis suggesting rents should still be strong, occupancies could still be strong. And at least I hear from your tune, you are kind of scratching your head a little bit wondering what's going on, why is this really going on? And I guess the question is, if we all don't know but you had to at least make one or two educated guesses, what will they be? What does that tell you about if that continues going forward or if truly this might be temporary?","Michael Schall","Well, John Burkart and I looking at each other. I hope we can come to the same answer to this one. But clearly the impact of affordability is one that concerns us and generally speaking we think affordability is a constraint not a driver, in some markets it's a driver, but not in our markets. And so anything that affects affordability and John mentioned doubling up, longer commutes, working from home, those types of things would be concerns us and we are back here data junky point, we are trying to find ways to measure them and we have some data on them.","And we do have some information about the level of double up, but it's not perfect at this point in time. But clearly, we are trying to become more refined in how we look at this and where we have a disconnect, we are trying to explain it to ourselves so that we can obviously use it proactively to manage the portfolio to do a better job of capital allocation.","Tayo Okusanya","Thank you.","Michael Schall","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Rich Anderson from Mizuho Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Rich Anderson","Thanks. Good afternoon. I am sorry to keep it going here, but just a couple of quick ones. Getting back to the rent control issue, while you made the point that it doesn't hit you because of your newer assets and all the rest, but is there an indirect effect, do you think, that is playing a role in some of the \"choppiness\" that you are seeing in the Bay Area? Is there any way to see that?","Michael Schall","I don't think so, Rich, because I would say the opposite, to the extent that people that were forced out of the marketplace can now stay there longer and turnover rates are going to be reduced. The number of units that's actually coming to market therefore is reduced and therefore you should have better pricing power. So on our portfolio, it's probably a net positive just because we don't have that many units, again, subject to what might happen in these referendums because we don't know what cities they are going to be effecting at this point in time. But based on San Jose and Oakland , for example, we think we have probably a positive effect not a negative effect.","Rich Anderson","Because of the turnover factor?","Michael Schall","Because more people, there is going to be fewer units vacating. The turnover goes down with rent control, right. It will go portfolio wide. It will go from 50% to 30% turnover. So you are going to turn only 30% of your unit therefore your units available for leasing to people moving into the area, you are going to have fewer units available to lease to the same number of people and therefore it's going to put more pressure on price as to the units that are turning. So again because we don't have that much rent control product, it probably has a favorable effect on us.","Rich Anderson","Got it. And then some have been alluding to why you haven't addressed guidance this quarter and I understand all of the answers, but to me, I am wondering if the guidance direction should be up or down? I think most people are indicating that maybe you should have raised guidance because you beat numbers in the first quarter. But is it as clear cut as your bias is upward? Or does the lumpiness in the Bay Area put at least them into the possibility list that guidance could weaken in the future?","Michael Schall","I think when you raise guidance in the first quarter, you better be really sure about what you are doing, otherwise why do. We just gave you guidance a couple of months ago. So that's kind of the basic premise of the whole thing. Obviously we are going to push to make the year and next quarter as good as it possibly can be and to react appropriately to changing market conditions. But I just don't see a lot of motivation. I am probably one of the ones that prevented the guidance increase of the group here. And that's the basic background. It's really uncertainty and the feeling that raising guidance after a quarter just doesn't make a lot of sense to me.","Rich Anderson","Okay. But at least the conversation was up not down?","Michael Schall","Well, we have had other conversation. We have lots of conversations. And most of the pressure was on up not down, yes.","Rich Anderson","Okay. That makes sense. And then lastly, you talked about some of these supply numbers in the second and third quarter. What are you guys seeing beyond that? Is there a notable reduction that you could speak to for fourth quarter of this year and beyond?","Michael Schall","Yes, there is. However the comment I made on in the fourth quarter on the fourth quarter call about transactions deliver when they deliver. We may schedule them to happen in, I bet a lot of the transactions that hit in the fourth quarter last year were scheduled for delivery in the second and third quarter, but they got delayed to the fourth quarter. My point is they deliver when they deliver. And we don't have, we actually have our people go around and look at buildings and try to see exactly what is being delivered. But having said that, you don't have great certainty with respect to exactly when it's going to be delivered. And it can easily slide a quarter.","Rich Anderson","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kris Trafton from Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Kris Trafton","Hi guys. Just wanted to circle back on the preferred equity. Obviously, there's a lot of demand for this capital, but could you speak to a little bit about the supply of preferred capital? And maybe the other players involved that are offering it? And then maybe how you are mitigating it in terms of risk?","Michael Schall","Yes. It's Mike Schall. I think there are several people that are active in that area, different types of specialty finance organization. So we have plenty of competition there and much like acquisitions, we don't win nearly all of the business and part of the reason for that and it goes through your risk mitigation point, is we only want to originate preferred equity on apartments that we would like to own. So it has to meet our locational and other criteria and again, if everything goes great, then it's a good piece of capital for the developer. If things don't go great, we want to position to step in at what would be an attractive price to us. So that's how we think we have the best of both worlds. We have high-yielding vehicle and we also have something that is synergistic with our portfolio if things don't go well.","Kris Trafton","That makes a lot of sense. Okay. Second question, when you are looking within a market and you are looking at cap rates that they are trading at, do you see a difference, obviously adjusting for properties that are just above or just below the year where you can do rent control in California?","Michael Schall","I haven't looked at it really that closely, but let's see, I just look at Oakland and San Jose and then again the statewide law, Costa-Hawkins, has a pre-1996 date and so we have obviously more properties that are within the Costa-Hawkins realm that's pre-1996. But with respect to the cities that already have rent control ordinances like the ones in Oakland and San Jose, that were pre-existing, the nice thing about them is they can't bump their prior date or effective date or cut-off date, they can't move it to 1995, at least at this point in time, because that was prohibited by Costa-Hawkins as well. So again I think our overall exposure to rent control is actually not that substantial, as I look at the portfolio.","Kris Trafton","All right. Okay. And then just one last quick one. I think your original guidance was to have three now developments in 2016 at $230 million at share and you just started one here at $230 million. Is that incremental to the other three? Or was that originally going to be a JV? Or can you just talk to what's updated there for development start guidance?","Michael Schall","The one that we announced is one of the three. So it's not incremental.","Kris Trafton","Okay. So that was originally going to be at 50% or something?","Michael Schall","No. That was always going to be at 100%. I am sorry. I didn't answer that piece of your question.","Kris Trafton","Okay. I thought the original guidance was $230 million for three properties?","Angela Kleiman","No. It was $220 million for the year.","Kris Trafton","That's a spend, not starts?","Angela Kleiman","That's the spend, correct.","Kris Trafton","Got it. Okay. Thank you very much.","Michael Schall","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Conor Wagner from Green Street Advisors. Please proceed with your question.","Conor Wagner","Good afternoon. Have you seen fewer properties come to market in the Bay Area in recent months?","Michael Schall","Come to market, you mean sale?","Conor Wagner","Yes. In the transaction market.","Michael Schall","No. Actually, there is a pretty decent deal flow out there. And we are looking at quite a few properties. As I would say, activity has generally picked up a bit.","Conor Wagner","And from your earlier comments, I gather that sellers haven't reset their expectations?","Michael Schall","Yes. Again, this is our experience and we underwrite lots of transactions and I can think of a deal in Fremont that we recently underwrote and we got handily beat and on that transaction specifically, that was, I don't actually think that it's closed yet even. So I think it just has been awarded. Again as we look at the transactions out there, we don't see a lot of evidence that cap rates have changed. And again we win some, we loose some, but we underwrite a lot and from our view things have really hung in there, which is what we expect by the way.","Conor Wagner","Okay. And then I just wanted to confirm, earlier you said that traffic at your properties has not slowed down and I know you have indicated before that you think that's a leading indicator of job growth. But is that correct that actual traffic at properties has not slowed?","John Burkart","Well, this John Burkart. I don't think we spoke about traffic earlier, but as it relates to traffic, it's actually up year-over-year really across the whole portfolio. But traffic is a challenging number sometimes. It can be driven, of course by better marketing and a variety of other items. But it is up. It's very strong.","Conor Wagner","Do you guys get the sense then that perhaps renters in the Bay Area because they read the headlines about slowdowns in tech and job growth, that perhaps they become more cautious on what they are willing to spend or their willingness to trade up?","Michael Schall","We are not seeing that in sense of anecdotal hearing about that. I mean, obviously people make comments about everything else, but obviously as been said a little bit earlier in the call, we are trying to reconcile the supply demand equation with the reality in parts of Northern California and I don't have the answer to that, what's exactly causing that to not fall in line exactly as we have expected other than some lumpiness in supply and possible doubling up.","Conor Wagner","Okay. Thank you very much.","Michael Schall","Thanks Conor.","Operator","And our final question comes from the line of Karin Ford from MUFG. Please proceed with your question.","Karin Ford","Hi. Good afternoon. Just wanted to go back to the divergent trends between some of the markets in Northern Cal and Seattle, given similar job trends. On the affordability side, do you guys track rent to incomes in each of those markets? And do you think there is a big difference between the metrics in those two?","Michael Schall","We do definitely track them on an ongoing basis. And yes, there is very significant differences. So Seattle which has much more affordability, obviously, the rent to income is around 19.6%. And so less than 20% in Northern California, those numbers are in the 25% to 27% range. So definitely affordability is much, much different in Seattle and San Francisco and that would drive what John Burkart was talking about with respect to double ups, the more affordability is in the equation, the more doubling up you would expect to happen. So clearly Seattle, if you look at median income levels are high, about $84,000, which is less than San Francisco and San Jose, they are both over $100,000 but nonetheless, when you look at that relationship between average rent, which are about $1,400 in Seattle on average, this is the whole marketplace, there is a high level of affordability in Seattle. There is not in Northern California.","Karin Ford","Thanks. So just to round that out, where is Southern Cal on that metric?","Michael Schall","Southern Cal on that metric is in the 21% to 24% range. So it is between the two.","Karin Ford","Between the two.","Michael Schall","Yes.","Karin Ford","Got it. Great. Thanks very much.","Michael Schall","Thank you Karen.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, there are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Schall for any closing remarks.","Michael Schall","Thank you very much. Hey, we really appreciate your participation on the call and obviously we are pleased with the results and we look forward to seeing many of you at NAREIT next month to continue the discussion. Have a great day. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. We thank you for your time and participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful rest of your day."],"8837":["Essex Property Trust, Inc.

As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded.","Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs as well as information available to the company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found on the company\u2019s filings with the SEC. [Operator Instructions]","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you, Mr. Schall, you may begin.","Michael Schall","Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for our second quarter earnings conference call. John Burkart and Angela Kleiman will follow me with comments, and John Eudy is here for Q&A. Today, I will discuss three topics: second quarter results and revisions to our 2018 market outlook, investment market conditions and an update on regulatory matters.","On to the first topic. We\u2019re pleased with our strong second quarter results, which reflect a mostly normal leasing season when compared to the early peak in market rents that we experienced in 2017. The deceleration in revenue growth in Q2 versus Q1 2018 is attributable to the occupancy gain difference in the two quarters of 30 basis points increase in Q2 as compared to a 60 basis point benefit in Q1 2018. While the market rent growth comps become easier in the second half of this year, it is our expectation that revenue growth will slow modestly as we push rents at slightly lower levels of occupancy, which will mostly benefit 2019.","Overall, fundamentals for apartments remain favorable, and demand for rental housing continues to be strong. We are seeing strength in our Northern and Southern California portfolios, particularly in San Jose and San Diego, and supply-related weakness in Seattle. As expected, favorable macroeconomic trends support a positive outlook for the U.S. and West Coast economies, indicated by a re-acceleration in job growth across much of the country.","During the quarter, hiring continued at a healthy pace in the Essex West Coast metros with 2.1% job growth for the trailing three months ending in June. Outperforming \u2013 this outperformed our initial forecast for the year of 1.6%. The tech markets of Seattle and San Jose continued to lead the way with more than 3% job growth during the period, driven by increases in the information sector. Given this strength, we are increasing our full year job growth forecast on Page S-16 of the supplemental for San Jose and Seattle by 130 basis points and 70 basis points, respectively. This resulted in an increase in our full year job growth forecast for the Essex markets by 40 basis points to 2%.","Throughout the U.S., a stronger economy and tight labor market conditions are drawing more people back into the workforce. In the past year, the labor force is up 1.9 million people or 1.2%, which is double the average growth rate seen over the current cycle. The higher labor participation rate can lead to incremental demand from people still living at home with parents or those currently doubling up.","Strong jobs data has resulted in a weighted average unemployment rate in the Essex markets of 3.5%, well below the U.S. average. Shortages of skilled workers are pushing wages, which are growing faster than rents. Personal incomes are expected to grow 5.6% for the Essex portfolio in 2018 compared to market rent growth of 3%. As a result, we are seeing an improvement in rental affordability in all of our markets compared to one year ago.","On S-16.1 of the supplemental, we published a chart on cost to own a home versus rent in our West Coast market. Due to severe for-sale housing shortages and recent tax reform, the premium to own a home versus renting an apartment has risen to 77% as compared to the historical average of 49%. Large increases in median home prices, which are up 13% year-over-year, along with tax law changes are driving the substantial increase. As a result, we expect this to favorably impact demand for rental housing and apartment fundamentals.","Turning to supply. During the quarter, we completed a full scrub of our supply analysis, including on-the-ground surveys of under-construction projects, to assess recent progress and expected delivery timing. Overall, supply remains relatively unchanged in our markets from our prior projections with the exception of Los Angeles, where delays pushed back deliveries to later in 2018 and into 2019, and Seattle where supply is up slightly. Our analysis indicates that Orange County, San Diego, San Francisco and Seattle will be past their peak supply by the end of 2018. Overall, across our markets, we expect 2019 apartment deliveries to be relatively flat compared to 2018.","Multifamily deliveries continue to be heavily concentrated in the downtown and CBD markets. As noted previously, when several nearby properties are delivered at the same time, lease-up concessions will often increase, temporarily disrupting pricing at stabilized communities.","Specifically, in Seattle and downtown L.A, the concentration and timing of deliveries has resulted in four to six weeks of leasing concession at new communities, impacting price and resulting in periodic concessions at nearby stabilized communities. These concessions begin to abate once the pace of apartment deliveries subsides. Going forward, we believe construction starts will slowly decline in our markets given rising construction cost, shortages of skilled labor and a more conservative lending environment.","As it relates to revisions to our 2018 market rent growth forecast on S-16, there is no change to the Essex portfolio rent growth of 3%. However, there are changes with end markets, namely: we now expect San Jose rent growth to be 4%, which is 100 basis points stronger than our initial expectations due to better job growth; conversely, Seattle is expected to be weaker than expected in the second half of 2018 given higher apartment deliveries in Q3 and Q4, and the greater seasonal drop-off in demand that usually occurs in Seattle in the back half of the year.","My second topic, updates on investment markets. During the quarter, we closed on one disposition in San Diego at a low 4% cap rate and have one acquisition in a co-investment entity in contract for approximately $100 million. We reviewed recent institutional apartment transactions in the Essex markets and concluded that there has not been any significant change to cap rates. Therefore, we continue to see A-quality property in locations trading around a 4% to 4.25% cap rate, with B-quality property and locations generally trading 25 to 50 basis points higher.","As noted, the past two quarters, and even with healthy levels of multifamily permits, we continue to see a slowdown in the volume of preferred equity opportunities that meet our underwriting criteria. Development yields are compressing given that construction cost increase generally exceed property NOI growth rates, representing a significant headwind to new development. So far this year, we have closed one preferred equity investment for $26.5 million, bringing our total outstanding commitments to $398 million as of the second quarter. Angela will discuss revisions to our full year investment guidance momentarily.","Third topic, regulatory matters. During the last few months, there has been a great deal of investor concern and reaction to Proposition 10 in California seeking to repeal the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act. As a reminder, costa-Hawkins is a state law that seeks to promote housing production to meet demand by establishing guidelines for rent control policies that can be enacted by cities.","In summary, Costa-Hawkins became state law in 1995 to counter the unintended negative effects of severe rent control laws adopted by certain cities, which resulted in a dramatic suppression of housing development and property improvement.","Prior to Costa-Hawkins, there were 12 local rent control ordinances enacted. A few cities, including Berkeley, San Francisco and Santa Monica, passed ordinances containing severe provisions, such as rent control of vacant apartments, which had draconian impacts, including no meaningful production of rental housing for the following 20-year period. As a result, these cities remain chronically undersupplied with respect to housing.","The state legislature passed Costa-Hawkins in 1995 to increase housing production and quality, requiring vacancy decontrol in all California jurisdictions and exempting any new construction built after February 1, 1995, from rent control. Following the enactment of Costa-Hawkins, new housing development experienced a significant rebound.","Essex has been part of a broad coalition to oppose the repeal of Costa-Hawkins, joined by other apartment companies, trade organizations, unions, veterans, the NAACP and a variety of pro-business groups. We believe that rent control is bad policy.","Given California\u2019s severe housing shortage, vibrant economy and an estimated 180,000 new jobs in coastal California in 2018, it remains unclear where many of the people filling the new jobs will live. We continue to vigorously oppose any expansion of rent control at both the state and local levels.","Strategically, the outlook for changing rent control is now a critical consideration in all portfolio allocation decisions. Property in cities that tighten rent control will be less attractive, leading to greater housing shortages over time, while nearby cities without rent control become more attractive for investment. We operate in about 70 cities in California, and information about what cities might do if Costa-Hawkins is repealed is often incomplete or not available. Keep in mind, in the past two years, 10 cities pursued rent control for pre-1995 properties, with 80% of the proposals rejected. We will continue to periodically update you as needed.","That concludes my comments, and I\u2019ll now turn the call over to John.","John Burkart","Thank you, Mike. Q2 was another solid quarter for Essex with year-over-year same-store revenue growth of 2.8% and NOI growth of 3%. Southern California led the portfolio in the second quarter with year-over-year revenue growth of 3.3% in part due to its 60 basis point gain in occupancy over the prior year\u2019s period.","This leasing season is playing out as anticipated. Our rents are following the historically normal rental rate curve, which peaks in July as opposed to last year when rental rates peaked early. The impact of the 2018 seasonal pattern is evident in our loss to lease numbers, which grew to 3.6% in July of 2018 compared to last year when loss to lease in July was 2%.","In order to maximize revenue over the next 12 months, our operating strategy is favoring market rents instead of favoring occupancy. Therefore, we expect that our occupancy during the third quarter of 2018 will be about 30 basis points below the prior year\u2019s period or approximately 96.4%, which will create a significant headwind in \u2013 for revenue this period. In July 2018, our same-store financial occupancy was 96.1%. Q3 2018 will be our low point for year-over-year revenue growth due to the occupancy headwind and timing of other income.","Now we\u2019ll provide an update on our markets. The Seattle market continues to be supported by strong job growth, posting year-over-year job gains of 3.1% in the second quarter of 2018, the second highest in the Essex portfolio. WeWork and Zillow continue to expand their downtown Seattle footprint by leasing the combined additional 200,000 square feet of office space. The city \u2013 the Seattle MD has roughly 5.2 million square feet of office space currently under construction, 45% of which is already preleased. Revenue in our East side and Seattle CBD submarkets grew 2.8% and 2.1%, respectively, for the second quarter of 2018 over the prior year\u2019s period. After years of outperformance, market rents are relatively flat compared to last year.","Moving on to Northern California. Job growth in the San Francisco Bay Area in Q2 averaged 2.5% year-over-year with over 76,000 jobs added. San Jose led the way with 3.3% job growth, while Oakland and San Francisco were up 1.8% and 1.7%, respectively. Facebook\u2019s expansion was robust this quarter, signing the largest San Francisco office lease in the history for 756,000 square feet, taking all of Park Tower building as well as adding an additional 750,000 square feet across the bay in Fremont.","Demand for prime office space continues to intensify as major tech companies compete for office space. An under-construction project in Mountain View changed hands from LinkedIn to WeWork and finally to Facebook, which ended up leasing both buildings totaling 450,000 square feet.","Other office leasing activity remains healthy in the market. In San Francisco, a self-driving car maker and two biotech companies expanded their footprint by a combined 675,000 square feet. And in the South Bay, Amazon grew the Bay Area footprint by adding 385,000 square feet \u2013 by adding a 385,000 square foot lease in Sunnyvale.","San Francisco quarterly office absorption was the highest amongst the Essex markets at 1.9% of total stock. Between San Francisco and Silicon Valley, there was about 7.5 million square feet of office space under construction, of which 68% is preleased. In July, we completed the lease-up of Station Park Green Phase 1 and estimate that pre-leasing for phases 2 and 3 will start sometime in mid-2019.","Our year-over-year same-store revenue growth for the second quarter of 2018 continues to be led by Oakland and Fremont submarkets with 3% and 2.6% revenue growth. San Mateo and San Jose grew at 2.4% and 1.8%, respectively, for the same period, while San Francisco was last for the period.","Heading down to Southern California. Job growth in Los Angeles in Q2 2018 averaged 1.4% year-over-year, 50 basis points above the pace of growth a year ago. Notable leases for the quarter includes Spotify\u2019s 110,000 square foot expansion into the Arts District in downtown L.A. and WeWork\u2019s 75,000 square foot lease, its 17th in the L.A. area. Revenue growth for the second quarter of 2018 was led by Woodland Hills with 5.1% and West L.A. with 3.9%, trailed by the Tri-Cities with 2% and Long Beach with 2%.","Orange County jobs in the second quarter grew 1.3% year-over-year. While this pace was weaker than our other markets, it\u2019s worth noting that reported growth was similarly soft at this time last year and then it was revised materially higher in the BLS\u2019s annual benchmark revisions.","Office activity continues to be healthy with 1 million square feet under construction, 40% of which is pre-leased. That is up from 20% pre-leased in Q1 of this year. Essex\u2019s South and North submarkets grew year-over-year at 3.5% and 1.8%, respectively, for the period.","Finally, in San Diego, year-over-year job growth remained at 1.9% in the second quarter of 2018. Revenue growth in the second quarter of 2018 was between 4% in the North side submarkets to 6.3% in Chula Vista over the prior year\u2019s period. Currently, our portfolio is at 96.5% occupancy, and our availability 30 days out is at 5%. Our renewals are being sent out, consistent with the loss to lease.","Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Angela Kleiman.","Angela Kleiman","Thank you, John. I\u2019ll start with a review of our second quarter results, provide additional color on our full year guidance revisions and conclude with a balance sheet update. In the second quarter, core FFO grew 5.7%, exceeding the midpoint of guidance by $0.09 per share. As noted in our press release, $0.03 of the favorable variance relates to timing of operating expenses, which are now expected to occur in the second half of the year. The remaining $0.06 of outperformance is comprised of the following: $0.02 from property revenues, $0.02 from property tax adjustments in the non-same-store pool and $0.02 from a combination of various miscellaneous items.","As a result of our second quarter performance, we are increasing the midpoint of our full year guidance for same-property revenue and NOI growth by 15 basis points to 2.8% and 2.9%, respectively. Year-to-date, we have raised the midpoint of our same-property revenue and NOI growth guidance by 30 and 35 basis points, respectively. But the strong second quarter results have also enabled us to raise our full year core FFO per-share guidance by $0.07 at the midpoint to $12.53. This represents a 5.2% year-over-year growth, which is a 70 basis points higher than our original guidance of 4.5% core FFO growth per share.","Turning to our full year investment guidance. Our initial guidance assumed between $400 million to $525 million of acquisitions, which would be funded with joint ventures or disposition proceeds. Therefore, our initial disposition guidance of $550 million to $750 million was dependent upon achieving our investment targets. Year-to-date, we have not acquired any properties as the assets in our markets remain highly desirable in the current competitive landscape, resulting in a continued tight cap rate environment, as Mike discussed earlier. Given this dynamic, we have chosen to stay consistent to our disciplined underwriting and capital allocation strategy.","Accordingly, we are modifying our 2018 investment guidance to assume $100 million to $300 million of acquisitions and $200 million to $300 million of dispositions for the full year. The revised guidance range includes transaction in the current pipeline. Note that our dispositions guidance excludes funding for our $250 million stock buyback program. Therefore, the amount of dispositions could increase from our guidance range, subject to the stock buyback volume, which we would execute on a leverage-neutral basis.","Lastly, a brief update on capital markets and the balance sheet. As we look to the second half of the year, our capital needs remain de minimis. The sale of Domain in the second quarter provided for all of our development funding needs. And we only have $120 million of secured debt maturing in the second half of the year, which was already contemplated in our $300 million unsecured bond issuance in the first quarter. With net debt-to-EBITDA of 5.5x and over $1.6 billion of liquidity, our balance sheet remains strong.","That concludes my comments, and I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions and answers.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Nick Joseph with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","Nick Joseph","Thanks. I just want to start on guidance. You mentioned that 3Q would be the low point for same-store revenue growth. So what are you assuming for 3Q and 4Q?","Angela Kleiman","For the guidance range, we assume Q3 same-store revenue in the low 2s and Q4 in high 2s.","Nick Joseph","Thanks. And then just on Prop 10. Hypothetically, if it does pass, some municipalities move to rent control, what do you think the timing would be in terms of how long it would take to actually implement?","Michael Schall","Hey, Nick it\u2019s Mike Schall. It\u2019s a good question. There are many conversations that are going on at the local level with respect to rent control. And they are debating at the local level what exactly is going to happen if Prop. 10 passes. And \u2013 but at this point in time, either because they haven\u2019t decided or because the deliberations are not open to the public, it\u2019s pretty tough to tell exactly what they\u2019re going to do or when they\u2019re going to do it.","There have been various cities that have tried to pursue new rent control proposals, including three that were defeated: Long Beach, Pasadena and Inglewood. There are some that are on the local ballot. Santa Cruz and Santa Ana are examples of that. And of course, there was the failed attempt to repeal the Washington state law that would have banned \u2013 that bans rent control currently.","So there\u2019s a lot of activity in this area, and none of it is complete. For example, it\u2019s difficult to distinguish what types of rent control these different cities are going to have. Some forms, as noted in my comments, are extreme, those that involve controlling vacant units, for example. But many of them are not nearly that extreme. And therefore, there\u2019s a lot of \u2013 a lot to be learned, and we still need a lot more information before we can make a good decision about what the impacts are going to be.","John Eudy","Yes. This is John Eudy. I\u2019d like to add one comment. With the \u2013 all the cities that we deal with on the entitlement side, I can tell you the vast majority do recognize the fact that if rent control were to be initiated in a city, it would have a very large impact on their ability to produce housing. Most cities are behind on the housing element, and we believe that\u2019s another governing factor. On \u2013 part of your question, you asked how long it would take. We don\u2019t think most cities are waiting at the altar to initiate rent control, assuming Prop. 10 were to pass. We think they\u2019re going to be thoughtful and methodical how they approach it. And it\u2019s too speculative to say, like Mike said, exactly where it lands, but we believe that it will be done in a balanced way. In a few cities that do, it will probably be much less draconian as the 1970 version of rent control is our general belief.","Nick Joseph","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Austin Wurschmidt","Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. I was just curious if the job growth outlook in your revised revenue guidance assume that the pace of job growth moderates in the back half of the year. It sounded like some of the 2Q data points on job growth were above some of the full year assumptions you provided.","John Burkart","Sure. Job growth \u2013 this is John. Job growth, obviously, moves around quite a bit, and we follow it on a monthly basis. But in the end, we\u2019re expecting the economy is doing \u2013 well, we see the economy doing very well right now. We raised our numbers a little bit to reflect that reality. We\u2019re not expecting a big slowdown, but the numbers are somewhat volatile. So we just see a solid second half as it relates to job growth and just with some limited movement up and down.","Austin Wurschmidt","Thanks. And then I thought your comments around households doubling up and an improving affordability was interesting, and I was just curious if you\u2019ve seen this phenomenon in the past and if you have any sense of what the benefit this could provide from a demand or \u2013 perspective or an impact on market rents.","Michael Schall","Yes, this is Mike. yes, we, for a long time, have believed that as long as we\u2019re in the band of 90% to 110% of long-term average rent-to-median income ratio, that, that tends to be a good spot in terms of rental pricing. If it\u2019s below 90%, it probably indicates that there\u2019s something wrong with the market. And if it\u2019s above 110%, then you get into these affordability issues. And that ratio improved in each market, as noted in my script. And interestingly, in Northern California, we are under the 110% threshold in all three major metros. So that\u2019s good news. And we\u2019re pretty close to 110% in most of Southern California. So we\u2019ve actually really come a long way with respect to affordability in the last several quarters.","Austin Wurschmidt","And where has that ratio been historically?","Michael Schall","Again, it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re comparing the \u2013 this is the band of 90% to 110% of the long-term, 25-year, 1990 to 2017 average. So it depends by market. Typically, Southern California is in the 22% range typically, and Northern California is in the 22% range except San Francisco is more like 27%. And Seattle is about 19%. That\u2019s the long-term historical average.","Austin Wurschmidt","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Jeff Spector with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.","Jeff Spector","Great. Thank you. Hi, everyone. I just want to go back to, Mike, your opening comments and clarify your comments on occupancy for 2019. It sounds like we\u2019re saying second half will decline a bit well. And are you [indiscernible] on rent \u2013 on trying to push rent? Are you saying that you feel in 2019 that based on demand, occupancy should pick back up again?","Michael Schall","Yes, let me actually kick that to John because I think you\u2019re referring to his outlook for the rest of this year. So John, you want to handle that?","John Burkart","Yes, absolutely. So what I\u2019m seeing is in Q1, we had a benefit of 60 basis points occupancy year-over-year. Q2, that shifted to 30 basis points. And in Q3, it\u2019ll actually be a headwind of 30 basis points, and that clearly impacts the year-over-year numbers that Angela was referencing, the reason being as we\u2019ve shifted to the strategy that the market has improved and the seasonality of the curve is consistent with the past, with last year or with historical standards. Last year, it fell off early. So we shifted strategies to favor achieving market rent as opposed to maximizing occupancy.","So it\u2019s that adjustment, which is also in line with increased turnover, increased units turning. Each unit that turns, there\u2019s a certain occupancy related to it. So as we turn more units in the summer and as we focus on achieving market rent instead of occupancy, there\u2019s a natural adjustment. It\u2019s not because the market\u2019s weak, it\u2019s because actually the market\u2019s stronger, and we\u2019ve adjusted our management strategy to maximize revenue over the next 12 months. So Q3 is the one that\u2019s most impacted negatively, as I mentioned. And then Q4 will bring our occupancy back up as we enter the weaker part of the rental season. Does that answer your question?","Jeff Spector","Yes. Thanks. And I thought Mike in his opening talked about the expected benefit in 2019. But that\u2019s helpful.","John Burkart","Sure, yes. I\u2019ll...","Michael Schall","Let me...","John Burkart","Sure, sure.","Michael Schall","Answer that. So yes, exactly. So if we\u2019re going to create a occupancy headwind in Q3, then by pushing rents \u2013 obviously, the rent growth \u2013 we only have four months left of 2018, and so the benefit from the higher rent growth is going to mainly start us out on a positive foot into 2019. Keep in mind that loss to lease at the end of July was 3.5% this year versus 2% last year. So that increment, you could expect to help us in 2019.","Jeff Spector","Okay. Thanks. Then just one follow-up on the rent control conversation. I mean, is it too early to talk about \u2013 if a town does implement rent control, what would Essex do with their \u2013 in that town or a municipality?","Michael Schall","Yes, this is Mike. Yes, we\u2019ve given a lot of thought to this, and we\u2019ve done a lot of research on what the discussions are in these various cities. And it\u2019s pretty difficult to glean any conclusions, obvious conclusions from those discussions because so many things are in flux right now. Because all rent control is not the same. There are, as we\u2019ve said, relatively few cities that have extreme forms of rent control, and then there are other cities that have moderate forms of rent control.","As we think of the world given \u2013 and John said this a few minutes ago, but I\u2019ll just reiterate part of it from my perspective \u2013 there seems to be a real split in how to deal with California\u2019s incredible housing shortage. A lot of the politicians and legislature have chosen to do things that are going to promote more housing development, consistent with California\u2019s Global Warming Solutions Act, which effectively seeks to put housing and office next to one another and get people out of their cars. There were 15 bills signed by Governor Brown last year, for example, that had the objective of increasing housing development, raising money for affordable housing, penalizing cities that didn\u2019t produce their housing element, et cetera.","So you have that on the one hand, and then you have this whole other political movement to try to use rent control as a solution to a problem. Well, rent control obviously doesn\u2019t produce more units. In fact, it produces less units because cities with extreme forms of rent control are going to produce less housing like they did last time around. So we know that. They also \u2013 there\u2019s also a fiscal impact in that the estimated cost to the state and local governments is in the hundreds of millions of dollar range, which is, I would think, problematic as far as that goes.","And then finally, the third problem with rent control is there\u2019s conversions, for example, condos from rental housing into other forms of housing. So it actually depletes the housing stock. So what we\u2019re talking about here is, there are people in the short term that will benefit from rent control, i.e., those that get a rent control unit. And then further down the road, there\u2019s going to be greater shortages, and the people that will be most vulnerable in that scenario will again be the people of limited means because there\u2019s going to be fewer houses \u2013 fewer housing units available in that scenario, and they\u2019re likely to be more expensive and more difficult to obtain.","Jeff Spector","Okay. Thank you. That helps.","Michael Schall","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O\u2019Neill.","Alexander Goldfarb","Hey, good morning out there. Mike, just appreciate your comments on the nuance of the conversations over rent control with the different cities. But I guess from \u2013 on the point of vacancy decontrol because that seems to be one of the most key elements of Costa-Hawkins and whether or not cities did draconian or not, is there any sense, as you guys speak to the different municipalities, that they understand the impact that removing vacancy decontrol would have? Or is it all part of a nebulous thing and they\u2019re not even bringing that element up?","John Eudy","This is John Eudy, Alex. There\u2019s no question that cities understand that. And if we were to lose vacancy decontrol by virtue of a city passing that, it also brings in the element of a fair rider return. And it\u2019s pretty clear that if you don\u2019t have the ability to turn units at market, you wouldn\u2019t be able to achieve that. So there\u2019s a legal argument there that also keeps the cities in line to understand that metric. So we believe the vast majority of cities get it. There will be a few exceptions that we\u2019ll have to work with if it comes to that.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. And then the second question is, you guys \u2013 Mike, you spoke earlier in the year about the \u2013 obviously the impact of pricing versus last year\u2019s early peak and then with the wild fires, and you spoke 30 basis points \u2013 or Angela, you spoke about 30 basis points lower occupancy hitting third quarter. But still, you guys definitely crushed on the quarter. Classic Essex. So how much do we take your comments with a bit of grain of salt when you\u2019re saying that hey, third quarter is going to be the low point of the year versus things are going better? And I guess the point is, has the economy improved a lot more than you guys thought when you had your outlook and discussions at NAREIT earlier this year? Or is it the standard Essex conservatism?","John Burkart","Hey, Alex thank you for the compliment, I guess, and this is John. And where we\u2019re at as it relates to the numbers, I \u2013 in my script, I mentioned that July, we were at 96.1% occupancy very specifically to show that occupancy really has drifted down pretty significantly. And I, of course, ended the script with the fact that we\u2019re at 96.5% current fiscal. So we\u2019ve pushed it back up some. But that 30 basis point changed from last year for the third quarter, which the third quarter last year we were at 96.7%, and so we\u2019re expecting to average in on the third quarter this year at 96.4%, still a good number, it\u2019s real.","There\u2019s a real headwind, and it really is a difference from Q2 when we had a 30 basis point benefit. That\u2019s a 60 basis point swing. So the real numbers, it relates to the strategy change, and then that actually tied back to yes, the market is performing as expected and it\u2019s performing well. And the curve has \u2013 market peaked, as expected, in July as opposed to early, and so we were adjusting to that. So no, we\u2019re not seeing \u2013 baking it in a big way, but thank you for the compliments.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. But were you saying, John, that the market hasn\u2019t improved more than you thought it? The market has been consistent with the way you guys originally thought earlier this year?","Michael Schall","Yes, it\u2019s Mike. Think of this as a big lagging machine. And what happens today, it doesn\u2019t show up in the numbers until some future day because again, we have to turn leases in the new reality. So what we\u2019ve done last year is we were given a choice between how much rent can we get in the third quarter. I\u2019m talking about 2017. How much rent can we get? Or are we better off trying to push occupancy? We made an occupancy-based decision to push occupancy given that scenario. Now we\u2019re looking at this year, 2018, and we come to a different conclusion.","And the way it shows up in the numbers, it looks like it\u2019s getting weaker, but - it\u2019s not getting weaker, it\u2019s getting better. It\u2019s just going to take several months or couple quarters for you to really see the benefit of that. 2018, because of, again, the shape of the market rent curve, 2018, for the first half of the year, we have really tough comps because we gave up so much rent growth in the second half of 2017. That won\u2019t happen this year. Again, I go back to this loss to lease being the critical piece of it, At the end of \u2013 July 2017, it was 2% and going down. And in 2018, it\u2019s 3.5%, much more normal and much stronger. So again, it\u2019s going to take a few months and some quarters for this to become apparent, but we\u2019re looking down the road in terms of our pricing decisions and trying to maximize revenue down the road somewhere.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed.","Dennis McGill","Hi. Thank you. Actually, following that last question. So when you look at the decision of a year ago and push occupancy versus today to be more focused on the rent side, when you think about the change in the market, how much of that better outlook that you have today is due to stronger demand versus less supply? Or what\u2019s the right way to think about the balance of those two things shifting over the last year?","John Burkart","I\u2019ll \u2013 this is John. I\u2019ll start and Mike want to \u2013 Mike might want to follow on. But really \u2013 certainly, we have strong demand out in the marketplace, and it\u2019s showing in the curve. As well as, supply was a little bit light in the first half of the year, which we benefited from. So it\u2019s really a combination, and that\u2019s probably what brought the curve back to what you might say is the normalized seasonal pattern. And the result of that is better year-over-year comps as it relates to market rents and then, therefore, the shift in operations strategy.","Dennis McGill","Okay, just to clarify. When you say less supply in the front half of this year, was that a push out of supply into the second half of 2019?","John Burkart","So you know what? It seems like that\u2019s just the ongoing theme for the last two years, is supply keeps getting pushed out. And certainly, in some markets like in L.A, we saw supply getting pushed out, and it continues to be pushed out. So yes, it\u2019s not the supply somehow kind of evaporated, it\u2019s just more of a \u2013 it continues to be delayed, and we\u2019re benefiting from that. It\u2019s \u2013 when the supply all comes at the same time in a concentrated area, that\u2019s problematic. In context, the amount of supply that\u2019s in the marketplaces, in MSAs, versus the demand, we\u2019re clearly upside down there. We obviously have a housing crisis. We do not have enough supply. But it impacts pricing when it all gets delivered at the same time, same place. And so at this point in time, it\u2019s \u2013 this last half of he year has been a little slower.","Michael Schall","Dennis I would add maybe one thing to that. And that is, it\u2019s very difficult to determine when the supply is going to actually be completed because of these labor shortages and other things that tend to delay. So the way we have it now, for example, is we had much more supply in L.A. in the first half. But now, according to our projections, it looks like it\u2019s mostly second half focused. However, we don\u2019t know how much of that is actually going to get pushed into 2019. It\u2019s just impossible for us to get down to that level of detail and to understand the labor markets in enough detail that we can make that comment.","And Seattle is the other piece of it, which is, again, second \u2013 heavy second half supply in 2018. Some of that very easily could get pushed into 2019. So \u2013 but again, when we look at price and look at pricing and expectations, we use the best information we have, recognizing that some of these things are very difficult, if not impossible, to predict.","Dennis McGill","Yes. In understanding that volatility, I guess what I was trying to get at to make sure I understand your comments correctly is if you\u2019ll be more offensive today on a go-forward basis than you were at this time a year ago, that more offensive strategies sounds like it\u2019s being driven from the demand side, and it sounds like the supply side has a relatively similar outlook. Is that fair?","Michael Schall","That\u2019s a \u2013 yes, okay, I get more of what you\u2019re saying. Yes, the \u2013 we think supply and demand, critical housing shortage, we think there\u2019s no way that demand catches up \u2013 or supply catches up with demand under any scenario. The issue is that when you get into some of these markets, the apartment deliveries are much more concentrated in the Downtown L.A. or Downtown Seattle, for example, South Lake Union in Seattle even more specifically than the downtown.","And the more you get that concentration, the greater chance you have that several buildings are going to compete with one another and are going to start getting to six to eight weeks of concession, which effectively stops rental growth in your stabilized communities. So that phenomena is what I\u2019m talking about. And this is periodic disruption. This has nothing to do with overall supply and demand. It just has to do with how aggressive owners become on lease-ups of multiple properties competing with one another in order to each absorb somewhere around 30 units a month.","How far do they have to push rents or concessions in order to make that happen. I think that\u2019s the key issue, and it\u2019s very difficult for us to estimate what that would be. As noted in the comments on the call, Seattle tends to also be more seasonal with respect to job growth and demand. And so that\u2019s why we have pushed back on Seattle or pushed those estimates down in terms of market rent growth for the year.","Dennis McGill","Okay. One other question of Costa-Hawkins. If \u2013 have you done any work \u2013 when we look at your mix of assets pre and post-1995, any sense on where the market would be as to whether that change would be a relative benefit to you or headwind to you versus the broader market?","Michael Schall","It\u2019s Mike. I\u2019m not sure I understand exactly where you\u2019re coming from. Let me just try and make a couple of broad comments. And Dennis, you can chime in here and \u2013 if I\u2019m off base. We have \u2013 we\u2019re operating in seven cities, as I noted in \u2013 on the call, in California. Four of them, we have more than 2,000 units in. And so the rest of them were, again, properties scattered throughout many cities in California, and there\u2019s no greater concentration. So what we have done, and this is not a perfect science, what we\u2019ve done is try to evaluate our portfolio in those four areas that we have the greatest concentration.","Two of them have a less onerous but longstanding rent control ordinance. That\u2019s L.A. and San Jose. And two of them do not have rent control at all. And so we\u2019re, again, trying to monitor, make good portfolio allocation decisions, recognizing that our \u2013 we\u2019re very diversified. And as John Eudy said, this conundrum of more \u2013 of rent control movement throughout California, while you have an enormous housing shortage and a bunch of law, again including the Global Warming Solutions Act, the 15 bills signed by Governor Brown last year, the conundrum embedded or the contradiction embedded in that discussion leads us to believe that there has to be a compromise somewhere in the middle, which will be to the benefit of less severe forms of rent control. But we don\u2019t know, and it\u2019s impossible to know at this point in time.","Dennis McGill","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you, guys.","Michael Schall","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley.","Rich Hill","Hey, guys thanks for your time. Why don\u2019t we just come back to the supply question a little bit? Is there anything \u2013 I know supply can be somewhat volatile and somewhat hard to completely forecast. But is there anything that would give you upside to expect that maybe supply would be lower than what you\u2019re projecting? I know you mentioned development yields, and that makes a lot of sense to me. But we\u2019re could upside be where this sort of supply crest happen sooner than we\u2019re expecting?","Michael Schall","Yes, this is Mike, and maybe some others want to chime in here. There\u2019s a lot of things happening that affect development. It\u2019s one of the most sensitive parts of our business. I\u2019ve made the comments with respect to our preferred equity program where we\u2019re seeing less opportunities. We started the year with a very robust pipeline, and little by little, it\u2019s been pared down. And our belief is we were somewhere around $100 million this year, but we thought we were going to be well in excess of that. And when you look at the factors that are constraining that production, it goes back to those things that I said.","But you have some new things. We have tariffs, which include Canadian lumber, for example, and steel. And you have direct \u2013 the rent control discussions are not pro-development or pro-business for that matters. And so you have a number of issues that you didn\u2019t have before. And even though the state is trying to produce more housing, the environment seems to be pushing against that, leading to that contradiction that I was talking about earlier.","Rich Hill","Got it. And so is there any \u2013 are there any specific markets where you think supply might surprise to the downside versus the upside? Or is that getting a little bit too detailed?","Michael Schall","Well, we think Northern California mostly has peaked. And I mentioned the markets that we\u2019re very confident that had peaked. The areas that we remain concerned about are L.A. and, I guess, Seattle would be the two because I \u2013 we don\u2019t think that they have peaked at this point in time or there\u2019s very significant permitting. I would guess that when you get down to the starts, that\u2019s where you\u2019re going to start seeing problems on those deals because \u2013 and John Eudy \u2013 John has two jobs. He\u2019s the co-chair of our coalition, which is a full-time job \u2013 actually more than a full-time job; and he\u2019s also Head of Development. And he looks at a lot of deals. John, why don\u2019t you chime in and talk about what you\u2019re seeing out there?","John Eudy","Well, I can say that in our dealings with cities on a couple of entitlements that were in the process, most cities\u2019 impact on their stack is far less than it was a year and two years ago. There are far fewer deals being processed now than there were in the peak, if you will, of the development pipeline buildup between 2014 and 2015. So I think that the outlook two years from now is going to be very much aligned lower than it is in the worst-case exception that it\u2019s growing because it\u2019s not. And then the headwinds between construction costs and the concern right now in the short run with the Costa-Hawkins repeal is muting it even further. So supply is going down.","Rich Hill","Got it. And then just maybe one more question on Costa-Hawkins and Prop. 10. Your comments are very well taken on the market not having enough supply of affordable housing. But given all the noise associated with it, if Prop. 10 was to occur, would it lead you to think about maybe entering into some markets that you\u2019re not currently participating in? Or are you just very confident with your markets over the medium to long term?","Michael Schall","Yes, this is Mike. It\u2019s interesting, again back to the scenario. So if there\u2019s a few cities \u2013 let\u2019s go back to the pre-Costa-Hawkins world, which we did just fine, by the way. In that world, as John and I have talked about, there were a few cities that had very extreme forms of rent control and basically we built no housing in those cities. So obviously, the demand is the demand for housing. And therefore, it has to go somewhere else.","So if you have cities with extreme forms of rent control, you would be more likely to invest in the cities that are nearby those cities, the places where those \u2013 the people that are working in San Francisco, for example, or Berkeley, for example, might live. And we got \u2013 have a pretty good idea of how that will work. Because presumably, if you\u2019re going to lock down housing in some cities, the cities that are the likely beneficiaries will be the cities nearby. And rents will \u2013 because again, you\u2019re talking about a net reduction of rental housing in that scenario, rents will probably go higher, not less high. So they will benefit from the greater demand or the lack of supply, let\u2019s say, that is caused by the rent control cities.","Rich Hill","Understood. Thank you, everyone. I appreciate the color.","Michael Schall","Thank you.","Operator","Hello, are you able to hear me now?","Michael Schall","Yes, we hear you.","Operator","Okay, you can hear. We\u2019re going to join Karin Ford for her question.","Michael Schall","Great. Thank you.","Karin Ford","Sorry about that. Glad to hear we\u2019re back. I wanted to just ask one more about Prop. 10. I know you said that cap rates haven\u2019t moved in your markets, but are you seeing more product starting to come to market from landlords ahead of potential repeal?","Michael Schall","Karen, it\u2019s Mike and thank you for sticking with us. Anecdotally, we\u2019ve heard that there are some more listings out there. But as I said in my comments, we really scrubbed all the deals that have been completed year-to-date just to make sure that we weren\u2019t missing something. So we went through them one by one, the deals that were in our \u2013 in the markets that we care hear about. And so there was no indication that cap rates have changed in those transactions. But again, so there are some anecdotes that maybe there\u2019ll be a little bit more transaction activity as we get to the back half of the year, although that\u2019s not unusual because all the sellers now that rents peak in June and July, and, therefore, they typically wait until June or July to get the best underwriting of their deals. So I wouldn\u2019t say that\u2019s at all unusual.","Karin Ford","Great. Thanks. And my second question is I was interested in your comments about single-family affordability in your markets and the lack thereof in \u2013 given the current tax regime. We started to see some weakness in the housing markets here in the Northeast, and we obviously don\u2019t have the same job growth that you guys have out there. Do you think that single-family headwinds could be a real demand driver for you guys in 2019 as people start to recognize the tax impact of the tax law change?","Michael Schall","Karin, it\u2019s Mike again. We\u2019ve seen \u2013 when you look at production of housing in California, we\u2019ve seen very, very low levels of production for single-family homes largely because of California\u2019s Global Warming Solutions Act, which seeks to put housing \u2013 high-density housing near the jobs, lower carbon pollution, fix the traffic problems that we have, increase in spending for public transit, et cetera. So that agenda is sort of operating in the background, and that is not a pro-single-family home type of agenda.","So we see more densification of housing in the urban markets. And so I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen. I think that if anything, there\u2019ll be more condos being developed, and I think that\u2019s a big possibility. And more on that discussion as well as it relates to a number of our properties. So I think it\u2019s more likely to be in the high-density area than it is in the single-family home.","Karin Ford","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from John Guinee with Stifel. Please proceed.","John Guinee","Oh, great. Thank you. John Guinee here. Quick question for you. If you\u2019re looking at land at today\u2019s prices, and the current hard costs and, as you know, land prices are sticky and really haven\u2019t come down, on an untrended basis, what does your underwriting show is the return on cost for development if you have to pay today\u2019s prices?","John Eudy","This is John Eudy, John. It depends on the specifics, obviously, but far less than it would motivate you to do a deal. If you take it on today\u2019s numbers, probably average somewhere in the high \u2013 and that\u2019s buying land at today\u2019s number and entitlements out a year. So the high 3%, low 4%, 4.25% at the high.","John Guinee","Do you see institutional money essentially willing to continue at that kind of \u2013 those kind of returns? Or are they finally backing off?","John Eudy","From my perspective, it appears like they\u2019re backing off. And we see it through the pref equity program as well the pipeline going down. Mike, what do you think?","Michael Schall","Yes, I totally agree with John. And I would say maybe one caveat because there are deals that have a significant amount of money that are already invested in them, and those are the ones that tend to move forward. When you get beyond those transactions because, let\u2019s say, a 4% yield is better than having $10 million invested in a deal that\u2019s not going forward. So you end up with that conundrum. But aside from that, I totally agree with John.","John Guinee","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question is from John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors.","John Pawlowski","Thanks. Mike, I\u2019d like to get your thoughts just on the broader political risk in California. I mean, Costa-Hawkins is one aspect, and you have some other legislation about initiatives moving against commercial landlords like Prop. 13, Prop. C. So the odds of legislators or voters reaching for the economics of landlords seem to be increasing. It\u2019s becoming increasingly less leaning to date. I guess my question is, how do you approach political risk in comparing any type of risk-adjusted return framework to California markets versus non-California markets? And have you started factoring that into investment decisions outside of this Costa-Hawkins, very city level-specific considerations?","Michael Schall","Yes, John, this is Mike. It\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s a \u2013 it\u2019s a good question. And we \u2013 you \u2013 pretty much everything through the lens of supply and demand for housing. And so if the regulatory environment gets so extreme that you start seeing job growth slow, which drives the demand side, then that would cause us to make a different decision potentially. But we are always going to be the same. We\u2019re going to look through the lens of supply and demand for housing, and we\u2019re going to seek areas that have the best dynamic \u2013 the best supply-demand dynamic.","And right now we believe that\u2019s in California, in the various markets that we\u2019re in. If that dynamic changes because of the political risk, then we would come to a different conclusion. So it\u2019s \u2013 and I think it\u2019s far from certain what California is going to do because we have seen, certainly on the office side and in a variety of ways, the local governments very willing to accommodate the growth of California, wanting to accommodate the Apples and Googles, et cetera, of the world. And you\u2019re right, more recently, you\u2019ve seen these head tax proposals and a variety of things that seem very focused on those entities.","Notably, in Washington, Amazon, the head tax was repealed after being passed. But I think to give you some idea, there is some give-and-take here, and where the politicians come out on this is going to be really critical. I think, again, there\u2019s a dichotomy here. You have Gavin Newsom that is supportive of our position with respect to Prop. 10.","He\u2019s not favor of the repeal, but the democrat party is in favor of repeal. You have a variety of issues going back and forth. I think we just need to let it play out. I mean, our hope is that reason prevails at the end of the day. And the \u2013 there\u2019s a study by UC Berkeley\u2019s Terner Center that starts a conversation about what should happen that I think is notable, and it\u2019s available online. And so I think it\u2019s too early to tell. And we will see \u2013 we will know in the next year or two which way this is going to go.","John Pawlowski","Okay, that\u2019s super helpful. Today \u2013 back to the rent control risk. Today\u2019s prepare \u2013 portfolio allocation decisions, are you redlining any cities right now from an investment standpoint?","Michael Schall","I wouldn\u2019t say redline because, again, an investment decision \u2013 rent control is only one factor within the investment decision. And in fact, you would say that if, for example, Santa Cruz decides to establish a pretty extreme form of rent control, would there be a cap rate that would also bend? It\u2019s not the current cap rate environment, obviously, but, again, there\u2019s a number of considerations that really prevent you from absolutely redlining things. Again, assuming that the cap rates and yields are not \u2013 don\u2019t change very significantly to compensate you for that risk and for the lower return.","John Pawlowski","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies.","Peter Abramowitz","Hi. This is Peter Abramowitz on from Tayo. I just wanted to touch on the tax expense growth in the same-store pool in the first half just given that it has particularly kind of climbed down in the second quarter but also below the peers\u2019 in the first half. So I was just wondering what sort of trends you\u2019re seeing that\u2019s keeping that pretty low. And how sustainable is that going forward? Or what are you seeing for the back half?","Angela Kleiman","On the tax front, first half was lower, but it\u2019s primarily because we had essentially property tax adjustments. And so we had expected \u2013 in the non-same-store pool. So as far as the same-store pool, it\u2019s coming in pretty much as expected. Seattle is always a little bit of a wildcard, and it\u2019d be coming a little bit higher. And so we do expect second half property tax to be even higher than in the first half. Does that answer your question?","Peter Abramowitz","Yes, sure. Thank you.","Angela Kleiman","Great. Thanks.","Operator","There are no more questions at this time. We will return the conference back over to Mike for closing comments.","Michael Schall","Thank you. Hey, we\u2019re so sorry for our technical problems during the call. Apologize for that. And I want to thank you for your participation today. Hope to see many of you at the BofA Merrill Lynch conference next month. Good day.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation."],"8640":["Essex Property Trust (NYSE:ESS) Q1 2013 Earnings Call May  2, 2013  1:00 PM ET","Executives","Michael J.

First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs, as well as information available to the company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found in the company's filings with the SEC.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you, Mr. Schall. You may begin.","Michael J. Schall","Thank you. I would like to start by welcoming you to our first quarter earnings call. Mike Dance and Erik Alexander will follow me with comments. John Eudy and John Burkart are available for Q&A.","I will cover the following topics on the call. First, Q1 results and commentary; second, cap rates and investment markets; and third, an update on the State of California. So on to the first topic.","Yesterday, we reported another strong quarter with core FFO per share of $1.87, an increase of 14% over the prior year and equal to the high end of the guidance range that was presented on our last earnings call. Our operating results should be viewed within the context of our recent activity in the capital markets that was not fully considered in our original guidance. The result of these efforts is an improved balance sheet, with longer debt maturities, less variable-rate exposure, increased common equity, greater liquidity and a lower debt-to-EBITDA ratio, which is now below 7.0.","Our Q1 results and most of the economic data give us confidence in our 2013 guidance. We acknowledged concerns about the level of housing supply, especially apartments, that are scheduled for delivery in 2013 and 2014 in selected submarkets, notably North San Jose and downtown Seattle. At the same time, there are several important factors that support our optimistic outlook and favorably differentiate the West Coast from other parts of the country. These factors are as follows. First, although March was a disappointing month from the perspective of national job growth, California continued to perform quite well. According to the BLS forecast, California is estimated to produce 30% of the nation's jobs in 2013 and is, therefore, expected to significantly outpace the national average in job growth.","Second, production of for-sale housing continues at a muted pace, although its pace will likely increase later this year. This expectation is driven by the exceptional increase in year-over-year housing prices, up from 15% to 35% in the coastal markets.","While the median priced homes still lag the high set in 2007 and 2008, they have recovered sufficiently to allow for-sale housing development. Our experience is that apartments benefit from high cost for-sale housing alternatives.","Third point, the health of the apartment rental market depends both on job growth and job quality and the quality of jobs continues to be high in the coastal regions of California and Washington. High income jobs have a greater multiplier effect, more disposable income and greater wealth creation. A good indication of job quality is estimated personal income growth, which for 2013, is up 5.1% for Seattle; 4.9% for San Jose; and from 3% to 3.4% for Southern California, as compared to the national average of 3.1% .","And finally, fourth factor. We look to the office market, H1B Visas and venture-capital investment activity for confirmation of jobs and economic trends. While the national office recovery has been modest since the Great Recession, we have seen significant improvements in several of the West Coast office markets. For example, since the Great Recession, San Francisco's office rent growth has led the nation, increasing approximately 30%. In the coastal markets, office absorption has outpaced the U.S. and is accelerating, major expansions of corporate campuses have been announced by Google, Apple, Amazon and several other companies. Another confirming data point is the demand for H1B Visas, which are used to admit foreign skilled workers into the U.S.","A lottery-style approach was used to distribute 85,000 H1B Visas allotted in 2013, with all committed in less than a week. Finally, venture capital is another confirming data point. California received 47% or $2.8 billion of the nation's first quarter 2013 total D.C. investment.","As a result of these factors, we continue to see a favorable ratio of housing demand to supply based on our job and supply estimates indicated on Page S16 of the earnings supplement. We estimate that housing demand, including both apartments and for-sale housing will, on average, exceed supply by a 2.5:1 ratio for the Essex portfolio. We conclude that the apartment markets will continue to report strong rental growth. While lease-ups will soften rents in a few places and create some level of volatility, we expect new apartments to be absorbed without major difficulty.","My second topic, cap rates and investment markets. Cap rates are generally unchanged from last quarter and are currently in the 4% to 4.25% for A property and A locations, and in the mid-4% to low 5% range for B quality property in A locations. Cap rates increased from there to lesser locations and property quality. In the first quarter, deal flow that satisfies our criteria was relatively light, however, we still believe that we will achieve the $400 million in acquisitions contemplated in our 2013 guidance.","We will likely start 2 additional apartment developments in 2013, aggregating approximately 500 units. We have become more selective for new apartment development opportunities and are looking for locations that we expect to improve, with rents that have strong growth potential.","And finally, my third topic, concerns the State of California. We believe that significant progress has been made in California. While there is an ongoing discussion about future fiscal issues and the need for higher taxes, including modification of Prop. 13, the current condition has dramatically improved from just a few years ago. An improving California economy generates more tax revenue. A combination of an improving economy, reduction in cost and tax increases has eliminated the state's fiscal deficit in this fiscal year. According to media sources, general fund spending in the state has declined by approximately $10 billion or 9.7% since the 2007-2008 fiscal year.","Prop. 30 will raise an estimated $6 billion in new taxes. As a result, the state expects to take in an estimated $2.4 billion more in revenue than it will spend this fiscal year, which ends June 30. That's exceptional progress relative to the $27 billion deficit that the state experienced just a few years ago.","I would like to thank you for joining the call today. Now I'll turn the call over to Erik. Thank you.","Erik J. Alexander","Thanks, Mike. Essex enjoyed another strong quarter of property operations, and we are pleased with our results. Demand was strong and improved throughout the period. Turnover was lower than forecasted and we are poised to take advantage of what is expected to be a solid peak leasing season. New lease and renewal activity maintained strength, following a good fourth quarter, and not since before the recession have we started off the year with economic rent increasing every week for 4 straight months.","As of April, loss to lease for the portfolio was 4.2%. As projected, average renewal rate increased 5% during the quarter and are expected to continue at that level through July. Furthermore, the average rents achieved on all new lease transactions in April reached their highest point ever and are $70 higher than renewals recorded in the same month. So with portfolio occupancy at 96.4 at the end of April, and our net availability less than 6%, we feel confident about the strength of our market and our ability to achieve our plan for 2013. Bolstering that confidence, the preliminary revenue results for April were at the top end of our revenue guidance for the year.","But if there was any surprise during the first quarter, it was lower turnover than planned. Despite strong rent growth and higher renewal rates, turnover for the portfolio decreased 2% compared to the first quarter of last year, with the lowest turnover actually in Seattle. Turnover due to home purchase decreased from the fourth quarter and remains in check across the portfolio at less than 12%. We do expect an increase in moveouts due to homes purchased in the upcoming quarters and anticipate that it will remain well manageable levels. Overall, lower turnover, coupled with rising economic rents, high occupancy and increasing demand should help us maintain pricing power across most of the portfolio throughout the summer.","Expo was the only active lease sector in the quarter. As forecasted, we stabilized this community in April. Congratulations to the Expo team for averaging 37 leases per month during the slowest time of the year. I think this is another testament to the strength of the Seattle market. Demand in leasing volume have remained strong in the downtown despite new product deliveries. Next quarter, I will provide initial leasing results for Essex as we begin pre-leasing activities this month.","Now I'll share some highlights for each of our regions beginning with Seattle. Properties in the region have met or exceeded expectations so far this year and enjoyed collective rent growth second only to parts of the Bay Area. We have posted company leasing rent growth for new leases in April and we remain confident that this market will meet growth expectations for the year, especially on the East Side. Employment growth remains strong in the region, with a year-over-year increase of 2.5%. Job growth details for all of our markets can be found on S-16 of the supplements.","Given the robust hiring that continues at Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Intel, Cisco and Visa, we believe job creation will match or exceed our forecast for the year. Of equal importance, the Seattle metropolitan division posted the highest personal income growth at any of our markets, with expected gains over 5% for 2012 and 2013. Office absorption showed continued strength with 1.6 million square feet of space absorbed during the quarter, or nearly 2% of total stock. I think it is safe to conclude that Seattle remains a hot job market and our portfolio should benefit from these commercial activities throughout 2013.","In Northern California, continue to lead the way for Essex with the highest growth in rental rates and revenue for the portfolio. The primary reason is the job growth continues to be strong in the Bay Area and the current rate of formation is outpacing our forecast on a year-over-year basis. All submarkets are ahead of schedule and are led by growth in professional and business services.","San Francisco and San Jose job exploits are well-known, but the East Bay continues to make meaningful strides in employment, adding 21,000 jobs in the last 12 months. First quarter office absorption in the Bay Area was positive in all submarkets, but it is interesting to note that East Bay led the region with 600,000 square feet of net absorption during the period. Multifamily deliveries in North San Jose continue as expected. The demand appears to be sufficient to occupy all of these new offerings. Pricing in the submarket increased 3% during the first quarter and concession activity remained normal for the communities looking to achieve a high rate of absorption.","Turning to Southern California. Los Angeles leads the result, followed closely by Orange County. We expect the relative submarket rankings to remain the same throughout 2013, but do look for Los Angeles and Orange County to increase momentum this summer. San Diego has not been very exciting so far this year, but given that unemployment has dropped below 8% and our job forecast is ahead of schedule, we do expect San Diego would have a better second half of the year. Current occupancies in the county are above 96% and rents moved up in April. Ventura is ahead of San Diego in terms of rent growth and should perform in line with expectations on modest job growth, high occupancy and low new supply.","The jobs picture in Southern California continues to improve in all submarkets, again led by professional and business services. Los Angeles, Orange and San Diego counties have all seen job growth rise from below the national average last spring to well above the national average in March, and all post rates of job growth above 2%. The West side of Los Angeles continues to be the strongest, with creative and tech companies like Amazon and Beats by Dre. seeking additional space, while PEMCO, Hyundai and Google expand in Orange County. Office absorption in Southern California remains positive and large projects like the expansion of Universal Studios, approval of USC Village, and groundbreaking of Runway imply this is a signal of continued economic recovery in Los Angeles. Therefore, we remain confident in all of our markets and our ability to execute our plan in 2013.","Thank you for your time, and I'll now turn the call over to Mike Dance.","Michael T. Dance","Thanks, Erik. Today, I will provide commentary on our recent capital markets activity and provide details on the second quarter's and full year's guidance. In April, Essex issued $300 million of 10-year senior unsecured notes at an effective rate of 3.35%. That proceeds from the offering we used to pay off the balance on our lines of credit. While there is a temporary mismatch on the timing of the use of the proceeds, we felt it was an opportune time to enter the market and prefund some of our future debt needs. At the end of April, our cash balance was approximately $100 million, with no balance on our bank revolving credit line. By reducing our variable rate exposure with 10-year bonds and prefunding the debt component of the 2013 development expenditures, we estimate that the additional interest cost will reduce FFO in Q2 by $0.04 per share compared to the Q1 2013 results.","Also in Q1, we see -- we received approximately $40 million from the early payment of indirect real estate investments, which were yielding over 9%.  These prepayments will reduce interest income by $0.02 per share in Q2 and subsequent quarters. The $0.06 loss with sequential FFO will be offset by a sequential increase in net operating income for our midpoint in Q2 core FFO guidance of $1.83 per share. For the first quarter, we achieved 5.9% year-over-year rent growth of the same property revenues and 5.3% increase in same property expenses. Both metrics were better than our internal projection. Our same property expense growth in Q1 was higher than our full year guidance of 3% to 4%, as we have tough operating expense comparisons for the first half of the year. Operating expenses during the quarter were negatively impacted by 25% higher property taxes in Seattle, with increases of both the assessed values and levy rates. For 2013, we are affirming the guidance for FFO and same property operating results provided in January. If the new lease and renewal results that Erik just reported for April continues through the next 2 months of the quarter, we are well-positioned to achieve close to the high end of our revenue growth guidance in the second quarter.","Year-over-year same property operating expenses for the second quarter are forecasted to be similar to the first quarter. Operating expenses for the second half of the year are forecasted to be below the full year guidance range, as the comparative periods in the second half of 2012 are more reflective of the operating expense run rate for the portfolio. The improvements in our gross operating margins are expected in the second half of 2013.","With the strong operations meeting our internal expectations, we are maintaining 2013 FFO guidance despite having issued, in April, $300 million of unsecured bonds, which was not anticipated in our January guidance. To be clear, had we not issued the bond and received the early payment on high yielding investments, we would have been able to increase our FFO guidance.","That ends my comments, and I will now turn the call back over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from line of Nick Joseph with Citi.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great. You mentioned that first quarter's same-store revenue growth of 5.9 was maybe a little ahead of your expectations. So just looking at the full year guidance of 5 to 6.5, are you expecting revenue growth to kind of trend towards that 5.9? You're not expecting really a deceleration going forward?","Michael J. Schall","We haven't seen it in April. And based on where renewals are going out, and what we're seeing, nothing shows deceleration for the portfolio.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Then in terms of the development, are you seeing any construction cost pressures?","John D. Eudy","This is John Eudy. Of course we are. Fortunately, our portfolio under construction is 95% bought out.  But in the future for the next 6 to 12 months, there's going to be high single-digit increases is our thought.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","All right. And then finally, Erik, can you talk about your thoughts on the ATM program, how you balance the desire to match fund and continue to improve the balance sheet with where your current stock price is today relative to NAV?","Erik J. Alexander","Yes, I think that was one of the reasons we looked at the bond market. Obviously, we are very pleased with the pricing of our 10-year bond and relative to our stock price right now, we basically, intentionally deferred some of our equity raise and prefunded some of our debt raise. And we hope with continued strong results that we are expecting, the cost of the common equity will go down. But we need to continue to deliver the results we're seeing.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Bragg, Green Street Advisors.","David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, LLC","A little bit in detail about your underwriting of Fox Plaza, your going-in yield and your expected IRR?","Michael T. Dance","Sure. Fox Plaza is our acquisition on Market Street, in San Francisco. It's across the street from the brand new Twitter Headquarters. And it's a very vibrant, changing, improving area. So that is the first very important point in that acquisition. It is a rent-controlled building. And as a result, you could expect our going-in yield to be lower than comparable transactions, given rent control. And that was certainly the case. There was a low 4 type going-in yield. But a much higher cap rate on market rents. In other words, there was a very large loss to lease there. The cap rate on market rents was approaching 6%. And so in the short-term, as you're turning units, you don't benefit as much obviously because of the going-in yield is lower. But over time, we hope to capture that large loss to lease and get closer to the economic cap rate given rent control. Does that help, Dave?","David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Yes, that's helpful. And my next question is just about Southern California. Last quarter, you spoke about the region having underperformed your expectations so far on this recovery. In the first quarter, your revenue growth was at the low end of full year guidance. So after 4 months of this year, are you disappointed again with the region or are you optimistic that it will accelerate, putting you at the top half of your guidance range for that region for the year?","Michael J. Schall","Yes, Dave. This is Mike, and Erik may want to follow up as well. Keep in mind that we just came out of our seasonal period. Our peak leasing season begins in effectively March 1, and we see most of our growth during that period of time. So as it relates to guidance revision, other types of things, keep in mind that we just came out of a seasonal period. And so the first quarter may or may not be as relevant as some of the other quarters. In fact, I would say Q2 is the most relevant quarter. We go effectively from having near 0 loss to lease at December 31, given seasonality, primarily, and we see how strong the markets bounce back as we enter into the peak leasing season. And where as Erik said, we are favorably impressed by what we see out there, and I think that we're on track for a strong peak leasing season. Having said that, relatively new and a couple of months does not make a year. And so we are erring maybe a little bit more on the cautious side.","David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, LLC","So just specifically, Mike or Erik, you said you expect 5% renewal gains April through July for the portfolio? Where would you put those for Southern California?","Erik J. Alexander","There's going to be a range in SoCal on the lower end. Maybe the 3s in San Diego or Ventura again. They could be higher depending on that specific address, too. 5s and 6s in parts of Los Angeles, certainly the West side and Downtown. We see strength and we have a good demand and higher occupancy. So we're hopeful and optimistic about the upcoming summer. But as Mike said, we'll know a lot more in the next few months.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Rob Stevenson with Macquarie.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Can you talk a little bit about San Jose, Seattle, when the biggest percentage of the development comes online and sort of how you sort of -- when you see that despite robust job growth, what do you do to sort of prepare for that for your existing assets in those markets to avoid the sort of cycle where 1 month, 2 months starts becoming 3 and people start moving out?","Michael J. Schall","Sure. In San Jose, it's really a unique situation in that, a couple of years ago, the city was trying to incentivize new development of apartments before we saw any of the rent increase activity and they granted waivers of the BMR requirements and some other things to help developers start construction. That was granted to 5 -- on 5 transactions, aggregating somewhere around 3,000 units. All those units are going to hit, at some point in time, in '13, the '13 to '14 period and, therefore, that is where the sluggish supply is coming in San Jose. And again, it's right there before us. Irvine was the first to deliver and a couple of others long station and there's a series of transactions that are coming in for the rest of 2013 and into 2014. In Seattle, we see just a continued amount of supply. Our estimates, if you look at multifamily deliveries in '13, we have 6,900 units. In 2014, we think it's probably 8,000, so we'll see continued supply of multifamily units in Seattle, maybe even a few more than we see in 2013. In Northern California, it was in San Jose, specifically, we think it will, given what I said, it will be reduced. It will go from 4,100 deliveries of apartments in 2013 to 3,500 in 2014. Again, those numbers can change, especially in the 2014 numbers. We track this pretty carefully and so it's pretty sensitive, obviously to our overall results. Having said all those things, given job growth, we think that we can absorb these levels of supply and still have very strong rent growth and so we don't expect, based on what we see in front of us today, for a significant amount of deceleration in rents in 2014.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Okay. Given what you guys had said earlier in the call about high single-digit increase in construction costs, meaning, I would imagine that, at this point, rental rates are still keeping up with that to an extent where yields haven't -- on developments haven't just fallen off a cliff. But how much higher do construction costs really have to go in your markets before it starts really choking off yields to the point where you are seeing a real decrease of supply?","Michael J. Schall","That's already happening, Dave or Rob, excuse me. The potential deals today compared to when we were underwriting and doing the funding of our deals that we have in our pipeline now 2 years ago, is very, very minimal on what hits the radar, from our perspective as far as potential deals. I think the market's recognizing that as well. There's a lot of deals out there being chatted about and talked about amongst various folks from merchant builders on up. But on a go-forward basis, I see, the supply starts -- starting to taper off considerably, just for that reason.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then just lastly, what's the -- you've got a few redevelopment projects on the books these days. What's the outside of those projects, what's the incremental opportunity from a redevelopment standpoint that makes sense from a returns perspective today?","John F. Burkart","This is John Burkart. There's actually a variety of opportunities in the portfolio. One of them that we're starting to embark upon is the reamenitization of the assets. Just basically updating the amenities to modern standards. Another one of course we're continuing is the unit turns. We have a substantially increased our unit turns this year from last year, and we'll continue to do so. Obviously, the major renovations are still part of the opportunity to grow some limited inflow opportunity. And then, of course the condo auctionality on many of the assets that we have. So we're pretty excited about the value of the portfolio right now.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Can you help us quantify what that, in terms of units, in terms of dollars, that you could put out over the next couple of years in that type of project?","John F. Burkart","Yes, the units -- we're probably going to hit about 1,200 renovated units this year. There's a range of, say, 1,000 to 1,500 and Erik's team and my team work very closely together to make a lot of good decision based on market conditions, et cetera. So it may vary, but the targets around $1,200. We're typically investing around $20,000 per property -- per unit and our returns are averaging 10% to 15% on that. Additional renovation opportunities funds, we're in the $10 million to $20 million range on the assets overall. That's in addition to unit terms. Does that help?","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Yes, I just want to quantify as to how big of a growth driver. It sounds like there's opportunity but it's still in terms of [indiscernible] at this point. Over the next couple of years it's not going to be a material sort of tailwind from a growth perspective.","Michael J. Schall","Rob, I think part of that is philosophical in nature, and that rather than throwing a chunk of money at a renovation program, we try to be purposeful. We try to look for low hanging fruit. We try to not have a one-size-fits-all type of approach. And I think that we end up with a better overall result doing that. The reality is, we have most the housing stock in the West Coast and certainly within our portfolio is 20 to 30 to 40 years old, and there's a lot of redevelopment potential within it. In terms of how to actually execute a redevelopment program, that's where there's, I think, very significant strategic differences among the apartment companies. And we tend to take the maybe a little bit more conservative approach, which is try to be very purposeful with respect to how we invest that money.","Operator","Our next question comes from in line of David Toti with Cantor Fitzgerald.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Just one quick one. Mike, this one is kind of for you. You guys have obviously taken the opportunity to sort of laterally invest opportunistically over the past couple of years. But it's been somewhat quiet the last few quarters. Is that partially because of the deal flow or do you think that pricing, even in the lateral investment opportunities, is a bit beyond your hurdle rates?","Michael T. Dance","Yes, it's really the deal flow. There are 2 things I think that are happening.  Number one, there are more deals that are not within what we define as our core markets. A lot of sales are on the periphery. And property that we really don't want to own. So there actually have been transactions, but really not transactions that we -- that fit our criteria. So I think that's number one. And number two, I think there's just been a slowdown in overall deal activity. And, I guess, the third piece is, it's harder for us to make the numbers work, given that last year we grow through core FFO 21%. We're starting the year with very solid growth rates, which makes our equity more expensive and, therefore, more difficult to invest at a positive spread, in terms of what we're looking at. So it's really all of those factors. Having said that, we have more modest expectations this year. Last year, we did about $800 million in acquisition. This year, we expect to do about $400 million. So I think we're still on track to hit that number.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then my second question just has to do with the asset you are planning to sell from the fund. I might have missed this earlier. If you guys are hesitant on the acquisition side, what is the buyer profile on the other side of those potential deals? What kind of buyers are looking at those assets and finding it meets their hurdle?","Michael J. Schall","There is a lot of activity in those transactions. And most of those properties are very well located. And they will fall within the cap rates that I talked about in my prepared remarks. And so for well located property there's still plenty of buyers out there that are very interested in those properties. So I don't see that changing. I mean, I think that you would start seeing cap rates change if you started seeing investor activity pull back. Cap rates are probably more a function of how many dollars, investor dollars, are chasing how many deals than they are expected growth rates in IRRs and that type of thing. So we still see plenty of money out there.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Salinsky with RBC Capital Markets.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Erik, first question. What was the sequential rent growth in the first quarter and also, if you look at the blended rents for the quarter signed, how does that compare versus the first quarter of 2012?","Erik J. Alexander","The sequential rents are .08%, and over last year, on the -- let me look that up for you, but I think it's -- well, I don't want to guess at it. I'll get back to you on that.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. I appreciate that. And second question. Mike, just to go back to David's question about the acquisition pricing in the market, how far off are you missing on the deals? How much is pricing outside? And on your numbers and your gross expectations, where is the market pricing coastal multi-family assets today on an IRR basis?","Erik J. Alexander","I don't really think that's the issue, Mike, because we're just kind of underwriting the same quantity of deals that we underwrote over the last couple of years, which surprises me a bit because even last year, I think was -- the transaction volume was somewhere around 70% of what it was in 2007, 2008. So we had, even last year, we had less transaction volume. We're seeing even less this year. I think a lot of that has to do with what has happened with rents over the last past several years. If you go back to 20 to 30 years, there was not this peak leasing season concept nearly to the extent that it exists today. Rent increased more ratably throughout the year. Now you have a 4-month period that your entire year is essentially predicated on, from March to July or August, let's say. And so all things being equal, I think sellers and owners would rather wait a little bit longer and see how good the peak leasing season is before listing their building it because obviously, if the NOI goes up, they can justify higher NOI, they're going to get the higher price. So I think it's probably more that, but we'll tell you next quarter.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I don't have the quarterly information that you asked about, but the most recent information which would be the complete month of April compared to last year is 7% higher on the new lease -- on all new lease transactions.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's encouraging. And just a final question. I think previously, you've mentioned 2014 is kind of the year you expected Southern California to outperform Northern California. Is that still a reasonable expectation?","Michael J. Schall","Well, we've been expecting Southern California to improve faster than it has. So I think that's the one area that we've been a little bit off. The magnitude in Northern California and Seattle of rent growth and the pace were much better than we thought. But the pace in Southern California offset the benefit we saw up here. So we're going to make a similar guess. I'm not sure that, and Erik may have a different opinion, but I'm not sure that they're going to crossover in 2014. Part of that is due to, if you look at personal income growth is so strong in the North. When you're at 4% to 5% personal income growth and 2x to 2.5x ratio of demand to supply, which were the numbers that we were quoting actually and even more strong in the North, we are starting to think that Northern California and Seattle can remain stronger, longer than we thought. And so we feel good about that and at the same time, I think our expectation for Southern California is the continued slow, methodical improvement that we've had thus far, recognizing, however, that pricing power is a function of availability in the marketplace. And there's a big difference if you add -- 95% to 96% market occupancy, we get quite a bit more pricing power over that 1%. So it's more like an exponential impact, if you go from 96% to 97%, you start picking up more pricing power. So we could be wrong, we think that things will go in the right direction. It's just been painfully slow in Southern California. So I'm not so sure that they -- I see them as more equitable than probably one outpacing other at this point.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Paula Poskon with Robert W. Baird.","Paula J. Poskon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Are there any other industries in your markets that you think will have accelerating significant job growth outside of technology?","Michael J. Schall","I mean, life sciences is the other obvious one. In Southern California, we're seeing these are not as good as quality jobs, but certainly leisure, hospitality seems to be doing really well in Southern California. So I'd say anything having to do with tech, energy, life sciences are really the top of the radar screen in terms of the types of jobs that we're looking for. And then of course professional services are always good as well. So I'd say all 3: professional services, life sciences, tech and energy, which we don't have so much of.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Ross Nussbaum with UBS.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I just want to clarify, when you said that in April, the new leases were up 7%, is that over the expiring leases?","Michael J. Schall","No. So that's all new leases executed in April versus all new leases executed last April.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So effectively, sort of market-asking or -taking rents are up 7% year-over-year?","Michael J. Schall","There's quite a bit of noise in this over expiring because our expiring includes, if someone goes from a -- goes into a month-to-month premium, it's picked up in the denominator of that calculation. So there's been over the last couple of years more and more the disconnect between the expiring lease rate. And, in fact, I've encouraged our people to either create a new metric or deemphasize that one because it's not relevant. I mean, we were talking about in Q1 somewhere around 5% renewals and 5% new lease rates, yet we were better than that. And so I think that there's -- some part of this is a disconnect in how that metric is calculated and I think it's becoming a little bit less relevant than it was a couple of years ago.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes, that's sort of where I was trying to go, because I was looking at the back of your supplement in terms of the 6.1% market rent growth forecast you had for this year and I was just sort of trying to tie that back to the 5% renewals, 7% new leases. And I mean, they are all in the same ballpark, I guess, I mean it gives us a sense that, that's roughly what you are achieving.","Michael J. Schall","Yes.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I thought it was notable that you didn't change your estimated market rent growth forecast from last quarter. You didn't just simply paste the page in to this supplemental. You continue to believe that the market is as strong today as it was the last time you put out your supplemental.","John F. Burkart","Yes, that's absolutely the case. This is John. We continue to get great job data, which is actually better than what we had in our supplemental. And we're seeing a great experience out of operations because [indiscernible]","Michael J. Schall","[indiscernible] There's one more factor, which is I'm sort of philosophically opposed to raising guidance 2 months after we give it originally. So I was a -- I weighed in against the guidance change candidly, because we just gave it to you in February and it's only April, and I want to see a little bit more about what happened. So perhaps, I'm part of the problem there.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","The last question, you guys have been opportunistic in the past, and I'm curious, when you look at the stock prices of virtually all of your peers in the multi-family REIT sector and you look at them and say, most of them might be trading at discounts to the cap rates that you're seeing in the market, do you have any inclination to go out and buy a few shares of public companies rather than direct assets?","Michael J. Schall","You are so smooth, Ross.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I'm not saying -- I'm not bringing up BRE. I mean, this is a whole different... I'm not going down that -- I'm not saying that you want to buy the company, I'm just sitting here, saying you've done these kinds of things in the past. And I'm curious if that's still something you spend time thinking about.","Michael J. Schall","I mean, we do try to understand the environment that we're in, but at this point in time, it's really not worth spending our time. There's a lot of other things that I think may be more interesting to us. So we are working on some transactions that are similar, but maybe a little bit unique. So no, that's not where we're spending our time right now.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with BMO Capital Markets.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Do you have any properties in Camarillo?","Michael J. Schall","We do.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","There's a big fire there right now, just FYI.","Michael J. Schall","Okay.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","So that's, that. So...","Michael J. Schall","[indiscernible] We have several properties in Camarillo.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. So take a look. I guess, I just want to ask a bigger picture question. I mean, we talk about granular detail, cap rates and renewal increases and all that sort of stuff and yet the sector still underperformed NAV discount average of 7%. Nothing is really working when we get on these calls. And I'm curious if you could think, Mike or anybody, of big picture, what do you think has to happen for the sector to start performing better as a group or even you, yourself? I mean, do you think that there is a catalyst out there in a positive way? Do you think 2014 might do better than people are expecting? Do you have a big picture comment about how we can get the sector moving and acknowledging what is a good value and also good growth?","Michael J. Schall","That is a great question. And I wish I had the answer. I will make the comment that I made to Mike D., which is this was the first year in his 8 years here that he wasn't accused of sandbagging with respect to our guidance this year. So I thought that goods from quarterly results, which we consider these results to be pretty strong, especially coming out of the first quarter, which has an element of seasonality. And that comment, that we still saw the West Coast as being a great place to own property and then confirming that with actual results would be a positive thing. But as I look to the stock over the last day, that doesn't seem to be the case. So I think it's more of the same. I think it's proving it out and I think the expectation of investors or the concerns of investors are maybe too large, relative to the reality. So again, I don't know how to -- if I could say it any differently. I tried to bring up the points in the script that supports the reasons why you should own properties on the West Coast. I hope that resonated.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Do you think that 2014 -- not to give guidance, of course, but do you think 2014 could be a bit better than what people are kind of dialing in to their numbers right now?","Michael J. Schall","I think implied in my comments, which again, when you see personal income growth in the 3% to 5% range and you see ratio of housing demand to housing supply at 2% plus, those would be bullish indicators and they would mean that you would not expect to see any meaningful deceleration going forward. So yes, I expect a very good 2014. And candidly, we could be maybe surprised by Southern California that it has continues its slow but steady recovery. So I think 2014 will be another good year.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, there are no further questions at this time.

Good day and welcome to the Essex Property Trust Incorporated First Quarter 2015 Financial Results Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. ","Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions, and beliefs as well as information available to the company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found in the company's filings with the SEC.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you Mr. Schall, you may begin.","Michael J. Schall","Hi, thank you. I'd like to start today by welcoming you to our first quarter earnings call. Mike Dance and Erik Alexander will follow me with comments and John Eudy, John Burkart, and Angela Kleiman are also in attendance. I'll cover the following topics on the call; first, our quarterly results and market conditions; second, a merger integration update; and third, investment activities.","On to the first topic, we are pleased to report continued strong operating results consistent with robust demand for housing on the West Coast. Our guidance for 2015 contemplated slightly lower rent growth compared to 2014 based on modestly higher levels of housing supply, in particular in Seattle.","Our housing supply expectations remain unchanged, however, we have experienced better than expected demand from job growth. As a result, our reported 7.7% revenue growth exceeded the high-end of our guidance range, equal to Q4 2014 and Q3 2012 for the highest same property revenue growth achieved since the great recession. The March jobs report supports that out performance with U.S. job growth of 2.3% versus our estimate of 2%, and the West Coast dramatically outperforming the nation in March year-over-year job growth of 4.3% in Northern California, 3.4% in Seattle, and 2.8% in Southern California.","Demand from job growth is significantly outpacing our 2015 housing supply growth expectations, expressed as a percentage of housing stock of 0.8% in Northern California, 0.6% in Southern California, and 1.4% in Seattle. As noted on previous calls, a persistent housing shortage is ongoing in our coastal California markets. ","For several years our theme in Southern California has been for slow and steady recovery from the great recession, which now is picking up steam as market occupancy improvements lead to better pricing power in selected sub markets. For the quarter, this was particularly apparent in Orange and San Diego counties. The typical seasonal slowdown we experienced in the fourth quarter, abated faster than normal this year leading to stronger expectations for the rest of the year, which Mike Dance will review in a moment.","Concern about rental affordability has rekindled rent control proposals in several cities in which we own property. Certain landlords are pushing through renewal increases well in excess of 10% resulting in political pushback with the threat of rent control. Essex follows a voluntary guideline that generally provides our customers with at least one longer-term renewal option at no more than 10% increase.","Now to my second topic merger integration, April 1st was the one year anniversary of the closing of the merger with BRE. Last quarter, we outlined a three phased process for BRE merger integration with most of phase one already completed. We made significant progress implementing the second phase, including the re-launch of the combined corporate, property, and mobile website, a significant increase in renovated apartment homes, 484 this quarter versus 353 in Q4 2014, due to the expansion of redevelopment to the legacy BRE properties. And an approximate 50% increase in resource management initiatives designed to conserve water and energy consumption with the positive financial contribution to the company.","With phase two well underway, we are now focused on completing the planning process for the transformational opportunities to comprise phase three, capturing the benefits of scale and property locational synergies. The goal is to complete that plan this summer with implementation beginning shortly thereafter. Once again, I thank all the E team members for their relentless effort to improve the company.","And finally third topic, investments. In the first quarter, we experienced a sharp increase in stock price with really attractive debt rates, allowing us to improve per share cash flow, NAV, and the growth rate of the portfolio through acquisitions. We used this capital advantage to buy out our partner's ownership interest relating to three Southern California co-investment properties, following our match funding approach.","We also acquired 8th and Hope, a high-rise community in downtown Los Angeles, which was approximately 50% leased upon acquisition and is now 68% leased. More recently, our cost to capital has increased making acquisitions more challenging. Our ability to react quickly to changing market conditions is a key part of our success in our acquisitions program.","The importance of our co-investment program can be demonstrated by the recent buyout of our partner's interest in Reveal Apartments in Southern California. We estimate that the use of the co-investment format upon the purchase of the property in 2011 followed by the recent buyout of our partner resulted in approximately 155,000 fewer Essex common shares issued relative to the pro forma acquisition of 100% ownership in Reveal by Essex in 2011.","Overall transaction volume of properties that meet our criteria is relatively thin, and we are frequently outbid. Anecdotally, broker contacts tell us that they are becoming more active and so transaction activity could increase during this summer. Including the pro rata buyouts of our partner's co-investment interest, we expect to achieve the high end of our acquisitions guidance of 600 million in 2015. Our preference continues to be properties located near public transit throughout our coastal portfolio as well as properties near urban areas of Northern California and the stronger sub markets throughout Southern California.","As noted in the last quarter's call, the limited transaction volumes in institutional quality apartments in the recent past do not support definitive comments about cap rate trends. We spoke last quarter about modest declines in cap rates, our best estimate is that the highest quality property and location trade around 4% cap, while B quality property and locations trade around 4.5% cap rate. Lesser quality property trades at higher cap rates and periodically a trophy property will trade in the high 3% cap rate range.","With respect to development, we continue to make great progress completing and leasing up our development pipeline, detailed in the press release and on page S9 of the supplement. We have three, possibly four projects scheduled to start in 2015. We have seen some moderation in construction costs growth after increasing approximately 10% in 2014.","Before passing the baton to Erik Alexander, I'd like to note that it is with mixed emotions that we announced the retirement of Mike Dance. I thank Mike for his spirit, wisdom, and friendship and I acknowledge his many contributions to the company's success over the past 10 years. Keep an eye out for Mike on the nation's roadways as he promises to spend a considerable amount of time on his bicycle.","I also welcome Angela Kleiman to her new CFO role. Angela has been working alongside Mike for the past year. You'll be hearing from Angela each quarter beginning with our Q3 earnings call. This concludes my comments. Thank you for joining our call today. Now, I'll turn the call over to Erik.","Erik J. Alexander","Thank you, Mike. I'd also like to extend my appreciation to the Essex team for turning in another strong quarter. As Mike pointed out, we exceeded the initial expectations with outperformance in all regions. While occupancy levels remained in line with our plan for most of the sub markets, lower turnover and stronger scheduled rents have set us up for a very good year.","Spurred on by higher than expected job growth, the market conditions in each region remained strong and have allowed us to progress while maintaining occupancy above 96% in all regions. We look for these favorable conditions to continue, while we approach the summer months. As you would expect, market rent levels have moved in line with these strong demand conditions, and we have seen our economic rents increase nearly 6% portfolio-wise since the beginning of the year and more than 9% over last year.","Oakland and the East Bay have seen the largest year-over-year gains in economic rent, but San Jose and San Francisco are a close second. Seattle remains in good shape as well, but we continue to manage assets in the downtown carefully as we work through the peak of new deliveries.","Also encouraging was the sustained improvement in Southern California. This is the second quarter in a row that year-over-year revenue growth has eclipsed 6% and is the 10th consecutive quarter that year-over-year revenue growth has accelerated. Growth in Orange County and San Diego led the way, but I believe we have a lot of upside in Los Angeles.","Once again we expect renewal activity portfolio-wide to support strong revenue results in the coming quarters. Renewal rates for the first quarter were above 6% across the portfolio, and offered rates through June are also north of 6%. We also worked through the over-exposure condition that existed in the BRE portfolio this quarter, and the expiration profile for Essex and BRE is now within 1% of each other for the rest of the year. Earlier this week physical occupancy for the combined portfolio of same-store properties was 96.1% with the net availability of less than 6%.","Now I'll share some highlights for each region beginning with Southern California. Orange County and San Diego were the strongest sub markets this past quarter, thanks to job growth above 3% in both counties. The employment picture continues to improve in Los Angeles, as well, with the unemployment rate decreasing 130 basis points year-over-year. Commercial activity, leasing activity for the broader region has muted in the first quarter and office vacancy rates continue to hover between 13% and 16%.","One of the more significant developments in Southern California was announced this quarter as Broadcom broke ground on a 1.1 million square foot headquarter building in Irvine, with approvals to add another 1 million square feet to this campus. On our last call I laid out some challenges with the BRE portfolio in Southern California that resulted in a revenue gap when compared to Essex. We were able to make strides at some of those under performing assets in the BRE portfolio, and overall leasing activity in the region was strong.","We were also able to work through the additional lease expirations in the BRE portfolio that I referenced earlier, and created a more stable profile going forward. However, this exposure condition did contribute to higher turnover, lower occupancy, and ultimately tempered our rent growth this quarter in the BRE portfolio. The carryover for Essex's successful renovation programs also added to the revenue gap between the portfolios during the first quarter.","However, we believe the performance of the BRE legacy assets will be much more similar as we reduce turnover, expand our renovation efforts, and optimize the use of a single-revenue management system. We are making progress in all of those areas and based on the overall strength of Southern California market, I'm confident that the BRE assets will make a valuable contribution to our revenue growth this year.","Turning to Northern California, the Bay Area continues to post the largest job gains in the portfolio and be the impetus for strong revenue growth. March year-over-year job growth in San Jose and San Francisco was 5.4% and 4.4% respectively. Once again the information in professional and business service sector represented the lion's share of the new jobs created this quarter, with nearly half of the employment growth coming from these high-paying jobs.","Commercial leasing activity was robust during the first quarter and appears to be on pace to match last year's impressive absorption rate. 1.9 million square feet was leased during the first period, with the Silicon Valley accounting for more than 60% of that activity. HCP's co-project at Oceans Point in South San Francisco broke ground this quarter and will add nearly 900,000 square feet of life science office space once completed.","Economic rent levels continue to be strong and are up 8% since the beginning of the year, and there are no areas of weakness on our radar. On a year-over-year basis the economic rents at our same-store properties are up 13%. This is a function of the Bay Area being the most occupied region in the portfolio. Currently the combined portfolio stands at 96.6% occupancy with less than 5.2% availability. Based on these results, we are looking forward to another strong leasing season.","Finally in Seattle, employment growth in this region is also very strong and ahead of our forecast. The information and professional business service sectors accounted for 25% of the job growth while construction represents another 25% of these job gains. After absorbing 2 million square feet of office space in 2014, the first quarter results were actually negative by just over 200,000 square feet. This is largely a function of timing, and we expect to report much more favorable results next quarter. ","Given that companies in the market are actively searching for nearly 4 million square feet of space, we still estimate annual absorption to be around 2 million feet in 2015. Of note, Expedia announced the acquisition of the old Amgen campus in Queen Ann, plans to relocate by 2018. And Facebook will double their footprint and consolidate in to a single building in the Lake Union area of downtown.","New apartment supply is a potential risk to revenue growth this year, and we will have to carefully monitor the new competition this summer. The average absorption rate for the 26 active lease ups in the region was 18 units per month in March. Given the time of the year, I'm encouraged by the strength of demand. Economic rent growth in our portfolio through April has been ahead of our forecast overall and was strongest in the north and south ends of the region. These sub markets are now realizing the benefits of the job growth in CBD Seattle and the East Side. ","Our properties in CBD and on the East Side have seen 5% and 6% economic rent growth respectively on a year-over-year basis, but have only increased modestly since the beginning of this year. As we move in to the peak leasing season with occupancy nearly 96% and availability just over 5%, we expect economic rents to press higher. We are very pleased with the results so far this year, and I think we're set up for a terrific summer. I am confident that property operations will be able to achieve the underlying results that are driving our higher guidance.","Before I turn the call over to Mr. Dance, I would like to congratulate Mike on a successful career, wish him well in retirement, thank him for 10 years of friendship and counsel.","Michael T. Dance","Thanks Erik and Mike for your kind remarks on my retirement. I hope today's outperformance in the Essex stock price is in reaction to our great operating results and not the announcement of my retirement. I appreciate all the congratulatory correspondents from Essex shareholders, the Board, associates, the sale side and REIT peers. ","It has been a privilege to have served as the CFO the past 10 years. For over a year now, Angela and I have been working together on building a strong team that is well prepared to perpetuate the Essex track record. I am also personally committed to assist in a seamless transition of my responsibilities.","I will now comment on the first quarter's results and the changes to the 2015 guidance. Based on higher than expected job growth in all three regions, the Essex first quarter same property portfolio revenue growth is tracking at the high-end of our revenue guidance for the year. As a result of the strong first quarter results, we have increased our full year same property growth rate by 50 basis points at the midpoint, to 7.25% and by 25 basis points for the combined legacy and BRE portfolios for the next three quarters. ","This revised revenue guidance reflects only the first quarter results and we will await for the second quarter leasing activity to occur, before revising guidance to reflect the higher markets rents that we expect to occur if demand continues to outstrip the housing supply. We reported a favorable variance in same property operating expenses resulting in an additional $0.02 per diluted share of FFO in the quarter. The majority of the favorable operating expense variance is timing-related and is expected to increase with the higher resident turnover activity expected in the April through August peak leasing season.","Operating expenses also benefited from levy rates lower than forecasted on our Seattle properties. This favorable property tax expense variance resulted in a reduction to the legacy Essex same property guidance by 25 basis points at the midpoint for the full year. We have not decreased the operating expense guidance for the combined BRE and Essex same property portfolio due to the uncertainty of future supplemental property tax assessments related to the legacy BRE California portfolio.","We also reported core FFO in the first quarter of $2.29 per diluted share and have provided second quarter guidance for core FFO of $2.31 per diluted share at the midpoint of our range. The $0.02 net increase at the midpoint projects sequential growth in the consolidated and co-investment net operating income of approximately $7 million as a result of expected rent growth in the same property portfolio, accelerating lease up activity at the communities recently completed, and the acquisition of the three stabilized communities acquired from our co-investment partners. The 8th and Hope acquisition will be dilutive in the second quarter as it was only 50% occupied at the end of March and will not reach stabilization until the third quarter.","In summary, the $0.10 per share growth expected from the sequential increase in net operating income will be offset by $0.07 per share related to the cost of capital required to fund the external growth, which includes the additional interest expense related to the $500 million bond offering that closed in mid March and a $0.01 per share increase in general and administrative expense expected in the second quarter as we continue to fill open corporate positions.","In closing, a quick highlight on delivering the debt to EBITDA ratio we outlined in the merger financing plan. To fund the cash consideration of the 2014 merger with BRE, we contributed nearly $900 million of unencumbered assets through 50\/50 joint ventures, which increased the company's debt to EBITDA to 7.4 times. A year later as a result of stabilizing the legacy BRE development pipeline and growing net operating income, the ratio has improved by 1 full turn and now stands at 6.4 times. I will now turn the call back over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And we will take our first question from Nick Joseph with Citigroup.","Nicholas Joseph","Thanks, you acquired the two land parcels in the quarter, I think to deliver in 2017 and 2018. So I'm wondering if you could talk about the role of development at this point in the cycle and your appetite to continue to back fill the pipeline?","Michael J. Schall","Hi, Nick it is Mike Schall and John Eudy is also here. He may have a comment. We continue to be interested in development and as I noted we have three, possibly four starts this year. We did not believe that the parcels that we sold for future development sites met our criteria in terms of going in yield or expected yields. And there was some complications in terms of the entitlement process and so we decided to sell them. So I wouldn't view that as indicative of our overall appetite for development. I've commented on previous calls that as we go through the cycle, and now our view is we're mid cycle plus. We will de-emphasize development at some point and obviously we don't know when the end of the cycle will occur. So we'll never exit development, but we will slow it down as we perceive that we're closer to the top of the cycle.","Nicholas Joseph","Thanks. Then you mentioned an increase in potential rent control initiatives, where are you seeing this push and if it actually comes to fruition, what's the process and timing of the actual implementation?","Michael J. Schall","That's a good question. I don't have the specifics. I think it will vary from location to location. And we're talking about at this point cities and local jurisdictions taking on this rent control issue. Obviously, they're concerned about the affordability of the rental stock within their communities and the ability of people to live and work within the same community. And with all the rent growth we've had it's obvious some of those issues are going to become more extreme.","During this last quarter there was one specific city that was threatening a rent control ordinance, but negotiated with the major owners and ultimately concluded that if the major owners would agree to a 10% cap on renewal rents, and as you know we give out a variety of renewal options. So in our case we try to give longer-term renewal option subject to a 10% cap, and as long as we're willing to do that and commit to that, which we have done, that they would not pursue the rent control ordinance. ","So there is an ongoing process here. We're also very active with the California Apartment Associations, when some of these really egregious rent renewal are given out, not by us but by anyone in the marketplace. We tried to be active in helping CAA mediate and work with them to try to make sure that the market pulls itself to the extent it can.","Nicholas Joseph","Just quickly, in terms of that example you just gave, what was the ordinance the city was talking about, what was the rent cap that they were going to present?","Michael J. Schall","It was much lower. I don't think that there was a specific number at this point in time. So, again this is the nature of the beast, to the extent that they feel that affordability within the city is being affected to a great extent. They will use this as leverage to try to moderate rent bumps on existing residents. So, I think it's an example of how the local jurisdictions are reacting to the large rent increases or large market rent growth within these marketplaces. And we see it everywhere, we see -- there was some discussion in Seattle and a variety of Bay Area cities and even in Southern California so, again we see it throughout our portfolio.","Nicholas Joseph","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you and we will take our next question from Ian Weissman with Credit Suisse. ","Unidentified Analyst","Hi guys, this is Chris for Ian. Congrats on a great quarter. If you were to think about changes in rent growth forecast for the course of 2015, would it be fair to broadly assume that moderate deceleration in Seattle, maybe a little bit of acceleration in Southern California and then steady in Northern California and then I guess secondly, what markets do you see the biggest moves in 2015 on the upside and the down side?","Michael J. Schall","Okay Chris, this is Mike Schall. Good question. Erik may have a follow up. If you go back to S14, I think it does a good job of outlining the apparent issue. If for example Los Angeles has 84,000 jobs being produced in 2015 and we assume that 2 to 1 ratio of jobs to household, that's 42,000 households. And the total supply, that's multi-family and for sale is 16,000. So, basically demand exceeds supply by 2.5 to 1 ratio, if you believe these numbers. And the only one that's even reasonably close is Seattle.","And I guess I would pose the question back, because from our perspective these conditions are ideal for the company because if you're producing less than 1% of stock in these markets that had very substantial revenue growth, it's unclear where that net excess demand is going to go, and that's what's pushing rents higher and it's pushing for sale housing prices higher. It is a great scenario for apartments and for apartment owners and property owners within the markets that we're in.","And I agree with you, Seattle is the one question mark. It's a relatively small part of our portfolio and we're somewhat concerned about it. But having said that it looks like we're going to have strong revenue growth for the foreseeable future. I don't know how long that's going to last.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great, makes sense. Then following up on Nick's question on those large land acquisitions you made in the first quarter, is it too early to talk about stabilized yields for those projects? And then, I guess you also commented that you are de-emphasizing development in this stage of the cycle, but it looks like you have one of the largest capital budgets at share about $1.3 billion. Would it be fair to assume that you're going to sell off one of the projects to a JV partner, are you going to be looking for the Station Park Green, a partner for that one?","Michael J. Schall","Let me comment on both of those. We did joint venture, the high rise in San Francisco near the Transbay Center, and we did that because it's a 42 storey high rise. High rises have, I think, a greater risk profile from the perspective of it takes you a few years to build them and then you have a vacant building that you have to fill up. And so a lot can happen within that period of time. And as a risk mitigation strategy, we thought it made sense to bring in a partner in that context. Having said that, we still believe that it met our basic underwriting criteria of cap rate today, based on market rents now of somewhere in the low 5% range. And we would certainly expect that to grow to somewhere in the 6% to 6.5% range by stabilization or maybe a little bit higher on that one because the construction process is longer. ","As it relates to Station Park Green, that is a different product. It's actually a four phase project and therefore that phasing allows greater flexibility with respect to how we manage through the process if conditions change. And therefore I think we're less likely to seek a joint venture partner on that, but we have not finalized that decision at this point.","Unidentified Analyst","That's great. Thank you very much.","Operator","We will take our next question from Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital. ","Austin Wurschmidt","Hi guys, its Austin Wurschmidt here with Jordan. Erik, I was just a little bit curious on your comments, you mentioned that there's lots of upside potential in LA. So I was just curious what gives you the confidence or what are you seeing on the ground there?","Erik J. Alexander","I think that the leasing activity at some of the properties, in West Hollywood for example, and the activities downtown give us confidence that things were going to heat up there. Downtown has become much more attractive place to go, and we're actually seeing people moving from some of the other areas around downtown to be downtown and we just haven't seen that before. The West Side continues to be strong, so the Marina Del Ray, the Playa Vista where we have properties there. We're encouraged. We've seen 8% to 9% increase in economic rent growth since the beginning of the year in those locations. And as we said earlier, Orange County and San Diego have done better than expected out of the gate. If you look at where our forecast was, we thought for the year that LA was going to lead the pack, and in the first quarter San Diego and Orange County are. Since those are really pressured by supply, if we get that kind of job growth going forward there's no reason that we can't continue growing revenue there. So, I've just encouraged overall and I don't see why virtually all the properties shouldn't share in that better market condition.","Austin Wurschmidt","Thanks for the color there. Then just, Mike, in terms of mentioning earlier about the cost of capital increase, you guys were pretty active on the investment front. But given your comments on competition and what you're seeing, I mean do you expect that the investments will be more second half loaded given the slowdown in the pipeline?","Michael J. Schall","We do have a couple of deals that we're looking at now and one of them is in contract. And so, I think that it will be fairly equally balanced. There's a little bit of uncertainty as to what is going to come out this summer in terms of product. Again it's been fairly thin at this point in time, but I would hope that we will be pretty close to the $600 million by late summer. That would be my expectation. Then it will probably slow down again as you go in to the more seasonal period of time in the late third and fourth quarter.","Austin Wurschmidt","In what markets are you seeing the best opportunities today?","Michael J. Schall","Well, I think the only market that we remain somewhat concerned with is the Seattle market. Northern California and Southern California has again given supply\/demand relationships, both look very strong to us, and so we'll focus there. Southern California, the absolute rent level is lower than Northern California and over a long period of time that relationship is, rents are a little bit higher in Northern California than they typically are in a relative basis to Southern California. That's if you look at for example, rent to median income statistics, Northern California is above not by a tremendous amount, but above the long-term historical average. Where, Southern California tends to be slightly below the long-term historical average. So we think that even though the economy is certainly better in Northern California, Southern California has more affordability, and therefore we're interested in both geographies.","Austin Wurschmidt","Great, thanks for the time.","Michael J. Schall","Thanks. ","Operator","Thank you. We will take our next question from Rob Stevenson with Janney.","Robert Stevenson","Good day guys. Erik, did I hear you say that renewals were up 6% and if so, does that basically imply with the 8% on rental rate growth that new leases were up 10% in the quarter?","Erik J. Alexander","New leases were in the 9% range, so yes, it's pretty close. And I think that renewals going forward are going to be in the high sixes. April came in higher than the first quarter, so it's moving in the right direction.","Robert Stevenson","Okay. Does that consciously have you guys thinking about driving more turnover to take advantage of the higher new lease rate than the renewals? Or are you worried, or is that sort of feedback in to Mike's comments about rent control that has you worried about doing that too much?","Erik J. Alexander","Yes, I think a little of what you said there but again we like the low turnover equation. More of that occurs in the second quarter in the summer anyway and so when you have that availability tied down, it does allow for upward growth on the new rent side which we would rather capture it there.","Robert Stevenson","Okay. And then what is the current -- what are you sort of tracking at the current opportunity between the legacy Essex portfolio as well as the BRE portfolio in terms of redevelopment, I think Mike said it is 484 units that you guys did in the first quarter, I mean, what are you expecting in the back half of this year and what sort of a run rate going in to 2016?","Michael J. Schall","Yes, so we expected with the addition of the legacy BRE assets through the redevelopment program we've increased about 50% the number of units subject to redevelopment. And I think our target for the total year is around 2,100 to 2,200 units. So there will be a modest acceleration relative to what we did in the first quarter.","Robert Stevenson","Okay and then just lastly, is the same store portfolio -- is BRE going in there because of the April 1st close or are you guys at January 1 same store portfolio?","Michael T. Dance","Well -- generally speaking, we're a January 1, but given the magnitude of the merger we will bring in the BRE portfolio in the second quarter. So the second quarter same store comparison will be a combined versus a combined, but then the year-to-date will be an Essex only. So, we'll have two different unit accounts for the year-to-date versus quarter-over-quarter.","Robert Stevenson","Okay, given how that's tracking, how the difference between the BRE portfolio and you still have some stuff that you're correcting there, is that going to cause any sort of abnormality when we look at first quarter versus second quarter, just thinking about our run rate, is that going to wind up having the combined company lower in the second quarter than what we'd otherwise see?","Michael J. Schall","I think that's spelled out in the guidance. If you go back to last quarter's guidance, you see a slight moderation in growth because of that. But again it's tracking very favorably, so I would go back to the guidance we provided last quarter that shows the moderation that occurs by combining the two portfolios.","Robert Stevenson","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","We will take our next question from Jana Galan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jana Galan","Thank you. I was wondering if you could comment on the five assets in lease up in terms of what's the pace of lease up, are there any concessions at all out there, and kind of how does this compare to a normal healthy lease up that you see?","Erik J. Alexander","This is Erik. The lease ups are tracking very favorably. The one that we're paying attention to the closest is because it's new, is the One South Market asset that's about to have its first occupancy this month. We've already leased I think as of today 50 units, a little bit more even since yesterday. So, that's a really healthy absorption before we get started there. In the projects in San Francisco, Mosso and MB360 are coming up on stabilization, so their absorption was a little bit slower over the quarter but well within expectations. As you come towards the end, the Emeryville project has been clipping along at 9 to 10 leases a week and so we're just thrilled with that.","From a concession standpoint, we probably have anywhere from zero concessions for the first 30 leases at One South Market, I think were done with no concessions on 24 of those and a half to one month on certain floor plans. So again that is an expectation there. And then at the other properties it would be four to six weeks on some of the floor plans. Pretty consistent with what's going on in the markets to get 25 plus leases per month.","Jana Galan","Thank you, Erik.","Operator","We will take our next question from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.","John Kim","Thank you and good morning. I wanted to ask a follow-up on your assessment that your cost of capital is increasing. Your cost of debt is the same, your stock prices have performed well this year, so can you just clarify what you meant by this comment?","Michael J. Schall","Sure, it's Mike Schall speaking again. I think the stock went over $240 earlier this year and there was a pretty significant rally in the 10 year treasury as well. And so we have tried to match fund our acquisitions. And again, what we try to accomplish is capture the arbitrage between our blended cost of funds and the cap rate on the asset, trying to hold portfolio of quality constant, and try to improve the growth rate at the same point.","So, at that particular point with the stock trading at $240 and the 10 year, I think it got down to like $170 or something like that was a -- I don't think it's ever been better in my 30 years, almost 30 years here. So, that was an extraordinary period of time. And then we tried to execute match fund transactions against that and again try to capture the arbitrage. So, every quarter that goes by that we're generating somewhere around 10% to 15% core FFO growth was against the cost of capital because you have greater cash flow coming out of the existing portfolio.","Again, multiples are declining from that force and from the stock price moderation and from interest rates increasing, still attractive, but increasing. So, again as it relates to acquisition development is different, but as it relates to acquisition we're looking at that, whether there is arbitrage and trying to capture at a favorable moment.","John Kim","Got it, okay. And then right now your stock price is trading at an AFFO yield of about 4% and a pretty significant premium to consensus NAV. Can you just remind us what metric you look at in terms of utilizing equity for acquisitions?","Michael J. Schall","Sure. We follow a fairly standard program looking at the impact of NAV and core FFO. Core FFO on a per-share basis, what is the impact of the acquisition. And again, we're looking for some sort of arbitrage between those two numbers or else all things being equal, if there's zero arbitrage in those numbers and we're generally not inclined to do another acquisition. And more recently we've seen that arbitrage somewhere between 25 and 50 basis points. And again, when our stock rallies and debt rallies if we get closer to that 50 basis point type of number, and then of course we're interested in growth rates. So, we want any acquisition that we make to outgrow the average growth rate of the portfolio. So, we have a progress that we've developed internally that measured each of those things and if we can add value on the acquisition side, we do. If we can't, then we will pass.","John Kim","Speaking of market movements, there's been a correction in some of the major tech company stock prices, have you observed in the past a correlation between asking rents in Northern California and the way that some of these tech companies trade?","Michael J. Schall","I think on the margin, there is not a great deal of impact. If there's a shock to the system and\/or something happens that's more pervasive, then absolutely we see an impact. When the internet boom of the late 1990s and early 2000 ended and the companies that were consuming huge chunks of cash had no access to capital, that obviously had a tremendous impact on hiring within the valley went negative by I think somewhere around 10% in Silicon Valley. But on the margin, we're not anywhere close to that type of scenario. And I don't think that they're all that sensitive to stock price as it relates to growing their business. Most of these businesses especially the social media businesses and a lot of the other businesses are very well financed and are not reliant on stock issuance in order to grow.","John Kim","Great, thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander Goldfarb","Good morning and Mike we will definitely miss your conservative guidance.","Michael J. Schall","Hey you know what Alex, I think Mike taught Angela well.","Alexander Goldfarb","Then that means that the guidance will be even more conservative going forward. So, along those lines Mike D, it sounded like in your comments that you're anticipating bringing further boosting 2015 guidance, I mean, assuming that the market doesn't suddenly crack here, rents are very strong. So if that was the correct interpretation we should expect numbers to come up further when you guys report second quarter?","Michael T. Dance","Basically, all we've done is change our guidance to reflect the results already achieved. So basically bringing in our budgets to the scheduled rents and the occupancies we have today and moving it forward. We haven't gone back and revised market rents to reflect this demand\/supply imbalance that Mike mentioned and Erik mentioned in their remarks, that we're seeing more jobs coming in than supply. So that imbalance continues. Yes, your comments are -- you understood me correctly.","Michael J. Schall","Hey Alex, you recognize the irony in your question because you accuse him of being a sand bagger and then you ask him if he's going to raise guidance.","Alexander Goldfarb","Well, maybe in his waning moments he's feeling weak as he is heading out the door. The next question is, as you guys look at the Bay Area and obviously visiting out there you can see it firsthand, the amount of growth and also people starting to spill more in to East Bay. Are you guys more inclined to invest further away from San Francisco to get acceptable returns or your view is that when the cycle does correct, those further away areas are going to collapse more and therefore you'd still rather pay up a lot more to be either in the Peninsula or hugging the East Bay Coast versus going out further East?","Michael J. Schall","Yes Alex, this is Mike. One of the strategic limitations that we place upon ourselves is commute patterns because people in general are willing to commute a certain distance from their jobs and trust me, commutes have become much worse out here than I think they've ever been in my career. And we think that limitation is somewhere around a half hour, a half hour commute for a renter. We realize that homeowners will commute longer distances to be sure probably typically an hour. And so that limitation and the increased traffic has meant that to get to your job, the jobs are very concentrated in certain places. To get to your jobs is more challenging than ever. And so we think that the high density residential alternative, be it the condos or apartments is going to be the overwhelming preference of the cities in order to meet the housing need within the area. Interestingly, this last quarter there was a single family development proposal that was at least put off and maybe canceled because of water use. Because single family residential homes consume more water than condos and apartments do.","So again, I've commented previously on the impact of AB32 and SB375. These are California's global warming initiatives which have the effect of trying to become much more resource oriented and resource and conservation of resource oriented. And I think that has a bearing on where housing is going to be located so, hence our preference for transit oriented sites and areas that are fairly close to the urban cores or the job centers.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from Dan Oppenheim with Zelman and Associates.","Daniel Oppenheim","Thanks very much. Mike, given those comments in terms of the locations and the scarcity of properties on the market right now, what do you think about the communities in Riverside and Chino right now, could those potentially be up for sale, would you think about that given the focus in terms of the more core locations?","Michael J. Schall","Dan, that's a good question. I think the plan will be to continue what we've done over the last several years. We will be selling the non-core assets, which certainly Riverside would be included in at the appropriate time. And try to cull the portfolio, we're not in any particular hurry. We think the portfolio is as good as it has ever been and therefore we're happy with the portfolio. But if we see opportunities to dispose of those secondary locations, yes, we're going to do that.","Daniel Oppenheim","Got it and then in terms of the 10% supposed be longer-term leases, I guess what are you seeing in terms of the renewals on that. I imagine that tenants aren't exactly thrilled saying, oh, gee 10% for an even longer-time, I'll sign up for that right away. But do you think that is something that can reduce the turnover even further, and do you think it would benefit from that where it does, you keep the tenants longer versus just ending up getting a little bit in the way of less rent for that?","Michael J. Schall","Yes Dan, it's actually we've had that 10% or some type of renewal cap in place for some period of time. And so it really isn't anything new. And part of the reason why we do it, is it sets up a great discussion with your resident because yes, you're right they don't like a 10% renewal increase. However, the next step in that conversation is, hey, go out and look at the other properties in the area, and we think that you'll come back and conclude this is a rental value, a good rental value and we think we will keep you as a result of that. And so I think it does act as a reward for being an Essex customer which is important to us. And at the same time thought there are these benefits that you don't really see, which are lower vacancy, lower turnover cost. And if you have X amount of traffic coming in the front door, you now have fewer units to lease to that fixed amount of traffic, and obviously it can push rents on the -- for the people that are coming in off the street a little bit harder. So, I think it actually works really well and we've had great success with it over several years and we're happy with it. We think it's a great program.","Daniel Oppenheim","Great, thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from Haendel St. Juste with Morgan Stanley.","Haendel St. Juste","Hey out there, thanks for taking my questions. First, Mr. Dance best wishes on your next endeavors. You'll be missed. But I guess a bit of upside here is that there will be less confusion on these calls going forward when someone simply directs a question to Mike.","Michael T. Dance","Thanks, Haendel.","Haendel St. Juste","Question for you Mister well I guess, Mike Schall, a question on capital allocation and a bit of a twist on an earlier question. Help me understand a bit better the decision to acquire assets in LA while developing assets in San Francisco given how far along the San Francisco recovery is and what is still a relatively nascent but sustained recovery in Southern California as you guys described it? Do your recent capital allocation decisions in the region reflect what you believe are the best available returns or opportunities today, and then how do LA acquisition IRRs compare to development IRRs in San Francisco today, and when can we expect to see more South California development starts?","Michael J. Schall","Okay, you may need to remind me of some pieces of that question, because that was one of those multi-faceted ones. But I think what we said was that we like both, and I don't know when Northern California is going to turn again. If you just look at the basic numbers, if Southern California generates 2.5% job growth and Northern California is closer to 3.5% that means the demand is stronger, the supply is not all that different, of total housing I'm talking about, between the two markets. And so you'd say the stronger overall supply\/demand imbalance still favors Northern California.","However, as I said earlier the absolute coupon, the rent levels are higher in Northern California relative to Southern California. So, I don't know how to handicap which exactly is better. I can say that we like both and I think both will lead the nation in terms of the overall results over the foreseeable future. And I know that, I just saw some Axiometrics data that seemed to come to a similar type of conclusion, and so I don't know.","As to development versus acquisition, that's more a function of the deals that we see and where they're located and whether we like them. And John Eudy is here, he may have a comment on that and what he's seeing in terms of deal flow. But generally speaking, I think both Northern California and Southern California are going to be leading metros for some period of time. John, do you have any comment on deal flow?","John D. Eudy","In Northern California, just to comment on the two starts that we've just announced recently, both of those were negotiated and started entitlements in 2011 and 2012 respectively. So, we had some wind at our back on our land basis in the exact locations [ph] on the entitlements that would be tough to match if we were out trying to compete for the same sites today, puts us in a better start position. In terms of the going-in yield, we think they're in the low 5% cap rate obviously. And if the land was higher and the exactions were greater, that would change. So, I think on the margin it's tougher and tougher to do deals in Northern California than it has been ever and given the fact of where we are in the cycle.","When you go to Southern California, the problem on the development side is the acquisitions that we've done are at or below replacement cost as a general rule. So, any time you can do that why go through the brain damage of developing unless you can find the right site with the right metrics to make it work. So that's a challenge we have down there. We haven't seen the rent move that we've seen up here and granted it's coming, but the velocity isn't where we think that it's a slam dunk to find development deals.","Haendel St. Juste","How does the math go for the IRRs for acquisitions in LA compared to perhaps the developments in San Francisco?","Michael J. Schall","The IRRs, the typical acquisition IRR which again let's go back to basic strategy, if we're buying on balance sheet, we are really more focused on the impacts to NAV per share, core FFO per share, and the growth rate of the portfolio. In the co-investment world we're more focused on IRRs. But I think generally speaking the IRRs on the typical acquisition are somewhere in the 7% to 8% range, and the development IRRs are in the 9% to 10% range un-levered.","Haendel St. Juste","Got you, appreciate that. And sorry if I missed it earlier, but did you explain your concern on the Seattle market. I assume it's a function of the supply that's predicted to hit Belleview [ph] over the next year or two. And if that's right, can we perhaps see you cull some of your exposure there and maybe reallocate it to another region like maybe South California?","Michael J. Schall","It's a good question, Haendel and we're debating it at this point in time. I note that less than 19% of our revenue is coming from Seattle. So it's not a huge amount. We are looking at the possibility of culling parts of that portfolio. I want to be clear, I don't see a problem per se up there because the jobs growth has been so good. The issue is if there's something broader that happens more broadly to the U.S, economy, which could be geopolitical or international in scope or whatever, that has an effect on the economies around the world, if you have a couple percent job growth -- couple of percent supply growth in that environment, you could find yourself over supplied relatively quickly. So that's the risk that we're focused on. But I think things look good. Based on the numbers that we have in terms of job growth, relative to supply, I think Seattle is still fine.","Haendel St. Juste","Great, thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Drew Babin with Robert W. Baird and Company.","Drew Babin","Thanks for taking my question. As you're out there looking around for acquisitions and competing in the market, are there any new players that you're running in to or any private equity or international money coming in and looking at the space, is there a preference for location or it is in a store you go to the brightest, shiniest assets?","Michael J. Schall","Drew, that's a good question. We have plenty of competition from all the above. From some foreign investment, which I'm hoping a strong dollar might lessen that. But we haven't seen that thus far. And other REITs provide plenty of competition, private equity is in the mix. But everyone has their own little template that they like and that they're pursuing. And so you see a variety of different requirements or mandates out there with respects to the types of property, newer versus value add and locational differences. Some investors we've seen recently are really trying to focus on yield, so they're willing to go to an area that maybe not be in the CBD for example, or an urban area. Maybe go a little bit further out in order to get 25 or 50 basis points higher cap rate. So, again I think it varies from investor to investor. But I'd also say that we're not seeing that many transactions out there, so the transactions that come out tend to be aggressively bid.","And right now there's quite a few merchant built properties that are being delivered and will be sold in several of our sub markets. There's also a demand for value add. In our discussion about value add, it seems like so much of the benefit of the value add is already being priced in. It's difficult for us to make those deals work. And so you see a variety of things, but the bottom line is a relative dearth of well located property and plenty of capital chase event.","Drew Babin","And does that kind of get you in a position or I guess I should say how close are you to being in a position where it might make sense to start selling some assets that you would consider more at the right price?","Michael J. Schall","And again we will cull the portfolio but what I said about acquisitions a few minutes ago, that they're accretive to NAV cash flow and growth rate to make that work in reverse, because at disposition you need somewhere to put the money. And having, it is funny most of my career the option of leaving money in a money market account or in short-term bond was not that painful. It's obviously incredibly painful now because money -- interest on money is 20 basis points or something like that. So you don't have that option. And acquisitions are still working, so that would imply that broad based disposition probably is not going to be part of our plan until those forces change.","Drew Babin","Okay, thank you very much.","Michael J. Schall","Thanks. ","Operator","We will take our next question from Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities.","Richard Anderson","Thanks. And Mike, I hope you dance in your retirement like no one's watching.","Michael T. Dance","Thank you. I am a pretty ugly dancer.","Richard Anderson","I just crafted that one just now, by the way. I just have one quick question for maybe Mike Schall or whomever. But I can recall many years ago, I don't even remember when, when your company was underperforming, your peers and I don't know about dramatic fashion, but certainly meaningful, and you had a situation with the State of California, obviously, driving that unemployment up. But what is it that could happen here, is that situation in any way, shape, or form repeatable in your mind in the foreseeable future as it relates to you relative to the rest of the country?","Michael J. Schall","Well, that's a good question. I'm hoping someone around the table here has a crystal ball because I don't have it. Rich, I would say that things look as good from a supply\/demand standpoint and in terms of what the State is looking to accomplish as it relates to housing in terms of higher densities, more urbanization, public transits, getting people out of their cars, and reducing the impact on commutes. I mean all of those things are incredibly positive for us. So I think\u2026","Richard Anderson","I'm just trying to create a road map of where it could go wrong?","Michael J. Schall","Yeah I felt so, it has gone wrong before, so that was my next point. One thing that's certain about the world is it will change. And people -- businesses make good decisions. In the late 1990s when Northern California became very expensive, you saw movement of businesses and back office operations, pieces of businesses to Southern California, and it was the beneficiary of the tech boom in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The tech community is, I would say, sensitive to broader economic conditions and Northern California from my mind is a more -- there's more volatility, but at a higher overall growth rate. Northern California generates the highest CAGR of rent growth over a long period of time as compared to any of our other markets. But there's more bouncing around, more volatility within that number. So, housing is very economically sensitive and to the extent you've got large supply pipelines that are undelivered, it becomes even more sensitive. We saw that in the last cycle in Seattle where we had 3% supply that went to jobs declined, something like 10% and that 3% supply hit the marketplace and decimated rents in that marketplace.","So those are the types of things that we're concerned about. That enters in to our thinking though, and we try to react to it. People ask us, why do you joint venture your development pipeline and part of the reason for that is that we commit to a cap rate on day one and we don't know what the yield is and we don't know what our cost to capital is until the deal is finished. And therefore it exposes us during that period that we're building it and leasing it up to the forces that could change in the marketplace. So, we tried to -- part of the reason why our balance sheet remains at a very conservative level. So we try to build the model of the business and react to some of the forces that you're talking about in a thoughtful way. So that over the long haul we outperform. But, I would say that the answer to your question is dislocation in the economy will affect us and affect everyone at the same time.","Richard Anderson","Right, okay. Thanks.","Operator","We will take our next question from Dave Bragg with Green Street Advisors.","Dave Bragg","Thank you, good morning. Mike Dance, congrats and thanks for the update on your leverage progress earlier. Can you just review where you stand today relative to your long-term targets?","Michael T. Dance","We're about 6.5 times turns with the growth that we continue to see in the sequential NOI and the continued success in leasing up the co-investments, it could be low sixes by the end of the year and continuing in to the high fives next year. So, basically to Mike's point, preparing for the times when things may change and we don't have that luxury, so I think continuing to build up that capacity for the rainy day is where we're headed.","Dave Bragg","And that leads to the next question. Essex was uniquely active during 2009 and 2010. I might be wrong, but I think your leverage in 2006 and 2007 is pretty comparable to where it is today. What would you say is the reason why you didn't do even more during that time, were you capital constrained or opportunity constrained?","Michael J. Schall","I remember it vividly. It's because the world was coming to an end remember that Dave? Or the fear was -- exactly, it was a very uncomfortable time to make big commitments because no one knew where the bottom was. And so I think that was the driving force that we were trying to focus on, let's maintain the dividend. Let's do a thoughtful job of operating the portfolio and let's not make any big bets in a very uncertain time.","Dave Bragg","And given that to what extent do you debate internally the idea of taking leverage even lower than those targets that you just walked through?","Michael J. Schall","We have discussions about the 100 year flood, and how well -- and we did pretty well during that period of time. Obviously, the stock didn't do well, but we raised the dividend very marginally each year and we paid the dividend in cash every year. So, we think the model for our balance sheet has been pretty well tested in the 100 year flood and it has done pretty well. So, that factors in to our thinking. So obviously, everyone wants to deleverage at the top of the cycle. No one has certainty with respect to where that is. But we are debating it and we're trying to get that right. We still think that we have at least a couple and maybe more pretty darn good years ahead of us given the supply\/demand relationship. And so hopefully our hope is that we continue to just naturally deliver via growth and we end up somewhere in the fives.","Michael T. Dance","This is Mike Dance. The other change that we've made dramatic improvements on since the last recession, is most of our assets were encumbered, and so the ability to sell those assets was limited. And if that were to reoccur, we're in a much better position to sell assets and use those proceeds to buy back stock. So that's the other motivation for continuing to delever as we are in these good times.","Dave Bragg","Thanks for that, that's very interesting. And then the next question just rewinds the clock even further, back in 2005 and 2006, Essex pursued several mid-Atlantic portfolios and most notably the Town and Country portfolio and at the time you talked about your views that DC was quite like California and Baltimore was quite like Seattle over the long term, do you retain those long-term views that clearly hasn't played out over the last 10 years, your markets have done much better but what's your long-term thinking on that?","Michael J. Schall","We do believe that there are certain East Coast markets that are similar to the West Coast markets. I think the thing that's changed though since then is there are already four companies that are bi-coastal in nature, and we are the only ones that have this particular and I think very appealing piece of geography. So, I think the uniqueness in this case makes us favor a West Coast centric company. And I think that we've gotten pretty good credit for being the local sharp shooter out there, and I think that adds some value. And so, we're happy where we are, Dave.","Dave Bragg","Okay, thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from Tom Lesnick with Capital One Securities.","Tom Lesnick","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. First, I guess with so many jobs coming from the tech industry and VC funded start ups, employees are often compensated not just with salary but with equity as well. So, I guess in the context of that, how are you guys thinking about equity comp and how close we are to approaching an upper limit or so to speak, on what people are willing and\/or able to pay in rent? Are you factoring equity comp into your rent income analysis or just base salaries?","Michael J. Schall","No, it's mostly base salaries. If you look at the base salaries in San Francisco and throughout the West Coast, I think they're high. And one of the things that's a little bit different about our markets is that personal income growth is pretty substantial. And I think that there's some fives and sixes in personal income growth and I have a chart here. 2015 personal income growth I think that San Jose is the leader at 6.2% and a lot of fives throughout our West Coast portfolio. So if we're growing rents at 7% and income levels are growing at 5% to 6.5% it's not really pushing that rent to median income level to a great extent. So we still feel pretty good about it.","Anecdotally, I was talking to a young 26 year old professional that was renting with a couple roommates a place near the beach in Southern California and paying $3,300. And I said, how do you think about that $3,300, which to me is like the king's ransom in rent, but she thought, you know, that seems pretty good deal. So, I think we forget that each generation reprices and as long as the relationships are okay. So I think because we are in high income areas that the pushback from rent, which there certainly is some, but I think it's manageable.","Tom Lesnick","Alright, thanks. And then my second question following on that, I guess historically, when liquidity events have picked up pace, did you see any correlation to move out to purchase a home, did the realization of the equity create influence renter behavior in that regard?","Michael J. Schall","It's hard to tie it exactly to that. We hit an all time high, move out to buy homes in 2008, which you would expect before the crash. That was something like 17% or 18% and an all time low in 2009, that was about 7%. The recent trends have been a little bit below the long-term average which is 11% to 12%. I think the last quarter we said it was 9.8%, we move out to buy a home. So, we're not seeing a big move out push to buy homes at this point in time. But again, as I've commented on prior calls, there is a very limited supply of for sale housing and that is having a great deal of impact on the overall housing supplies within our markets, and it's helping us a lot.","Tom Lesnick","Thanks.","Operator","And we will take our final question from Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, this is George on for Tayo. I guess first off Mike Dance, congrats on the retirement and enjoy the bike riding.","Michael T. Dance","Thank you.","Unidentified Analyst","I guess my questions, in terms of your JVs, you're continuing to do JVs on the development side and you're buying out some JV interests. Just overall, what are you seeing from current and potential JV partners in terms of doing anymore potential JV buy outs and then also sort of interest from the JV partners to do more investments and then just additionally, are JV partners having interest to go in to other markets where you guys currently are not present, where you might be influenced to go into a new market because a JV partner would like to allocate capital there?","Michael J. Schall","Yes, this is Mike answering this question. Generally speaking we're in the markets that we want to be in and we would not enter a new market because there was financing from a JV partner. In general, we're 50%, around 50% of these ventures. And we believe that the co-investment option is important to us because there are certain times where if our cost to capital changes and stock price goes down and debt rates go up, it may be more advantageous to use a joint venture to buy a property when we can't make it work on balance sheets. So, it is really a diversification program with respect to having different capital options so that we can optimize the opportunities that we see. So, generally speaking that's how we view it. When, as I mentioned on the call, our stock price rallies very nicely and debt rallies as well, we see opportunities to potentially buy out some partners. We're less excited about that today than we were earlier in the first quarter, and so I think that's less likely. But I think it's still the on balance sheet cost to capital is marginally better than the co-investment capital in terms of just the overall cost to capital equation. So, we'd probably prefer to execute on balance sheet still.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, thanks. It's a long call, so I'll leave it there.","Michael J. Schall","Very good.","Operator","That concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Schall, at this time I will turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.","Michael J. Schall","Okay, very good, thank you operator. I guess in closing, I just want to note that we appreciate your participation on the call. Obviously, we're very pleased with what's going on out here and the results last quarter and our outlook ahead. And we look forward to seeing many of you at NAREIT next month.

Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs, as well as information available to the company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found in the company's filings with the SEC.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you, sir. You may begin.","Michael J. Schall","Thank you, Dan. And welcome, everyone, to our third quarter 2012 earnings call. Before we begin, I would like to acknowledge the tragic impact of Hurricane Sandy, our hearts and prayers go to our friends and colleagues that have been affected by the storm.","With that said, I'll begin by noting that Erik Alexander and Mike Dance will follow me with brief comments, John Eudy, John Burkart and John Lopez are here for Q&A. I'll cover the following topics on the call: number one, Q3 results and market commentary; number two, investment markets; and number three, an and update on what's happening in the State of California.","So the first topic, Q3 results and market commentary.","We are very pleased to announce another strong quarter in which we reported core FFO of $1.71 per share for Q3 2012. That result was $0.02 ahead of the midpoint of the guidance range announced in connection with our Q2 call. This positive variance would have been $0.02 per share higher if we did not accelerate the timing of our $300 million debut public unsecured bond deal, which led to higher interest costs versus forecast. We continue to see strong growth in Northern California and Seattle, and improving conditions with pockets of strength in Southern California. Same property revenues improved once again, to a 7.2% increase over Q3 2011, which was the best year-over-year growth in the last 20 quarters. These results lead us to reiterate our expectation for strong conditions for the remainder of 2012 and continuing in 2013, driven by growing, but still limited supplies of housing, and job growth that exceeds national averages in Northern California and Seattle, and continues to improve in Southern California.","With have provided our preliminary market forecast for 2013 on Page S-16 of the supplemental package. The weighted average estimated rent growth for our primary metro markets is 6.5% for 2013. The primary macro assumptions, which are integral to the rent growth estimates, are indicated on S-16 and are not materially different from the estimates of our economic data providers. However, some of the expected 2013 supply and job growth estimates, and consequently, the projected economic rent growth, are significantly different from the data providers. As an example, there are around 10,000 apartment homes under construction in the Seattle Metro, for which we estimate that 1,100, 4,100 and 4,800 will be delivered in Q4 '12, all of '13 and all of 2014, respectively. Accordingly, the timing of these deliveries can vary significantly based on a variety of factors. We believe that this overview of housing supply and demand information provides the appropriate [indiscernible] in our 2013 market rent growth assumptions for each MSA. We will update these numbers in connection with our formal 2013 guidance, which will occur in conjunction with our Q4 earnings conference call. We also recognize the inherent uncertainty in the U.S. and global economies, which could lead to significant changes. We view job growth as the key to the estimates, and as you know, that is dependent upon forces that can change rapidly and are not easily predicted.","I'd like to make 2 additional points about the 2013 preliminary market forecast on Page S-16. First, construction of for-sale housing remains muted on the West Coast, partially due to the hard landing it experienced in 2008, relatively high cost for-sale housing and mortgage qualification issues. However, median home prices are spiking dramatically and have experienced year-over-year increases as of September, of 17% in Northern California, 7% in Seattle and 6% to 12% in the various Southern California metros. If those median price increases continue, we would expect for-sale housing supply to accelerate. Second, the relationship between jobs and supply is at the core of our economic research effort, and John Lopez attempts to quantify housing demand and supply on a submarket basis. From a broader perspective, it takes, on average, about 2 jobs to create a household in the coastal markets. In 2013, our forecast indicates the addition of the total of 192,500 jobs, which should produce around 96,000 households. This is sufficient to cover 2.8x the 33,800 combined expected deliveries of for-sale and rental homes in 2013.","Our 10-Q will indicate that the investment in common stock, at cost, increased to $72.7 million from $42.9 million last quarter. Nearly all of that increase related to purchases of common stock of one company that we consider strategic in nature. As such, we will not provide additional information about this investment.","My second topic, the investment markets.","Cap rates continue to be aggressive in the coastal markets and have not changed materially since last quarter. Cap rates range from 4% to 4.5% for A quality property in A locations, and from 4.5% to near 5% for B quality property in A locations. Page S-15 of the supplement summarizes the closed acquisitions through last Wednesday, which aggregate $515 million, including the buyout of our partner's interest on Skyline. These deals include properties acquired both by the company and in the Wesco co-investment. We also have 3 transactions aggregating $186 million, in contract with contingencies removed, most of which should close by year end. You can expect a greater focus on Southern California from an acquisitions perspective in 2013. By the end of 2012, we expect to complete the sale of 7 properties representing roughly 1\/2 of our Fund II portfolio, for an aggregate contract price of approximately $413 million. Essex owns the 28% limited partnership interest in Fund II, and up to 20% of profits as it's general partner promoted interest. The remaining properties are expected to be sold in 2013 in anticipation of the Fund II term date of September 2013, which is extendable to September 2014. The trailing 12-month cap rate on these sales was less than 4.1%. Development deals in the West Coast markets, underwritten based on today's rents, generate development cap rates ranging from 5% to 5.5% or 6.25% to 6.75% upon stabilization. Our development pipeline did not change materially during the quarter, and at estimated cost, we have approximately $1 billion under construction. We estimate that the average cap rate of the development deals is about 6% based on current market rents and approximately 7% at stabilization.","And finally, my third topic. Dealing with the State of California.","We'll be paying close attention to the election results this coming Tuesday, as California goes to the polls to vote on 2 ballot measures that propose to raise state taxes in support of education and other needs. Prop. 30 which is being championed by Governor Brown, would increase the California sales tax by 0.25% for 4 years, and the state income tax, based on a sliding scale for those that earn over $250,000, for a period of 7 years. Prop. 38 seeks to raise income taxes on those making over $7,300, based on a sliding scale that begins with an increase of 0.7% and has a maximum increase of 2.2%, and is for a 12-year period. If both measures pass, the one with the greatest number of yes votes will supersede the other. Important to note that none of the ballot measures impact Prop. 13.","So I'd like to thank you for joining us, once again. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Erik Alexander.","Erik J. Alexander","Thank you, Mike. Operations performance during the quarter was better than expected. We continue to have strong demand in most of our markets. Rental rates grew throughout the quarter. We finished the period in a strong occupancy position and are poised for a solid fourth quarter. Once again, rent growth reached its highest point in July but remained strong into October.","During the quarter, we completed more than 4,100 new lease transactions and signed nearly 4,300 renewals. Portfolio-wide, renewal rates for the period were up 5.3% and were steady throughout the quarter. New lease rates were 6.4% higher than expiring rates during the quarter, peaking at 8.7% in July.  October leasing activity has been good, and we now have seen an average coupon rates for new leases and renewals above $1,500 for the past 4 months. So on a combined basis, achieved rents in October are 11% higher than last year.","So while we expect overall rent growth to moderate at some point next year, strong job growth in all of our markets should continue to produce solid revenue gains throughout 2013. Looking ahead, renewal offers for November and December averaged 5% to 6% portfolio-wide. At the end of October, our loss-to-lease for the portfolio was 4%.","Turnover remains within expectations, and for the quarter, was within 1% of last year's move out rate. Given our low availability and expiration profile, the turnover expectation for the year remains in the low 50% range. The reasons given for move-out were consistent with last quarter's results, and we saw declines reported in home purchases and affordability. These factors represented 10.5% and 13% of all move-outs, respectively. I think these numbers remain low due to persistent high occupancy in our markets, a steady demand for rental housing, and the affordability and qualifying hurdles facing home purchasers. We do expect these reasons for move-out to increase in 2013, but should be well within manageable ranges.","Expo was our only active lease-up during the quarter. This community is in the very popular lower Queen Anne neighborhood of Seattle, and is less than 1 mile from Amazon's world headquarters. These apartment homes, average nearly 700 square feet and rent for almost $3 per square foot. Again, this project was delivered 6 months ahead of schedule and we had our first move-ins during October. Thanks to strong pre-leasing efforts, Expo is already 25% occupied and 38% leased. We expect to stabilize this asset during the second quarter next year.","Operating expenses continued to be within expectations, and year-to-date are up 1.1% compared to 2011. Turnover and onetime service items drove the typical sequential growth, but there's nothing unusual to note. Next quarter's expenses could be slightly higher as we continue to improve property presentation and enhanced services for our residents. Operating expenses for the year should end up 2% higher than 2011, and within our guidance.","Now, I will share some highlights for each region, beginning with Seattle.","Essex's market rents are up 10.6% year-to-date and the job picture in the region continues to be robust, and we're seeing more tech applicants, including employees from Microsoft and Amazon. Our outlook through 2013 is 2.3% job growth. Job growth projections for all of our markets are detailed on Page S-16 of the supplement.","Office absorption slowed during the quarter to about 200,000 square feet. However, Zillow, eBay and Intel are all expanding operations in the region. Additionally, Amazon Phase 5 is slated to be delivered during the fourth quarter of this year, and a nearly 400,000 square-foot expansion will commence next year. Other large projects are scheduled to start in 2013, including Amazons' 3.3 million square-foot project in the Denny Triangle area of the city. This would be Seattle's largest commercial development in history.","Turning to Northern California, Essex market rents are up 10.1% year-to-date. Job growth expectations remained strong in Silicon Valley, with the highest forecast for any of our markets, at 2.4% through 2013. Commercial absorption in Silicon Valley also remains strong, as another 1 million square feet were absorbed during the quarter, including the balance of Amazon's research unit in Sunnyvale, which is expected to add 2,000 jobs. The balance of the region accounted for another 600,000 square feet of leasing activity, with 230,000 square feet in the open MSA. Commercial leasing activity in this market is increasing, and we expect stronger absorption in the coming quarters with subsequent benefits to our East Bay portfolio.","Supply expectations for the year remain unchanged and the new apartment offerings in San Jose continue to lease well. We have yet to see an adverse affect from these projects. Next year's growth expectations include this new competition, with contingencies for possible concession activity. Again, it is our view that strong job growth in Silicon Valley and tight occupancies in the submarket, coupled with very limited single-family home deliveries, will allow for the new apartment supply to be absorbed and rents to grow as well.","Finally, looking at Southern California. The jobs picture in Southern California is improving. We have experienced a year-over-year decline in unemployment of 2%. September's jobs report was up 1.8%, 40 basis points higher than the national average. Next year, we expect the region to match the national average, with Orange County leading the way.","Office space absorption for Southern California was positive for the fifth consecutive quarter, as another 1.1 million square feet was absorbed during the period. Of note, Orange County accounted for 700,000 square feet of that space.","Downtown Los Angeles and the West Side remain the best locations for us in Southern California, but Orange County improved in occupancy and rent growth during the quarter, and we remain optimistic that this region will continue to enjoy improved performance throughout 2013.","Our performance was strong enough to increase our year end guidance, but more importantly, we feel confident about 2013. All indications are that Seattle and the Bay Area will remain strong, as Southern California continues to build steam.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike Dance.","Michael T. Dance","Thanks, Erik. Before I turn the call back to the operator for questions, I will quickly highlight the accomplishments during the quarter from 4 key activities.","First, our same property operating results, from both a year-over-year increase in revenues and a year-over-year increase in net operating income, were the best quarterly results reported by the apartment REITs. We believe that these sector-leading results should continue throughout 2013.","Second, the accretion from our 2011 and 2012 property acquisitions, and from our Via development, is reported in our net operating income from non-same property results on S-7. These results have far exceeded our '12 guidance and are key contributors to our leading year-over-year FFO growth. With the recently announced property acquisition and the earlier-than-expected delivery and lease up of Expo, we expect to have sector leading FFO growth continue into '13.","Third, we demonstrated the strength of our balance sheet by executing a $300 million public bond offering at a 3.625% fixed coupon, which is a record low coupon for a public debut of REIT 10-year unsecured debt, and within 20 basis points of a fixed 10-year rate from Freddie or Fannie.","And lastly, with the dispositions and expected sale of the Fund II assets, our co-investment activities demonstrate the capabilities of the Essex platform by attracting institutional capital, which is deployed into the best apartment markets on the West Coast, coupled with better-than-market rent growth, with value creating improvements and property operations that improve the resident experience, enables us to sell these assets and generate attractive returns that meet our investor's high expectations.","I would now like to turn the call back to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dave Bragg of Zelman & Associates.","David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, LLC","I kind of just have to ask, since you've put it out there and elaborated a little bit. But could you just set some parameters for us in terms of how would you define a strategic opportunity?","Michael J. Schall","That's an interesting question. I don't think I really have a way of defining it. I would say it is something that is -- what we're trying to indicate that we're not doing is just going out and buying common stocks and making that type of investment. We view this as something that we think there is some strategic fit for the company. But the problem is, if you go down that road and start talking about any part of it, I think it diminishes what we're trying to accomplish. And so, that's all I'm going to say at this point, Dave.","David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, LLC","And then just going over to the 2013 rent growth estimates. I'd be curious just to maybe get some color around the relative outlook for Class A versus B assets. When you think about the supply coming on in some of your markets, I'm sure that John would have some thoughts on that, and that would be helpful.","Michael J. Schall","Yes, actually this is Mike. I'll take that one and John can add to it if he wants. We view the A's and B's as being fairly similar. It depends on what's going on in the local market. I'll give you an example. Probably the area that has the greatest, Dave, would be the area around the Irvine Ranch, because Irvine Ranch has the ability of producing a lot of A-type product. And so what we try to do is look at the amount of A in the marketplace relative to the broader stock and try to judge whether that's the appropriate amount of A product, again, relative to the high-end renter demand. And so, based on that, we will make a decision as to whether we think the As are going to outperform the Bs or vice versa. So that's how we approach it. We do it on a submarket-by-submarket basis. We don't believe these broad statements about As doing better than Bs or Bs doing better than As, really has a lot of merit overall. As, obviously, we're producing more apartments going forward, and as that happens, we are going -- almost all of the apartment deliveries are going to be in the A category. We are going to become more sensitive to how much A product is in the market relative to the overall housing stock.","David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Got it. That's helpful. Mike, one other just big picture question for you. Shortly after you took over as CEO, you kind of set forth some thoughts, and one of them was keeping the size of the Essex portfolio in the total capitalization range of $7 billion to $10 billion. Do you continue to think that way or has that changed?","Michael J. Schall","The backdrop for that comment was trying to balance the external growth component with the internal growth component. And we -- and Essex, I think, has a reputation for being a very savvy investor, and clearly, I don't want to lose that. And we want the impact of being a savvy investor to show up in the numbers, right? By not having the base so large that it doesn't matter what we buy or build because there's so many shares outstanding that it gets diluted in that effort. So what we're trying to do is have a balanced program of internal and external, and still, we are still comfortable within the $7 billion to $10 billion range at this point in time And we'll look to that. But I will also make a comment that we are spending, really, considerable time and effort, now that the size of the portfolio is $8.5 billion, roughly, in terms of value, more time and effort as it relates to the asset management and operations in automating the operating process, re-thinking the platform. Because when you get to a certain size, the relationships between what you spend on new systems and processes and that type of thing, are easy to allocate over a broader portfolio. So I think there's some real opportunity in that area as well. But for now, still comfortable in the $7 billion to $10 billion.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Stevenson of Macquarie.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Sitting with a $925 million development pipeline, with your share roughly $550 million or so, how are you guys thinking about incremental starts over the next 6 to 9 month? Especially given that most of your deliveries right now are '14, and so, starting anything in the near term would probably accentuate that.","John D. Eudy","This is John Eudy. Everything that we have in the pipeline now, the 9 deals, the $940 million you referenced, are under construction. Behind that, we don't have a lot in our shadow pipeline, quite frankly. So I think what you're going to see is most of our product delivers in the second and third quarter next year, going into first and second of '14. And from there it's just a matter of whether or not we decide to pull the trigger on future deals.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Okay. How aggressively are you guys pursuing land for future development today?","John D. Eudy","Well, it's hard. As you know, the genesis of our portfolio that were developing and under construction now were started 2 years ago, and if you mark the land basis that we're in at, to market, we're about half of market today. And as Mike noted, our current cap rate on the pipeline is in the low 6 range. The same with current land values would be in the low 5 range, and that's a harder thing for us to make an easy decision on. Really good location would get some -- a deal that we can't pass up or some accommodation from the city on fee waivers, there could be a deal that pops up, but it's going to be difficult.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then, Mike Dance, where are you seeing the greatest upward pressure, today, on the expense side?","Michael T. Dance","Not really anywhere. I mean, we continue to manage expenses. They're more timing when they come. That happened to be -- last year our expenses were really low in the fourth quarter, as we tried to make some stretch NOI goals for fourth quarter last year. So we have a hard comp on expenses for next year. We do -- I've mentioned in the past, property taxes in California. We do have some Prop. 8 adjustments. We'll be seeing those in our 2013 numbers, likely to start coming in. They were muted for the second half of this year. So my concerns were not -- have been alleviated, and for Prop. 8 adjustments for the second half of this year, but it should show up in the second half of '13. And then probably, one area where we don't have as much cap on or being able to predict property taxes would be in the Seattle area. And in Seattle, set values have increased significantly. We haven't gotten the levy rates yet. But depending on where those levy rates are, that could be an area in '13 that could be an area beyond our control.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then just last question. When you guys look back over the last 5, 7, 10 years, how have you guys historically done versus the overall market and submarkets from a rent growth standpoint?","Michael J. Schall","How have we done relative to our expectations? Is that what you're...","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","No. I mean, is it -- so if I tell you that San Jose is a 4% rental rate growth market over the last 10 years, I mean, where are you guys normally in those...","Michael J. Schall","I see, relative to the broader market. We are somewhere within the broader market, and I think that the opportunities to outperform the market are really -- from the perspective of rehab, certainly there is some incremental growth over the market. A number of buildings that we bought have been bought from owners that have owned property for long periods of time. They haven't spent a nickel on them for 30 years, the old syndicators and that type of thing. And the opportunity to both put some money in the building and improve the quality of management, I think adds some incremental value as well. And so I think that those are the main opportunities out there. Those are things that we're looking for when we are buying properties in the marketplaces, where we have an information advantage and our information advantage can lead to a little bit better performing acquisition, which I think we've pretty clearly demonstrated over the last couple of years.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Donnelly of Wells Fargo Securities.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I'm just considering your forecast for 2013, specifically for the Bay Area. It looks like you\u2019re expecting rent growth to decelerate about 250 to 300 basis points from what you've realized year-to-date. Just trying to understand your assumptions, because with an expectation of what I think is increased net absorption, and pluses [ph] in the forecast, you should have the same or better pricing power. So, I guess, I'm curious. Is that a degree of conservatism in your forecast or on your rent growth prospects or are you expecting to hit some degree of, I guess I'll call it, a ceiling on affordability?","Michael J. Schall","Yes, I think. This is Mike. Clearly, when you look at the jobs that we are assuming and the broader economic recovery, which we think benefits probably the left Coast over other parts of the nation, that would -- I totally agree with you. That looks like we have another undersupplied housing scenario. But I guess the other thing that concerns us, and tempers that a bit, is how much of income is being -- how much of people's income is being consumed by rent. And so, we think -- we use the metric of rents-to-median-income as an indicator of the point at which people choose to move farther out into the hinter lands, let's say, or double up more and\/or other things that change the world. And in fact, if I go back into our history bank, we hit the all-time high rent-to-median-income around year 2000, in San Francisco. And if you just look at what happens in that scenario, you will find employers moving people to Denver and Phoenix, and a lot of things that have a muting impact on what's going on in the local marketplace. So, our view is to try to keep our expectations within the range of sustainable, let's say, rent-to-median-income levels. I guess, the other related point is that median incomes, their personal income growth has been very substantial over the last couple of years. So, obviously, that could add fuel to the ability to get very large increases over a longer period of time. But it's more difficult to predict and so we're assuming that we're going to hit some resistance is, in effect, what's happening. And that's what's causing us to lower our expectations relative to what we have in 2012.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Where do you think is the ratio is today, and can you remind us what the peak was?","John Lopez","Yes, this is John Lopez. We're a little bit ahead in San Francisco, in the low 20s. The peak was 30-plus percent in Silicon Valley. In Oakland we're a little bit below. In Seattle, we still have a ways to go to get there, so it's the ones with the most gaps that build up. So San Francisco is our only market where we're a little bit above. But I think if you historically, that, in expansion [ph] period, it gets very high.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I guess I had the same question for Southern California, but there I would say that it's a similar dynamic of net absorption, but you're expecting revenue growth to accelerate. Is that because you think it's a little bit more affordable down there, if you will, you have a little bit more leeway to push?","Michael J. Schall","Yes, Southern California is, in our view, much different position. We've had very limited rent growth in Southern California. It's the last major metro in the country to recover. Whereas in Northern California, we've had 25% rent growth over the last couple of years, we've had a fraction of that in Southern California. And at the same time, Southern California has not had nearly the job growth that the tech markets in Northern California and Seattle have benefited from. So it's actually a much different dynamic and so we just think it's a couple of years behind Northern California in terms of its recovery. If you look at rents now to the prior peak, in many places it's still below prior peak rents, where we are well above prior peak rents in Seattle and Northern California. So all those factors combined lead us to believe that Southern California accelerates, Northern California and Seattle are modestly lower.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And just a last question. Could you tell us what the move-outs to home purchase and home rental were?","Erik J. Alexander","Yes, this is Erik. It was 10.5% for the most recent quarter, down from about 11.5% in the second quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Karin Ford of KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to follow up on that conversation about Southern California accelerating, and it sounded like in your comments, Mike, that you guys are really going to be focused there on the acquisition front in the coming quarters. Can you just talk about how much of your portfolio you'd like to potentially position in Southern Cal in an ideal world, today? And which markets specifically you'd be targeting?","Michael J. Schall","Sure. Well, our Southern California portfolio has been high as 60%, and we've made efforts to invest more in Northern California and Seattle over the last couple of years. Because we predicted, I think correctly, that those markets would experience the strongest growth and it would happen sooner than Southern California. And so, again, with 25% rent growth up north over the last couple of years, the natural inclination is to shift more of the acquisition focus in Southern California. Not to say, though, that we won't buy in Northern California. I don't want to create that image at all. Over the long haul, if you look at this 20-year compounded annual growth rates of rents, Northern California has been the strongest market in our portfolio. So we have sort of the long-term in the back of our minds, and in the shorter-term, obviously, I think it has to decelerate to some extent. I think it'll still remain a very good market, but it's not possible, in my opinion, to produce 7% to 8% rent growth over a prolonged period of time. So we'll move to Southern California. To get to your -- the specific relationships, I think that Southern California could go to maybe up 10% from where it is now. So it could get in the high 50% range. But, again, I think that we are -- Northern California is the area that has the best longer-term growth and we're going to be protective of our allocation here because of that factor.","Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And are you equally interested in L.A., Orange County, San Diego or is there one particular area that you're more focused on in Southern Cal?","Michael J. Schall","No, we definitely have submarkets that we like more than others. And, in this case, we like to the CBD L.A. We like the West side, the Marina. We like, really, the tri-cities area, Pasadena, Glendale and Burbank. The coastal markets through Orange County would be the targets that we're focused on.","Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. Next question, just on development and it sounds like you're not planning to add much new to that pipeline in the near term. Is that -- I guess the part of it is that, as you said, yields on -- if you bought new land today, yields would be relatively low. Is it also that you're starting to see some maturation in the cycle? And given the long lead time to get something done that you're maybe expecting slower growth for new starts if you started anything new today?","Michael J. Schall","Yes, the thought process really goes back to how do you deal with uncertainty as it relates to the broader markets and the broader economy. And the decision early on to match fund all of our acquisitions, i.e. not increased leverage on the balance sheet, the decision to use a institutional partner, with respect to a lot of our development transactions, and the decision to -- essentially the day that we commit, very shortly after that, start construction. So not have a long delay period where construction costs can increase and you're subjected to other risks that can pretty dramatically change your expected results, which is exactly what happened in the last cycle, by the way. And so the combination of uncertainty in the -- as to the general economy, and our preference to try and have a more risk adverse view of our external growth platform, is really where we've come, and how our portfolio and our development deals have evolved. So, going forward, that uncertainty certainly hasn't abated, and we're still looking at a lot of deals. In fact, John, a year ago, set up triage because we had so many deals to go through. And most of them didn't qualify for what we were looking for. We continue to look at a lot of deals and there's certainly no shortage there. But in terms of actually hitting what we consider the sweet spot of the development program is something that we're struggling with. So not to say we aren't looking at a lot of deals, we are looking at a lot of deals, and we may do some. And we do have a couple of deals that are land banked that we could start in the next couple of years. But it's just finding the deals that we think fit our profile and fit our parameters, is a struggle.","Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. Last question. I think there was some talk on the last call about rent control concerns in Northern California. Is there anything new, positive or negative, on that front?","Michael J. Schall","No, nothing new on that front. It continues to be an issue just because of the magnitude of the rent increases and the politicians in terms of an issue that they can get their arms around, that is certainly one, but nothing recently has happened. I did talk to the President of CAA the other day, and he was -- he acknowledged that we've been pretty helpful in some of the efforts to mediate between cities and residents, some of the rent increases. So yes, I think it's more of the same. I think it's -- I haven't heard anything new at this point.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","The first question, Mike, just goes to the stock investment. When you guys bought the unsecured bonds, clearly, there's an ability to underwrite what the cash flows are. When you're doing a stock investment, it's based on sort of how the market interprets the story, which is obviously different than how bonds are priced. So while I understand that you want to keep quiet on the strategic part of it, how do you guys gain comfort, the same comfort that you have on that downside protection?","Michael J. Schall","Alex, the problem with this whole topic is, without revealing the nature of what we're doing and how we're going to do it, yes, I can't answer you, I can't answer the question. I mean, to answer that question, I would have to be able to talk freely about the nature of the investment and why we are pursuing it. So I'm kind of in a difficult spot with respect to this question and other related questions. I understand that the market would like to understand what we're doing, but let's keep in mind that it's a relatively small investment to the size of the company, and we will disclose what we can, and we will. I mean, it's our practice, I think, to be pretty open and transparent as a company. We'll disclose information as we can, we just can't do it right now because who knows how that could impact what we're trying to accomplish. So I can't add anymore at this point.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","No, I think that's fair. Listen, you guys have clearly, as you said, demonstrated savvy and the market certainly gives you guys credit for doing this stuff. It's just -- help us gain further insight, but understand that you want to keep it close to the vest. Let me ask you a question, for Mike Dance. On the Fund II dispositions and the policies, I don't have a supplemental in front of me, I don't have working Internet. Do you -- what's the potential for any promote cert [ph] , chocolate chips, if you will, in '13 versus '14 that we should be thinking about?","Michael T. Dance","There's possibility for both in '13 and '14 depending on the timing of the last sale. So it's back-end loaded because the promote is very sensitive to how these last assets are going to sell. And if we get to the extension in the '14, that will either put them in last half of '13 or early '14.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. And if you can't provide any color right now, when you guys provide fourth quarter guidance, would that include a range of potential for those promotes? Or because they're really subjective to when the sales finalize even in the fourth -- even in the '13 guidance provided in the fourth quarter, it still wouldn't been in there?","Michael T. Dance","We would provide in, as we have in the past, a range of possible other income. So I could see some wide [ph] range of possibilities there.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. And then just the final question. In Seattle, saw a news item that you guys sold Tower 801. Just sort of curious if that's a submarket decision or if that was an asset-specific decision.","Michael T. Dance","That was a Fund II decision and -- so that was one of our Fund II assets. And as you know, there is a lot of downtown Seattle development that will be coming online, so looking at the Fund II assets to sell and the timing, we thought we're going to have to sell it eventually. If we could own it, we would have bought it from the Fund, but that's not our deal. But we just figured it was the right time to sell that, pass that this year rather than next year when some of the new deliveries will be occurring.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Salinsky of RBC Capital Markets.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","First question. In the guidance that you provided, you talked about some of the acquisition upside. Can you give us a sense of what the pipeline looks like today, what could close in the fourth quarter? And also, just any change you've seen in pricing in the last 90 days would be helpful as well.","Michael J. Schall","No change in pricing in the last 90 days. It's interesting because obviously, given said efforts to keep interest rates low and lower, we're seeing some pretty amazing debt rates on 10 years from Fannie, Freddie and certainly, in the unsecured market. In my comments, I noted that we have $186 million in contract, contingencies removed. The timing of that will be mostly fourth quarter. There are some loan assumptions and some other things that could impact that timing, but most of it will close in the fourth quarter. There's a lot of product on the market as well, and so our acquisition people are busy now. Every year, there are some tax-motivated sellers that need a quick close type of scenario. We're hoping for that this year, still too early to tell, but we always like those deals because there's such strong motivation on behalf of the sellers. So $186 million, thus far, and we're looking at lots of other things. So hopefully that helps.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. Second, probably a question for Erik. In the third quarter of last year, your occupancy dropped then picked up sharply towards the end. I think in October, you had a very good pickup. Can you tell us how kind of October trended versus last year and where occupancy is at this point  versus the occupancy last year?","Erik J. Alexander","Better. Seriously, the -- again, it's been smoother this year. So I think our strategy on pricing, particularly renewals and on the new lease side, we paid attention to some of the relationships between net availability and pricing earlier, and again, just worked that equation a little bit differently. I think last year, I talked about how the pickup really started in September, maybe second week of September, and then ran through the middle of October, and by the time it got to the end of the month, settled in at whatever that ending rate was. As of yesterday, physical occupancy was in the 96.3% range portfolio-wide. And so that's the reason -- that's where we stand.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","How does that compare versus last year at the same point?","Erik J. Alexander","I don't have that in front of me, but I think it's about -- I don't have it in front of me. It's similar though. I mean, I can -- it's either at the same level or it might have been 10 basis points higher because we got after the leasing aggressively to make sure that we got to essentially the point that we wanted to be, which is where we are today. We like exactly where we are today in that 96.3% range with 5% availability looking out 45 days. So a very manageable supply between now and the end of the year.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Then, finally, Mike Dance, not to leave you out. On the Fund II sales, did you give what the gain on a gross book value basis was? And can you comment what the IRR on those, the 7 that were sold were, at Fund II [ph] ?","Michael T. Dance","Yes. We will have the gain -- Bryan gave me his number. I'll have to get back to you on that. I just -- it escapes my memory right now. But we do have a number that we can provide. And the IRRs today are around 10%. So we're expecting the promote to come with the second half sales, where some of our bigger gains are in the Bay Area assets we bought. And those will be sold either late '13, early '14. But given the high rent growth we continue to see in -- on the peninsula, we didn't want to sell those yet.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Can you remind us what the hurdle rate on that -- on Fund II was?","Michael T. Dance","It's 10%. So we're -- we've now paid out the hurdle rate. So everything else that we earn above the 10% will have a promote.","Operator","Next question comes from Eric Wolfe of Citigroup.","Eric Wolfe - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I think in your opening remarks, you talked about the home prices in your markets being up, I guess, 7% to 17%, so pretty strong on a year-over-year basis. Just curious, if you look at it, if it's not your renters and other first time homebuyers that are moving out to single-family housing that's pushing up pricing. Is this just a sort of temporary short-term squeeze due to a lack of supply or do you see these gains as being stable?","Michael J. Schall","Well, that is a very good question, and I'm not sure I have the complete answer. I can tell you that as you start getting these big numbers in home prices, a couple of things happen, one good, one not so good. The good part of it is that the affordability, the ability to shift from a renter to a homeowner becomes more difficult to occur. So we like that. But at the same time, as the price goes up, you're going to start seeing more homebuilding in these markets. And our view is that apartments are essentially the shock absorber within the market. So to the extent you build a home, we assume that it's going to be bought by someone and it's going to absorb a household. So the confluence, I guess, the relationship between the 2 is, I guess, number one, for a couple of years, I think we're good because we have very muted levels of for-sale housing coming at us. But we're going to be mindful of that and we're going to track it carefully because again, our view is that to the extent they're built, they are going to be occupied and they're going to take away from the renter demand.","Erik J. Alexander","Eric, I just want to add that our affordability levels are returning to more normalized levels we'd expect to see. So I would believe that these gains are not a temporary jump, but sustainable.","Eric Wolfe - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. That makes sense. And I guess, along the same line, you talked a little bit about the supply of single-family homes maybe coming back. As a response to these gains, which I guess may not be stable, but how quickly do you think that could happen? And do you see it being more of a trickle or a flood, and is it likely to hit more of your sort of peripheral markets versus your core markets?","Michael J. Schall","I think that we don't have the ability, except in a couple of places where you have massive tracts of land that are ground zero, competing against our apartments. I guess one of the notable exceptions would be the South Orange County market, where there actually is quite a bit of open space and the ability to build homes that -- and they can be built fairly quickly. If we use the last cycle as sort of an indication of what's going to come at us, there were a lot of thousands of condo buildings that were built in the coastal markets. The timeframe for building that type of product is obviously much more like an apartment, it's going to take longer. Our ability to track it and identify it and understand its impact is much greater. So I think that in the coastal markets that we focus on, you're going to see -- you will start seeing that again, but I think it's a couple of years off. And so with respect to the product that can be generated more quickly, which is more like the single-family homes, I think that, that's going to be -- it's going to be muted, but there are a couple of areas that we're concerned will have more of that. San Diego would be the other example of an area that we'd be concerned about in terms of the ability to produce single-family housing.","Eric Wolfe - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Right. Great. And sort of a weird question here, but you talked a little bit about strategic position. You wouldn't ever consider some type of position in a homebuilder or something sort of outside your core focus. I mean, what you're talking about is something that's really more specific to Essex.","Michael J. Schall","Again, I have -- this is the problem Mike. It's almost like I can't say anything without providing a piece of information that I just -- I can't do it. It sort of handcuffs me as a question, so I just can't comment. Sorry for the frustration that might cause.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Rich Anderson of BMO Capital Markets.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","So to what extent that you mentioned the 13% of move-outs for financial reasons are -- I'm not exactly sure how you put it, affordability or whatever it was, but you indicated that might be growing in 2013 as well. To what extent is that influencing your rent growth assumption for 2013 moderating? Does it have an influence on that calculation?","Michael J. Schall","No, it doesn't. Again, I've talked about it before. It's been higher in the past. I think same period last year, it was closer to 17% or 18% of the move-outs. We're citing this as a reason. And again, basically, I'm combining people that tell us that either their apartment is too expensive or that they're specifically moving out due to a rent increase. And so again, we've seen that number stable or even come down. So at this point, it is not impacting how we are projecting 2013.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. Mike, or whoever, you'd mentioned that you could see Southern California climb 10 percentage points to 50% from about 40% currently. How is that going to accomplish it? Will it be purely through acquisitions or will it also be a time to be a seller following the huge rent growth in Northern California?","Michael J. Schall","I could see, Rich, us selling some assets in Northern California and Seattle, and we would tend to look at these secondary locations. John Burkart is actually here. He is the keeper of the dispo list, and he -- there are some assets on there that are more secondary areas of the San Jose MSA and the other Northern California and Seattle markets. So it'll be that, and to the extent we can build in Southern California, we still would like to do that. We have a couple of development deals that are under construction in West Hollywood, and so that could be a component of it. But again, most of the -- there's so little production of housing in these markets that almost by default, most of it is going to be acquisition-oriented. So it will be a combination of all those.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And regarding some of your past and most recent investment activity, buying buildings that are more better-suited potentially for condominiums, Skyline for example, to what degree is that strategy something that you'll continue to pursue or is it kind of gone? Or maybe from a risk perspective, you don't want to go down that path much more. Or where are you on that strategy from an acquisition standpoint?","Michael J. Schall","We still like it. We think that the opportunities to execute it are few and far between. Most of the transactions that we did in 2010, 2011 involved a financial institution of some kind, which are great sellers because they're very motivated and you have certainty of closing, in some cases, actually in a couple of those cases, we had to underwrite the asset and remove contingencies within a week, for example, because they're so motivated. And so we don't see the motivation of the financial intermediaries to nearly that -- nearly the same extent at this point in time. There are a few transactions that we see that have condo maps and we give a little bit of extra credit, let's say, to those transactions just in recognition of the scarcity of condo maps within these markets. And so we -- contingencies, some transactions that have that. But I think most of the real opportunity has been -- has been realized on that front. I note that the increase in single-family home prices is obviously a tremendous benefit as it relates to that strategy. So it's a mixed bag for us because on the one hand, we know that if housing prices go up significantly, we're going to see more housing, more for-sale housing being delivered, but at the same time, the condo optionality becomes more meaningful on our portfolio. So again, a good and a bad.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And then my last question is, first, I'm hopeful that you won't bite my head off by asking it, but I'm just going to ask it anyway. And obviously...","Michael J. Schall","It is your nature, Rich, to do that.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","So, but I think it's benign enough. And I'm just curious, not on the stock investment issues specifically, but just a general rule of thumb, to what degree is this a normal course of business for Essex? How often do you make stock purchases as a general rule of thumb and is it something that isn't so far afield from what you've done in the past?","Michael J. Schall","It's a good question. Obviously, most people know that we were pursuing Town and Country several years ago. I guess the other factor that's a little different now is we self-insure. We've got an insurance captive with somewhere around $30 million in it. And so we tranche that, by giving it a very safe tranche, and then less safe tranches. So as you get more money in the captive, we're going to be buying -- we will be making investments and they will be, by their nature, liquid. Mostly bonds probably, but there is a chance for some common stock investments within that entity. But this, I would view this as being very unusual and something that we think we can add value. I think we have a reputation as being a very value-oriented company and try to be opportunistic. But at the same time, I think that we're also pretty darn risk-adverse as well. So certainly, that's the influence of George Marcus for many years, being both sides, opportunistic and sensitive to risk. So where we see opportunities that sort of fit within that box, we feel compelled to move on it. I think the other bias of our board is, let's not do things that are so large and such large bets that we undermine the good thing that we have going. I mean that comment is something that is often stated at the board level. And so within that discussion, I would expect this to be sort of within that same vein. There's an opportunistic element, there's a strategic element, there's an element that says don't make it so large that it could affect the good thing that we have, the good things that we have going, and I think that's what we're doing. It will all become clear down the road as we all know.","Operator","Our next session comes from Andrew McCulloch of Green Street Advisors.","Andrew McCulloch - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Just back to the common stock investment, I'm sorry to beat a dead horse here, but I think one of the things that makes investors a little uneasy, in addition to the fact that you're not letting anyone know what you're investing in, is that you're also issuing common stock at the same time. When you issue common stock at a big premium to either [ph] buy apartment assets, that's arbitrage. But when you issue common stock to buy common stock in another company, unless it's another apartment REIT, that's pure speculation. And I guess my question is, why would investors want Essex issuing common stock to make purely speculative investments in other common stock?","Michael J. Schall","I mean, I don't necessarily agree with your characterization. I mean, we're issuing common stock and we've got a very robust acquisition and development pipeline. And so I don't think you really know that, that's exactly what we're doing. Having said that, I don't think you should -- you know who we are. We have a 20-year track record and I don't think we have too many crazy things that we've done over that period of time, so I would ask that you see it through with us, and in the end, I don't think that anyone will be disappointed or think that it's something that's hugely speculative or out of character. So again, I go back to what I just said, which is we have, we try to be opportunistic, I think you all want us to be opportunistic within the balance of let's not do anything that's going to undermine the great things that are happening out here, and I think this fits nicely within that. So I think if we were talking about an enormous investment, I would agree with you, Andy. But in this case, I just think we're making too -- making much out of something that just really is not all that large.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tayo Okusanya of Jefferies.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just a quick question on the development side. If you could talk somewhat about development costs and just where you see that trending?","John D. Eudy","Sure. This is John Eudy. Fortunately, the pipeline that we have, the 9 deals, $934 million, all but the last probably 10% has been bought out and we priced it for the most part, on average, about a year ago. And we don't -- we're pretty safe there and we're trending on the portfolio to come in at or better than budget. At present, there has been some moves. We have the recent Sandy event, which is going to probably give a little spike to some of the material costs. We do think that costs are increasing, not as substantial as I think the recent Wall Street Journal seemed to indicate, of anything gross, but they are going up and that's one of the risks that we're being averse to. Better have your landing from 2 year ago prices and your costs in from 1 year ago than going forward. And that's why we're moderating our forward-looking activities carefully.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just going back to the comments about rent income ratios. I mean, I did get this idea that the rent to income ratios are nowhere close to where their historical highs have been. But I'm just curious, with everything you're seeing in regards to job trends and overall market trends, whether you actually expect rent-to-income ratios to get as high as they were, kind of in the dot com era, or in the last real estate boom of 2004, 2005, 2006?","John Lopez","Yes, this is John Lopez. Only San Francisco is above its long-run trend. And so I would say that most of our markets are still below the long-run average, not anywhere near the highs. And San Francisco, where it's at right now, is not at the level you would expect to see in a very hot market. The second thing I'd like to add is we look at Seattle as a market where it was hit pretty hard in that it's becoming more of a market like our Northern California markets, and we expect that long-run average to actually increase over time.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paula Poskon of Robert W. Baird.","Paula J. Poskon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Just one big picture question. Just given how strong the fundamentals have remained, are you surprised that the apartment sector has not done better, has really just underperformed year-to-date?","Michael J. Schall","Wow, that's a great set up question, thank you. Thank you, Paula. I'll send you a check within the mail. Obviously, we're disappointed in the performance of the stock. I think the multifamily REITs are the poorest performer, stock-wise, this year, which may not be -- was true about a week ago, I think, but maybe changed a little bit. So, I mean, obviously, yes, but at the same time, we view our jobs as putting numbers on the board, growing cash flows, doing just smart real estate deals and we believe that the stock price will follow that effort. So we remain optimistic and we're happy with lots of things that are going on, and we hope that the stock reacts appropriately over time. And I think it will.","Paula J. Poskon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Do you think that investors though are -- that the concerns, particularly around that return of homeownership, have been overdone or do you think those are warranted given what you were saying in your comments earlier around housing prices and your fear that the inventory will increase?","Michael J. Schall","Yes. The comments that we've made are in no small part, trying to put that issue into perspective because I think there is sort of a homogenization of America in terms of the data. And I think that the regional variations are very significant, and so I think that what works in the general theme may not work as to every company and every location. We recognize this as being a very local business, and relationships that may apply on a national basis will probably, ultimately apply to us, but there can be a couple of years of lag between them. So I think in this case, there's a couple of key points that really matter here. Number one is our rents fell further than most. Our prior peak to the trough was off 15% as a company. And so we expected a strong bounce and we got a strong bounce. From that though, we started at a very low point. We were about 2 years later to recover, given the fact that head [ph]  Companies prove that they can restructure very quickly, and so we had very significant job losses for a period time, which led to the rent reductions, but it also set up the opportunity to add jobs quickly when conditions were better. So our view is that if you have those 2 things in context and then you also look at what happened in the for-sale area, where you had all these vacant condo buildings, really demonstrate the distress within the for-sale markets. And again, we were able to buy 8 of them over that period of time, and it just shows you how much distress there was. And again, that will recover as well, and -- but it's not happening yet. And so I think you have -- you've got to look at regionally, with respect to the different elements of supply and demand, and you'll see why we're as optimistic as we are in our comments.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Rosivach of Goldman Sachs.","Andrew Leonard Rosivach - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Really quickly in the call, you guys have done a lot of transactions both on the buy and the sell side in California. And I'm just curious, have you been able to have any kind of efficiency in terms of Prop. 13 when you're entering or disposing of assets?","Michael T. Dance","No. I mean, when you buy or sell an asset, which is different than development, they're going to use your purchase price, and whatever adjustments we do for GAAP accounting, they kind of ignore. They just use the -- what's recorded in the purchase sale agreement. Development is more of an art. They try to come in and assess us a fair value. They can't mark up the land, but they can mark up the improvements on the development. So there, we have had some success on the development side, but acquisitions and the dispositions, it's pretty black and white.","Andrew Leonard Rosivach - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So even in the history of the company, like way back when, when you sold the Fund straight to UDR, even if you do an entity-level transaction, that you're still going to get a markup?","Michael T. Dance","Well, with UDR, you'll have to talk to them. But I imagine if there were assets outside the state, they would've tried to change the allocations. I can't remember all of the assets of the Fund, but there may have been some allocations because there was a purchase price, they had some flexibility and ability to allocate within or without the State of California to maximize their tax position. But you'll have to check with them on what they did.","Andrew Leonard Rosivach - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Right. And this just one thing. This is indirect to this year purchases. You increased your interest in other income guidance by $600,000. Is that because you're carrying the additional common stock, which is producing a dividend?","Michael T. Dance","I think that falls under Mike's previous comments. We're just not going to go there, Andrew.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ross Nussbaum of UBS.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I guess, there's a lot of talk about this common stock investment. And while you've been on the phone, your stock is down $1. BRE's stock is up $1. So I don't know why everybody's beating around the bush here. Can you at least tell us what this is not as opposed to what this is? If this is BRE, can -- do you have any intent or are you buying BRE Stock? Do you have any intent of merging with BRE? Are you in discussions with BRE?","Michael J. Schall","Ross, you know I can't answer those questions. I mean...","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Well, if I asked you if you had any intent of merging with IBM, you'd answer the question. So, I guess, you guys opened the door by making a strategic investment, you've told us nothing about it, you won't tell us if you're going to be buying the entity, selling the position and I guess, maybe the question then becomes how long do you plan on keeping us all in the dark for on this?","Michael J. Schall","Well, I would argue that you're really in the dark. We have disclosures that we have made. And you know the relative size of the investment and you can judge that relative to the size of the company. And there are laws that concern other disclosures that are out there. And so again, I can't say anything more.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","All right. I mean, I hope you can understand there is a sense of frustration out there because I think people are concerned that this isn't just a small investment, that it is going to be something bigger, and they don't want to get in front of that until they know more.","Michael J. Schall","I understand.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Bilerman of Citigroup.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Michael Schall, you mentioned Town and Country in your response to a question. I guess, what is your thoughts on new markets and markets outside the West Coast and your interest level?","Michael J. Schall","Michael, we continue to be interested in markets outside the West Coast. The fact pattern of Town and Country is, I think, important and maybe instructive in that, at that time, West Coast was, I'd say, marginally ahead of the East Coast in terms of overall asset pricing and cap rate and just overall attractiveness in terms of where the West Coast was in the cycle and the East Coast. We view this business as, a good strategy is great and important, but only when coupled with good decisions with respect to timing and value create -- the value creation thesis. So in this case, I would say the reverse is -- has happened, which is, at least to this point, the East Coast was ahead of the West Coast in terms of recovery and in terms of asset pricing and valuation. So hopefully, that gives you some idea of how we think about these things.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then the $73 million that's in marketable securities, so the $43 million that was there as of the second quarter and the $30 million that you added to it, the entirety of that is one single position and one single security or is there multiple positions in there?","Michael J. Schall","The vast majority of it is one position.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then has anything been added to that position during the fourth quarter or is $73 million the current standing position?","Michael J. Schall","No.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then, I guess, just from a disclosure perspective, there's obviously your own disclosure, which you've made, and I guess once you reach 5% of the entity, you would have to disclose a shareholder perspective, correct?","Michael J. Schall","We will comply with the law, correct.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So then, therefore, the target has a minimum market cap of $1.5 billion because you haven't reached 5% yet, and potentially, you could be at 4.9%. And with normal leverage, the entity would be greater than $2.5 billion. And I think that just goes to Ross' question about it's a small position relative to the current size, but clearly, as a totality, if you were to move forward on the security, this obviously is a large investment at some point.","Michael J. Schall","Can't argue with your math.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then onto the last question, in a lot of M&A type scenarios, a lot of situations, people use derivatives, puts, calls in order to get their stake up. Do you have any of that today or is your position entirely built up of shares of common stock?","Michael J. Schall","We have no derivatives.","Operator","It appears we have no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the floor back to management for closing comments.","Michael J. Schall","Well, thank you very much for the spirited debate this morning, and we appreciate your participation on the call. Obviously, we're pleased with the results of the company during the quarter and our outlook for next year, and hey, we look forward to seeing many of you at NAREIT in San Diego in a couple of weeks.

As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded.","Statements made in this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs, as well as information available to the Company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found in the company's filings with the SEC. [Operator Instructions]","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you, Mr. Schall, you may begin.","Michael Schall","Thank you for joining us today, and welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call. John Burkart, Angela Kleiman and I will make brief comments and John Eudy is here for Q&A. I will discuss three topics: our third quarter results and preliminary thoughts about 2018, recent regulatory activities and an update on investment markets.","We are pleased with the Company's performance during the third quarter, carrying forward the momentum from the solid first half of 2017. Occupancy gains, other income growth and non-same-store properties contributed to the core FFO beat versus guidance. As noted last quarter, market rents peaked in June, two months early compared to normal seasonal patterns, and then declined throughout the third quarter.","On a year-to-date basis, same property market rents were up 3.5% from January through September, significantly lower as compared to the 6.3% market rent growth from January to June. The decline in year-to-date market rents during the quarter significantly reduced loss to lease, which was less than 1% at September 30 compared to 3.4% at June 30, 2017.","Two primary factors contributed to these market rent reductions. First, new apartment deliveries with substantial moving concessions continued at a robust pace during the quarter. Second, unadjusted total non-farm employment declined across most of our markets in Q3, reducing demand and mirroring the broader U.S. after outpacing the country for over five straight years.","As a result, given an ongoing apartment supply deliveries and lagging job growth, concession levels remained high and leasing incentives increased during the quarter, both undermining pricing power.","Essex remains focused on understanding supply and demand dynamics across each of our West Coast markets, with demand driven principally by job growth. We now forecast 2017 job growth to be about 1.4%, about equal to the United States but materially less than the 2.2% growth expected at the beginning of the year. Thus, job growth remains our primary concern as we head into 2018.","Fortunately, the economy, tech earnings growth and absence of significant layoffs suggest the slowdown in jobs is mostly related to a shortage of qualified workers, as tech firms continue to have large numbers of unfilled positions. We are also seeing significant infrastructure and new office construction across our footprint, with close to 11 million square feet or about 7% of existing stock under construction or renovation in San Francisco and San Jose and another 6 million square feet or 6% of existing stock in Seattle, both with substantial progress on pre-leasing.","When considering that the metros representing the Essex portfolio struggle to increase total housing stock by 1% per year, the employment growth to fill the new office buildings indicates that housing will remain in short supply. Additionally, since the end of the Great Recession, we have added nearly 2.1 million jobs across our footprint while adding only 451,000 new housing units. Accordingly, should job growth not reaccelerate, we believe that there is significant pent-up demand to support rent growth.","Switching to supply. We've had our research team recently drive all the major development sites in each market. We continue to face headwinds in certain submarkets, most notably downtown and West L.A., Sunnyvale and downtown Bellevue. We expect deliveries to peak in our markets over the next several months, with overall moderation of 5% to 10% in 2018.","The geographic mix of apartment supply will also change with deliveries in Northern California expected to decline over 25% and Seattle down about 5%. Finally, deliveries in Southern California should increase around 5% in 2018, with deliveries concentrated in downtown and West L.A. and downtown San Diego. However, we expect a 30% decline in supply in Orange County, which leads us to our initial thoughts about rent growth in 2018.","With the deceleration in job growth and choppiness of deliveries, concession visibility is more limited than at any point during the current cycle. Thus, we will continue to evaluate market conditions, especially job growth expectations, for the remainder of 2017 before providing guidance in early 2018.","At this point, we expect market rent growth to be mostly in line with long-term averages of around 3% for the Essex markets. In addition, market rent growth becomes revenue only when a lease is turned, and therefore, it will initially rebuild loss to lease, resulting in reported revenue for 2018 likely lagging market rent growth.","On to the second topic concerning new housing regulations in California. A package of 15 housing-related bills were passed at the end of September. These bills fall into several general categories, including: number two, more money for housing, which consists of a proposed $4 billion bond issuance and a real estate transaction fee; number two, building permit processing reforms to reduce time; number three, requiring developers to build more affordable housing; number four, forcing cities to plan for more housing; and number five, penalizing cities that do not provide enough housing.","These bills are summarized in a recent L.A. Times article published on September 29. Notably, none of these bills affect existing laws dealing with rent control, focusing instead on housing supply, process improvements and financing. Collectively, these measures represent a start of a process to address the severe housing shortage in California, although they are unlikely to make a meaningful change in housing supply in the next several years.","In addition, last week, a group containing labor unions and tenant rights groups filed a proposed 2018 ballot proposition that would repeal the California law referred to as Costa-Hawkins, which limits the types of rent control that can be enacted by local governments. While this could pave the way for more restrictive rent control laws, the Costa-Hawkins repeal movement is still a long ways away. Thus, we will continue to monitor the proposal and provide updates on future calls.","It is important to note that California's housing shortage and related issues of affordability and gridlock emanate from a variety of older laws which complicate any proposed solution. For example, the objective of California's Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 is to refocus housing construction on high density projects in urban areas and primary transit nodes, causing housing supply to be more concentrated and costly. The point is that solutions to the housing shortage will take time and significant investment to overcome at a level well beyond the scope of the regulations being discussed.","Finally, on to the topic of investment. We recently outlined transactions in the press release, and Angela will describe activity related to our co-investment program in a moment. Overall, we expect to be toward the high end of our $400 million to $600 million guidance range with respect to acquisitions. With regard to property dispositions, we should be close to our revised target of $300 million to $350 million, with $216 million closed year-to-date and two properties in contract that could close by year-end.","Regarding asset values overall, cap rates remain stable, A-quality property and locations continue to transact around a 4% to 4.25% cap rate using the Essex methodology, while we continue to see more aggressive buyers willing to pay sub-4% cap rates for select assets. B-quality assets and locations are generally 25 to 50 basis points higher, though often contemplate upside for redevelopment and\/or value-add activities.","Looking forward, we don't see cap rates changing materially, given positive leverage that is generated when cap rates average around 4.5% and seven-year, fixed-rate debt is approximately 3.6%. On the development front, we commenced the third phase of Station Park Green during the third quarter.","We also entered into a joint venture to develop a 269-unit apartment community located near Downtown San Jose, as outlined in the press release. In the fourth quarter, we expect to commence construction on a third project, which will meet our target for 2017. Even with these starts, our unfunded development commitment remains well under 5% of enterprise value, with minimal predevelopment exposure.","Finally, we remained active in originating preferred equity investments during and after the quarter, as outlined in the press release. As we approach $400 million in outstanding commitments, we will reevaluate the further expansion of the program, as well as possibly diversifying our funding sources.","That concludes my comments. Thank you for joining our call today. I will now turn the call over to John Burkart.","John Burkart","Thank you, Mike. Essex had a solid third quarter year-over-year same-store revenue and NOI growth of 3.1%. Our quarterly year-over-year revenue growth rate continues to decline as expected, due to both market conditions as well as difficult comps from last year when we adjusted our strategy to emphasize higher occupancy. While Mike outlined year-to-date changes in market rent growth, I'm going to talk about year-over-year market rent growth rates.","As we mentioned in the second quarter conference call, the seasonal peak in market rents was one to two months early. The result, of course, was that the year-over-year market rent growth deteriorated from about 3.5% in May for the portfolio overall down to below 1% in July 2017 compared to the prior year's period. Since the low in July, market rents for the portfolio have steadily increased to about 1.5% in September compared to the prior year's period.","The negative impact of the early market peak will continue as a headwind for revenue growth into 2018, due to the volume of leases that we signed during the peak leasing months with little to no increase over the expiring leases. Additionally, our loss to lease for our portfolio has declined from 1.9% in September 2016, down to 0.2% in September of 2017, with several markets having a gain to lease, such as San Diego, San Jose and Seattle.","Our operations team worked to increase occupancy by 30 basis points in the quarter to position our portfolio for the fourth quarter of this year. We increased the use of our concessions in the third quarter by about $725,000 over the second quarter of 2017. Our portfolio is now positioned well for the fourth quarter and our use of concessions will be reduced.","Finally, as a result of the devastating California wildfires, Governor Brown has signed an executive order which instituted emergency price controls for rental housing, amongst other things, throughout the state of California through April 2018. Although we are currently working through the details, at this point, we do not expect the executive order to materially impact our earnings.","Moving on to an update of our markets. In Seattle, job growth continues to slow relative to prior quarters but remains one of the strongest job markets within the Essex portfolio, generating year-over-year growth of 2.4% for the third quarter of 2017. While Amazon searches for a potential location for the second headquarters, the company continues to expand in Seattle in the third quarter, moving forward with construction on a fourth tower at the company's new South Lake Union campus and leasing an additional 1.3 million square feet of office space in Downtown Seattle.","In addition to Amazon, other tech companies such as Oracle, WeWork and Indeed expanded their combined office footprint by almost 500,000 square feet in Seattle CBD. In total, the Seattle MD has roughly 6 million square feet of office space that is currently under construction, of which 55% is pre-leased.","Median home prices continue to rise in the Seattle MD, with 14.1% year-over-year growth in the month of September over the prior year. Our year-over-year same-store revenue growth for the third quarter of 2017 was 5.7% for the CBD, 4.4% for the Eastside and 6.1% and 5.9%, respectively, for the North and South submarkets.","In Northern California, job growth for the Bay Area for the third quarter of 2017 averaged 1.4% year-over-year. San Francisco continues to be the Bay Area jobs leader, posting a year-over-year job growth of 1.8%, while Oakland and San Jose were up 1.5% and 1.2%, respectively.","In San Francisco, Dropbox, Facebook, Airbnb and WeWork added over 1.5 million square feet of office space to their footprint, while in Silicon Valley, Google continued to expand, completing a multi-year 52-property acquisition in Sunnyvale; Lyft announced a new office lease in Palo Alto; Microsoft announced plans to develop a light industrial center in North San Jose; and Future Mobility, an electric car company, leased R&D space in Santa Clara.","During the quarter, we completed our lease-up of Galloway in Pleasanton. And in October, we completed our lease-up of Century Towers in San Jose as well.","Moving down to Southern California. In Los Angeles, job growth in the county averaged 1.1% year-over-year for the third quarter of 2017, which is below the U.S. at 1.4%. The entertainment industry continues to invest in the West L.A. submarket, as movie network Starz leased 60,000 square feet of creative office space in Santa Monica and tech startup Snap partnered with NBCUniversal to create a new digital content studio based in Santa Monica to produce original programming, primarily for Snapchat.","Essex continues to perform well in this market, led by Woodland Hills at 4%, Tri-City in the CBD at 3.2%, Long Beach at 3.1% and West L.A. at 2.4% year-over-year growth for the third quarter of 2017.","Orange County job growth continues to slow down, with 0.2% year-over-year job growth in the third quarter of 2017. Office leasing activity, however, remained solid in Orange County, as year-to-date net absorption totaled 300,000 square feet, up 100,000 square feet from the prior quarter.","We continue to achieve solid rental results in Orange County market despite weak job growth and elevated supply, which we are still closely monitoring. Our South Orange and North Orange submarkets grew at 4.3% and 4.1% year-over-year, respectively, in the third quarter of 2017.","Finally, in San Diego, job growth in the third quarter of 2017 averaged 1.3% year-over-year and it continues to outpace both L.A. and Orange County. In the military pipeline, which may impact the large military sector in San Diego, HR 2810 was passed in both the House and Senate. This bill, which calls for more ships, aircraft and soldiers, authorizes an additional $696 billion in defense spending for 2018.","Office activity picked up, with Amazon leasing just over 100,000 square feet of office space in Universal City, with local job openings for game development, software engineering and data science. Our Oceanside submarket achieved 4.4% year-over-year revenue growth in the third quarter, while both North City and Chula Vista submarkets achieved 3.3% for the same period.","In closing, we are sending out renewals for the fourth quarter at an average of 3.4% for the portfolio. However, the renewal rates may be negotiated down as rents have peaked for the portfolio and our loss to lease is 0.2%. Currently, our portfolio is 96.8% occupied and our availability 30 days out is 4.6%.","Thank you. And I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Angela Kleiman.","Angela Kleiman","Thank you, John. I'll briefly review the full year outlook, then provide an update on our co-investment activities and conclude with comments on the balance sheet. For the full-year, we are reaffirming our same-property guidance of 3.6% revenue growth and 4% NOI growth at the midpoint. We are increasing core FFO by $0.06 per share to $11.89 at the midpoint. We are now projecting a 7.7% year-over-year growth in core FFO per share, which is now expected to be 370 basis points above the same-property NOI growth rate, as we continue to drive operating results to the bottom line.","Moving on to our co-investment activity. We formed a new venture, which acquired 8th & Republican in Seattle and 360 Residences in San Jose. We sold Madrid, a joint venture asset located in a non-core submarkets, at a low 4% cap rate, achieving a 12.3% IRR on an asset that is 35% leveraged.","We have previously discussed our plan to monetize the embedded promote within our private equity platform, and we have begun to do so subsequent to the quarter. We amended the Wesco I joint venture, where we negotiated a buy-sell and earned a $38 million promote. This promote is currently excluded from total FFO and net income forecast for the year, since we will plan to finalize accounting treatment in the fourth quarter.","We have reinvested the promote into the joint venture, thereby increasing our ownership to approximately 58%, which results in an additional FFO of over $1 million annually. This execution is a good example of our ability to source and structure unique opportunities in response to changing market dynamics and creating shareholder value. Overall, the private equity platform has performed well, and we will continue to look for ways to optimize return.","Turning on to the balance sheet. The balance sheet remained strong. Our BBB+ rating and stable outlook was recently reaffirmed by S&P, and our credit metrics continue to trend favorably. At quarter end, net debt-to-EBITDA improved from last quarter, now at 5.5 times, and our total debt-to-market cap remains low at 24.5%. With over $1 billion of liquidity on our line of credit and cash on hand, along with a light maturity schedule in the near term, we are well-positioned as we move forward to 2018.","That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Nick Joseph from Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Michael Bilerman","It's Michael Bilerman here with Nick. Mike, as I listen to you go through all these regulatory, which are pretty complicated, and all the onerous things that are going on in California, with local rent controls and you have the Costa-Hawkins and you think about Amazon HQ in Seattle, I guess, do you sit back and think about whether Essex needs market diversification, additional market diversification, away from those traditional West Coast markets?","And like I know going way back, there was the whole Town and Country thing that you were going to do in a joint venture and I know we've had some topics over time, it just seems a little bit more direct today. We certainly saw Avalon announce going into Denver and South Florida. So, I just want to take your temperature a little bit about where your head's at in terms of market exposure and maybe mitigating some of the risk, and I recognize there is a lot of opportunity in your West Coast markets, but how are you sort of underwriting that today?","Michael Schall","Michael, it's a great question. And the answer is we think about it a lot. We reviewed it in our strategic session with our board recently, and there are other markets that we compare and contrast ourselves against, and some of them, actually, almost all of them are on the East Coast, because of our basic formula, which is where is housing most supply-constrained and where are single-family homes or the housing alternatives, more affordable? We want to avoid those areas.","In other words, we want to be in markets where other types of housing is very unaffordable, making the transition from a renter to a homeowner a very expensive one. So those are the core elements of our strategy, along with, of course, job growth, which our view is job growth is the driver of pretty much everything. And we all like to talk about demographics and other things, but I think that, that's a sideshow relative to the job growth forecast.","So, as we evaluate the world, we are constantly looking, and I'd say we're compelled to go to other markets to the extent that we think that they will outperform over time the West Coast and the conditions on the West Coast. And at this point, we've concluded that we're going to remain here on the West Coast for a variety of reasons, and you have seen part of this. I mean, when tech is strong, it is incredibly strong.","The Town and Country scenario is not analogous, in our view, to today. Remember, back in the early 2000, you had the Internet boom-bust cycle. In connection with that, rents in the Bay Area went up something like 40% in two years. And so, we thought rents were way out of reach relative to the common consumer to a much greater extent than they are today, and therefore, we sought diversification. What we see now is we see yes, rents are somewhat unaffordable, but not nearly as unaffordable as they were then.","The job growth, the dominance of tech, we were also concerned about the tech markets back then, because as you all know, a bunch of companies went public, they had a few hundred million dollars in the bank, but they had no product, they had no income. They had no growth and so that was obviously very troubling to us. We now are in the markets with the top 10 tech companies that are headquartered here. And yes, they are having trouble. We've reported this over time. They're having trouble finding qualified people, but there is demand for people out there and job growth and these companies have enormous wealth.","I think we did the 10-year comparison and I don't know, don't remember exactly the statistics, but it's something like if you go back to 2005, the tech companies had a market cap, the top 10 public tech companies, had a market cap of about 50% of the top 10 non-tech, excluding the banks. And if you fast-forward 12 years, we, the tech companies grew 4.5 times, whereas the non-techs grew something like 40%. Tech is not going away. And if anything, the integration of tech into every component in society. You have this number of how many devices will have a IP address, for example, going from somewhere around 25 billion to 75 billion in the next five or 10 years. It's a pretty extraordinary thing.","So, we think betting against tech is probably a bad thing. We recognize that things don't follow a straight line. I've said this many times, there are bumps in the road. Things happen that are unanticipated, and we will endure that for a higher CAGR of rent growth over periods of time. And so, I actually have a chart in front of me that we prepared for our board that talks about what the CAGRs of rent growth are for the various different markets, and we still think that those are pretty compelling, and we still think tech is pretty well-positioned.","Michael Bilerman","Tech is not only on the West Coast, either, right? You think about where, how tech evolves, right, and it may not only be constrained to West Coast markets.","Michael Schall","No, for sure. We think people are smart. We think companies are smart. If they can't find their people on the West Coast, they will look at other places. We believe all of that is true. We believe that if the United States is not competitive, then the tech companies will find and set up operations overseas. We totally agree with that. But I don't think it's going away. I don't think the concentrations are going away on the West Coast, and there will be other beneficiaries.","I mean, I looked at a list of Alphabet companies the other day. If you look down the list, there's like 100 companies that fold in under Google and Alphabet. I mean, they're pursuing a lot of things. They're disrupting all sorts of things from the way we - taxis and travel and communication, and retail, obviously, and even governmental elections. I mean, it's a pretty extraordinary time and I don't think it's done. And so, we are not necessarily - we're not obviously a tech company, but we certainly are attached to them, attached to the tech train and it still seems like it's the right place to be.","Michael Bilerman","Just on Costa-Hawkins. Is this the most momentum you've seen towards a repeal? And then what's the expected timing of the bill or how do you expect this to play out?","Michael Schall","It's not a bill, Michael. It's a ballot proposition, so it's proposed to be on the 2018 ballot, and John Eudy is here. He spends a lot of time on the political side. And maybe I will defer to him, but I'll say that it still has a long way to go. It was just filed as a proposal last week, so we don't want to make such a big deal about it at this point in time. Let's see, in the process of getting it qualified and gathering signatures, see how much effort is behind it.","I think the key part, the point I was trying to make in the prepared remarks, is that the bills that were passed, the 15 bills related to housing, did not affect rent control. And I think that there is a, at least a recognition at the state level, that rent control has some very significant unintended consequences. The biggest, from my view, is that it reduces turnover. In other words, rather than people being forced out to cheaper housing outside the core areas, they are now allowed to stay in San Jose or San Francisco, but that significantly reduces turnover.","Reducing turnover, of course, creates greater scarcity for people moving into the area. It actually exacerbates and pushes rents up on those units. So, I think there's general recognition of this. Again, as I said in my prepared remarks, the proposal is being pushed by the labor unions and some tenant advocacy groups and therefore, it's really separated from the political process in Sacramento at this point. John, do you want to add anything?","John Eudy","The only thing I can add is, again, Costa-Hawkins repeal measure is before the Attorney General, it's got about 45 to 60 days to get qualified before they can start gathering signatures. And if you recall, this same measure went before the state legislature earlier in the spring and it didn't make it out of the committee, because the long and short is everyone recognizes that rent control does not solve the affordable housing issue at the lower end of the spectrum. And most of these housing bills, if you look at them, that have gone through are trying to address that segment.","And we believe, first off, that the repeal measure will likely be recognized for what it is. And we think that if it does make it to the ballot, we can beat it. And if it does get passed, in that event, it is not rent control. All it is, is it repeals a protection post-'95 product from possibility of rent control at the local jurisdiction. And if you look across the state, since 1995, very, very few examples of rent control being voted on by local jurisdictions were done for pre-'95 product, even though they could have been. From our radar, what we see is most cities, when you get down to it they recognize that it doesn't help solve the problem.","Michael Bilerman","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Gaurav Mehta from Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.","Gaurav Mehta","I joined the call and I'm sorry if you already talked about it. But for the new JV that was formed, can you talk about how much can the JV grow? And I guess, how to decide between what's being acquired by the JV versus what you guys acquire for your own?","Angela Kleiman","Sure thing. In terms of how we think about the JV business itself, it's really a function of how do we optimize our cost of capital. And so, we don't have a specific requirement to contribute an asset to a joint venture or to put it on the balance sheet. These are not, if you will, a platform acquisition vehicle. And so, we do have that optionality to arbitrage between where our stock price is and the cost on the joint venture side, which also benefits from leverage.","So, they're slightly higher levered, and so we can really optimize the cost of capital when it makes sense to do so. So as far as that piece, we try to - the self-imposed goal is to keep that business somewhere around less than, say, 20% of our total enterprise and right now, it's still well under that, as far as the component of our business. And so, it's truly just a way to arbitrage the cost of capital from that perspective.","The promote embedded in this platform itself, at this point, I think last, the end of last year, I had mentioned the preliminary estimate was somewhere between $35 million to $50 million. And then so fast-forward to this year, with the current run rate and more robust update, now that we were able to monetize one joint venture, we believe that there's another, somewhere between $40 million to $50 million of embedded promote available to us.","Gaurav Mehta","Okay. And I guess second question, could you talk about what you are seeing in the private equity market?","John Burkart","Can you repeat the question, please?","Gaurav Mehta","Can you talk about what you're seeing in the private equity market? Are you seeing more demand or less demand?","Michael Schall","Yes, this is Mike. I can comment on that. Well, the fact that we completed these transactions in the joint venture world at a price that we thought, as Angela said, was advantageous to the on-balance sheet cost of capital, means that, that business is alive and well. I think that institutions are struggling to find opportunities at a reasonable yield.","And I think 4% to 4.5% cap rates with some growth is being considered pretty attractive by the institutions, and that's what enables this type of transaction. So maybe there aren't as many institutions out there, but I would say that the ones that are out there are still very focused on the market and there still is a very active buyer pool within the institutions.","Gaurav Mehta","Okay. Thank you. That's all I have.","Michael Schall","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Juan Sanabria from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Juan Sanabria","Hi, maybe just a first question for Angela. You talked about the other income kind of driving some of the same-store revenues. Was hoping you can just expand on that, kind of quantify the impact in the third quarter and maybe year-to-date and what's driving that?","Angela Kleiman","Sure. On the outperformance in the third quarter, which is - if you're thinking about the, on the same-store perspective, we had last quarter guided to 2.8%, and we ended up at about 3.1%, so about 30 basis points higher on a same-store. But if you translate that to the actual FFO impact, out of the $0.05 beat, $0.02 is timing, so let's take that off the table.","As of $0.03, only $0.01 of that is really attributed to same-store and $0.02, other pennies, is non-same-store. And the components of the $0.03 beat are occupancy and the other income. And the other income component, that includes your typical other income, like parking garage income, some [indiscernible], so those are the key drivers. But it's mostly on the non-same-store and that's one of the reasons why we did not make any adjustments to our fourth quarter outlook.","Juan Sanabria","Okay. And then I was just hoping you guys could go through the new and renewals for the third quarter, and any data points you have on October. I think you spoke to maybe the renewal offers out, but if you can go through that again, that would be great?","John Burkart","Certainly, this is John. So, what I had mentioned is we had sent our renewals out for the fourth quarter and or are sending them, in the process of doing that in the 3% to 4% range. But it's important to understand that, as we mentioned earlier, our loss to lease right now is about 20 basis points. That means that the market is pretty near where our actual rents are.","And so, where exactly that ends up, some will get negotiated down, most likely, and we'll go from there, ultimately case-by-case. But from the market perspective, as I mentioned, the market, on a year-over-year basis, hit a low in August, but it's subsequently come back up, and so at this point in time, we're about 1.5% above where we were last year from a low that was below 1%.","So, from my perspective, the view is optimistic. We know last year we had a tough fourth quarter, so the comps get a little bit easier and so overall, we're doing good. Moving forward, it's not the extreme job growth era that we had a few years ago, but things are pretty solid out there.","Juan Sanabria","Do you mind going over the new and renewals by the major buckets\u2026?","John Burkart","Sure. So, SoCal, we have renewals going out at about 3.7%, and the year-over-year SoCal rents are around, just up around 1%. In Northern California, we have renewals going out also at about 3.7%. And in Northern California, year-over-year rents are up about 2.3%. And then in Seattle, we have renewals going out at about 4.1% and the new rents year-over-year are up about 1.3%.","Juan Sanabria","Okay. And what was the third quarter renewal number, though?","John Burkart","Third quarter renewals?","Juan Sanabria","Yes.","John Burkart","Third quarter renewals came in somewhere around 4% overall.","Juan Sanabria","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Dennis McGill from Zelman. Please go ahead.","Dennis McGill","Hi, just to close out that last question, so in the third quarter, new versus the renewals at forward new was what?","John Burkart","In the third quarter, new rents for the quarter were up about 2.5%. So, they've - yes, new rents in the third quarter were up - actually, let me rephrase that, sorry. New rents for SoCal in the third quarter were up about 2.5%. NorCal was about 20 basis points up and Seattle, about 2.7%. It went down. They peaked up and then came back down.","Dennis McGill","Okay, thank you. And then with respect to concessions, you talked about them being elevated today. How would the concession activity today compare to what you would have anticipated, call it, three, four months ago?","John Burkart","The concession activity in the third quarter was significantly greater in both the second quarter and the third quarter of last year. It really was across all markets, but the biggest area of impact was Southern California. So, to put it in context, last year, we had three assets that constituted 90% of our concessions in the same-store portfolio, and that was really focused around Downtown LA and West LA. This year, that broadened, so 10 assets constituted 80%, and that was also Downtown LA., West LA and then some into the Tri-City, Glendale, Pasadena. So, we saw much greater use of concessions in the SoCal area.","As we look in Northern California, the concessions were much more spread out. Its 21 assets constitute only 40%, the top 21 assets were only 40%. Basically, in Northern California, concessions were used as a look-and-lease, a tool to close, whereas in Southern California, in several cases, certainly around the downtown area, they were used just as part of the market.","In essence, a month free on some existing assets competing with all the new supply out there. When we go to Pacific Northwest, again, the spread was pretty significant. It was 13 assets at 75% of the total concessions, and that was really largely in the Eastside and North area, not in the downtown area. The downtown area has remained pretty strong as far as demand goes.","Michael Schall","Hey, John, let me just add one other thing. And Dennis, I think just connecting the dots back to the comments in the script, the third quarter this year we had actually net negative employment growth. And so, what happened, I think, is you have the same lumpiness of supply hitting the marketplace. And when you have net negative job growth, in other words, unadjusted total employment actually went down from June 30 to September 30, there is no demand being naturally created during the quarter.","And so, the concessions start pushing through the lease-ups and into the stabilized portfolio, which are the numbers John just mentioned. So, you still have the lease-ups with pretty robust concessions, that always happens. They're trying to hit 25 to 30 units a month in absorption targets.","If they can't get it from job growth, then they start trying to steal from, or they take from the stabilized communities, which is what is happening. But I think that this is, the difference between the quarters is that the stabilized communities were affected to a greater extent than in prior quarters.","Dennis McGill","That's very helpful, and I think you kind of answered my next question with that. But when you think about the comment of visibility on concessions maybe being more limited today than they've ever been, and yet at the same time, deliveries are expected to be down next year in the majority of your markets, as you walked through, so you would think that developers would be pushing less aggressively versus more as they get closer to the end. But you're actually seeing the opposite, but you'd put that more on the unemployment side than on the supply side?","Michael Schall","Yes, I mean again, that's a good question. I think developers have a different economic objective than the stabilized owners. The developers want to fill up the development and minimize free rent over the lease-up period, whereas - and as soon as they become stabilized owners, they're like us, they want to minimize concessions.","So, there are very different motivations and that is why this is so challenging to figure out. But our econ really study - our economic research group, and the way we view this stuff after doing this a few years is that job growth really matters. And we need job growth in order to create that demand.","And if you get a quarter where job growth actually turns negative, and we know what the lease-ups are going to do, they're going to continue to push to hit their absorption targets. When those two intersect, bad things happen. So, it seems like this time of year, many times in the past, you start seeing the deceleration theme that's happening out there.","And I would caution everyone on that a bit. And the reason why we didn't publish a full-blown 2018 S-16 is because looking at this time of year, weird things happen with rents because of the drop-off in demand. This is a normal thing. The extent of the drop-off this year is out of the norm, which is, leads us to believe well, is this an aberration or is this the start of a new trend.","And that really is the issue and really is the key to this. And so rather than sit here during what we know is the seasonally most weak period of time, and try to determine what that means for next year, we would, candidly, rather wait and see what happens and then we'll have a better view of the world after the next couple of months go by. And we'll get a feel of what happens after the New Year as we go into our Q4 call in early February.","So that was the logic behind it. I mean, we could have easily put some numbers down on a piece of paper, but we want to have conviction with what we think, and more importantly, we want to make sure the team is - stands behind and feels responsible for delivering what we put out there.","So again, this year's a little bit different, I think, than normal. And so, we just adjusted our overall program to consider the fact that it's different and we're - it's a little bit more challenging to figure out what's going to happen next year, and we have limited visibility. So hopefully, that makes sense.","Dennis McGill","Certainly, it does. Appreciate the comments. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Austin Wurschmidt from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Austin Wurschmidt","With regard to the slowing job growth and demand commentary you've had, what are you seeing specifically in terms of traffic at your properties or on your websites versus prior periods? And has it coincided, I guess, with the moderation in market rent growth that you've seen or is that more a function of the concessions?","John Burkart","No. So the answer to your question, what we've seen is traffic is actually up. It's probably up about 5% across the board from last year same period and good overall. But traffic is always a tough, tough metric to look at and try to get insight into the market, because is it that we're doing a better job with our marketing, is it that people are looking more - for more options, or is it that demand's up? It's hard to understand sometimes exactly driving it. And I think it's tough to understand what the root cause is, but traffic is definitely up for us.","Austin Wurschmidt","Interesting and then, I guess, just thinking about supply growth and decreasing in 2018, perhaps some of the heavy concessions starting to burn off. What level of job growth do you think you need to see market rent growth reaccelerate into the peak leasing season next year?","Michael Schall","This is Mike, and that is the million-dollar question, so you get an award, which is a piece of Halloween candy. It's a great question. I think next year is going to start pretty strong again. I think, again, when we look at the number of open positions at the tech companies, it still seems like there is very significant demand. It seems like the business plans for these companies are being developed now and we hit the New Year and those business plans get implemented, and they all involve hiring good people.","And so, I honestly don't - I think we're going to have a strong recovery into Q1. And the question will be whether we peak early again next year. And so, I think the first part of the year will be - will continue to be good. But you bring up another key issue, which is we do track how many of the lease-ups are starting to get into their final phases, and there's a pretty significant number of them.","For example, in Northern California, about one-third of the 7,600 units that are in lease-ups, are 90% or higher leased, so that should help quite a bit. LA., which has really been disappointing on the job side, and has pretty heavy supply, I don't see a whole lot of relief there. San Diego, which has been - which has really led Southern California portfolio, will actually accelerate in terms of lease-ups in the downtown.","So, it's a mixed bag, but I think we'll start pretty strong next year, and we'll have to wait and see how that trend goes into the summer. This year, it was interesting, we peaked early, but our year-to-date rents were actually higher when we peaked than the year before. So, every year is a little bit different, but I'm thinking that we're going to have a strong start to next year.","Austin Wurschmidt","And then one quick follow-up to your comment on leasing, lease-ups in their final phases, do you typically see concessions pick up as potentially looking to stabilize ahead of coming out of the peak leasing season, any thoughts there?","Michael Schall","Yes, I think, again, I think that the philosophy of the lease-ups is pretty consistent, and they're not done until they're done. In this quarter, again, we saw something that we haven't seen, which is we see some of the lease-ups hitting stabilization and dropping concessions, but continuing concessions.","We saw that in Seattle. We saw it in Downtown LA So in other words, the thing that I think is different is the use of concessions post-stabilization, again, I think exacerbated by the fact that you had no demand growth, is something that was new in the quarter that we haven't seen, and obviously, we hope that goes away very quickly.","Austin Wurschmidt","Appreciate the thoughts. Thanks guys.","Operator","Our next question is from John Kim from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","John Kim","It may be a little early to digest fully, but the House Republican announced tax bill includes a reduced cap in the mortgage interest deductions for new homes. Big picture, do you think this significantly impacts housing developments? But specifically, to Essex, do you track the percentage of departures that move into new home?","Michael Schall","We do. And I don't - John, do you have those numbers?","John Burkart","Yes, well, we have move-outs to buy a home, not specifically to new homes, and when we were looking to see where people were moving. In the third quarter, we were about 11% of people moved out to buy a home, which is in the long term - long-term average is about 11% as well. So that's not changing much, but we don't separate between a brand-new home versus [re-built] home.","Michael Schall","No, exactly. But the other number that is very substantial is the median home price increases on the West Coast, which are striking. California averages about 8.4% increase year-over-year in the median price home. Seattle was 14%. So, San Jose was 13%; Oakland, 12%. These are very striking numbers, which again, it goes back to our view of condos versus apartments.","As you know, we have about 8,600 apartments that are condo convertible. We have over the last several years spent significant amount of efforts to maintain the ability to convert to condos, and we've just taken one of our Senior Vice Presidents and basically said, \"Okay, this is your new job, to work on the condo side of the business.\" So, the - we think that all these things fit together in some level. And where the bad news is that rents aren't growing as fast as we want them to, the good news is that there is something else that perhaps can compensate for that and allow us to add value to the portfolio.","John Kim","Okay. And then John discussed this in his prepared remarks, but a lot of the new office developments in Northern California have been filling up in recent months. I realize that's not all expansions necessarily, but it seems like office tenants are optimistic. And I'm just trying to align that disconnect or the seeming disconnect between that optimism versus your expectations for slowing job growth.","Michael Schall","Well, yes, but again, job growth - we're talking like this is a horrible thing. We're still at the U.S. average. There are a lot of places that - the fact is that we had fantastic job growth and we've reverted back to the mean or the average. It's not that job growth has completely gone away. And so, we're maybe beating ourselves up a little bit too hard for that issue.","And again, we still expect job growth. We track, for example, the number of new positions, and one interesting change is Amazon's been between 8,000 and 10,000 new positions over the last couple of years and now it's down to 7,000 open positions. I don't know if that has something to do with HQ2 or not. We'll have to wait and see.","But again, there's still a lot of those positions that remain open and I presume that a lot of these things are going to be absorbed into the space that's being built currently. Again, we struggle to produce 1% of housing supply overall, and there has been and continues to be a lot of office construction that would imply that the demand for people is going to continue.","John Kim","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from John Guinee from Stifel. Please go ahead.","John Guinee","Okay, thank you. Two questions, so if I'm a tenant in one of your properties and I just got my renewal notice, which was an up 3.4, but I heard that the loss to lease was about 20 basis points, I should try to negotiate you down about 3.2%? Is that the best way to look at it?","Michael Schall","Wow, I hope you don't live in one of our buildings, John.","John Burkart","In the big picture modeling world which is why I refer to it that way for sure. On the practical side, it's obviously a case-by-case situation and the tenants are looking at the same things we are, which are what's going on with the comp and the quality of life that we provide them.","So, in the end, I know that a lot of people on the call here are trying to figure out how to model and that's why I'm trying to help give some perspective there. But on a practical basis, obviously, no matter what, people are always looking to try to come in and negotiate the rent. It's part of the American consumer culture.","But how it really works out is people are looking at what's going on in the comparable marketplace and the services that we provide, which I think are very great. I think our team works very hard, so we find, more than you may expect, more often than you may expect, perhaps from my comments, people will say this is a great value and that we appreciate it and we want to stay.","John Guinee","All right. And then my real question is if I listen to, I think what you said, Mike, about all these bills, which clearly, my eyes glazed over, at the end of the day, I think it means development oriented towards transportation-centric locations and much more density and much more urban locations, but correct me if I'm wrong. What does this mean to how much it's going to cost to build multifamily in the future? And do you expect these bills to generate more or less supply?","Michael Schall","Well, that is a great question and Mr. Eudy is here and he's got lots of thoughts on this, I know. But I will answer the first part of the question, which is California has been a sprawl type of world, where you build the next road 10 miles further out, you build 10,000 more homes, and that's how we're going to grow.","Sometime over the last 10 or 15 years, California said that's the wrong idea and it's really driven by the global warming concerns, et cetera, where California wants to be a leader on that. So, it passed in 2006 its Global Warming Solutions Act, which tries to mandate housing on, in the urban areas and on the transit nodes, and it is trying to execute on that plan.","Unfortunately, the transit nodes are not nearly plentiful enough. We need a lot more transit in order to make this transition work and the properties that will be built on the transit nodes and in the urban areas are almost by definition incredibly expensive. And cost of construction is going up pretty significantly. So, I'll leave it to John to fill in the next part of that question, but John, how difficult is it to find development deals now?","John Eudy","We've talked about this the last several quarters. Financial feasibility, at the end of the day, is what drives the bus on how much gets built. And while these bills are an attempt to try to help spur at least certain portions of the housing that could be created, but the reality is if you impose other restrictions, for example, the Wiener bill, SB 35, has an attempt to expedite the process to make it more ministerial, if you're zoned, to go quicker in the process, but then it has a prevailing wage requirement, which kills every deal, just about, outside of San Francisco, which he represents.","So, form over substance sometimes gets in the way of what this really is going to produce. And we try, with our cost of capital, to be as aggressive as we can, and you've seen our portfolio of development transactions go down a lot over the last couple of years. Not because we want it to, but because of the financial feasibility.","And that is going to be the natural backstop from things going hog wild, all of a sudden, you'll see an oversupply created. We see going in the opposite direction, see the tailing off of the supply deliveries that we're predicting are going to happen over the next two years significantly less than what they were in the last two years.","John Guinee","Great, thank you.","Michael Schall","Thank you, John.","Operator","Our next question is from Wesley Golladay from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Wesley Golladay","Good morning everyone. When you're looking at the supply forecast to go down next year, are you looking at that on a nominal basis or just from a weighted average - from a timing perspective? So, would late 2017 deliveries be impacting the 2018 number at all?","Michael Schall","Wes, it's Mike. Yes, they changed from last quarter. And again, we sent our people out, our econ research team out to drive pretty much everything in the marketplace to get a better idea of what's going to be delivered when. It's always very difficult to pinpoint it, because again, with high density buildings, you end up with the exterior done and the life safety done, but you don't know how much of the interior is done nor do you have access to the building in general.","So, it's going to continue to be something that we cannot do with great position and so we're not going to really be able to refine this until we know exactly what happens from quarter-to-quarter. But the analysis that we do is, again, driving all the significant buildings in the area and trying to get a sense for what happened. And so, from last quarter, having driven the sites, we thought that there would be net total about 5,000 units reduced.","Now, we're sitting - next year 2018 over 2017, now we're at 2,800. So, some of the units that we forecasted previously into Q4 have driven into Q1 of 2018, so - but still significant reductions overall. So Southern California, a little bit of an increase overall, about 5% increase overall, really dominated by San Diego and LA as well. But reductions, significant reductions, in Northern California and a smaller reduction in Southern California - I'm sorry, Seattle.","Wesley Golladay","Okay, but from a timing perspective, as far as are these, some of these are 2017 deliveries, are they coming in later this year and should we expect supply pressure to remain somewhat elevated in the front half of this year and then really get the big benefit next year in the second half?","Michael Schall","Okay, again caveat with what I just said, it's not perfect. In Southern California, Q4, around 6,500 units, Q4 2017 going to 5,000 units in Q1 and then up a little bit in Q2 and Q4 is at 3,700 units. In Northern California, Q4 2017 is about 2,200 units and Q1 2018, 2,200 units, about the same and then it drops off each quarter thereafter, such that Q4 is about 1,500 units. Seattle, 2,800 units in Q4 2017, dropping to 2,000 and then picking up in Q2, Q3 and then dropping in Q4. So, it's going to be a mix.","And again, we feel much better with the supply hitting when the jobs are hitting. I can't overemphasize this issue. When we're in the peak leasing season, in our peak leasing season, jobs are going, that's when most of the jobs are being created, and when the supply hits, there is natural demand being created to absorb some of that supply and so concessions don't go completely crazy.","When you get later on in the year, Q3 and Q4, depending upon when the peak occurs, that's when we start being concerned about more supply, because that has an outsized impact. You have zero, let's say, somewhere around zero demand growth, and you end up with supply and that is what softens the markets very quickly, again concessions 1.5 months, two months concessions being the key driver there.","Wesley Golladay","Okay, and then looking at the building blocks for the market to get normal trend, 3% growth. Would concessions be the biggest driver of that easy comp for next year? And at what point does the strong wage growth start to offset some of the weaker job growth?","Michael Schall","Again, we didn't talk about wage growth, but it continues to be strong and it continues to be better than rent growth. So, I think it's a slow improvement to the market. Rent-to-income ratios continue to go down. And interestingly, in our numbers, we now have a couple of Southern California markets that are higher rent-to-income than the Bay Area. So, it's interesting, it's changing, and the Bay Area's strong income growth is definitely helping.","Wesley Golladay","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And our last question today comes from Conor Wagner from Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.","Conor Wagner","On the preferred equity program, what's the type of demand you're seeing from developers and what is your - what's the spread on these deals?","Michael Schall","Conor, how are you? We're still seeing reasonable demand. It's not as strong. We expected it to drop off toward the end of this year, but we're still seeing reasonable deal flow. And in terms of pricing, there's been some competition coming into the marketplace. And as we start - as we approach high $300 million to $400 million in commitment, we may scale back our appetite a little bit or look for another funding source or a number of different things.","So, but I think right now, as we look at that business, we still see pretty good demand and we're also seeing cap rates move down, as we talked about. Obviously, rents are growing more slowly or NOI is growing more slowly than construction costs. That continues to be the case, which means these deals need more equity and which we're willing to provide as long as we're in a pretty safe position in the capital stack. So, I don't think that business is going to go away this next year, but I think it will slow down somewhat overall.","Conor Wagner","Okay, thank you. And then on the comments on the housing bills, given your assessment that they won't do much in terms of alleviating the housing shortage in California, but that we do see a new willingness on the part of the legislature to act, what are your thoughts going forward on what the next steps could to be or if they could - if a repeal of Prop 13 could be on the table to help fund some of this affordable housing or longer term, what do you think California will be doing, since you've acknowledged these bills really won't do much in the short term?","John Eudy","This is John Eudy. I'll take a stab at it, a difficult one to answer completely accurately, but the attempt right now is to fill the gap on the affordable side of the equation, because that's where most of the squawking is. And as you know, that California used to have a redevelopment agency in all cities up until 2011, that was disbanded by the governor, and that went away. It took away a primary driver to help the affordable folks produce housing.","I think that's where it's going to go. It's going to go in a direction to help, create an incentive, whether it's through this bond measure that's being proposed for the ballot next fall, or a combination of that and other incentives, to basically help create the housing that's needed.","And if it's attempted to take it out of the very thin pie that is available on the development side, that is making it difficult to make development deals pencil, it's not going to happen. It's got to be a form of public-private partnership, if you will, and yet to be seen what's going to exactly happen. But I'm sure you will hear a lot of chatter here in the next legislative session, because it is top of the radar for everybody.","Michael Schall","I think the LA Times article that I referred to in my comments said the $4 billion bond issuance could support about 14,000 homes and - but again, it has to be approved.","John Eudy","Right.","Michael Schall","It's going to be on the ballot, it has to be approved and then those homes have to be built. So, we're in favor of what the government has done. We acknowledge that there is an enormous shortage of housing here. We see it every day. There used to be, most of the traffic in the morning was on the freeways, now it's cutting through the neighborhoods and everything else because the freeways are so jam-packed. And I know down in your area, that happens as well, Conor. So, these are real problems.","And John Eudy and I talk about the effect of CEQA, which none of these laws - really, they touch CEQA, but they don't really directly address it. CEQA is the law, California Environmental Quality Act that allows people to object to and fight a proposed development, based on environmental matters, which includes traffic, noise, et cetera and the CEQA challenges, they're real.","The traffic is real and it's disruptive and everyone talks about the NIMBYs need to just go away. But it's not going to happen, because these are real issues. Even neighborhoods are jam-packed with cars now and it needs a resolution and I think back to Michael Bilerman's initial comment, why are staying in California, that resolution is many years away. We don't see anything in the short term that is going to make a dramatic impact on this. All of these issues require multi-pronged, multi-year approaches, with a whole lot of money, a lot more than what we're talking about.","Conor Wagner","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any closing comments.","Michael Schall","Thank you. Well, in closing, we appreciate your participation on the call, and we look forward to continuing the conversation at NAREIT in a couple of weeks. Thank you so much. Have a good day.","Operator","This concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time."],"8646":["Essex Property Trust (NYSE:ESS) Q3 2014 Earnings Call October 31, 2014  2:00 PM ET","Executives","Michael J. Schall - Chief Executive Officer, President, Director, Member of Executive Committee and Member of Pricing Committee","Erik J. Alexander - Senior Vice President of Property Operations","Michael T. Dance - Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer and Executive Vice President","John D. Eudy - Executive Vice President of Development","Analysts","Nicholas Gregory Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Operator","Greetings, and welcome to the Essex Property Trust, Inc. Third Quarter 2014 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs as well as information available to the company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found in the company's filings with the SEC. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you. Mr. Schall, you may begin.","Michael J. Schall","Thank you, operator. And welcome to our third quarter earnings call. As usual, Erik Alexander and Mike Dance will follow me with comments on operations and finance, and John Eudy and John Burkart are also in attendance for Q&A. I'll cover the following topics on the call: First, comments on Q3 and market conditions; second, an update on the cyber attack; third, investment activity; and fourth, our preliminary market outlook for 2015.","Before proceeding, for the Essex team members listening today, I would like to recognize your extraordinary contribution to the company's success. Your dedication and relentless efforts has allowed us to prosper despite the significant challenges we faced this year. Thank you. You are extraordinary.","On to my first topic, Q3 results and market commentary. We were pleased to announce another exceptionally strong quarter, demonstrated by our reported Core FFO of $2.16 per share. That result was $0.08 ahead of the midpoint of the guidance range provided in connection with our second quarter call and the components of out performance are noted in the press release.","In our coastal California Markets, our results reflect a persistent housing shortage, attributable to limited housing construction relative to the robust demand really related to job growth. While apartment construction has increased in response to strong demand, for-sale housing construction continues to significantly lag, a condition that we don't see changing until at least 2016. At this point, in past economic cycles, it is typical to see banks lower their lending standards for mortgages and construction loans, leading to more housing construction.","We're pleased that credit standards remain high to the benefit of both apartments and for-sale housing. While for-sale housing prices have accelerated, so have apartment rents and valuations, and so the significant premiums in value for condos relative to apartments have not yet materialized. We see this as a win-win scenario in which we'll enjoy escalating apartment rents and values until a meaningful premium materializes in condo valuations that will allow us to monetize our condo conversion optionality within our portfolio.","On to the second topic, an update on the cyber attack. For a variety of reasons, I won't go into depth regarding the cyber attack that we announced in September. However, I can say that our IT team identified suspicious activity in our network and that we immediately engaged a team of nationally-recognized experts to investigate the matter and assist with our response. Evidence exists that both the Essex and BRE systems experienced unauthorized access prior to the merger. At this point, incident containment has been achieved and our investigation into the cyber attack, remediation efforts and system enhancements are ongoing.","Recent media reports have highlighted numerous cyber attacks on corporate America, creating a new cyber security landscape. This new environment is described in a recent comment by FBI Director, James Comey to the effect that there are 2 kinds of big companies in the United States. Those that have been hacked and those who don't know that they've been hacked. We believe that changes we have made position us appropriately for this new environment.","Third topic, investments. Last quarter, we outlined an opportunity to grow externally, given lower debt cost and strong stock price. To date, we've completed $425 million in acquisitions and have another $180 million in contract with contingencies removed. We believe that cap rates remain relatively stable with the highest quality property and locations trading at a 4.0% to 4.25% cap rate, while B quality property in locations traded in the 4.5% to 4.75% cap rate range. Lesser quality properties traded higher cap rates, and periodically, a trophy property will trade in the high 3% cap rate range.","As suggested previously, our development strategy leaves us to be less aggressive as we progress through the economic cycle. As a result, we expect to start 3 apartment development projects in 2015, and we will ultimately reduce our annual development deliveries to between $300 million and $400 million per year. The primary reason for this is risk reward, that is, at this point in the cycle, there is a good chance that construction and capital cost can increase faster than NOI, making development less attractive.","Please join me in congratulating John Eudy and his team for being recognized as the Residential Developer of the Year by the Silicon Valley Business Journal.","Fourth topic is our market outlook for 2015. Page S-15 of the supplement provides an overview of the key housing supply-demand and economic assumptions, supporting our market rent growth expectations for 2015. The forecasted 5.6% overall growth rate per S-15 is likely less than the 2015 same-property revenue growth expectations for the Essex portfolio due to our healthy loss to lease and other factors that will be discussed in early 2015 as part of our guidance.","Thank you for joining us. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Erik Alexander","Erik J. Alexander","Thank you, Mike. We continued to be impressed with the focus of the operations team and are very appreciative of the results that have been delivered since the merger. We were able to build on a solid second quarter and deliver results beyond our initial expectations.","While occupancy remained strong during the quarter, rent growth continued to accelerate above expectations. We also continued to make great progress with our goal to reduce turnover and increase occupancy within the BRE portfolio.","Same-store occupancy and annualized turnover rates were nearly identical in the third quarter for the Essex and BRE portfolios. This represents a significant improvement in the BRE portfolio compared to the same period last year.","Turnover is down 8% and occupancy has increased 200 basis points since that time.","This performance is not possible without the dedication of the corporate teams that have pushed through integration challenges and fought off external distractions to deliver essential support services, allowing us to remain committed to our core business of creating communities people call home.","Despite challenges, we have been able to reprioritize some of the system integrations and remain on track towards a single operating platform. Thank you, Essex. I am proud to be a part of your high-performance team.","During the quarter, leasing activity accelerated faster than expected in almost every submarket. With respect to performance of the Essex portfolio, the strong results in July set us up for a great quarter. In fact, we achieved sequential scheduled rent growth of 2.8%. Strong revenue growth was fueled by increasing economic rent levels that were up nearly 9% year-over-year. These higher market rates helped push our renewal pricing to rate 7.4% higher than renewals achieved in the third quarter of last year.","Looking forward, we expect renewal activity to continue to support strong revenue results as offered rates through December are in the 6% range. As of yesterday, physical occupancy in the Essex same-store portfolio was 96.5%, with a net-to-lease of 5.4.%.","Now turning to the BRE portfolio. We've essentially eliminated the gap in financial occupancy that existed between the 2 portfolios. Earlier this week, the same-store portfolio for BRE was 96.5% occupied, with the net availability of just 4.5%.","Sustaining a high occupancy profile in the fourth quarter should allow us to maintain parity between the 2 portfolios as we restart renovation activity within the BRE portfolio.","For context, the Essex portfolio had an extra 20 to 30 basis points of vacancy due to renovation. Realizing these gains in occupancy and reducing turnover is a tradeoff to higher pricing, but really isn't any different than executing a new lease up. First you fill up the building in an accelerated pace, then you strategically stagger your lease expirations, stabilize your occupancy and then take advantage of the pricing power.","Scheduled rent in the BRE portfolio improved by 1.9% over the second quarter. Renewals during the quarter were above 5% and are expected to be at similar levels for the fourth quarter. While we do expect BRE and Essex portfolios to achieve similar renewal rates next year, renewal pricing in the BRE portfolio will be lower than the Essex for the fourth quarter and the first quarter of 2015 as we work through higher expiration profile and complete the revenue management system integration.","Now I'll share some thoughts and highlights of each region beginning with Seattle. Employment growth for the region remains very strong, and there are a few signs of slowing. Amazon now occupies 4 million square feet of space in the CBD, and is projected to double their footprint over the next 6 years. Such an expansion could result in over 20,000 new jobs at Amazon.","Boeing continues to grow as well and beginning construction on their wing factory in Everett. This facility is expected to be completed by May 2016, and will bring 2,000 new jobs with it.","We continue to monitor employment activity at Microsoft, as layoffs in the region now total approximately 2,700 jobs. But notably, there are roughly 1,400 open positions listed by Microsoft in the Seattle area. The status of contract workers is more difficult to track, but we have not experienced any unusual move-outs activity to date.","Rent growth in Seattle was positive in all submarkets and, once again, was led by the East side, with year-over-year economic rent growth above 9%. The CBD, where we have less exposure, predictably posted the lowest growth in the region due to peaking deliveries. However, absorption appears to be keeping pace with supply, thanks in part to Amazon's continued growth.","In Northern California, while spirits in the Bay Area have been buoyed by our San Francisco Giants Third World Series titles since the Great Recession, rent growth continues to be buoyed by job growth. Job growth continues to be at or better than expectations in the region, and notably, the information sector at San Jose was up more than 12%. That is seven consecutive months that the sector has achieved more than a 9% gain.","The future remains promising as well, given the commercial leasing is keeping pace with new construction. Our San Francisco and San Jose markets have each absorbed 1.8 million square feet of office space year-to-date, with roughly 50% of the under construction space in downtown San Francisco already spoken for. In Silicon Valley, Google recently agreed to lease all 1.9 million square feet of the Moffet Place development in Sunnyvale. This is in addition to Google's purchase of a 900,000-square-foot office project in Redwood City.","Economic rent levels continued to outperform in all submarkets with San Jose, San Francisco and Alameda leading the way with year-over-year growth north of 10%. These markets have had little trouble absorbing new supply thus far in 2014 despite relatively higher deliveries compared to prior years.","Our Mosso and Radius projects averaged over 40 leases per month during the quarter. Therefore, we continue to believe that demand is comfortably outpacing supply.","Now to Southern California. The region continues a path of steady recovery. September job gains were in line with our forecast, although Los Angeles came in a little lower than expected, while San Diego added more jobs than anticipated. We are encouraged that Los Angeles' unemployment rate has actually dropped below 8%, and there continue to be gains in the higher-paying professional and business services sector.","We are optimistic that solid job growth in San Diego, coupled with our property's improving performance are signs of a sustained recovery in that market.","The commercial activity remains positive with modest improvements in office leasing, and Los Angeles receives some good news with the passage of a bill that will more than triple annual state film and television tax credit. The economic incentive should have a meaningful impact on local production activity over the next 5 years.","Economic rent growth improved during the quarter. And at the end of September, year-over-year economic rents were 6% higher in Southern California. The pace of leasing at our new developments is also encouraging sign for Los Angeles as Dylan and Wilshire La Brea averaged 38 and 47 units per month, respectively, during the quarter. With modest job growth and limited new supply, we should continue to get meaningful revenue contributions from Southern California.","So while we must still successfully complete our systems integration, we believe that consistent strength of our markets will enable us to deliver impressive full year results for 2014, and we will enter 2015 with a lot of confidence, supported by favorable macroeconomic conditions. Thank you for your time. And I'll now turn the call over to Mike Dance.","Michael T. Dance","Thanks, Erik. Today, I will provide comments on our third quarter results, the revisions to our merger and integration cost guidance and we'll close with an update on our balance sheet.","As Eric and Mike mentioned, we had another outstanding quarter, in which Core FFO exceeded the midpoint of our guidance by $0.08 per share or a 13% increase over the third quarter of 2013.","The out performance in the quarter was primarily due to better-than-expected property operations and the strong development lease-up activity in both the Essex and legacy BRE portfolios, as the growth in new jobs minimize the impact of the new supply delivered in the quarter.","The 6% sequential increase in Southern California's operating expenses was predominantly caused by utility expense increasing by $350,000 from seasonal water use and $225,000 increase in property taxes. In California, the new property tax year begins on July 1 and the sequential increase on property taxes of 4% was due to assessments in Southern California returning to their adjusted Proposition 13 valuations after benefiting from the temporary declines and valuations from the recession. These sequential increases in Q3's operating expenses were expected and included in the guidance provided on our second quarter call.","As a result of the strong third quarter results, we have increased our same-property revenue growth by increasing the midpoint 30 basis points to 6.9%, and our same-property net operating income growth by 40 basis points to 8.5% at the midpoint.","For the full year, we have revised down the merger and integration cost estimate by approximately $19 million at the midpoint. We expect to realize between $5 million to $8 million of savings in merger and integration cost and expect to incur the remaining integration cost in 2015.","Yesterday after our earnings release, Essex received notice that our Wesco II preferred equity investment of $95 million was prepaid. The redemption fee recorded in the fourth quarter will increase our guidance for total funds from operations by $5 million. However, this prepayment penalty will be excluded from Core FFO. The loss of our preferred equity investment of yielding 10.1% and our asset management fee of 1% will largely be offset by the pipeline of new preferred equity investments and the fourth quarter real estate acquisition which Mike referred to earlier.","I will now conclude with brief comments on our balance sheet. At the October -- at the end of October, we have approximately $750 million available on our unsecured line of credit. The legacy BRE Phoenix assets held for sale of approximately $108 million should close early in 2015. We have approximately $100 million of debt coming due in the next 12 months, and our share of the unfunded development commitment is approximately $300 million.","Overall, Essex is in great position financially as we head into 2015. This ends my comments. And I will now return the call back to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Nick Joseph with Citigroup.","Nicholas Gregory Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","[Audio Gap] conversion optionality in the portfolio. So I'm wondering if you can give kind of a percentage around where you see that in the -- both the Essex legacy and the BRE legacy portfolio.","Michael J. Schall","Nick, I missed the first part of that question, but I think you were asking about where we see the premium of condo versus apartment values. Is that right?","Nicholas Gregory Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","That's part of it, and then kind of what percentage of your portfolio has that condo quality.","Michael J. Schall","Well, in California, I think the key issue is whether we have the entitlements to sell these condos. Most California cities are very protective of the rental stock. And as a result of that, they do not allow convergence of apartments into condos. The numbers that we had in our Investor Day about a year ago were somewhere in the 6,000 to 7,000 units of apartments that our condo convertible not all of immediately, but there's a process that we think that we can convert into condos and sell. In terms of the premium of condo values over apartment values, it varies very widely by market. And Southern California, for the most part, I'd say, at 0. And in Northern California, really specifically San Francisco, it's in the 10% to 15% range.","Nicholas Gregory Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then just in terms of operations. Are you running into your self-composed cap at any of the assets right now in terms of the rental rate growth?","Michael J. Schall","Yes. Rental rate growth, yes. We have a self-impose on renewals. We have a self-imposed 10% cap on our renewal rates. And again, it goes back to -- it's not in a vacuum that can sound like a limiting factor. The purpose of the cap is really twofold. It's, one, to give existing residents a little bit more favorable transaction relative to people coming in through the front door, and 2, to increase the renewal percentage so we turn fewer units. So there's -- we believe that there's a payback in how we manage that part of the equation. And, I guess, there's a third potential benefit, which is I think the local government entities would consider that a reasonable approach as it relates to the need for rent control type ordinances.","Operator","The next question is from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","So first question goes to BRE. And I'm trying not to do a multi-part to squash my second question. So let me just ask it this way. You guys have done a phenomenal job at bringing up the BRE portfolio to the Essex standard in 2 quarters. So you also spoke about the same point of maybe restarting the redevelopments. So just sort of curious, Mike D, not asking for 2015 guidance, but as far as more upside out of BRE, is it -- should we think about it more from integration, which it doesn't sound like it sounds like you guys have maxed at all or is it more from the external stuff like redevelopment? Where do you think that we'll see more of the upside of the BRE portfolio?","Michael T. Dance","I think it both looks good. I think there's still integration opportunities and the renovations, I think, will put up impressive returns.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. So is there -- but, I mean, if you guys are already 140, if you guys have already gotten it up to the Essex's occupancy and it sounds like the rents are similar or the rent increase are similar, where's the other operational stuff that we can look towards?","Michael J. Schall","Alex, it's Mike here. Let me take a shot at that, and Erik may want to chime in here at the end. I think that we've got the let's call it the low hanging fruit and that we have normalized the occupancy and taken some of the immediate steps that we can take. But in our experience, revenue management is a process. And it will take a couple of years to get all of that dialed in. And by that, I mean, for example, we amenity-price every single units. And so I think that we still need to work through the amenity pricing that was done on the BRE portfolio. There's a lot of, I think, opportunity there just because they didn't have enough time to fully implement LRO. And we've done it now a few times and those of you that go back far enough with us will remember that it wasn't always so perfect on our case either. So it takes time to fully dial that in. There's some opportunity and expiration management as well. We took on the expiration that we had in place on April 1. In general, BRE had shorter lease terms, somewhere around 10 months. And Essex was a little bit longer than that. And so we think there are some opportunity there. On the redevelopment side or the value add part of the portfolio, again, we approached it differently. And so we stopped the -- we have of the BRE -- on the BRE side, and are going to reimplement it. I think there are some unique opportunities here because their properties are somewhat newer than the Essex portfolio, and therefore, there's less of the basic infrastructure, we have plumbing and roofs and that type of thing and more things that the customers see, which are kitchens and baths and that type of improvements. So I think there's good opportunity in both areas. And we're excited about the opportunity. We think we'll be able to unlock some additional value there.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. And the second is on the office conference calls for San Francisco, a lot of talk about the impact of Prop M on limiting new office development. Is there any inhibitor on your ability to develop in San Francisco that would impact multifamily? Or there basically are no restrictions on the ability to continue to build new product in San Francisco as long as it pencils?","Michael J. Schall","San Francisco is a difficult place to do business, and as you can imagine and there are always challenges on the entitlement side. So there's no Prop M equivalent to worry about, but there are other challenges to get deals approved, which always limits supply in general.","Operator","Our next question is from Dave Bragg with Green Street Advisors.","David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","So we've covered a lot as it relates to the BRE topline synergies, but can we talk about the expenses? It looks like you have a 69% operating margin on the Essex same-store portfolio. That's about 400 basis points better than the BRE legacy portfolio. We understand that maybe some of these can't be closed due to property taxes. What is that opportunity though?","Erik J. Alexander","Dave, it's Erik. Again, the focus has been on the revenue side. And we've tried to consolidate some of the expense activities. But there's definitely more opportunity there as we reorganize procurements, as we take advantage of some of these synergies where we have these now bigger clusters of properties. We've started some of the job sharing. But again, that won't be fully implemented until probably late next year as we utilize some scheduling tools and so forth. So I think we still have a fair amount of opportunity there.","David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Would you care to try to compare a same-store expense growth rate for the Essex legacy portfolio versus that of the BRE portfolio? How much difference would there be between the 2 going forward?","Michael J. Schall","David, it's Mike Schall. We're in the middle of the budgeting process, and that process ends this December when we present our business plan to the Board in early December. So I think you've caught us sort of mid-cycle on that. But as a general statement, I don't think there's -- other than the things Erik said, there is some things in the BRE portfolio that, over the longer term, I think falling to the merger synergy of things. If you have, as I mentioned on one of the other calls we've got 10 properties within a couple of miles of one another. So what are the synergies resulting from that? We have not -- we don't have a number for that. And I don't think that they fallen to the low hanging fruit category. They fallen to the reorganized and become more efficient. And I think it probably benefits both sides. I think the key difference here is that you have the proper team revaluation as you alluded to on the BRE portfolio, and it's a fairly large number on the Essex portfolio. So I wouldn't see, other than those comments that I made, a significant difference between the expense growth rate overall. And I think, again, our focus is going to be on the combined synergies lowering the overall growth rate of expenses of the combined portfolio. And we're not going to be all that sensitive to which side it comes from.","David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","And as it relates to the JV of the BRE assets, can you talk about how those operations at that pool the BRE properties is just fairing ?","Michael T. Dance","In terms of...","David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Well, you took out, I think, some of the lower quality BRE assets were put into a joint venture. And the results that you're seeing at remaining BRE same-store properties are wonderful. But how -- as we think about the old BRE portfolio, it would be helpful to hear how the revenue growth is trending at the JV property, too.","Michael T. Dance","David, this a Mike Dance. They're doing very well. We had about 7% rent growth in that portfolio. So it did as well as the rest of the portfolio.","David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Great. And last question for Mike. You suggested that development activity on year end should slow going forward. Are your JV partners on the same page there? Is this potentially indicative of less new start activity in your markets? Or are your partners, just as example of other capital interest and West Coast development, do they retain an interest in doing more?","Michael J. Schall","I think, David, there's plenty of capital out there. I don't think that's the limiting factor. And if you look at our multifamily supply, '15 versus '14, it's up a couple of thousand units, 36,500 for '14, 38,350 for '15. So we expect about the same amount of supply overall within the areas that we operate. I think the limiting factor is a couple of things. In certain areas, I think you have pressure on labor cost. There is some other cost increases that are part of that, and they're putting pressure on cap rates. So getting cap rates to that, that clearing price of somewhere above a 5%, 5.25%, 5.5% type cap rates measure today, and stabilizes somewhere in to 6% to 6.25%. So it's hard to make those numbers work when you're fighting against increased cost. And I think of this -- the cities are somewhat less excited about a lot of development. I think that there's a factor there, I note San Francisco, there's some pressure to increase the low income component to up to 30%, whether or not that actually happens on all future deals, I don't know. But that will have a very significant impact on apartment construction in San Francisco. So our expectation is that the multifamily supply remains about the same, and we'll see what happens. But I think that's probably good for the next year or so. Everyone's asking us when we expect supplies to peak, and the answer is we don't exactly know. It seems like there's plenty of apartment supply in Seattle that's a concern. But in California, we think we're overall -- we remain limited supply level for the next couple of years.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Jana Galan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just following up on your comments on development. Curious where do you see stabilized yields for the current projects? And what are you projecting for the forward starts next year?","Michael J. Schall","We're projecting 3 starts next year, 3, maybe 4 starts next year. All of them in the underwritten today, based on the rents today between 5 and 5.25, and that means a stabilizing somewhere around 6 to 6.25, something like that. Did that answer your question?","Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes.","John D. Eudy","Just 1 clarification on the units being delivered this year and next year that are already under construction. They're in the 6 to 6.5 range on today's numbers going to a 7.","Michael J. Schall","Exactly, on the deliveries.","John D. Eudy","On the delivery.","Michael J. Schall","Maybe I misunderstood.","John D. Eudy","She asked both, I think.","Michael J. Schall","Did she -- okay. Well, I was answering starts, John was answering deliveries. So just to clarify.","Operator","There are no more questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Schall for closing comments.","Michael J. Schall","Thank you, operator. In closing, we appreciate your participation on the call, and happy Halloween to all of you. We are obviously very pleased with the results last quarter and the outlook ahead.

As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs, as well as information available to the company at this time.

When we get to the question-and-answer portion, management asks that you be respectful of everyone\u2019s time and limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you. Mr. Schall, you may begin.","Michael Schall","Thank you for joining us today, and welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call. John Burkart and Angela Kleiman will follow me with comments and will end with Q&A.","Our first quarter results represent a good start to 2019. Core FFO per share grew at 4.5% year-over-year and was $0.04 ahead of the midpoint of our guidance, primarily due to solid operations, which John will discuss in a moment.","Market rent growth was up 3.1% from the start of the year through March, which was in line with our expectations. As such, we are not making any changes to our full-year rent or revenue assumptions at this time.","We are pleased to be raising our 2019 core FFO per share midpoint by $0.05 following our first quarter results as a result of great execution from Essex team. Angela will provide more detail on the guidance increase in a moment.","Taking a broader look at several economic indicators, we are feeling pretty good about the setup for Essex in 2019. Job growth, both nationally and in our metros decelerated earlier this year, slightly underperforming our annual expectations on Page S-16 of the supplemental. The most significant underperformance was in Southern California, some of which may be attributable to year-end market volatility, the government shutdown, and cost reductions related to the merger of Disney and 21st Century Fox.","Less robust economic conditions both in the U.S. and globally has tempered inflation expectations and reduced the chances that the Fed will raise short-term rates in 2019. In our experience, lower interest rates and steady economic growth generally provide an attractive environment for NOI growth and asset value appreciation.","While we are closely monitoring job growth, we are encouraged by other economic indicators in the Essex markets such as office construction, venture capital investment, job listings, and personal income growth, which are all either accelerating or trending at healthy levels. Major developments of large-scale office projects continue especially in our Seattle and Northern California markets.","Under construction office projects from San Francisco to Silicon Valley aggregate almost 14 billion square feet, while Seattle is adding approximately 8 million square feet both representing greater than 5% of existing stock.","Venture capital investment recently reached a record level in the Bay Area with over $60 billion invested in the region on a trailing 12 month basis supporting continued strength for the Bay Area economy. Several West Coast-based unicorns are expected to complete their IPO in 2019 and much of this liquidity is likely to be reinvested back into the local economy.","We continue to track job openings in the Essex markets for the 10 largest public tech companies which recently reached over 26,000 job postings, representing a 33% increase in the past year and the highest level since we started tracking this information several years ago.","Amazon's job openings in Seattle also reached an all-time high with over 11,000 openings. The competitive environment for talent on the West Coast is driving average income higher. For example, growth in per capita personal income in the Essex markets grew over 6% last year, and is expected to remain strong, growing at a similar level in 2019.","With income growth outpacing rent growth, affordability has improved in all of our markets, as compared to one year ago. Each of our markets rent to income ratio with the exception of Ventura is now within the upper end of the desired range, and San Francisco now has a rent to income ratio of 26.4%, which is below its long-term average for the first time since 2011.","In summary, against the backdrop of low interest rates, several of the most relevant economic indicators in California and Washington suggest healthy demand for rental housing. Fast growing and innovative companies continue to attract top paying talent from across the country, leading to higher average incomes and improved rental affordability.","On the supply side, we've seen no noticeable change from the commentary provided on our last quarterly update. We continue to see delays in development deliveries, which are already factored into supply estimates on Page S-16 of the supplemental. We are aware that other data providers have much higher development delivery estimates for the Essex markets and believe that their estimates will be lowered as we proceed through 2019.","In addition, perspective yields on new development deals continue to decline as the tight labor markets are causing construction cost increases that exceed rent growth. Overall, our delay adjusted supply forecast for 2019 have not changed.","Looking a bit further into the future, we are encouraged by our recent decline in residential permits in our markets as shown on Page S-16.1 of the supplemental. Residential permits which include both multifamily and single-family housing have fallen about 10% from the peak we recorded in the second quarter of 2018.","While we can't be certain the permitting activity will not reaccelerate, we suspect that the recent decline is attributable to financing and other consequences of compressing development yields. The decline in permits is a good indication that capital is responding to lower development returns, which should lead to lower multifamily supply beginning after 2020.","Turning to the investment markets, we've seen no significant change to cap rates for A or B quality properties. As I've mentioned in prior quarters, cap rates generally do not move quickly and are mostly a function of capital flows. As such, we try to create value for our shareholders by arbitrating the differences between public versus private market pricing. We took advantage of this disconnect in the fourth quarter of 2018 by selling 8th and Hope, a Class A, high-rise property located in Downtown LA at an attractive cap rate and buying back the stock at a discount to NAV.","In the first quarter, we saw a nice improvement in our cost of capital and use this opportunity to buy out our partner's interest in One South Market at an accretive yield. One South market is a Class A high-rise property located in the heart of San Jose and can be seen on the cover of this quarter's earnings supplement.","With Google in the early stages of developing over 11 million square feet of office space near downtown San Jose, we are happy to increase our exposure to a high-quality asset and a great long-term market.","Given our improved cost of capital last quarter, we are actively looking for acquisition opportunities and we continue to have an ample preferred equity pipeline. We will continue to underwrite assets with the same diligence and process that have helped us succeed in the past.","Lastly, regarding California regulatory matters, there are many moving parts as a variety of state and local government officials attempt to balance the need for more housing to address chronic shortages with the expanding rental protections. We will continue educating others with respect to the unattended consequences of rent control while helping to create housing at an attractive risk-adjusted return to our shareholders.","With that, I'll turn the call over to John Burkart for some more color on the quarter and our markets.","John Burkart","Thank you, Mike.","We started off the year strong achieving year-over-year 3.1% revenue growth for the first quarter which exceeded our expectations due to one-time other income in March. At the Citi Conference, we published our January and February preliminary revenue growth rate of 2.7% and we noted that are scheduled rent for the same period grew approximately 3%. That trend continued into March 2019 where scheduled rent grew 3.1% over the prior year's period.","The variations in revenue growth rates relate solely to other income. March 2019, other income was elevated due to a combination of line items including lease break fees, one-time filming income, and early utility collections related to the spike in natural gas cost in January.","Occupancy for the same-store portfolio in Q1, 2019 was 96.9% or 20 basis points below the prior year's period as expected. We continue to see opportunities to create more value in other income line items.","In the first quarter of 2019, our parking revenue is up 14.2% compared to the prior year's period and we expect that trend to continue. Our expenses came in higher than expected, due in part to one-time costs related to the water and snow damage from the heavy storms in January and February.","Additionally, our gas expense spiked due to both an increase in the use and rates caused by the colder than normal West Coast winter weather. Fortunately, some of the utility cost increases were offset by declines in electricity costs related to our green initiatives, including the installation of PV panels at over 50 properties.","We continue to make progress towards our digital transformation objectives, completing the implementation of work day, a paperless mobile HR platform that will enable - that will eliminate printing and trips to the office to sign documents reducing labor while playing a foundational role in our steps to success program which is focused on growing employees careers and related compensation at Essex.","The rental market was strong as we expect in the first quarter. However, it's slowed down since the quarter end with SoCal being the weakest. It's hard to say what the driver is with such a small sample period although it appears to be mostly supply related as the weakest markets are L.A. and Alameda Counties.","Now, I'll provide an update on our markets. Seattle employment growth continues to outpace the U.S. and other major East Coast markets posting year-over-year growth of 2.2% for the first quarter of 2019. Amazon continues to grow their presence in the East side, announcing plans to move the business division from Seattle to Bellevue by 2023 as well as pre-leasing and potentially buying an additional 900,000 square feet office space in Bellevue.","In Downtown, Apple and Oracle are vying to sublease one of Amazon's under construction towers. Dropbox executed a pre-lease with the potential of adding 5,400 jobs to the downtown market.","The north and south submarkets continue to lead in year-over-year revenues for the first quarter posting 3.3% and 5.3% growth respectively followed by the East side with 2.5%, and Seattle CBD improving with 1.3%. Loss to lease was 1.1% at the end of March.","On a trailing fourth quarter basis, Venture capital funding hit a new 20-year high in the Bay Area. So far in 2019, 3 Bay Area tech companies Lyft, Pinterest and Zoom Video have completed their IPOs and others such as Uber and Postmates filed for IPOs with many more IPOs in the process. The liquidity from the IPOs of some of these uniforms will both free up funds for additional investments and provide capital to certain employees who often create their own startups.","Office expansion has been robust. YouTube kicked off an environmental study for 2.4 million square feet of mixed use development in San Bruno. Facebook revealed plans for the 1.8 million square feet mixed use development in Menlo Park. LinkedIn and Alibaba increased their combined footprint by a little over half of million square feet in Sunnyvale, and in San Jose Google pre-leased another 700,000 square feet office park currently under development.","Our Q1 year-over-year same-store revenue growth was led by our San Mateo and San Jose submarkets with 4.5% and 3.8% growth respectively followed by San Francisco at 3.3%, Fremont at 3%, Oakland at 1.9%, and Contra Costa at 1.7%. Loss to lease at the end of March was 1.9% for the Bay Area.","Continuing South, Southern California posted a weak quarter for employment growth averaging only 90 basis points for year-over-year Job growth or half the national average in Q1 and well below our 1.3%, 2019 estimate on the S-16 in the supplemental.","In 2018, the BLS showed lower employment growth for San Diego, Orange County and Los Angeles and then revised these markets up between 50 and 100 basis points with the March 2019 prior year revision.","Los Angeles actually performed below the Southern California average posting 70 basis points growth for the period. One of the employment categories that showed weakness was Motion Pictures, which was down approximately 10% during the first quarter. It is unclear what impact, if any, the Disney 21st Century Fox Studio merger maybe having a local employment. However, they have stated that they expect to achieve $2 billion in cost synergies, which will include staffing reductions.","At the same time HBO expanded their headquarters in the market adding just over 110,000 square feet in Culver City. Workspace companies such as WeWork, Knotel and Spaces expanded their combined L.A. footprint by over 300,000 square feet. Year-over-year revenue growth in Q1 was led by West L.A. at 4.6%, Woodland Hills of 3.5% and Tri-Cities at 3.2%. L.A. had a loss to lease of 1.1% in March.","Although Los Angeles Q1 revenue growth was very strong, we've seen a reduction in the year-over-year market rent growth rates, which may be related to the combination of lower employment growth, and the aggressive lease-ups in Downtown L.A. with some lease-ups offering concessions that exceeded 8 weeks free rent.","In Orange County, jobs in Q1 grew 90 basis points year-over-year, with the largest gains in professional business services. In January, the BLS posted 2018 benchmark revisions which erased all prior year's reported softness in this market.","On revenues, the South Orange submarket continues to lead with 2.4% year-over-year growth in Q1 and the North Orange at 1.8% for the same period. We ended March with a loss to lease of 60 basis points.","Finally, in San Diego, year-over-year, job growth was 1.4% in Q1. Year-over-year revenues in Q1 were led by our Oceanside submarket with 4.8% growth followed by Chula Vista with 4.3% and North City with 2.9%. Currently, our portfolio is at 96.8% occupancy and our availability, 30 days out is at 4.3% with loss to lease of 1.1% for March, 2019.","Thank you. And I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Angela Kleiman.","Angela Kleiman","Thank you, John.","I'll briefly comment on our first quarter results and increase to the full-year guidance and provide an update on our investment and capital markets activities. I'm pleased to report that our first quarter core FFO per share grew 4.5% to 3.23% exceeding the midpoint of our guidance by $0.04 which resulted mostly from one-time revenue items, as John Burkart highlighted earlier.","For the full year, we are raising the midpoint of our core FFO guidance by $0.05 per share to 13.08. This is primarily driven by a more favorable capital markets conditions as the pricing of our first quarter bond offering was better than originally contemplated in our guidance. Overall, this revised midpoint equates to a 4% growth in core FFO per share for 2019.","Moving on to investment activity, during the quarter we originated two new preferred equity investments which comprised of a $24 million investment fully funded at close, and a $36 million investment funding in July and will not before we funded until the end of September.","Year-to-date we had early redemption in two preferred equity investments totaling $27 million. The typical term of these investments is three years, but the timing of our pay-off is often tied to the developers, ability to obtain long-term financing or sale of the projects which can result in lumpy repayment and can be difficult to anticipate.","Turning to capital markets activity. During the first quarter, - our cost of capital improved as the tenure dropped by over 50 basis points since last November. We took advantage of these favorable conditions by issuing $500 million of unsecured bonds at an average rate of 4%. The proceeds were used to repay secured debt that has matured through April over this year.","For the balance of the year, we plan to repay approximately $400 million of debt, which consist of $110 million maturing this year plus $290 million maturing next year, but can be repaid early with no prepayment penalties. The reason for making early repayments is the cash benefit, although the effective rate on this $290 million debt is 3.8%. The cash rate is 5.5%, which will allow us to generate over $3 million of additional cash savings on an annual basis. We have access to a variety of capital sources, and we'll continue to monitor the capital markets to optimize the refinancing. With over $1 billion in availability on our line of credit, 22% leverage and net debt EBITDA of 5.5 times, our balance sheet remains in excellent shape.","That concludes my comments and I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Austin Wurschmidt","With respect to guidance, you mentioned that the first quarter, you had a one-time benefit. So just curious how we should expect the cadence of same-store revenue growth now through the balance of the year?","Angela Kleiman","Hi there, it's Angela here. The cadence given the first quarter performance on same-store, we had originally anticipated that first half was going to be much lower than the second half and now they're going to be about the same. So we're not changing our same-store guidance and, but because of the first quarter revenue though just end up being more comparable.","Austin Wurschmidt","And then, you guys talked a little bit about some softening trends. Subsequent to quarter and you highlighted Alameda in LA. I was just curious if this is being offset by strength in many other submarkets?","John Burkart","Well, this is John. That's a great question and the answer is yes. We are seeing other parts of the Bay Area that are a little bit stronger and certainly Seattle is a little bit stronger. So there is an overall balance there, the whole portfolio performed a little bit better in Q1 than it started out to perform in April, but again, there is clearly a little bit more strength in some of the tech markets.","Operator","Our next question is from Nick Joseph with Citigroup. Please proceed with the question.","Nick Joseph","You mentioned improving affordability, there continues to be a broad push for rent control nationally and specific to your markets, Governor Newsom in California appears to be supportive of some additional rent control despite the defeat of Prop. So how do you think about portfolio positioning and capital allocation going forward given the current political backdrop?","Michael Schall","I guess I want to take a step back from that and to talk a little bit about the overall discussion, and that because I think it's much more balanced than it was a year ago. And by that I mean, I think that there is more recognition that if you push too hard on the rent control side that will have a pretty dramatic impact on the housing production within California and Governor Newsom has been part of that discussion and part of his campaign was trying to produce 3.5 million new homes between now and 2025, which would be somewhere around 500,000 to 600,000 per year versus about 80,000 per year that we produce for the last 10 years.","And so we also noted that he wanted to protect letter. So striking that balance, I think is what the legislature is grappling with and lot of the things that are happening we are focused on that. I think that what we've done is tried to identify the best long-term growth markets for multifamily property. We think in those markets and it seems like other potential places that we might be interested in investing say Oregon or Colorado or Florida or some of the bigger East Coast cities are having some of the same issue. So I don't think this the California thing, I think it's a broad movement and so I think that we are pretty comfortable with our existing geographic focus.","Nick Joseph","And then just how do you think about underwriting the preferred equity deals versus more our acquisition or development deal? And I recognize there, the risk profile is different, but how from FX at this point you underwrite them?","Michael Schall","We underwrite them much like we underwrite our development deals, our direct development deals. And so, in other words, we look at costs and the spread between what acquisition values are and what the development yields are in order to get comfortable with that and what we are trying to do is we're trying to find the best let's say development oriented strategy for the company. And the reason why it focuses us on preferred equity investments is because we don't take that upfront risk between when we are financially committed to a land purchase. Yes, because we step in those transactions at the point that the deal is closing in construction is beginning, so we've eliminated that front end risk element. So we think it's just a better risk reward equation for the company.","Operator","Our next question is from Trent Trujillo with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question.","Trent Trujillo","Just looking at Seattle. Real quick, I think your midpoint in guidance calls for similar growth in 2019 versus 2018, despite some new supply and we've seen some areas in the Seattle if they get zoned, so how are you thinking about the potential to continue rate growth trends in that market?","Michael Schall","And maybe I'll start. This is Mike and John might want to comment more directly on the market itself. But as to the up zoning, I think it's going to be several years before you really see the impact, the potential impact of that and it's not as quite as simple as hey, there's going to be up zoning and therefore this going to be more units produced because there are affordable unit requirements and construction costs, as you go up in density can increase. So I would say it's not just a slam dunk that we're going to see it significant increase in the amount of developed departments in the Seattle market. So John can I turn it over to you?","John Burkart","Yes, absolutely. As what we're seeing right now in Seattle is overall continued strength, which was consistent with the end of last year. The supply is getting absorbed as I mentioned previously, the job growth is strong and it continues to absorb that supply. So we'll see what may happen is maybe were a little stronger in Seattle and little weaker in LA overall with our guidance but Seattle is certainly performing well the tech markets are performing well. Does that answer your question?","Trent Trujillo","Yes, sure it does. Thank you. And I guess touching on theme from earlier in terms of capital allocation, you've been opportunistic in buying back shares. And since your repurchase the stock has rebounded out 15% and you're now trading above consensus NAV. So, at what point do you consider issuing equity as a source of funds for the acquisition opportunities that you cited in your prepared remarks?","Angela Kleiman","Well, keep in mind that for our investment activities we balance the cost of capital or the spread. And so it's really gone through driven by that. We haven't issued yet so far, because we had proceeds excess proceeds from the sale of 8th & Hope and our preferred equity investments have been funded by the redemptions and so until we have a need for that capital, we'll take a look at that point in time, what are the best opportunities are, whether it's issuing over the market over the broad market or via joint venture or dispositions and that relate to also on the divestment side what yield that we producing to get the best spread possible.","Operator","Our next question is from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","John Kim","With affordability improving in all of your market and all these tech IPOs coming out, can you just discuss what that means for the housing market and your ability to push rents, above the 3% market rental growth per cap?","Michael Schall","John, this is Mike. And that is the key question. I think affordability is, has been a key constraint over the last couple of years, plus I'd say peaking development pipelines and when development deliveries occur in essentially several properties being delivered at one time you start seeing these concession levels increase which is, -- our ability to push price to this point. So we see those we see those force is changing somewhat over the next couple of years and not to a huge extent but on the margin, and as a result of that, we think that there will be more pricing power go in a few years down the road.","John Kim","On your acquisition of the joint venture stake at One South Market. Can you just remind us if that was partner led or your decision. It sounds like it was more years and remind us how you to derive purchase price?","Angela Kleiman","Yes, on the One South Market transaction, our partner had a life on their fund that was coming to an end. So the timing was driven by that. We normally wouldn't have choose to say market and asset in the fourth quarter in the midst of on the tailwind of Prop 10 Vote. So it's really driven by them.","John Kim","And the purchase price was it \u2013 were there a lot of bidders for that stake?","Angela Kleiman","Yes it was broadly marketed and the we end of purchasing it at, at the growth of $179 million and we ultimately - it makes sense to transact with us on several level because we already own the assets, and it was a certainty of execution as well and the pricing makes sense to us.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Please proceed with your question.","Alexander Goldfarb","Two questions for you. Mike, just first one going back on the regulatory front, there have been some articles about certain municipalities are going, putting in rent caps or different sorts of right controls subsequent to the defeat of Prop 10. So can you just provide a little bit more perspective on this? And are you guys seeing any impact in the markets in your markets? Or is this more of a localized bank that doesn't seem to be spreading?","Michael Schall","Yes, Alex. Good question. I would say that we are at the beginning of the process and so it's going to take some time to work through all the different regulations that are out there. Keep in mind that we have concentrations really four cities in California whereas there we operate in about 80 cities. So we're pretty diversified within California as it relates to this rent control issue and there isn't, it isn't like a change in any one municipalities going to have a huge impact on the company.","So I think that's important to keep in mind, but there has been increased regulation proposals on the local area, a lot of them had to do with these just cause of evictions and higher cap. So, in the case for example of Glendale capping rents at 7% and again over long periods of time we grow rents at somewhere around 3%, 3% plus or minus, so some of these caps are set at a point it should not have a dramatic impact on our longer-term results.","And so, we're cautiously optimistic. We've left the California for responsible housing entity in place so that we can have a coordinated industry response to all these various proposals and, but we're working through and there is, we can speculate about what might happen, but it's so early on that I think it would be may both challenging and in precise to do so. So we're going to avoid, we trying to look into the future, because at the end of the day, we don't know what exactly is going to happen.","Alexander Goldfarb","And then the second question is for Angela on the guidance , and maybe it's continuing on with the legacy of Mike Dance. But if you look at your NOI, your NOI expectations for the year are higher but you left the NOI, same-store NOI range unchanged, your interest expense is now higher. So you know just thinking about it, is it the fact that it's just too early in the year we don't want to be changing your NOI guidance or are there other things that are going to sort of push back on the NOI, because otherwise it - it sounds like both should have moved up commensurately with your performance in the first quarter versus, you know, is there a reason that you're sort of holding back on growing the same-store NOI range?","Angela Kleiman","It's a good question and you're right, it's a fine line to try to block, but in terms of, let's just make sure that Tom that you understand one - on the NOI, it looks like there is a change the midpoint on our guidance page. But that is really because of the One South Market consolidation. It was off balance sheet and so, rolling that that to consolidated NOI and then as you know, and then we have our partial offsets to that. And so at the end of day, it's not a meaningful change to NOI at this point and nor do we see a meaningful change on a trend line basis.","So it's it and as you know, we've always make sure that there is of course a level of conservatism. So we don't miss. Having said that, we certainly are seeing anything so compelling right now that it makes sense to try to get ahead of the numbers and move guidance.","Operator","Our next question is from Rich Hightower with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.","Rich Hightower","So a lot of my questions have been asked already, but I guess just to follow up on the guidance question and what you're seeing currently. Are you able to tell us where you're sending out renewals over the next 60, 90 days at this point in April? And what you're achieving?","John Burkart","I can answer that. I think that's an important to understand is we really, we send our renewals out like six days in advance. So our Q2 renewals have gone out largely almost all of them at around 4.9%. So very strong, but again, realizing that I also mentioned in the opening that the market little bit weaker at April, so those may get negotiated down a little bit, but they are up from where they were in Q1 was about 4.1 and Q2 that about 4.9 at this point where they were set out.","Rich Hightower","That is helpful and that's in aggregate, I mean can you break that down quickly maybe across the three sort of bigger markets?","John Burkart","Yes, absolutely. So that is an aggregate and so we have at about 4.3% for SoCal overall about 5.4% for Nortel at about 4.9% for Seattle.","Operator","Our next question is from Drew Babin with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Drew Babin","Question on, your deliveries coming in later this year in San Mateo and Santa Clara. I was hoping you could kind of talk about the specific submarkets in the Bay Area. Obviously supply coming into the Bay Area is very some market specific and markets are kind of all over the place in terms of their performance. But I guess, can you comment specifically on where development through achieving first occupancy in 2Q and 3Q?","Michael Schall","Drew, this is Mike just make a couple of quick comments. First is that they are, we've had a pretty severe winter here. And so they are, from a timing perspective being pushed back somewhat given rain delays and that type of thing, so that's the first comment. The Station Park Green development is about a mile from our corporate office here in San Mateo and it's a very strong sub-market effect I think is that the strongest region. I think John within the portfolio right now.","John Burkart","Yes, that absolutely has the strongest region, rents are up over 6% year-over-year, and haven't seen so seems like we've time that well and then Milo is in Santa Clara and that market has a little more concessionary activity, but it still seems like San Jose and tech markets are doing so well from an employment perspective that we think that those markets are well positioned, both properties well positioned and timing is good.","Drew Babin","And then on downtown LA, would you say that the bulk of the supply that you're expecting there this year has hit or is hitting now as you mentioned the weakness kind of so far in 2Q or is there more to come as we get through later into the year?","Michael Schall","We have about -- our estimate is about almost 12,000 units in 2019 and actually increasing a bit in 2022 to almost 13,000 units in downtown LA or LA, which is the downtown is the primary component of that. And it really doesn't slow down until Q4, 2012, so I think we're going to have continued supply deliveries for the next - at least the next year.","Drew Babin","And then one for Angela, would you say that your preferred investment I guess aggressiveness maybe increases given the redemptions in the first quarter. You may be looking to do more preferred investments as was implied in the original guidance this year, or might the proceeds just be spread among other investment opportunities as well?","Angela Kleiman","Good question. Generally speaking for on the preferred equity investments, we would like to do more than we have always targeted on the pipeline just because the yield is so compelling and as Mike mentioned earlier and the risk adjusted return also makes a lot of sense.","So that\u2019s just a general statement, but as far as what we're expecting we had guided, between $50 million to $100 million and we're not at this point ready to go outside of that guidance and because primarily we do have redemptions to offset that. And so, but to the extent that we can ramp up, we were certainly not to do so. But at the end of day, we still have a very disciplined underwriting process. And so even if there are a lot more opportunities, it doesn't mean that work to us adequately to more deals.","Michael Schall","We\u2019re pushing that.","Operator","Our next question is from Rob Stevenson with Janney. Please proceed with your question.","Rob Stevenson","Are you seeing any difference in rent growth between your assets at the high-end price point wise within the specific market versus those that are sort of in the middle or somewhere in between?","Michael Schall","Yes and no. Certainly, if you're talking Downtown LA, where we're competing head on with supply, the high-end is, if we're talking in other parts of the portfolio, it's not necessarily that way. We love the portfolio we have. It's broad in the sense of geography and as well as in the sense of As and Bs. And it performs very well. But there, if you're competing head on with supply again say Downtown Oakland, Downtown San Diego, Downtown LA those areas, the newer assets are finding more challenges with rents for sure.","Rob Stevenson","So no unless competing with supply, there is no sort of drag on A and A+ assets in terms of rental rate growth?","Michael Schall","No, I mean it wouldn't in those submarkets. Yes, definitely but outside the sub-market. Yes, no it depends, it's really a function of the concentrations of lease-ups and especially those that are offering large concessions that's what really impacts price.","Rob Stevenson","And you guys haven't started to do development. I think roughly 18 months or so. Can you talk about where you are in the process with your current land parcels and anything that you might be thinking about doing there and then what's the potential for additional redevelopment projects starting in 2019?","Michael Schall","Yes, Rob. That's another good question. On the direct development side, again the dynamic that we talked about a couple of times over the last year or so where construction costs are growing faster than rents in general are essentially pushing back some of those potential starts.","We do have a couple of relatively small direct development deals that we could start, we're trying to find a window that sort of optimizes there, the cost structure on them. And so we've again had a preference for preferred equity investments. As a result of that, we're again, someone else takes those risks and we step in at the last minute before construction begins and earned a very decent yield.","So from a variety of perspectives, I'd say direct development is the third most interesting investment opportunity at this point in time, given that that headwind behind preferred equity investments number one and acquisitions either in a joint venture or on balance sheet would be number two. So we're going to continue to be cautious, but we don't have a huge land inventory, as you know. And so we're just going to sit back and wait for their optimal time to start.","Rob Stevenson","That redevelopment starts?","John Burkart","Sure, I'll answer that. We are looking at several assets in the same-store portfolio currently. But I would say there's other assets that we've started redevelopment programs on that are not in the same-store portfolio. So they're not outlined in our financials, the newer acquisitions or joint venture transaction. So we continue to find opportunity in the portfolio, continue to monitor that. We\u2019re also balancing that watching the regulatory environment and making sure that the program is going to work for all constituents.","Rob Stevenson","And then, out of the 17 preferred equity investments, you have currently. Are you expecting to own any of those or you expect to get repaid on all of them at this point?","Michael Schall","Rob, no we don't know. We don't have an option on any of them and we always try and get an option, but we find that our developer is typically more aggressive in terms of what he thinks of values are, than we are, and therefore it's not worth it to us to negotiate an option.","Having said that, we always have the seat at the table when it comes time to refinance or sell these properties and there's been a couple of cases where we have actually bought the properties and-or in one case Stadion is a preferred equity provider after stabilization has occurred . So we like the optionality of the preferred equity investments, because both upfront. In some cases, we've chosen to be a part of the ownership group and at the back side, we have potential for buying the property and we're remaining involved in some way like in a preferred equity type of format. So we try to look at that portfolio as part of our opportunity set.","Operator","Our next question is from Hardik Goel with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question.","Hardik Goel","I wanted to ask about the parking fees and maybe other ancillary revenue opportunities that you see and how substantial that could be in the longer term like the runway you see longer term and also whether that was concentrated in a few markets or whether that was broad-based initiatives if you could just talk through some of the details there?","Michael Schall","Yes, I'm glad to. We do see pretty good amount of opportunity in the other income line item, line items and they include some of the initiatives we have right now, which include renting out amenity space to non-residents. The same thing, renting out parking to non-residents also looking at our parking space with current residents in the light of revenue management you might say, recognizing the different values of the different spaces and charging it accordingly.","So we do see many opportunities, we're working on some smart unit pilots right now and a variety of other items. There are some offsets as well certainly have cable cutting and some other line items that are offsetting that. As far as for the magnitude of this, we're pretty focused on it. We think there is a good future there, but we're not at a point where we were putting up enough results to then translate that into numbers. I don't think you'll have a material impact on 2019 and we'll see an update as time goes, but we have quite a few things going in the other income line items.","Hardik Goel","And just as a follow-up to that, do you have considered looking at assets that might have excess parking in your view to maybe add Snap-on units, maybe like 100 units snap-on development sort of deal that some of your peers have done, what kind of opportunities exist across your portfolio there and have you considered them?","Michael Schall","Yes, we're looking at the real estate every which way you can to try to drive the most dollars per square foot, we can. So there again we\u2019re not in a position to say this is the, this is the future that we've summed it up, but we are evaluating many, many options and there is some units, there were some parking that's being converted into units at some places, there's all kinds of things that are happening, and we\u2019re evaluating the options across the portfolio.","Again, the biggest thing for us though is to be very clear, is we're always focused on good real estate in the right locations, the right markets that's always number one and that is what we have as a great portfolio, but as far as optimizing it, we're working very hard at this point, to optimize our revenue.","Operator","Our next question is from John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors. Please proceed with your question.","John Pawlowski","John, just a quick follow-up on the leasing spreads in 1Q, you sent out renewals at 4.1 But what did you actually achieved in the first quarter on renewals and as well as new lease spreads?","John Burkart","Yes, that was fair enough. So we actually achieved 4.1 in Q1 and that number will move around some. But we did achieve 4.1 in Q1 and the new leases in Q1, and again to be clear, this is light kind leases which typically are basically 12 month leases and we provide information this way to be insightful into the marketplace. So the new leases on light kind were about 3.6% year-over-year in Q1.","John Pawlowski","And then Mike, certainly back to the political conversation. I don't want to focus on rent control. I want to focus on regulatory barriers to supply I guess like some comments from your lens, the next 5, 10 years, how will that the backdrop be different, when the Governor is setting higher regional housing in targets. And then you have legislation like Senate Bill 50 gaining traction. I guess what markets could see change in supply and what markets would probably be a non-event under different regulation?","Michael Schall","Yes, John, that it's a good question and I know you guys have written extensively on this topic. Again I go back to what I said before, which is we are at the beginning of this process and trying to understand exactly how these things are going to roll out and what they will mean will be something that we will spend a lot of time on to try to understand and to ultimately benefit from it.","SB 50 which is greater densities near public transit is something that California has talked about a lot and it makes imminent sense if they can figure out how to work through some of the logistical issues. Notably, for example Huntington Beach has been sued by the State and is counter sued over who has the right to dictate housing policy and I expect that some of that type of activity will continue as we work on our way through this process.","So I think unfortunately, it's a little bit too early to tell what the impacts are in the case of Seattle, for example, I think you guys suggested that maybe it be 1% of stock. I think that's probably a bit aggressive, there could be some impact and candidly, there are markets that really need the housing and Seattle would be one of them, given it's incredible job -- San Francisco would be another one for example the different allowing greater office and residential construction is probably a net positive to have additional housing in that area given the amount of office supply that's coming in, and that's why we spend some time talking about the amount of office that is under construction, because if you have, as we said before, if you have somewhere around 5% under construction on the office side and you're producing about 1% on the residential side, it seems like there is an embedded imbalance in favor of demand oversupply embedded in those numbers.","So the short answer is, we don't know, but we are engaged and studying it carefully and we will stay abreast of what's happening.","Operator","Our next question comes from Omotayo Okusanya with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Omotayo Okusanya","Given that you still have an interest in development and fairly limited land bank. Just curious about interest in doing mixed use development maybe working with a retail REITs or someone under retail side on moderate densification projects, what would get you interested in doing things like that?","Michael Schall","Hi Tayo, this is Mike. We have actually worked with a number of retail organizations trying to determine whether we can provide the housing and I would say those conversations are though interesting and they've to some extent you've gone pretty far.","But we haven't been able to actually strike a deal on those transactions. And so over to we're trying and you're right there. There is a natural I guess synergy between the two of us, if we can figure out how to get the economics right. The challenges, the same challenges that we have elsewhere, which is construction costs are too high and to some extent your retail partner looks at it and it goes well, it really cost that much to build that, but when you get through the numbers. That's what, that's what happens.","I'd say it isn't necessarily the will isn't there, I'd say it's more a function of cost and yields and essentially the land valuation when you start looking at a spin-off of a part of a property from a retail company. So it's complicated, but it's possible. Our general view, again is we need cost to settle down a little bit here so that we have more certainty, because development cap rates measured today untrended in the high 4s. I just don't think that's enough of a risk premium to justify direct development.","Now if we, if we found transactions that were in the low 5s on trended basis again, yes, that would represent maybe 100 basis points of cap rate over acquisition transaction that would be more interesting, but we have not been able to find those transactions.","Omotayo Okusanya","Angela, I just wanted to go back to your comments about the preferred equity program, if rate you end up kind of staying lower for longer. Should the natural outcome for that program be just less origination simply because the yield may not end up not being as attractive anymore and also because you probably end up with more redemptions as you start to refinance?","Michael Schall","Tayo it's Mike, I'm going to take that question from Angela, if you don't mind. I think that it's been interesting because there are, there is more money in the direct development side as it relates to some of the merchant builders out there and in cases, for example, last year where we didn't hit our guidance range on the preferred equity side. What we found was in some of the sponsor is willing to ride an additional check to put more equity into the transaction to get it moving ahead.","So, in our experience there are limits to the amount of equity that the merchant builders can put into transactions to make them work when costs go up faster than rents and it compresses the yield. And but it's hard to tell which transactions are going to move forward and which are not. So I would say there probably are some headwinds there, but keep in mind that our pipeline for preferred equity, we have about $400 million outstanding and we probably are 25% of the capital stack. So that you're talking about $1 billion to $1.5 billion of development. It's just not that big. So I think that we given the size of the West Coast, I think that the opportunity is still pretty substantial.","Operator","Our next question is from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Rich Hill","Quick question, it looks like there is some disclosure on lease accounting changes. I was wondering if you just maybe provide us some high level thoughts and how that maybe might have impacted any numbers if at all during the quarter?","Angela Kleiman","Sure thing. Actually for us is simple. On the lease accounting changes, on the P&L side, there is no impact because we've already been disclosing our bad debt in our contra-revenue. And so the only new disclosures that you will see is really at the balance sheet, we break out operating leases and liabilities and so it\u2019s just a new disclosure item and thus far -- they end up net each other out essentially. And so once again, no impact on FFO either.","Rich Hill","And then just one quick question, I'm sorry this been asked before, but it looks like expenses were pretty elevated in Seattle. Could you just recap maybe why that's the case?","Angela Kleiman","Happy to. On Seattle, it's really driven by property taxes and it's because in Q1 of last year, we had a disproportionate amount of refunds. Having said that, this is actually the numbers came out as expected, we had expected that Q1 the sale it was going to trend this way. And so that's another reason why we didn't need to revise our operating expense guidance either.","Operator","Our next question is from John Guinee with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","John Guinee","First, Mike you mentioned severe weather last winter, this past winter in California. Is that a little bit of an oxymoron?","Michael Schall","It is. I know I felt very uncomfortable using that as an excuse.","John Guinee","Okay, yes two questions quickly. You're coming down the home stretch on some of your development deals that you started construction couple of years ago. If you look at something like Station Park, looks like you have cost per home about 715,000 unit they 500 Folsom of about 750,000. What do you think it would cost you to build these products today if you're bidding out the GC work et cetera?","Michael Schall","It's a good question. We do have a Phase for Station Park Green and we have to John Eudy is not here with me today, I know that the costs are up. I don't know what the magnitude is.","John Guinee","So it's higher in both cases?","Michael Schall","But I can't tell you again it goes back into that comment I made earlier which is construction costs going to somewhere between, let's say, high single-digits, which is down from low-double digits over the past couple of years versus rent growth, which is in the three plus-minus percent range. So that's how badly, and that's been the problem on the development side.","John Guinee","No, we understand. Second question, any updated yield on cost for these projects as you get close to initial op leasing and occupancy?","Angela Kleiman","We have mentioned our yields in the past, it's kind of there Tom. The size range upon stabilization, which usually you know is another at least a year out from initial occupancy so that only hasn't changed, the rents are coming in at plan on our development.","John Guinee","And then the last question. This is your redevelopment portfolio and I think somebody asked a few questions about it. But the net-net, is it looks like you haven't put any projects into redevelopment idea $25,000, $30,000-$35000 per unit. Overhaul and a lot of years, at least on the East Coast people who doing that more and more. Anything that you just aren't quoting in your sup that our kitchen and bath renovations are things that others might include in our redevelopment pipeline?","Michael Schall","Yes, again with let me just talk broadly about our redevelopment program. So right now we're typically doing 2500, 3000 units a year which roughly with 5%, it implies a 20 year life, so that's just taking care of the units. And then on the major renovations, we look through the portfolio and look at opportunities. There are several opportunities we are studying right now that are in the same-store portfolio. It's also common for us as we acquire in assets to see opportunities along those lines. And those are not called out specifically in the supplemental. They're not in the same-store portfolio. So they're not pulled out of it or otherwise identified.","So there are some other assets that we have, we are renovating right now that are outside of that realm. I suspect over the next year. Again, we will add a couple more assets into that, into that bucket that are coming from the same store. The current same-store portfolio. But again, we are working through the opportunities we had we are near completion and those will be coming out and we'll probably be adding a few more, but there's others that are going on right now. That just start, they just starting the same-store portfolio, so that called out specifically.","Operator","Our next question is from Rich Anderson with SMBC. Please proceed with your question.","Q \u2013 Rich Anderson","So I don't know if you ever seen this commercial AT&T Wireless commercial when guys going to get surgery and nurse that surgeons just okay or kind of sushi dinner and they said the food is just okay except the Cook went home sick. The reason why bring up that commercial because you started off this conference call by saying things fueled quote pretty good. And I know you're tying that to the job growth discussion decelerating underperforming your expectations, but they're \u2013 you also lobbed a lot of other things that sort of paying a relatively good picture for you guys. So I'm just curious, am I over reading your sort of your body language? Or are you really thinking that things could decelerate from here just judging from the way you described it right at the outset.","Michael Schall","Well, that's an interesting feedback. That was, I don't think that is our desired goal to be negative on the call at all. We feel pretty good about things, and again, we're off to a good start this year. Yes, I would say, having said that jobs are the locomotive of rent growth. And so if we see any pickup in on the job front, I think it would be it's appropriate that we bring that up.","A lot of those seem like it happened in the first quarter again, there was a huge amount of disruption, stock market, government shutdown, et cetera and so I guess our inclination or hope would be to believe that things will get back to normal as seems like the U.S. economy is doing pretty well and things will be in good shape. So we don't know and we're just trying to make sure we do a good job of essentially shown what we know with you.","Q \u2013 Rich Anderson","All okay guys, you always do a great job about \u2013 just seeing it - called away states that I meant as a complement really but just wanted to judge or bigger picture view of things. And second is this Q2 not in New York, a good thing for Seattle or the non-event for Seattle?","Michael Schall","I think it's a good thing for Seattle. I mean Amazon \u2013hey, I would say all of these tech companies that have these incredible growth rates, they're going to find ways to grow within the cities that are headquartered in or nearby or else if they can if they can't grow there. So I think all of them have similar perspectives and what are we going to do, how we going to grow, how we're going to pursue our opportunities and they're either going to be successful in working with the local political structure. All they're going to move elsewhere, if that's my view and in this case the political structure elsewhere turned out to be maybe more challenging than the Seattle marketplace and some others. So it led to a different decision.","John Burkart","I would just add that it may turn out to be a lot better for Bellevue as well. We are seeing more and more and getting more indications in the broker channels that there's a lot more interest in the East side, which does make sense. I think they have acknowledged that there have a tremendous supply concentration in downtown Amazon does in the downtown Seattle and they're looking to expand and it seems like the side is the beneficiary part of that.","Operator","Our next question is from Karin Ford with MUFG Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Karin Ford","There was an article this week in the New York Times about the 2020 presidential candidates courting Renner's. It sounds like a few of them are supporting tax credits on rent. Do you think something like that could be impactful on demand and propensity to rent?","Michael Schall","It's a good question and I think anything that helps with the affordability issue will continue to spill more production housing and increased demand and all those types of things, because I think when you start pushing affordability start having more double absent and other things that destroy demand. So I think it would help incrementally but I think that again the broader political discussion is one that is continuing to evolve.","And I think it's a healthier discussion as id said earlier in my comments that it's a more balanced discussion between the need for housing on the one hand and how to have protections and a pretty high level with respect to the residents and the tradeoffs are being I think appreciated by politicians to a greater extent than they have in the past. It's a good thing.","Karin Ford","And then my second question is with all the IPO money coming into Northern California, do you think we might be nearing a tipping point on condo conversion economics?","Michael Schall","It's another good question and it's interesting in the past year, the price of a for-sale home has not really moved a whole heck of a lot. So we've continued on the perfect side to have rents grow which of course gets capped out and home prices really haven't done that much. Having said that a year ago we had incredible, incredibly large increases in for sale prices. So in the past year actually condo conversions became less appealing when you compare the value of the building. As an apartment versus the value of the building as a condo. So no help there.","Operator","Our next question is from Shirley Wu with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Shirley Wu","So Mike, coming back to Amazon and in your further remarks, you mentioned that they have around 11,000 job postings and with news of I'm moving from the operation in terms of that. Now, have you, would you think of, do you think there'll be any changes fundamentals in those, in those markets on supplier demand side, especially in relation to your asset?","Michael Schall","Yes, I'll grab that. Clearly Amazon is a major force in downtown Seattle and we don't see that changing. We think they're continual will have continual demand pressure there, but we do see the benefit of some of these movements to Bellevue. We're seeing more than Amazon there's other companies that are expanding out into Bellevue and recognizing the quality opportunity out there.","So we think that will benefit our portfolio, which frankly most of our portfolio is outside of downtown, it's on the east side and a little bit north and south. So yes, we do see the benefit of that in the Belvieu area.","Shirley Wu","And so on job growth, obviously you mentioned in January. That was at 90 basis points and you're maintaining job growth at one, two. So is that due partially to the conservatism originally baked in that number or do you how comfortable you feel with that number? And I guess what could change that would make you change your mind to either provide that up or down?","Michael Schall","Sure. The numbers are pretty volatile to begin with. And last year, as I mentioned in the Orange County, San Diego and LA had benchmark revisions between 50 and 100 basis points, pretty substantial benchmark revision. So, we all focused on what's going on. It's the only number we have and we look at that, but then we look for other checks and balances and that's in part why we look at office space, we look at absorption, rents and other factors and try to triangulate and make sense of it.","Our belief was last year that Orange County was it falling apart and then with benchmark revisions came out. It showed it wasn't falling apart. It actually had solid job growth. We expect the same thing for this year and we don't have any particular reason to change the expectations at this point in time. I think it will kind of come together nicely. We do see some weakness and that's why I pointed out to LA, because we're seeing a little bit of weakness in the rental market. And then that does tie to the jobs market and it kind of becomes a confirming item there, if that makes sense.","Operator","Our next question is from Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Wes Golladay","There seems to be a little bit more moving parts heading into the peak leasing season. I am just wondering if you can update us on the strategy for the broader portfolio, as I recall, it was to push rate this year. Is that still the case?","Michael Schall","Yes, that absolutely is again our, our position is, again we try to communicate clearly and transparently so, April was a little bit weaker. We don't expect that to be the year, we expect it to be a good year and we are continuing with the strategy we started with and that is to continue to favor rental rates over occupancy, we expect that in 2019, our occupancy will be about 20 basis points below the prior year. And that we are moving forward. As Mike mentioned, it's probably more or less some noise that's going on, but we do want to be transparent in what we see.","Wes Golladay","And then looking at going back to that preferred equity investment portfolio. Do you have a set repayment schedule or do these things have extensions, those -- that you really baked into the guidance?","Michael Schall","I know they have, they have a maturity date. All of them do. And again, as Angela said, potentially can change, it can be moved up or back dependent upon conditions. we received several that have had early repayments given our refinance and completion of construction and some others where we've carried on with a preferred equity investment at a lower outstanding balance for years following the completion just depends. So we\u2019ve - seat at the table is really the key point as it relates to the yield to maturity of the preferred equity investment but on all of them, there is a maturity date.","Wes Golladay","And then I guess maybe I'm not sure if you have it offhand, but should we model like 19, 20, 21 a breakup 50 to 100 million a year repayments, or is any sort of sense you can give us on how we should look at, we know the investment level, we just don't really have the repayment level.","Michael Schall","Yes, I guess you have - the challenge of course from our perspective is to not take something that's inherently a good thing and make it a headwind down the road. So we're trying to size the program, so that our essentially origination will offset the maturities. So to the extent that we do a good job of that that I think that, everything is everything is good. The reason why we don't want to grow the program to a huge level is because we don't want to be in a position that we're rolling it down over time. So we want to keep going, as long as we can. Angela, do you have a comment on what the typical maturity is for that program?","Angela Kleiman","Well, I mean, I think if you want to target. So let me step back, I mean, our program is about $400 million. They tend to have a three-year term. So for modeling purposes, 1\/3, 1\/3, 1\/3 is probably reasonable. Having said that, keep in mind that we also guide to every year at the midpoint somewhere else. 75. So there will be an offset and so if you are going to have roll off, you don't want to say a whole 1\/3 of them roll off because then you'll have pretty odd numbers.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we've reached the end of the question-and-answer session.

Second Quarter 2014 Financial Results. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs, as well as information available to the company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated.

Mr. Schall, you may begin.","Michael J. Schall","Thank you. I'd like to start by welcoming you to our Second Quarter Earnings Call. Mike Dance and Erik Alexander will follow me with comments. John Eudy and John Burkart are also in attendance for Q&A.","I'll cover the following topics on the call: first, second quarter results; second, an update on the merger with BRE; and third, the status of key priorities. So on to the first topic.","Yesterday, we were pleased to report an exceptional quarter driven by an undersupplied housing environment emanating from the robust economies on the West Coast. Our reported 7.2% same-property revenue growth matched Q3 2012 and Q1 2014 for the highest revenue growth rate achieved since the Great Recession. Southern California continued the expected steady-but-slow improvement in its revenue growth rate, which exceeded 5% quarter-over-quarter for the first time since the Great Recession. Northern California and Seattle continued to perform at the expected high level.","Our market update on Page S-15 of the supplement reflects a nominal increase in total housing supply from last quarter, still representing about 0.7% of the total stock of rental and for-sale housing in our target market. It is notable that the for-sale housing construction remains at very muted levels, while apartment supplies continue to gradually increase. Our 2014 job forecast improved from last quarter, with an increase of 35,100 jobs in 2014, moving our job growth forecast to 2.6%. While all areas continue to perform well, Microsoft's recently announced layoffs and growing apartment supply in Seattle will cause us to be more cautious in the Puget Sound region. Overall, the forecasted 2.6% job growth, with total 2014 housing supply increasing by 0.7%, indicates a shortage of housing that is apparent in our results.","Now on to the second topic, the merger update. It has now been 4 months since the closing of the BRE merger, and I can report that much has been accomplished, and that we still have plenty of heavy lifting ahead of us. To the E-team members listening today, please accept my sincere thanks and appreciation for your incredible efforts, dedication and skill as we become a stronger and more capable organization.","I am pleased to report that the management transition at the properties has proceeded well, and included a recent realignment of portfolio assignments based on geography rather than premerger ownership. Major systems integration to one platform is underway, beginning with HRIS and other systems. The conversion of the property operations and accounting platforms is the most important part of the systems integration, and it has been the subject of extensive planning and coordination. While both BRE and Essex use Yardi for property management and accounting, a host of specialized subsystems support the Yardi platform. At this point, we expect Yardi and related subsystems to be merged on a phased basis, beginning in Q4.","Considerable effort has been invested in our long-term strategic vision. We are truly a unique company, with clusters of properties located in or near the best apartment markets on the West Coast. In Downtown LA and North San Jose, for example, we have more than 14 properties within 5 miles of each other, requiring new approaches to service delivery, while providing opportunities for improvements in leasing, pricing, staff effectiveness, customer relations and marketing. This part of the integration planning will be a multiyear phased effort that we're excited to pursue.","And finally, third topic, update on near-term priorities. Last quarter, I commented on the need to remain focused on our most important priorities. Following is a brief update on the short-term, mid-term priorities outlined last quarter.","The first priority was to reduce the growth differential between the BRE and Essex portfolios, while taking advantage of the strength of the 2014 peak leasing season. In Q1 2014, Essex generated quarter-over-quarter revenue growth to 7.2% versus 5.6% for BRE, for a 1.6% differential. In the second quarter, that differential was reduced to about 0.5%, comprised mostly of 1.2% higher scheduled rent for Essex compared to BRE, offset by BRE's approximately 0.7% improvement in occupancy relative to Essex. BRE's higher turnover, shorter lease durations and lower financial occupancy make us believe that further improvements will be achieved in the coming quarters.","The second priority was to vigorously pursue integration of systems and processes, which remains a key management focus. My previous comments have already addressed this topic. And finally, the third priority was to ramp up investment activity, given relatively stable apartment cap rates at a time of declining capital costs, with debt rates declining and Essex stock hitting all-time highs. To avoid resource problems, our senior executive team meets every Monday morning, discussing issues and opportunities, including how investment activity might impact other priorities, especially merger integration. We came to the conclusion that we have capacity for a few larger acquisitions, mostly focused on Northern California. So far this year, we have acquired $217 million in apartments. We currently have $385 million in non-contingent acquisitions in process, which we expect to close in the third quarter. Therefore, we expect to exceed our acquisition guidance of $300 million to $400 million in 2014.","That concludes my comments. Thank you for joining the call. I'll now turn the call over to Erik.","Erik J. Alexander","Okay, thank you, Mike.","We're very pleased with our results this quarter, especially when coupled with the progress Essex has made in integration items. The focus on property fundamentals by operations in the corporate teams has been superb, and we applaud those efforts. The changes in management that Mike was talking about provided us with some important insights on integration items. Our regional leadership team has been able to share a fresh perspective on existing systems and processes from both companies. This has led to valuable recommendations on system strengths and challenges, and as a result, we have been able to accelerate some of those decisions.","We've not changed our overall timeline for integration, but we have been able to better organize some of the components because of feedback provided by our internal customers. Most notably, we will be migrating to a single revenue management system ahead of schedule, which will allow us to better attack opportunities to lower turnover, increase occupancy and improve our daily pricing review. These changes will also allow us to enhance our customer experience and improve satisfaction and retention.","So as expected, leasing activity continued to accelerate throughout the second quarter for the entire portfolio. With respect to performance of the Essex portfolio, strong occupancy positions reported in May allowed for solid scheduled rent growth beyond our initial expectations for the second quarter. In fact, the sequential growth in scheduled rent for the second quarter was 2.1%, which is the largest second quarter gain since before the Great Recession. July's scheduled rent gains were also impressive and should set us up for a solid third quarter.","Strong markets certainly fueled our revenue growth, as economic rent levels in the Essex portfolio were up 8.3% year-over-year. Higher market rents helped push our renewal pricing, which contributed to our stronger-than-expected revenue growth, as residents renewed their leases at a rate 6.3% higher than their old rate. Looking forward, we expect renewal activity to continue to support strong revenue results, as offered rates for August and September are in the mid-6% range.","As of yesterday, physical occupancy in the Essex same-store portfolio was 96%, with a net-to-lease of 6.3%. We expect to lower our net availability to 6% by the end of the third quarter, and sustain occupancy above 96%.","Turning now to the BRE portfolio. The real story has been the rapid gain that we made in occupancy during the quarter, having increased physical occupancy by nearly 100 basis points by the end of May, and holding that level through June. This translates to a 76 basis point gain in financial occupancy compared to the first quarter of this year, and a 92% improvement -- 92 basis point gain over the second quarter of last year.","I'm confident that we are in the right path, as the BRE portfolio was occupied at 96.1%, with a net availability of just 5.5% earlier this week. However, given BRE's higher turnover during the second and third quarter, we expect it will take a couple more quarters to truly close the gap in financial occupancy with the Essex portfolio, and a full year to bring turnover rates more in line with our expectations. We also have evidence that we are making meaningful strides in this area, as the annualized turnover for the second quarter was slightly lower than the turnover ratio recorded last year. This, despite facing 7% more expirations.","Furthermore, through a modified renewal strategy, we have been able to extend the lease terms residents are willing to accept to 11.5 months in June and July. This is about 5 weeks longer than historical average over the past 18 months, and should represent a structural change in the expiration profile and turnover results next year. Reducing turnover is an important part of our goal for achieving parity in occupancy with the Essex portfolio, and gaining pricing power to drive better revenue results.","So now a quick rundown of the new development lease-up activity, which continues to demonstrate strength of demand in both Northern and Southern California.","Epic continued to lease apartments at a rapid pace during the second quarter, and stabilized in June, nearly 2 months ahead of plan. We accelerated leasing activity at Solstice, occupied an average of 38 apartments per month during the period, and stabilized the property.","Radius opened at the beginning of June with very limited pre-leasing activity, and has already achieved an absorption rate greater than 40 leases per month. Mosso, which many of you have seen, is leasing very well, despite its under-construction condition, and has inked 111 leases to date. This result is a testament to the strength of the San Francisco market, and things should only improve for us as we begin to deliver a very nice complement of amenities.","In Southern California, Avery stabilized according to plan, and is nearly 100% leased, while Wilshire La Brea continues to lease at a rate of 35 to 40 apartments per month. And the collaboration with a half a dozen of our nearby communities, including Huxley and Dylan, has proven to be beneficial. Huxley is now stabilized. And Dylan will officially open next week, and we expect this property to lease as well, if not better, than Huxley given its preferred location. I'll provide leasing results next quarter, along with comments about Park 20 and Emming [ph].","Now for some highlights of each region, starting with Seattle. June unemployment growth at 3% and unemployment below 5%, Seattle continues to perform well above the national average. Amazon continues to grow, by adding over 700,000 square feet of office space in the CBD. Boeing Commercial Airplanes captured $17 billion of net orders during the quarter, and the backlog has now reached a new record high of $377 billion. This represents 5,200 aircraft, and equates to approximately 7 years of production.","Rent growth in Seattle is again led by the east side, with year-over-year rent growth above 9%. Seattle CBD, at 5%, is underperforming the rest of Seattle, as supply continues to impact our properties operating in this market, particularly the A product. Given the concentration of expected deliveries in CBD this year, and a similar number next year, we don't expect to see additional rent growth in this submarket in the near term. However, please keep in mind that the CBD market comprises less than 20% of our total same-store portfolio in Seattle, and less than 4% of the total Essex same-store portfolio.","Now looking at Northern California. Job growth in Northern California was 3.2% for June, with San Jose leading the way at 3.4%. Google recently announced an addition of 300 -- sorry, 336,000-square-foot office in San Francisco. And the Silicon Valley has a year-to-date absorption of 1.3 million square feet of commercial space, with another 3.5 million under construction. Levi's Stadium, home of our San Francisco 49ers, opened this past weekend, and development around the stadium is currently planned for up to 8 million square feet of commercial, retail, hospitality and housing. And in the East Bay, Amazon announced plans for a 574,000-square-foot distribution center. So all of this activity continues to fuel the jobs in the greater Bay Area.","Economic rent levels continue to outperform in all submarkets, with San Jose, San Francisco and Alameda leading the way, with year-over-year growth north of 10%. These markets have had little trouble absorbing new supply thus far in 2014, despite relatively higher deliveries in San Francisco and San Jose than we've seen in prior years. We continue to believe that the demand is comfortably outpacing the supply.","Now finally, in Southern California. Los Angeles, Orange County, San Diego all posted year-over-year job growth in June above 2%, and LA's jobless rate has dropped to 8.1%, compared to 8.7% in March.","Orange County's employment growth was tempered somewhat by layoff announcements from Allergan and Broadcom, while job additions in Los Angeles are coming from education and health, professional business service sectors, with the information sector growing 6%, which is the highest growth post recession. Commercial activity improved during the quarter, as Orange County absorbed 1.1 million square feet of office, and another 500,000 square feet of office projects are under construction within just a few miles of our Hollywood and Mid Wilshire assets. We saw rent growth accelerate in all of our Southern California properties, beginning in April and continuing through July. As of the end of July, year-over-year economic rents were at least 6% higher in Los Angeles, Orange, San Diego and Ventura counties. Modest deliveries and steadily improving jobs picture should help to continue respectable economic rent growth in the broader region.","So beyond the strong markets and healthy outlooks across the entire portfolio, I'm encouraged even more now that I have seen the new Essex team work together to achieve excellent results during a demanding and anxious transition period. I'm eager to work through the balance of the integration in order to realize true team unity and put Essex in a position to deliver top-tier results again next year.","Thank you for your time and support. And I'll now turn the call over to Mike Dance.","Michael T. Dance","Thanks, Erik.","Today, I will provide commentary on our second quarter results, the revisions to our guidance to core funds from operations, review changes to the income statement presentation in the supplement and will close with a few remarks on the balance sheet.","The second quarter exceeded by $0.08 the midpoint of our guidance range for Core FFO per share. This outperformance was predominantly from better-than-forecasted property operations, as we saw strong net operating income growth in all 3 regions and have revised the midpoint of same-property NOI growth to approximately 8%. Our revised full year forecast for revenue growth of 6.6% at the midpoint does not represent decelerating rent growth. It simply reflects the seasonality of our business, with the highest rent growth occurring during the months beginning in March through July.","Please recall that, in 2014, we also have a very difficult second half comparison to the second half of 2013. In the second half of 2013, we achieved greater than 6.5% rent growth compared to the second half of '12. For the second half of '14, the year-over-year rent growth for the same-property BRE legacy portfolio is expected to be slightly better than the year-over-year same-property rent -- revenue growth in Essex portfolio, as a result of the forecasted gains in occupancy at the legacy BRE communities. We expect to achieve similar financial occupancy in the 2 portfolios by the end of the year.","The midpoint of our same-property operating expenses increase remains unchanged at 3.5% for 2014. On our last conference call, we actually forecasted second quarter same-property expenses to increase by 5%, compared to the actual results of 3.1%. This $0.02 per share savings in expenses was due to timing, and we are now forecasting these expenses to occur in the second half of the year.","Moving on to our guidance change. We have increased the full year Core FFO per diluted share by $0.09, to a midpoint of $8.39 per share, resulting in Core FFO growth of nearly 11% for the full year. The guidance change was limited to $0.09, as our original estimate -- as our original guidance, first, we already assumed robust revenue expectations for the second half of the year; second, our expectations for the timing of operating expenses previously noted; and lastly, general and administrative costs should increase over the Q2 run rate based on anticipated increases to headcount, and incentive compensation tied to achieving the forecasted results.","Now I want to review the changes to accounting that impacted the financial information included in our supplemental presentation this quarter.","First, we reduced general and administrative costs by approximately $1.4 million for the development and redevelopment fees paid to Essex from our co-investment partners. In Q1, we had approximately $1 million in development and redevelopment fees, which were accounted for as revenues in Q1. But in Q2, we have reclassified the prior quarter's expense -- or revenues as an offset to general and administrative expenses, to be consistent with this quarter's presentation. This accounting change has no impact on FFO, and will reduce the fluctuation in management fee income and G&A expenses that occurs solely based on whether the development communities are owned on balance sheet or partially owned with partners.","By accounting for these fees as an offset to G&A, our overhead costs will be more comparable between quarters. This accounting treatment depicts the economic reality that these fees are principally reimbursement for the costs of providing these services to our partners.","The second change is that we have temporarily discontinued the allocation of the costs of G&A activities related to property and asset management fees as a separate expense line item on the income statement. Again, this accounting change has no impact on FFO results, and the allocations will be revisited after we merge the Essex and BRE accounting systems in the fourth quarter.","The third accounting change was noted in our press release, and relates to the accrual of the utility reimbursements from residents. This receivable was becoming material, and is considered a preferred accounting method than the accounting for the revenues on a cash basis. This change resulted in a onetime increase to revenue and FFO of $1.8 million, which has been excluded from the same-property revenue, and excluded from Core FFO.","The last change was mentioned on our Q1 Conference Call, and was contemplated in our revised guidance provided in Q1. Essex has adopted the BRE's accounting, which follows Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, the amortization of leased concessions over the initial lease term. This accounting only applies at Essex when it is offered to new residents at a development community. This change increased FFO by $0.01 in the second quarter, and reduced the dilution from the development pipeline. The accounting change will also better reflect the effective rent growth from these communities when the assets enter the same property portfolio.","I will now wrap up with a few comments on the balance sheet.","As a result of the merger, five of the six debt metrics presented in our supplement on S-6 have improved over the same metrics prior to the merger. As we successfully lease up the development communities and grow the net operating income in the same-property portfolio, we are on plan to reduce the total debt-to-annualized EBITDA to below 7x before the end of March 2015.","Year-to-date, we have issued $366 million on equity to match-fund our external growth opportunities. And we are committed to a strong balance sheet, as demonstrated by reducing our line balance in April by issuing $400 million of unsecured bonds with a 10-year maturity.","This ends my comments. And I will now turn the call back over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with UBS.","Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Turning first to BRE, a couple questions. Should we assume that the second half BRE same-store numbers and growth looks similar to what you achieved in the first half of the year, since you mentioned you still had some of the occupancy benefit coming?","Michael T. Dance","Yes, this is Mike Dance. Yes, we're looking at about 6.6% revenue growth year-over-year for the second half of '14 compared to '13, primarily, as you mentioned, due to the occupancy gains that we can achieve in that portfolio that we've already achieved in the Essex portfolio.","Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then if I turn to Page S-7 in the supplemental. You give the legacy BRE property revenue, NOI, et cetera. If I do the math, it looks like the margin on the BRE portfolio is like 64.5%, and your same-store margin 69%. How should we think about that gap? And how much do you think you could close there?","Michael T. Dance","That's predominantly Proposition 13 write-ups in their portfolio. So those were basically estimating Prop. 13 at this time, based on advice we're getting from consultants, but that's to be determined. We think we're doing a good job estimating those, but more to tell as we get supplemental tax bills from the county assessors.","Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly, on the development pipeline, can you remind us where you think expected yields are on the pipeline underway today; and then separately, what was just completed in the second quarter? And I was also hoping to get an updated thoughts on Wilshire La Brea, that's a bigger asset, how you think about the stabilized yield there and what the NOI contribution might be for 2014 since you saw some lease-up.","Michael T. Dance","Yes, this is Mike Dance. Let me just comment briefly on the BRE portfolio, and then I'll hand it back to John or Mike on the Essex portfolio. On the BRE portfolio, as part of business combination accounting, we're required to assign fair values to all of the assets. And then we looked at the state of completion there relative to cost to complete. The assets that are delivering in 2014, we pretty much brought in at a low 4 cap rate. So those will be stabilized in the low 4 rate, plus the rent growth we're achieving in those markets. I'll let John or Mike now talk about the Essex portfolio.","John D. Eudy","This is John Eudy. On the existing portfolio on the Essex side, the cap rates we have estimated on our stabilization is in the mid- to high-6 range. And the ones that we've turned over to operations fully this quarter were actually slightly on the high side of that range.","Michael J. Schall","Nice work, John.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nick Joseph with Citigroup.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","When do you expect the same-store revenue growth gap between the legacy Essex and legacy BRE portfolios to only reflect the different submarket allocation, not redevelopment contribution, the occupancy gains you talked about and other income differentials?","Michael J. Schall","Nick, this is Mike Schall. I'm not sure there's a real easy answer to that, because we approached each part of the businesses separately. I think we've reported on -- in prior calls that we have discontinued the -- a lot of the redevelopment activity on the BRE side, pending transferring it over to the Essex way of looking at things. And just to give you an idea of what differences there are. We take an asset-by-asset approach on redevelopment. We look at each asset separately within its market, try to determine what things we get paid for and what things we just want to turn. We don't use a cookie-cutter approach. We use a customized asset plan for each one. And so we expect to start layering in redevelopment activity back into the BRE portfolio sometime in the third quarter. And actually, there's one large asset in Emeryville that there was some significant damage that was subject to an insurance claim, where BRE got $20 million back. So we're going to do an extensive rebuild, or a reconstruction on that, and pull it out of the same property pool, for example. But I guess, to answer the question, it'll probably take a year before there's a full redevelopment plan on the BRE side. It'll start right away, but it will be building up over the next year. Does that answer your question?","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","That does. And then just going to the acquisitions you mentioned, primarily in Northern California. Is that a result of more assets on the market there, or a strategic decision to grow that market, or a shorter-term opportunity you see?","Michael J. Schall","It's really all of the above. I mean we try to find the best markets, obviously. We try to measure growth rates, cap rates; try to look for the best opportunities within our portfolio. I'd say, as a general rule, the lowest-risk and highest-return opportunity is still in redevelopment. However, moving large dollars in redevelopment is difficult, because of what I just said, which is a specific asset-by-asset planning process, and it is difficult to deploy redevelopment dollars in a high-quality manner without trying to have just basically a systematic reduce of many things. So we're going to continue to be focused on redevelopment. We think that, that is our highest total return, but we're not going to be able to move huge amounts of money in that area.","Within the development side, we want to continue to be a developer, an active developer. We got up as about as high as 10% of enterprise value in our development pipeline at the bottom of the cycle. And we think, at this point in the cycle, we're unable to exactly figure out what's going to go grow faster: NOIs or construction costs. And therefore, we're going to be more conservative at this point in the cycle, and we may reduce our development exposure to somewhere around 5% of enterprise value, just to give you some idea. And so we'll find opportunities within that spectrum. And we continue to see some pretty interesting development deals that we're working on.","And then so finally, on the acquisition side, we still think Northern California. And we're comparing a lot of deals back and forth. We have passed on some deals in Southern California. We have gravitated to, rather than, let's say, the super A market within Northern California, finding opportunities that might be in a B+ city near a transit-oriented site, a transit-oriented district, where someone can get on, for example, BART or light rail and commute into town, because we believe that given how expensive it's getting in some of the core areas, that there's a logical transition to still good locations that have good transit options as being the best total return in the acquisition area. Does that make sense?","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","It does. And then, I guess, just between kind of those A locations and the B+ locations, what kind of growth differential are you underwriting?","Michael J. Schall","Well, again, this is the important distinction. I mean, typically, as you come out of a recession, the A areas are going to grow the fastest, and the B areas are going to essentially get the benefit of the second wave. And so we think we're in that second part of things. We're actually -- if you look at our own results, you'll see Alameda County, for example, which is mainly the B assets growing actually better than some of the A areas. So we're starting to see the transition from really expensive areas, people being forced to move out of the really expensive areas, and that is benefiting, again, the still good areas, but not Downtown San Francisco, for example.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Just quickly, just some questions here. The turnover difference between BRE and Essex, if you could just comment a little bit more on this. Was this more of the way like the way that the BRE tenants were managed from corporate? Or was there a more active approach to try and, I don't know, I guess, not retain people? If you could just give some color. And just because that seems rather glaring. And then also maybe a little bit on what the duration difference was. If you guys are going for 11.5 -- I think you said you're going for 11.5, or maybe it's now 11.5, but if you could just give some color on the difference of the duration strategy.","Erik J. Alexander","Yes. Alex, it's Erik. I think one of the biggest drivers was not so much the focus. I think BRE, like everybody, wants to retain people as much as they can. I think the strategy of how -- what you offer the residents, in terms of their length of stay. And so what we saw is Essex is in the 11.5 average term range on the renewals. And for the past 18 months, the BRE portfolio had seen closer to 10 month renewals. And that was really based on the offers. The offers favored a 10-month renewal, where typically, the renewals in the Essex portfolio favored a 12- or a 13-month lease, from a pricing perspective. So what we saw in June and July was a result of changing that, trying to push the longer-term lease, with an eye on managing our lease expirations so we set ourselves up good for next year, and just get in a better position for pricing.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. So there wasn't like an active part on BRE to get people to move out. It was more just how they did their duration of the lease renewal.","Erik J. Alexander","Yes, I don't believe there was an active plan to try to move them out.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. And then on the operations side, if we just use EQR-Archstone as a sort of a template, it seems like there are 2 stages to getting synergies. There's, one, the initial, which you guys have outlined and sounds like may take a year. And then there's the next stages, which is as you operate the portfolio, the properties in close proximity, there are efficiencies that you get above and beyond. So can you just give us a sense for sort of, if you take a sort of on a 1-to-10 scale and say 10 is full integration, everything going, how much do you think you will integrate over the next year for efficiency improvement; and then how much -- and then by default, what you think is then left over the longer term?","Michael J. Schall","Alex, it's Mike Schall. That's an interesting question. I would say that this first year is going to be picking the low-hanging fruit oriented, which means lowering the turnover ratio, focusing on occupancy, building pricing power, training the people so we all think alike and approach the business the same way, implement all the systems and the integration so that we are one company. Interesting note during the quarter was it took us a couple months to reconcile the definition of financial occupancy, because they were different between the 2 companies, for example. And so there's a tremendous amount of detail, and we're trying to work through that. I think that's going to take a good year. We are, at the same time, accumulating lists. And Mr. Burkart has a lot of this, and he may want to comment, creating lists of opportunities that we see that we want to pursue at some point in time down the road, when we get back to the scenario I referred to in my comments, the sort of a re-visioning of how we provide the service. And again, given the proximity of properties in certain clusters, notably in my call, North San Jose and Downtown LA, we know that, in certain cases, for example, price optimizers compete with, from property to property, without considering that the same owner may own both, for example. And situations like that have got to be resolved. I think we get to none of that during this first year. We may want leasing offices that are open till 9:00 at night within the main clusters, for example. We may want more specialized maintenance, so that you have sort of a cluster maintenance group, some which are highly skilled in plumbing and other -- a variety of other tasks. Essentially, all that stuff is out there. That is the broader how we are going to provide the service in the future, we will not get to in this first year. And we are, as a general statement, really busy trying to keep our eyes focused on the things ahead of us. We all recognize that these are not annuities. They are businesses. The world changes quickly, as we saw in our mea culpa moment in Q3 2011, which lives in infamy around here. And we remain vigilant in trying to make sure that we react appropriately to changing conditions, that the communication up and down the organization is appropriate, that we're monitoring things appropriately with reports, and that we are prepared to react if conditions change.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jana Galan with Merrill Lynch.","Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I was wondering if you could provide an update on condo conversion activity in your markets this summer?","John F. Burkart","Sure. This is John Burkart. As it relates to -- let me talk about condos in general. So clearly, when we look at the markets, in all of the markets, the condo pricing is moving, as it is in most of for-sale housing. The hottest market, no doubt, is San Francisco. San Francisco Bosa is actually building a couple of towers, one in San Francisco and a couple in Seattle. And to put it in some context, the San Francisco tower of 267 units, about 200 of them have sold out in a very short period of time. Compare that to, say, Seattle, where they're selling about 15 a month for a 700-unit tower. So all of the markets it's moving forward. San Francisco is at its closest point. However, we're still not at the point where it's, you might say, frothy, at the point where we would say it makes sense to convert because, at the same time as we have the condo price moving, we also have rents and apartment values moving. And so again, it's not a just condo price issue. It's a, where is the arbitrage opportunity where we can find the chance that someone will pay perhaps a half to a cap more for our apartments and valued as a condo? So we're not quite there yet. We're monitoring it very closely. We're engaged in numerous conversations. And we'll react, as Mike says, to the market when it -- as it gets there. But it's definitely moving forward.","Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And Erik, I'm sorry if I missed this in your comments. Could you provide move-outs to homeownership this quarter and maybe an update on rent-to-income?","Erik J. Alexander","No I haven't provided that. It hasn't materially changed since the last quarter. It stands around 11% for the portfolio overall, highest in the Pacific Northwest, and lowest in Southern California.","Michael J. Schall","And then, this is Mike. Let's see, rent-to-median incomes, not a whole lot of change there. We track the current rent-to-median income against the long term average from 1990 to 2013, and those relationships look pretty healthy. I'll go through a couple of them for the sake of discussion. In Seattle, for example, rent-to-median income, because incomes are doing very well in Seattle, 16.9% versus the long-term average 1990 to 2013 of 17.4%. So that looks good. San Francisco, currently at 25.1% against a long-term average of 24.4%. San Jose, 20.8% versus 20.3% long-term average. Let me do one more, LA, 20.4% currently against 22.4% long-term average. Again, I think the thing that is different about the West Coast is we are adding so many jobs that are professional in nature, that have high income levels. And it has the effect of pushing income levels up, and therefore, the affordabilities are not becoming stretched.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Toti with Cantor Fitzgerald.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","I just have 2 simple questions, and I might have missed this, but the portfolio metrics were a little odd in that turnover declined, occupancy was relatively stable but concessions rose, which I was a little surprised. I would think that, that number would follow turnover. Can you just provide a little bit of detail on that dynamic?","Erik J. Alexander","Yes, I might not be clear on the concession part, the -- If you're referring to the...","Michael J. Schall","It rose nominally, yes. I mean they didn't rise a lot. And I think most of it was one asset that is competing against a new community -- or actually, several new communities. I think it was the 5600 Wilshire asset. So I think that accounts for almost all of the concession number. Right, Erik?","Erik J. Alexander","Yes, that was the big concession number. [indiscernible] asset specific.","Michael J. Schall","And then I'd also comment that, again, the turnover number where BRE's was in the, what, 63% range. I mean that's a function of a high-turnover, high-lease-expiration period during -- intentionally, during the peak leasing season. And it takes time for us to bring that number down. It will -- we have to be there for a full cycle of implementing our view of how you do renewals; and a little bit longer lease terms, as Erik mentioned; and a variety of things. So again, some of these things just take time to implement.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. I was just curious on the mechanics. My other question, and this is maybe for Mike Dance. I would have thought we'd see greater levels of dispositions, given asset pricing. How are you guys thinking about asset sales relative to other costs of capital in terms of sort of a funding source? And why aren't you -- sort of why aren't you maybe disposing more at this point in the cycle?","Michael J. Schall","David, it's Mike Schall. It's a topic that we are talking about a lot these days, but I would suggest to you that we have done the calculations, and we have concluded that using a combination of stock and debt on a -- essentially balance sheet -- near balance sheet neutral type of basis, is better than using recycled asset proceeds. And there's a couple of caveats to that. One is that we, all things being equal, don't want to operate in Phoenix, and so there is a pretty good likelihood that we will sell out of that market. And the other caveat is keep in mind that, because of Prop. 13, the buyer and seller essentially have different cap rates, because the buyer is going to have a reassessment, and therefore, his NOI is going to be lower than it is on our books. And therefore, that acts as an impediment, in effect, to sell. Not -- and again, not that we won't sell, we're just going to be careful about time. But in our view right now, with debt costs rallying 50 basis points or so, and the stock hitting all-time highs, we are better off issuing stock to fund new acquisitions than using dispo proceeds.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities.","Richard C. Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","So just a couple of questions on BRE. What is the difference between their second and third quarter lease expiration schedule now versus yours?","Erik J. Alexander","Yes, so the -- this is Erik. So this, the third quarter has a higher turnover expiration than Essex. So we were -- they were 63% in the second quarter, and we were in the low 50s. The last couple of years, that profile was 70% for BRE and kind of mid 50s for Essex. And so we're seeing basically the same thing. And we're doing -- like you said, we're offering the longer-term leases, and we're doing some advanced renewals to try to bring that all under control. And I think that the physical occupancies so far are evidence that it's working. The fourth quarter is more similar to ours, and we don't expect a big issue there.","Richard C. Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","That's actually good information, but not quite the question I was asking. When it comes to, like, the percentage of your leases expiring in the second and third quarter, I'm sure it's more than 50% of the total, right? You try to target that. What is that number for Essex, not turnover, but just the raw expiration? And what is that number for BRE?","Erik J. Alexander","I'm sorry, Rich. I'll have to get back to you with the specific number for both those portfolios.","Richard C. Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Okay. Mike Schall or whomever, when you think about the combination of BRE, they bring more Southern California to the mix at the margin than you had originally. Do you think that, that's a particular opportunity given that Southern California hasn't started that ramp-up yet? Or is that kind of just splitting hairs?","Michael J. Schall","That's another good question. In a normal world, I would think that we would expect Southern California to have that ramp-up, but I think this is a very unique recovery period. This recovery period is really being dominated by tech, life sciences and energy. And that, we think, is going to continue to favor the North, Seattle and Northern California, and whereas Southern California is more of a diversified economy, and we think it will still do well, but unless the recovery broadens out or, let's say, until the recovery broadens out, we think that we have a distinct advantage in Northern California and Seattle. Obviously, we don't know, and we're trying to make decisions that are going to benefit the company over the long haul. I still think Southern California is a very, very strong market, very limited supply. We still think good things are going to happen in Southern California. And actually, I'd also mention, because of the tech and life science influence in Northern California, it can be -- and Seattle, it can be a little more volatile than Southern California overall. So I think having a balanced portfolio, as we have -- and as you know, we -- of the 4,175 units that were used to form the joint venture, they were predominantly Southern California focused, so that we maintain more of the Northern California, Seattle flavor to the overall portfolio. And we think that, that's about the right balance at this point in time. Again, could change in the future depending upon what happens in the broader economy.","Richard C. Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then on the topic of synergies, last quarter, you had operating G&A synergies ranging from $24 million to $27 million for a full year run rate. You beat on the BRE side, in the second quarter, you mentioned $0.02 better than expected. How come you didn't adjust the synergy target? Or did you and you're just kind of waiting for somebody to ask?","Michael T. Dance","Rich, it's Mike Dance. There are a number of vacant positions in G&A that we're going to be filling here in the second half of the year. So I believe it was some of the turnover that wasn't expected. We're going to be filling those positions. So that, and I think I mentioned in my remarks that we're having a great year, and we're hoping that we get rewarded for that in compensation levels. So that is going to also be adding to the second half of the year's G&A.","Richard C. Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","All right.. So the operating is outperforming. G&A might be a little bit higher, and the net is no change at this point.","Michael T. Dance","That's right.","Richard C. Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then the last question, Mike, for you then. Did you give any consideration to the accounting change, in particular the amortization of concessions over the life of the lease, and moving in that direction? Did you have -- did you give any consideration to taking it all upfront? And just curious what your thought process for -- was for not doing it that way.","Michael T. Dance","We are doing lease concessions on GAAP for the development communities. That's where it's material, where it -- again, it's a lot of work. We're not doing it for the same-property portfolio. We make -- we decided to make that change when we looked at all the BRE assets that are being delivered in 2014. So we are -- we did change our policy to recognize concessions upfront, and amortize that over the life -- the initial term of the lease. And that did benefit Q2 by about $700,000 in FFO. So that was all contemplated in Q1's guidance. So I think -- did that answer your question?","Richard C. Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Yes, that's fine. All right.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Morgan Stanley.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Erik, I guess I wanted to get some color from you on the Essex same-store revenue growth in Southern California, well above your peers'. So I'm just curious how much of that, would you say, is location, price-point driven versus upside in the BRE portfolio.","Erik J. Alexander","Yes, I think it's some of all of that. We had good results in Ventura County, where we moved occupancy in the first quarter. So we got some price gains there. Los Angeles, I think, fundamentally, has been better. I think evidenced by some of the lease-up activity that I mentioned. So that's carrying over into our stabilized assets where we're seeing some better pricing. And then we have made occupancy gains, I think, particularly not just in the BRE portfolio, but also in Essex San Diego. So all of those things have contributed.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And one or two more for you while you're there. Overall turnover in your portfolio was relatively unchanged year-over-year, but we did see almost a 10-percentage-point year-over-year decline in Seattle. Is that you guys being more cautious today given the ramping supply you referenced earlier in the call in the Seattle metro area? And then given the near-term outlook for Seattle you provided also earlier, can we perhaps see SoCal revenue growth exceed Seattle's by perhaps next year this time?","Erik J. Alexander","So the first part, the turnover was a little higher in Seattle last year due to some renovation activities that are not the same this year. And then we also see a higher conversion this year on renewal offers in Seattle. Part of that related to our renewal strategy and some of the self-limiting increases that we've set. And then with respect to Southern California beating Seattle next year, did you say?","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Well, maybe. You tell me. You tell me.","Erik J. Alexander","I don't know. I'm -- what I'm hoping for is it ties the same level that Seattle is this year. We're both enjoying that kind of growth. But I do think that you're seeing maybe a little more consistency in the growth in Southern California. Very anxious to see how the third quarter turns out, and hope that this is less bumpy and more sustainable, and that it moves towards those levels.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And last one now, speaking of renewals. Maybe I missed it, but could you give us the new and renewals perhaps by region, if you could, for 2Q; and then also the early reads, well, July actuals and early August, what you're asking for?","Erik J. Alexander","Yes, the early -- sorry, the August and the September is 6.5 for the Essex portfolio, and 5.7 for the BRE portfolio. And I think I'd commented in the -- in my comments about the second quarter being 6.3% overall for Essex. That number for BRE was 5%. And again, that's probably a little bit lower than it would have been, but again, we're pushing a renewal strategy to extend leases, to reduce turnover, to bring that occupancy up, and get into a better position later.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Did you -- or could you perhaps give those by region, the renewal and new for the -- during the quarter?","Erik J. Alexander","I don't have it right in front of me, Haendel.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of George Hoglund with Jefferies.","George Hoglund - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered, but I guess, one thing: I'm looking at your preferred equity investments. Is there the chance that any of those might turn into acquisition opportunities over the next 12 months?","Michael J. Schall","George, it's Mike Schall here. I don't know what the opportunity to do that. We -- it's obviously on our mind and part of the reason that we are in that business, not just for the return, but to be part of a discussion at the term of the preferred equity investments. But at this point in time, there are no discussions ongoing about taking any of them out.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Salinsky with RBC Capital Markets.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Erik, you gave a whole bunch of leasing statistics just at quarter end, where is the loss-to-lease there? I mean I didn't talk about moderation, but are you seeing that gap actually widen as you're capturing a lot this trend?","Erik J. Alexander","Yes, we are. It's getting pretty big. I mean July has been a good month. And for Essex, it's around 8%, and for BRE, it's just shy of 6%. And it's a double-digit number in the Bay Area. So yes, it's growing.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Impressive. Second question. I believe you talked a little bit about redevelopment, but now that you've got the portfolio for 4 months, you know the properties a little bit better, you got a handle on the lease-up, what's kind of the scope or scale you see of redevelopment opportunities across the BRE portfolio? Is it greater than that of the Essex portfolio?","John F. Burkart","Mike, this is John speaking. It's actually pretty similar to the Essex portfolio overall. However, the BRE assets are a little bit newer. So Essex, we tend to have a little bit more infrastructure, plus the outside finishes. And for BRE, it's a little bit more of the outside finishes, but the opportunity is pretty significant. As Mike said, we're -- we've had teams of people go through each and every asset. We've had multiple offsite meetings. And we're really rolling it into our portfolio plan that we expect to come out in -- over the next year. And it'll be at about the same level as what we're doing at the Essex portfolio right now.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. Third question, possibly for Mike Schall. The $385 million you referenced, I mean how should we think about that? Is that mostly B property? Is that A properties? What's kind of the acquisition strategy right now? Is there a focus on A versus B? Or is it really more submarket driven, no differential between A versus B right now?","Michael J. Schall","Yes, it's actually a little bit more submarket driven at this point in time. There were assets that traded that we dropped out of the bidding process when the cap rates for, I would say these are A assets and A locations, went sub 4. We're really not all that interested in participating in some of those transactions. And again, we would rather play this, what typically happens when you have a very tight apartment condition where people are forced to move out to the next area. So we're trying to go to transit-oriented areas in still good cities that are still near the jobs, and where rents are lower and cap rates are higher, and try to anticipate that trend of people that will be moving out or will not be able to find a apartment in the best areas and they're willing to get on a BART train or whatever and commute in.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, so this is more suburban type product that you're acquiring here...","Michael J. Schall","I'll give you an example. A couple of these buildings are within 10 miles of North San Jose, where all the jobs are, for example. We're not talking about going to the hinterlands. We're talking about going to good cities, Fremont, for example. Again, with transit options, given that the traffic in the Bay Area is becoming more problematic over time. And again, we're trying to find those places where people want to live, offer a good quality of life, can access their -- the employment nodes and provide the appropriate return to us.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Then finally, at your Investor Day last year, you provided a 3-year outlook that assumed pretty healthy growth there. The growth that we're seeing obviously is tracking above that. Are you seeing growth in addition to what you had expected, or are you seeing a compression of the cycle?","Michael J. Schall","That's -- I think that they can work together. I don't -- I'm not sure that you're seeing compression in the cycle. We would expect a longer cycle, as we suggested there. We went back and looked at all of the recovery periods for the last 50 years, and we concluded that, when you have major financial recession type periods, the recovery periods tend to be longer. And we certainly think that, that's a key part of this. The other part of it, though, is what's going on with incomes. I mean, as long as incomes continue to grow, and the overall affordability equation is tolerable to the consumer, we think that this can go on longer than we might otherwise have expected. But I think the difference between this cycle and several of the previous cycles are the number of high-quality, high-paying jobs is different. The amount of wealth that is being created is also different in that you have companies that are very profitable, as opposed to if you go back to, for example, the late '90s where you had companies with no operating history whatsoever, that you were able to raise $1 billion in the market and operate a \"to be formed\" type of company. It's a much different scenario to that. I mean we see, at this point in time, real jobs, income levels doing very well, the -- for example, the Microsoft announcement of 18,000 jobs essentially being let go, and of somewhere around 1,500 of them in the Seattle area is what we're expecting. A lot of those people are highly skilled. And again, there's a number of companies that are looking for those skill sets. So we're not sure exactly what impact that's going to have, but I feel like it might be more muted than what you might otherwise think given the magnitude of the losses.","Operator","Our final question today will come from the line of Nick Joseph with Citigroup.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Final, wow, that's a high hurdle. It's Michael Bilerman. So I noticed your marketable securities balance went up about $6 million to $106 million. And I wasn't sure if that was a purchase of additional stocks, if that was increases in market value. I know there's a bunch of bonds in there, but there is, like, I don't know, $22 million, $23 million of common stocks, and I didn't know if that was something of a strategic opportunity on the tongue [ph] that we need to be mindful of.","Michael T. Dance","Michael, this is Mike Dance. I assure you it is not a strategic opportunity. It -- we do have a captive insurance company that continues to have no losses, but continues to collect premiums. That's some of it. Some of it's increases in market values, but no strategic investments.","Michael J. Schall","And then just to be clear, Mike. The captive insurance entity, I think it has around $40 million in it?","Michael T. Dance","$45 million.","Michael J. Schall","$45 million in it. So the -- we have a tiered investment scheme which has -- the first couple of tiers are very safe, and then it becomes a little bit more discretionary and\/or more like ETFs and that type of investment in those layers. But it's really a function of that, wanting to remain liquid and have those reserves set aside in case there is a self-insurance type loss.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then we spent a lot of time on this call talking about how you've been able to influence the BRE portfolio in processes and things like that, but I'm curious if there's been any influence at all on the Essex portfolio from anything that you've been able to garner either out of operations or any other sort of discipline that, like, came from looking at BRE, that's had some influence on the Essex properties?","Erik J. Alexander","Sure. There have been. I mean, I think the information has gone both ways. I think we see a lot of it in the integration stuff. In the systems that we're changing, we've adopted some of those things that serve our internal customers. On the customer side, we're -- we'll be adopting a customer care platform that was used by BRE in a process we think works well. And we'll adapt some ideas we have on that. Some things related to utility bill-back, we're looking at. We've had some just great collaboration on stuff. I met with a manager in Seattle, who said -- who transferred from a BRE community to an Essex community, and she said, \"I just love the way you do this simple renewal.\" She said but, \"Gosh, there's like 12 steps to get to the price. I have some ideas on how you can fix that.\" And I'm like, \"All right. Let's get together and talk about that with the right people.\" And so again, people are really, I think, being encouraged and sharing ideas. And I think that's been a big part of the integration is it -- constantly encourage that, and don't pretend that we have all the answers. So yes, we're differently getting ideas from all the people that are involved.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I'd like to return the floor back over to management for closing remarks.","Michael J. Schall","Okay, thank you, operator.","In closing, we thank you for joining the call. This is truly an exciting time, if not exhausting time, at Essex. We appreciate your interest in the company and look forward to updating you again next quarter. Good day.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference.

Fourth Quarter 2014 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.","Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions, and beliefs as well as information available to the company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found in the company's filings with the SEC. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you. Mr. Schall, you may begin.","Michael Schall","Thank you. I would like to start by welcoming everyone to our fourth quarter earnings call. As usual, Mike Dance and Erik Alexander will follow me with comments. John Eudy, John Burkart, and Angela Kleiman are available for Q&A. I'll cover the following topics on the call: First, comments on Q4 and market conditions; second, merger integration update; and third, investment activities.","So on to the first topic. Yesterday, we were pleased to report continued strong operating results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 2014. In the fourth quarter, core FFO per share increased 15.1% compared to Q4 2013. For the full year, core FFO was $0.29 per share above the mid point of initial 2014 guidance range. In the four-year period from the 2010 recessionary trough, we have now grown core FFO per share by 70%, while tripling the total market capitalization of the company to almost $19 billion, and we are about a year ahead of our strategic plan outlined in our November 2013 Investor Day.","Mike Dance will comment on guidance in a moment, which anticipates continued momentum into 2015, supporting our expectation for strong rental markets and financial results. The primary factors supporting these expectations include: number one, inadequate housing construction relative to demand. While new apartment deliveries have increased, for sale housing construction continues to significantly lag. Total supply of housing, both rental and for sale in our target markets will average 0.8% of stock. This is the fifth year that housing demand has exceeded supply pushing rents higher as market occupancy levels increase.","Going forward, the suburban markets benefit most from this process, notably the East Bay which led the portfolio in rent growth. ","Number two, we expect the U.S. economy to improve modestly in 2015 with our assumed 2015 GDP upto 2.8%. If that GDP assumption is achieved, our target markets are expected to produce 2.5% job growth, significantly above the U.S. average.","Number three, California is different from Seattle on the supply side. In Seattle, where higher rents and for sale prices have lead to more housing supply, rent growth expectations have moderated. However, in Coastal California, supply has been muted by other factors including a long entitlement process, nimbyism, and large equity requirements for construction loans.","In addition, a new factor has emerged resulting from new laws designed to reduce green-house emissions, notably California\u2019s AB-32 and SB-375, both of which are described at considerable detail on state websites. These laws attempt to focus housing development in proximity to office and retail venues creating urban clusters that are accessible by public transit systems.","Pursuing California\u2019s massive proposed high-speed rail line instead of fixing clogged and failing roads demonstrates this change in direction in California. It is not coincidental that nearly all of our investment activity is in the urban core or near public transit. We believe that these factors will continue to constrain housing development in our coastal California markets, and these conditions will not change materially for at least several years. ","On to the second topic, merger integration, during the quarter, we made significant progress on merger integration, and as expected we\u2019re nearing the end of the first of three phases in the integration process. That first phase includes on boarding over 500 BRE employees, consolidating offices, moving all employees under one HRIS system, migrating all properties on to one property management and accounting platform, and consolidating pricing under one system. As part of phase 1, we also improved occupancy and pricing practices resulting in higher revenues from the legacy BRE portfolio, and we temporarily discontinued the BRE redevelopment program to prepare individual property assessments and rehab plans. There are still many details to complete in connection with phase 1, although most of the heavy lifting is done. I thank all the e-team members for their relentless effort. ","We kicked off phase II of the BRE integration last month, which includes extending resource management which seeks to lower energy and water consumption, and the redevelopment programs to the legacy BRE portfolio.","As discussed on prior calls, we will also continue to implement refinements to pricing, including amenity pricing and reduce turnover rates. Finally, we expect a new website to be implemented early in the second quarter.","Our planning efforts related to the third integration phase is in full swing and is intended to transform the combined company changing how we deliver our services with greater ease and efficiency, utilizing technology and changing our highly decentralized structure, especially where we have significant concentrations of property.","The goals of Phase III include integrating and simplifying systems, improving reporting and accountability, establishing greater flexibility and responsiveness to customers, customer relationship management, centralizing procurement, creating a regional management structure for maintenance functions, and a variety of human resource projects focused on management training and fast tracking high achieving associates. Phase III is expected to be financially positive with respect to both revenues and expenses.","Finally, on to my third topic investments. We sold two properties in Phoenix that were acquired in the BRE merger at a cap rate of approximately 5.7%. This completes our exit from the Phoenix market, a market with a CAGR rent growth of less than 1% over the last 15 years. Given recent increases in our stock price and low debt costs, we continue to be able to add cash flow and NAV per share through external growth. We completed approximately 641 million in acquisitions in 2014, up from 461 million in 2013. Overall, we expect to acquire approximately 500 million in 2015 or more if we can find suitable transactions emphasizing Coastal California.","A dearth of transactions in the past quarter provides little guidance on cap rate. Given rate liquidity and lower capital cost, cap rate could be up to 25 basis points lower than those discussed in our last call. Our best estimate is that the highest quality properties and locations trade around a 4% cap while B quality property and locations trade around 4.5% cap rate. Lesser quality property trades at higher cap rates, and periodically a trophy property trades in the high 3% CAP rate range.","With respect to development, we continue to make great progress, completing and leasing up our development pipeline detailed on S9. We have three projects schedule to start this year and are working on a fourth project that could possibly start towards the end of 2015.","Falling oil and commodity prices should reduce the risk of significant cost increases for construction materials, a positive given our concern about construction cost increases.","That concludes my comments. Thank you for joining our call. I will now turn the call over to Erik.","Erik Alexander","I can\u2019t thank the Essex team enough for another strong quarter achieving the kind of results that Essex has posted this period while expanding responsibilities, learning new programs, and converting our management system is impressive and a testament to the focus of the dedication of our team. After closing the occupancy GAAP last quarter, we were able to maintain parity between the portfolios with respect to financial occupancy, and both portfolios moved up 32 basis points during the final period of 2014. Also consistent with our strategy, we were able to keep turnover between the portfolios at the same rate, and average lease terms are virtually identical. Even the physical occupancy between the portfolio is currently about 50 basis points apart . We expect some difference between the portfolios at the end of the first quarter, with the result expected given the overexposure of lease expirations in the BRE portfolio that were discussed on our last call. ","The markets were in line with expectations during the quarter. The Bay Area continues to set the pace for Essex followed by Seattle and an accelerating Southern California. The thing that was different between the portfolios in the fourth quarter was that the Essex portfolio exceeded revenue projections. The main drivers for this improvement was the continued benefits of higher scheduled rents due to our profitable renovation activity and greater portfolio weightings in strong submarkets like Santa Clara town. Additionally, the underperformance of three BRE assets in Los Angeles coupled with differences in delinquency and other income items as a result of our systems conversion, all contributed to a wider revenue GAAP in the fourth quarter. ","However, with the BRE portfolio operating at a higher occupancy and reduced turnover, we believe that we are in good position to grow scheduled rents this year. These efforts will be aided by implementing our renovation plan in the BRE portfolio and completing the migration to a unified revenue management system for more consistent pricing and renewal practices. Predictably, market rent levels abated from the summer highs, but we saw less of a decline from peak brands compared to prior periods, and year-over-year gains in market rents were stellar led by San Jose, Oakland, and Fremont. The Bay Area experienced double digit market rent growth in 2014. We expect the same submarkets to repeat as the strongest markets this year and collectively the Bay Area should enjoy economic rent growth north of 7% in 2015.","Sub-market details of our forecast can be found on S15 of the supplement. Also, encouraging was the continued improvement in Southern California, especially in Orange County and San Diego. While our plan for 2015 calls for 4.5% to 5.5% market rent growth in Southern California with Los Angelis leading the way, improving jobs and low supply could help Orange County and San Diego surprise for the upsize.","Once again, we expect renewal activity to support strong revenue results, offered rates on renewals through March are in the low-6% range for Essex and in the mid-5% range for the BRE portfolio.","Earlier this week, physical occupancy in the Essex same-store portfolio was 96.5% with the net lease of 4.8%. The BRE same-store portfolio was at 96% with the net lease of 5.1%.","Now, I will share some highlights from each region beginning with Southern California.","Los Angeles experienced the biggest revenue gap between the portfolios during the fourth quarter. Where we came up short was the three of our four largest revenue producers in BRE Los Angeles portfolio generated meager year-over-year revenue growth of 1.3%.","We expect two of those assets, The Stuart and 5600 Whilshire to rebound nicely in 2015, because we completed disruptive exterior renovations at The Stuart last year, and we traded revenue growth at 5600 Whilshire for stronger absorption at nearby Wilshire La Brea, Dylan, and Huxley. Given the success of those lease-ups, we believe this was a reasonable trade. The third asset, Alessio, has faced a number of operational challenges pre-dating the merger. We were aware of those items and continue to work through some of the asset planning and resident profile issues that will take some additional time to resolve. Given that the West LA\u2019s submarket is performing well overall, I am confident that we can narrow the revenue gap at Alessio this year.","The employment picture continues to improve in Los Angeles. The unemployment rate has dropped 130 basis points year-over-year with the information and professional and business service sectors combining to produce 35% of all jobs added in 2014. This is important because these are high paying jobs and represent a larger renter contingent. Motion picture job growth was also up 5% year-over-year. Commercial activity remained consistent with all four coastal counties recording positive net absorption with the greatest contribution coming from Orange County. However, activity in Los Angeles generated the most positive news in the tech world. Google purchased 12 Acres in Playa Vista which is zoned for 900,000 sq. ft. of commercial development, and soon they are expected to announce the lease for the adjacent 300,000 sq. ft. Howard Hughes hanger. Additionally, Yahoo signed a long-term lease for a 130,000 sq. ft. in the neighboring collective campus development. This emerging technology cluster should bode well for the 21,000 apartments that Essex operates within just a few miles of this employment hub. ","So the bottom line is that we are bullish on Los Angeles, and we believe the combined portfolio will produce stronger results in 2015. The broader region continues a path of steady recovery. Orange County and San Diego exceeded job growth expectations in 2014 and pushed Southern California above 2%. We look for these counties to be strong again in 2015. San Diego is expected to perform well this year, but this region has the highest level of lease expirations among the BRE assets in the first quarter, so we are likely to see some difference in the revenue results between Essex and BRE for Q1. Again, this is a short-term issue that is consistent with our plan, and solved in part by operating a single revenue management program and centralizing renewal activity. ","We are excited about Orange County and have recently seen greater improvement in the performance of many of our A-assets. It\u2019s too early to determine that this will be a trend throughout 2015, but we are optimistic about the results at these high quality communities. So, as the overall economy continues to improve and supply remains muted, we look for Southern California to be a valuable contributor to our 2015 results.","Turning to the Bay Area, the Bay Area continues to post impressive job gains and be the catalyst for the company\u2019s leading revenue growth. The December year-over-year job growth in San Jose and San Francisco was 4% and 3.7% respectively. Once again, information and professional business services accounted for more than half of those new jobs in 2014, and we are seeing much of the same for 2015. Commercial activity continues to be strong in an effort to support new companies and expansion. During 2014, nearly 5 million sq. ft. was absorbed in San Francisco, the Peninsula, and the Silicon Valley.","The same submarkets have over 8 million sq. ft. of office under construction which is enough to support upto 40,000 new jobs. Economic rent levels remain strong and were up 12% on a year-over-year basis at the end of the fourth quarter. These markets have little trouble absorbing new supply, and our own leased up properties continue perform ahead of plan.","Mosso averaged 33 market rentals per month during the fourth quarter. Even working from a trailer and heavy construction zone, MB360 secured over 50 leases during the quarter. Park 20 has recorded more than 60 leases since opening in mid-November, and we have not even occupied the leasing office yet.","With such strong results throughout the holiday, it is evident that demand continues to comfortably outpace supply, so you can see why we look forwarding to opening Emme, Epic, and One South market this year.","Now for Seattle, employment growth for the region remains very strong, and in December posted 3.1% year-over-year gain. Amazon and Microsoft continue to big drivers of this growth, and we have not seen any impact from Microsoft\u2019s change in policies for contract workers.","However, the software giant does have a new neighbour, SpaceX received $1 billion of funding from Fidelity and Google and has opened an office in Redmond with plans to employ 1,000 people within the first few years of operation.","Amazon continues to march storage occupying 10 million sq. ft. in Seattle by 2019 and office absorption in Seattle region overall was 2 million sq. ft. in 2014 and is expected to reach similar levels in 2015.","Our rent growth forecast is tempered by the impact of increased deliveries in 2015. The robust job growth will help these developments get absorbed. We continue to like our portfolio composition in Seattle, and we expected to produce solid revenue gains this year, especially on the east side and south end.","I am very glad to have come through 2014 with only a few more grey hairs, though we still have some important integrations items to complete. I believe we are well poised to take advantage of the opportunities that our strong markets are presenting.","Thank you for your time today, and I will now turn the call over to Mike Dance. ","Michael Dance","Thanks, Erik. Before I begin my comments on 2015 guidance, I too want to especially thank the Essex accounting, IT, and HR teams that worked countless hours in 2014 to successfully plan, execute, and complete the integration of accounting and HR information systems. I\u2019ll now highlight the key assumptions behind our 2015 guidance. Many of these assumptions are found on page 5 of the press release and on S13 of the supplemental package. ","The first point emphasized on the \u201815 guidance is to reiterate Mike\u2019s earlier comment that the midpoint of our core FFO guidance range is predicated on achieving 2.5% job growth in our markets. Continuation of the current Goldilocks economic recovery provides ample job growth to absorb new supply and perpetuates the chronic shortage of well-located housing in our markets. Next, I will explain why the first quarter midpoint for core FFO guidance of $2.22 per diluted share is $0.02 lower than the result achieved in Q4 of \u201814. In late \u201814 and early \u201915, we sold two Phoenix assets. These Phoenix dispositions offset the increased net operating income from the same property portfolio and the continued lease of our development communities. ","The remaining shortfall results from the first quarter issuance of equity to match fund our external growth pipeline. For \u201915, we expect same property net operating income to grow in the Essex portfolio by 8.5% off the midpoint driven by 6.75% increase in same property revenues. We will be including the BRE properties that were stabilized at the time the merger closed on April 1 in the same store portfolio at the beginning of the second quarter. For the last three quarters of \u201915, we expect the legacy BRE same property revenues to grow at 6% of the midpoint. The primary difference between the Essex and BRE same store growth rates in \u201815 is attributable to the restarting of the renovations in \u201815 in the BRE portfolio. ","At the beginning of the renovation program, the increase in vacancies are not offset from the high risk scheduled risks. It typically takes three quarters before the increase in monthly schedule rents for the renovated homes begins to exceed the loss in occupancy. Our guidance assumes a 3% increase in operating expenses at the midpoint for both portfolios. The biggest factor driving expense growth is higher property taxes. Our budget assumes property taxes to increase 5% in the Essex portfolio driven by a 10% increase in Seattle taxes and the expected loss in California of over $1 million and successful 2014 tax appeals that are not expected to be replicated in 2015. We expect our controllable expenses to grow by less than 2% for the year for the combined portfolio.","The \u201815 general administrative expenses before merger and integration, cyber and acquisition related costs, is expected to increase by approximately 6% over the run rate we had in the last three quarters of \u201914. The increase was a result of filling several open corporate positions including a new Chief Accounting Officer and a new Chief Technology Officer, both recently hired plus annual wage increases. Our \u201815 cash flow projections for our ownership interest in the development pipeline will be approximately 285 million plus a 150 million in revenue generating capital expenditures to renovate units and add amenities to the stabilized portfolio.","We plan to refinance the 95 million on maturing secured financing, and the 200 million outstanding on our revolving line of credit with the new issuance of unsecured bonds during the first half of the year. We will continue our disciplined matched funding of equity and long-term debt to finance our external growth capital requirements.","I will close with the quick reference to the half turn improvement from Q3 to Q4, and our net debt to EBITDA credit metrics disclosed on S6.","Most of the improvement in this metric is the result of the accelerated lease up from the BRE development pipeline and the strong NOI growth in the portfolio, and 15 basis points to the improvement is attributable to an update in a calculation of ratio from total indebtedness, the net indebtedness to be consistent with the reporting of our REIT peers.","I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Nick Joseph with Citi. Please proceed with your question. ","Nick Joseph","Mike you mentioned cap rates are potentially compressing meaningfully since your last call. Do you attribute that to interest rates falling or are you seeing an increased demand for assets?","Michael Schall","I think it\u2019s a couple of things. I think it\u2019s lack of activity, lack of listed properties out there on the market place. So in other words there is a supply and demand for property out there, and supply driven by people listing their properties, demand driven by investor dollars searching for that -- for those properties, and they can become -- those forces can become out of wack just like any other supply and demand force. As a result of that, what we\u2019re seeing is less property coming on to the market and still considerable demand for multi-family assets and we think that the combination of those two in addition to overall lower capital cost may push cap rates down a little bit. ","Nick Joseph","So do you think that the buyer\u2019s underwritten IRR has come down as well?","Michael Schall","I do. Again, not materially, I mean as I said in my comments, there has really been very few transactions since last quarter, and so I think that we are interpreting the [tea leaves] perhaps a little bit here, and so what I\u2019m talking about is I think more of an anticipation than a reality at this point in time. ","Nick Joseph","Okay, thanks. Appreciate that. And then for the BRE renovation program, can you talk about the scope of what they were doing and the returns that were being achieved and then compare that to how you think about renovation going forward? ","Michael Schall","Yes, this is Mike S again; and John Burkart is here. He may want to add to it. In effect, we just had a different set of objectives. Our objective is to generate returns and overall improve our properties. The BRE redevelopment program was focussed on trying to generate the same unit everywhere. So, our view is depending upon geography you need to customize the rehab program to the asset you\u2019re dealing with and try to find things -- and John has done a great job with our redevelopment program because he has a whole list of potential amenities from backyards to other site amenities and interiors that really reflect the opportunity in the market place as opposed to trying and create more of a one size fits all type of approach. So, ours is a customized approach, and BRE was different from that. I recall at one of the first meetings we had in Las Vegas where we are looking at -- all the management team was there -- we were looking at returns from redevelopment efforts on the BRE site, again because they were trying to go to product consistency as opposed to investment return. They had some very low yielding redevelopment projects, and essentially that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to correct or to improve. ","Nick Joseph","Thanks. And then just finally on the Walnut Creek development; it looks like the estimated total costs went up about $7 million. What caused that?","John Eudy","This is John Eudy. A combination of two things, Nick, we had some environmental issues that we had during the course of the excavation. We believe we have recovery from Atlantic Richfield and a couple of others, but we\u2019re not putting that in the number we are assuming, we don\u2019t, that constituted about 2.5 million of the total. And then, there were some structural issues related to the build out on design of the units. We made some changes, and there are other issues that came up, and we went to the high end number. I think it\u2019s going to be little less than what we have reported, the increase, but we wanted to put everything on the table, worst-case.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with UBS, please proceed.","Nick Yulico","Mike Schall, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the acquisition environment and your guidance gives some acquisitions in it, but you know there is not a ton of the FFO benefits, it sounds like you might be balancing it off for some sales, I mean, how are you looking at maybe using the ATMs some more to do acquisitions this year. It seems like you guys are one of the few multifamily REITs that could actually drive some extra earnings growth by doing acquisitions. ","Michael Schall","Right, no, I totally agree with you. I think that cost of capital has improved since we submitted our business plan to the board, which is where the accretion number came from. Obviously, we sold the two Phoenix assets that are relatively high cap rate, and so we have had to overcome the dilution related to that from new acquisitions. I think that this year is one of the most difficult years to project what\u2019s going to happen primarily because there is such a dearth of transaction activity out there right now. However, having said that, most of the transactions are bunched into the peak leasing season, whereas sellers have learned to try to get the benefit of the peak leasing season. If rents are up another $100, obviously that inures to their benefit and evaluation of their properties, and so there is likely to be more transactions beginning and let\u2019s say the second quarter through the third quarter, we just have a hard time predicting what that might look like. So we\u2019d love to do more. Again, I think cost of capital is only moved in our favor since our initial accretion numbers came -- that were presented to the Board. And so, I think that there is some upside opportunity, we\u2019re just not sure about how deep the opportunity set is going to be on the acquisition side.","Nick Yulico","Okay. That makes sense and then just one other question. As I look at your market forecasts this year or any of the S15 in the supplemental, you gave a forecast for job growth which looks like it\u2019s slowing down a bit, this year versus -- I had like 2.7% job growth in December for your markets and you have rent growth as well slowing down. It seems like the rent growth is almost slowing down similarly between these areas; Seattle, Northern California and Southern California. When I would have thought that may be the impact would have been more so in say San Jose, Seattle or maybe there is more supply. So could you just maybe talk a little bit about your thoughts are on these forecasts and how much supply and job growth is impacting them? ","Michael Schall","Of course. So we are on S15. Anyone who is trying to follow this discussion, where we reproduce the job forecast and a forecast for residential supply, it intended to be a scenario. So if U.S. GDP grows at 2.8% and the U.S. gets 2% job growth, we think that the West Coast markets on average will outperform that. We have 2.5%, you made the point that that appears to be a deceleration but I want to note that in 2014 we did the same exercise and what happened was we ended up doing better in terms of jobs in our initial forecast. So I think that there isn\u2019t a chance that we can beat these numbers. I note that, as Eric also commented on San Jose\u2019s job growth over December \u201814 was 4% and San Francisco is 3.7%; we have those numbers decelerating to 3.2% and 3%. So this is not a perfect science. We try to do a pretty good job of trying to have a economic scenario and a economic rent growth forecast. There is an element perhaps of being somewhat conservative because we don\u2019t know what factors may face us in the New Year. And certainly we hope to move ahead. I think the other force that I referred to in the call which is in coastal California the lack of for sale housing production and the fifth year of demand over supply imbalance, are also really important considerations. We are not sure exactly how those will play out. It could be that once again it just pushes occupancies that much further and we actually get another really fantastic year rent growth. So there is an element of not knowing here and we probably interpret that to be a little bit more conservative than we could. I think that there -- specifically I think there is upside to the southern California numbers given again very limited supply of housing and improving economies we see it in -- certainly in Downtown LA and West LA, in West Hollywood and in Hollywood certainly and to a lesser extent other areas, like in Warner Center we have very limited growth rate and I\u2019ve seen very limited growth for several years. So, I think that LA has the opportunity, the LA Metro area has opportunity to outperform and Northern California again the conditions are great, but we have a pretty high expectation there, certainly relative to axiometrics and some of the other numbers. So again it\u2019s not a perfect science and there is a certain art to this and we think this is a reasonable scenario given what we expect the U.S. economy to do in U.S. job growth. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jana Galan with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. ","Jana Galan","May be following up on that, I was curious how you think about the macro risks to job and wage growth given the stronger dollar and lower energy prices, does that get us to the lower end of your guidance or do you think the type of job growth in your markets is less impacted than the national average?","Michael Schall","Jana, that\u2019s a good question. I think Mike\u2019s analogy to the Goldilocks economy is a good one because even though I would say that a strong dollar would hurt global companies in general, I think that there is enough momentum here especially in the tech world to continue with really good job numbers and again we have some deceleration forecast if you look at what we achieved in 2014 versus what we projected I think if you look at December-over-December 14 jobs we were up 2.8% as a portfolio we\u2019re projecting 2.5%. I think that\u2019s a reasonable expectation given what\u2019s happening in the job world and with macro economics. So we feel pretty comfortable with that. ","Jana Galan","And then you mentioned the lower oil helping a little on that development commodity prices. Is there any benefit you can realize in your expenses?","Michael Schall","I don\u2019t think that we specifically targeted that as the expense element. There might be something, Jana. I think in the scheme of things you know I think Mike talked about property taxes being the driving force here and so yes, I don\u2019t see anything material. I\u2019m sure there is something, because you know obviously oil cost affects delivery cost in a variety of materials and that could have some impact, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s material. ","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Dan Oppenheim with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question. ","Dan Oppenheim","I was wondering how you think about the growth in terms of wages for the tenants and the ability to pay these high rents and I think we look at the lack of supply and the difficult affordability in the markets, tough to argue the rent were as forecast unless we see something change in terms of employment but, how much do you think we will see some movement whether it\u2019s from Dublin further out on 580 or in Southern California\u2019s from Orange to Riverside, that would sort of lead to higher turnovers, so the rent numbers may come through, but the expense end up being a bit higher.","Michael Schall","I think that we have the expense growth numbers that we think that are prudent as we go through our budgeting process which is essentially a ground-up type of process. I think Eric can probably talk about what that assumption is with respect to our budgets, but in general I think the driving force of personal incomes are these tech companies and business services that are actually doing very well. I think this is BLS data doesn\u2019t forecast the personal income growth and they have San Francisco at 6.6% estimated for 2015, Seattle 5.6%, San Jose 6.8%; so very healthy numbers on the personal income side. And that of course drives the rent to immediate income ratio which still are within the ratios that we consider to be sustainable. So we feel good about that. Now having said that I think that not everyone obviously is getting these wage growth and so there is a transition going on within the portfolio, so if you are coming and taking a new job that\u2019s a high end job you could afford to pay the higher rent. Someone perhaps is being priced out of that scenario and may have to move further out and I think you see that phenomenon occurring within our portfolio because you see for example the Eastbay, Alameda County and Contra Costa County growing faster than San Francisco. I think that that represents people that are being priced out of the market, looking for a suitable house that\u2019s you know typically on a transit node outside the city. So there is a transition going on and I think that\u2019s healthy for the market place.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dan Weisman with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Dan Weisman","I just wanted to talk a little bit about your relative out performance in California and across your core markets. Obviously the West Coast continued to dominate, but your performances materially bettered than your peers. I just wanted to understand whether that\u2019s a bit of submarket exposure, suburban concentration or just operational outperformance? ","Michael Schall","I think a big part of it is redevelopment and we have really worked hard to perfect that. We produce less than 1% of housing stock a year, out here in our core costal markets. That means over 20 years you\u2019re producing somewhere around 20% of stock that means 80% of the stock is more than 20 years old and realizing that the real opportunity is in the redevelopment area and certainly is the focus within acquisitions to try to find value added transactions. I think that is a big driver. I also think that our submarket selection is good and our capital allocation process which involves ranking 30 somewhat submarkets and deploying capital appropriately ahead of growth. I think all those things work together. I note that one of the transactions we bought last year Apex -- Craig, our senior acquisition guy was noticing that between the time that the deal was listed and the time it actually got through the best and final was like 45 day lag, something like that, in that period of time he noticed that the rents have moved up significantly and he went from sort of #3 in that process to #1 by increasing his bid a little bit and ended up with a superior transaction. So, I think it\u2019s a variety of things about how we look at the world from capital deployment and allocation to the opportunity represented by the rehab program I think really drives that outperformance. ","Dan Weisman","Okay helpful. And just as a follow-up on the IRR comment you made earlier, in terms of IRR compression, where would you put IRRs today in your market and also how much of land prices increase year-over-year?","Michael Schall","May be John, you do the land price and then I\u2019ll do the...","John Eudy","Sure. Yes, go ahead. It\u2019s hard and this is John Eudy. It\u2019s hard to define exactly on the land price increase but the ask is much higher than last year, I\u2019d say by probably 10% to 15%. Those that are actually transacting at that level I can\u2019t directly speak to, I can say that in our shadow pipeline it\u2019s about a $1.3 billion fixed deals and they are all conceptualized on an average about four years ago that are set to close in part this year and next year. We have a very difficult time paying the freight on land prices that are being quoted today. So I don\u2019t know if that answers your question.","Dan Weisman","And the IRR\u2019s?","John Eudy","Yes, the IRRs, I think unlevered IRR\u2019s on acquisitions, I think expectation is in the 7.5 range for acquisition, so you need significant amount of growth to get there, and on the development I think we are on the 8.","Dan Weisman","That\u2019s again on unlevered basis?","John Eudy","Unlevered, yes.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of George Hoffman with Jefferies; please proceed with your question.","George Hoffman","Just a couple of questions, first on the Alecio property, can you give a little more color on what the issues are at that property?","Erik Alexander","Yes, this is Erik. I think they are primarily resident profile. We have a much higher delinquency and incidence of eviction there. So, just by way of example, in the fourth quarter we experienced 29 either evictions or encouraged move outs due to non-payment of rent. That would compare to something that\u2019s more like 7 or 8 in a quarter under normal conditions. So we think we were working through those. We had some abatement of that activity in the third quarter that we saw returned. And the nice thing is that of all the evictions that we have processed in the last five months, 80% of those were existing residents. So we think we are making headway on the underwriting of the people that are coming in. And even of the 20% that we\u2019ve already moved in and moved out, some of those were related to fraudulent activity. Again that gives us another opportunity to tighten up some of the screening process there. So that\u2019s a big part of it. Because when you don\u2019t have, it is the same equation when you don\u2019t have the strength in occupancy, it is difficult to push the pricing on the new side and clearly with all the information that is out there, it then becomes difficult to push the renewal. So, we have to get that stabilized. And then I will say a second piece is we\u2019re still figuring out what opportunities may exist at the property specifically for capital improvements, given that the overall submarket is so strong. So there are some things that we may be able to do, but under our normal discipline, we are going to have to prove that we think they are profitable before we just pull the trigger and start building fancy pools and gyms and stuff. ","George Hoffman","And then, so on the acquisition development front, since the fundamentals in the Eastbay are so strong right now and you\u2019re having that spill over from San Francisco. Would this be an area you guys be targeting for more acquisitions and then again the two developments in Pleasanton, but you envision going out any further than that sort of 680 corridor?","Michael Schall","This is Mike, and generally no. We generally don\u2019t like being beyond the 680 corridor primarily because it brings you too close to over the hill in Tracy where you can buy a house for a couple of hundred thousand dollars. So, we like this transition from a renter to a homeowner to be a very difficult one and so part of our broad strategic objective is to be in places where for-sale housing is very expensive making the transition from a renter to homeowner a challenging one.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Alex Goldfarb for Sandler O'Neill, please proceed with your question.","Ryan Peterson","This is actually Ryan Peterson here for Alex. As your cost of equity has come down, has JV capital come down commensurately or have you seen kind of a gap between those two making maybe the cost of equity funding more attractive than JV funding?","Michael Schall","This is Mike S. In general we constantly monitor the two and we are trying to find the best accretion solution given all the arrows in the quiver with respect to capital without making greater risk in the balance sheet. So at this point in time with the movement in the stock and the rally in the debt markets, I think the preference will be to grow on balance sheet. There would be perhaps some limited exceptions on the development side because that is a little bit different in that we\u2019re committing to a cap rate today and we funded over the next couple of years. So our batch funding ability is more limited there, but I would say we haven\u2019t marketed many acquisitions to the institutional market recently given what I just said about, our on balance sheet cost of capital, but I suspect that their yield targets have not changed all that materially, maybe come down a little bit relative to a year ago. ","Ryan Peterson","And then just one other quick question. How much of the 2015 redevelopment spend is for the BRE portfolio versus the legacy Essex portfolio?","Michael Dance","This is Mike Dance. Roughly a third of it will be targeted for the BRE portfolio.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Zielinski with RBC, please go ahead with your question.","Michael Zielinski","Can you just go back to the development, in terms the starts for \u201815, I think you mentioned 1.4 billion shadow pipeline. How much and what the size and scope of the starts plan in \u201815 and then just given the positive commentary about leasing in the fourth quarter, where is the expected stabilized yield in that pipeline stand currently? ","Michael Schall","First of all on your comment of shadow pipeline of 4 billion, I think that\u2019s -- one pipeline which includes the 2.5 billion# that we got plus the 1.5 that is in the shadow that we haven\u2019t started, just to clarify that. As far as yields overall in the mid 6 to 7 range is where we\u2019re landing our stabilization at and about half the pipeline that currently is in will be stabilized during the first couple of quarters and then half of the balance by the end of the year and then going into \u201916. And maybe just to add one specific item that I think you asked which is the 2015 starts are somewhere in that $800 million range projected of the $1.3 billion shadow pipeline. ","Michael Zielinski","Okay, that\u2019s helpful and a second question, just for Erik, do you have loss lease stats in the portfolio currently and if you could break that out between what you are seeing for the Essex legacy portfolio as well as the BRE portfolio, just in light of the 5.6% [indiscernible] you guys have forecasted?","Michael Schall","Yes, at the end of the quarter it was 3% for Essex and a little less than that for BRE, 2.5 range.","Unidentified Company Representative","Just one quick comment. December 31 represent the low point of loss to lease within our portfolio given seasonality, so just keep that in mind. So I think if you went back to July, July is typically the high point and it was in the 6 to 7 range, and so just keep that in mind, that\u2019s little bit -- needs to be put in to context which I was trying to do.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Tom Lesnick with Capital One securities, please go ahead with your question.","Tom Lesnick","Just curious, how are you guys thinking about schools like Orange Coast College in the growth prospects for apartments surrounding similar tier universities in California, is that something that you guys are opportunistically looking at to growing your footprint around?","Michael Schall","It\u2019s Mike. No, not really, we do operate some properties that are around a variety of schools and there are some unique challenges with those properties, namely that students don\u2019t treat the property very well and you need specialized systems and ways of dealing with them and I think that there\u2019s some price sensitivity at some level certainly with respect to students that are surrounding some of the major universities in the urban areas that are now very expensive. So it is not an area that we strategically are expecting to pursue. And I think that the growth rates that we are seeing on the properties that we typically target are generally better than the growth rates we see on the student dominated properties.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of David Bragg with Green Street Advisors, please proceed with your question.","David Bragg","Michael Schall, you have long kept us updated on your thoughts on prop 13. What are your latest thoughts on the prospects of that making into the ballot next year?","Michael Schall","That is a great question and I have to admit that I have not seen anything nor pursued, any of these latest discussions. Once upon a time we had a lobbyist in Sacramento that was keeping us up-to-date so I don\u2019t have anything new to report there Dave honestly. So I\u2019ll look into it and start commenting on that again in the future.","David Bragg","And the second question is, while first thanks for the interesting long-term perspective on Phoenix, we understand the criteria that you look for in markets. One that you used to be in, that we are curious about your related thoughts on is Portland which has put up a pretty good track record over the long-term and lately what extent do you consider re-entering that market?","Michael Schall","I was in Portland recently and we discussed it among the senior group here. We in the past were more on the periphery of Portland and in Beaverton, Hillsboro etc. And we found that the impact of for-sale housing was just too great and our original thesis surrounding Portland was that it was protected by an urban growth boundary that would be respected by the politicians and when that failed when essentially they expanded the urban growth boundary, built several thousand more homes, it changed our supply demand balance materially and we exited Portland. ","So our discussion recently is surrounded of more focused strategy on the downtown area in looking at rents and the opportunities there I think that we get the similar type of exposure in Seattle and so will probably not likely to move there at this point in time, but I knowledge that it has been certainly in the downtown, certainly urbanization is having an effect there and we think it is a high quality market and improving.","David Bragg","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And our last question comes from the line of Buck Horne with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.","Buck Horne","Good afternoon guys. I want to go back to the supply outlook for your macro projection in terms of new deliveries into the market and I am wondering a little bit longer-term if we -- if you guys extended the forecast in terms of what you know now into 2016, what do you think the delivery pipeline looks like for markets like San Jose in Seattle in particular and does a potential supply surge in those regions affect, how you think about deploying additional capital into either Seattle or Santa Clara County.","Michael Schall","The Axio data on Seattle had a big spike in permitting activity that concerns us but not to the extent that we would tell out of the wells also very robust demand in Seattle. In California, I think 2016 is going to be a continuation of the same forces that we have had before which is tech continues to do well tech and life science that drives the job growth at somewhere in the two and half plus or minus range and you have \u2013 we just don\u2019t produce enough housing to take care of that demand and as a result of that I think we have another very good 2016 at this point in time.","We also track as you know rent to median income levels and it\u2019s interesting LA or all of Southern California continues to be below the long-term historical average for rent to median income. Seattle and San Jose are pretty much right at the long-term historical average and San Francisco and Oakland are a bit above , about 8% or above long-term historical average. So we don\u2019t see an indication that affordability is an enormous issue here, but we recognize for example that the adults living with parents and that type of phenomena probably doesn\u2019t unwind all that quickly given the how high rents are in these marketplaces. So we still feel very bullish about coastal California and I would say that Seattle is more of more uncertain about Seattle but still positive but we are more uncertain about Seattle.","Buck Horne","Okay. very helpful and lastly just on the equity issue and from the ATM, you guys seem to have stepped up and accelerated some activity in January. you think pretty much you are done with the ATM for the quarter or do you envision continuing to, may be accelerate use of the ATM later this quarter or into the first half of the year","Michael Schall","Yes, we did jump ahead of it a little bit and we do have a transaction pipeline and we\u2019re trying to match fund that and we did get ahead of that a little bit and we understand that produces some dilution in Q1. We thought it was still the appropriate trade-off and so we expect again to given our debt rates and where the stock is trading to be pretty aggressive this year on the acquisition area. And we think cost to capital and ability to add NAV and cash flow per share is really great. So, we hope the transaction markets cooperate with us. Again we do have a pipeline now. And now I am going to tell you how large it is but we hope to add to that and so we are stepping a little bit ahead of the transaction closings with respect to the ATM and capital rates.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today question and answer session. I would like to turn the floor back to Michael Schall for closing remarks.","Michael Schall","Thank you, operator. In closing we appreciate and we thank you for your participation on the call. We are obviously very pleased with our results last year and look forward to another good year 2015#. We look forward to seeing many of you at City Conference in about a month. Thanks for joining us . Good day.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s teleconference.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs, as well as information available to the company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found in the company's filings with the SEC.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you. Mr. Schall, you may begin.","Michael J. Schall","Thank you, Christian. Welcome to our Second Quarter Earnings Call. As usual, Erik Alexander and Mike Dance will follow me with comments on operations and finance, respectively. John Eudy and John Burkart are available for Q&A.","I'll cover 2 topics on the call: first, second quarter results and commentary; and second, cap rates and investment markets.","So on to the first topic. Yesterday, we reported another strong quarter with core FFO per share of $1.88, an increase of nearly 13% over the prior year and above the high end of the guidance range that was presented on our last earnings call. Operations were better than expected in the second quarter, which includes the results of our peak leasing season, leading us to increase midpoint of the core FFO guidance range by $0.03 per share. Mike Dance will discuss the guidance range further in a few minutes.","Rents in the Essex portfolio are now approximately 10% higher than in the third quarter of 2008, which approximates the prior peak in rents, and 29% above the trough in rents experienced amid the Great Recession in Q4 2009. Our review of economic data suggests a continuation of the strong housing markets on the West Coast with rents in the Essex submarkets expected to grow at an average of between 4% to 6% in 2014 and 2015, absent significant change in the U.S. economy. Factors supporting this expectation include: Number one, loss to lease was approximately 6% of scheduled rent at June 30. Number two, personal income growth is well above the national average in the West Coast market. The national average personal income growth is 2.3% compared to Seattle at 3.8%, Northern California at 4% and Southern California at approximately 3%. Number three, given strong personal income growth, rent to median income, a proxy for rental affordability, remains at sustainable levels. And number four, with the exception of Seattle, production of for-sale housing continues at a muted level and for-sale housing is becoming less affordable given rapid increases in housing values and increasing interest rates. Limited for-sale construction mutes the impact of higher levels of apartment development. Overall, we continue to believe that household formation will be significantly greater than the total of for-sale and rental housing deliveries.","Economic data remained strong during the second quarter, supporting our expectation for a continued favorable apartment environment. Beyond the data, there's a certain vibrancy and confidence in the West Coast market, especially Northern California and Seattle.","As usual, we have summarized our 2013 forecast of residential supply, jobs and market growth on page S-16 of the supplement. We lowered the job growth projections for Los Angeles because June was weaker than expected, mostly due to the loss of 24,000 jobs in the entertainment industry. Although jobs in the entertainment industry are often volatile, this decline is unusually large. Several firms, including Walt Disney and DreamWorks Animation have reduced staff ahead of the normal industry seasonality. As a result, our estimated market rent growth for Los Angeles on Page S-16 was reduced from 6.5% to 6%. However, this does not change our conclusion that Southern California will continue its gradual recovery.","On to my second topic, which is cap rates and investment markets. The investment markets are adjusting to higher interest rates and better-than-expected apartment fundamentals. Although apartment transactions are only down about 10% from last year, there are fewer properties on the market that meet our criteria. We guided to $400 million in acquisitions in 2013 and have closed $290 million thus far this year. We remain on track to hit or possibly exceed the guidance with respect to acquisitions.","We've also been an active seller given the previously announced liquidation of Fund II and the potential sale of 3 portfolio properties. From our recent transaction experience, we draw the following conclusions: Number one, cap rates for institutional quality property in A quality locations have not changed significantly and remain in the low 4% range. The combination of scarce availability of these properties and significant institutional apartment demand have held pricing constant.","Second, for smaller properties and lesser locations, which often involve an individual or group of smaller buyers, cap rates have increased about 10 to 25 basis points to approximately 5% for B quality property and B quality locations. Buyers are pushing back, citing higher financing costs, which are countered by sellers pointing to better economic conditions that will result in stronger rent growth going forward.","And then third, in the case of Fannie Mae, increased interest rates have been accompanied by higher spreads. A 10-year Fannie Mae loan at 65% loan-to-value is now priced at around 4.75%, which is about 75 basis points lower than in 2007, but up from about 3.3% earlier this year. Shorter terms, Freddie Mac and swap bank loans are generally more competitive financing options.","And number four, our overall expectation for the next 6 months is for transaction volumes to remain at essentially muted levels.","On the development side, we believe that the supply of apartments will peak in 2014 to 2015 and approximate 10% increase in construction costs over the past year, higher interest rates and overall conservative underwriting by construction lenders will continue to slow the number of apartments that are started. We're beginning to see a few lower density condo developments in San Francisco for the first time since the Great Recession. We expect more condo activity if the median-priced home continues to increase rapidly. The median home price increased year-over-year by 13% in Seattle and from 20% to 35% in Coast of California. The combination of strong market price increases at higher mortgage rate makes the transition from renting to homeownership more difficult, which benefits apartments.","That concludes my comments. Thank you for joining the call. I'll now turn the call over to Erik.","Erik J. Alexander","Okay. Thank you, Mike. Property operations turned in another solid quarter, highlighted by continued strength in Seattle and Northern California. And while Southern California has yet to accelerate the way that we had hoped for, the region does continue to deliver improving results and we remain optimistic about future growth. Leasing activity during the period continued to strengthen following a good first quarter. Average new lease rates continue to post new highs for Essex, and on portfolio-wide basis, reached $1,756 in July.","Renewal activity was also strong and slightly ahead of expectations. For the quarter, renewal rates grew 5.2% over expiring rates and were 5.7% higher in July. This compares favorably with last July when renewals were 5.2%. We expect August and September renewals to be in the mid 5% range, given the offers extended to residents, which include our voluntary 10% cap on rent increases for existing residents. Even at these higher rental rates, turnover remains in line with our plan for the year. Portfolio occupancy ended lower for the quarter compared to last year as we took advantage of economic rent growth and increased our profitable redevelopment activity. For context, our portfolio occupancy was actually 10 basis points higher this quarter compared to the second quarter of 2012 when you net out the renovation activity for both periods. Even in Southern California where rent growth isn't as strong as the rest of the portfolio, we saw increases in scheduled rent and took advantage of renovation opportunities at several properties in the region. We believe the modest reduction in occupancy is a worthwhile trade-off for higher scheduled rent in the second half of the year and will continue to reward us in 2014.","Following our pre-leasing efforts, we opened Phase I of the Epic development on June 21 and are off to a very impressive start. So in the 6 weeks since opening, we have leased 145 apartment homes and already have 83 of those units occupied. We expect to stabilize Phase I in October and deliver the second phase by November. Rent levels are near pro forma with concessions ranging from 2 to 6 weeks, but we are well ahead of our absorption schedule.","Beyond our own success, we are very pleased that competitors are also enjoying strong absorption. In fact, our research provider reported that average absorption in the submarket for the 5 active lease-up projects was a whopping 60 units per property per month during the second quarter. So while this pace is not likely to continue, demand is more than sufficient to absorb the 30 to 35 units we need each month to execute our plan at Epic. Therefore, we believe this robust leasing activity supports the strong fundamentals in San Jose and gives us reason to continue to be bullish on the region.","We also began pre-leasing efforts at Connolly Station in Dublin at the end of the quarter and are looking forward to receiving our certificate of occupancy later this month. We've leased a dozen apartment homes sight unseen and we'll begin conducting our first model tours this week. With an interest list of more than 500 people, we hope to achieve absorption ahead of plan at this project as well.","Now I'll share some highlights for each region, beginning with Seattle. Seattle continues to perform above our expectations. Rent growth continue to be strong in all submarkets and the 12 active lease-up projects in downtown averaged 26 units per building per month for the second quarter. Strong rent growth is also extended to the south end of the region, with actual achieved rents growing by 7% since the beginning of the year. Employment growth remained strong in the region with year-over-year increase at 2.4%. And year-to-date, commercial office absorption totaled 1.9 million square feet, and overall vacancy is hovering around 13%.","Of note, Vulcan announced last month that it will begin construction on Phases 7 and 8 of Amazon's headquarters, adding over 600,000 square feet to their South Lake Union location. Once all the projects under construction are completed, Amazon can occupy more than 7 million square feet in Downtown Seattle. While Amazon is clearly one of the most important employers in the Metro, Disney, Expedia and Zulily all announced expansions during the quarter as well.","Moving to Northern California. As expected, Northern California continues to lead the way for Essex with the highest growth in rental rates and revenue for the portfolio. In fact, new lease transaction in the division has averaged over $2,000 for 3 months in a row. Consistent with rising rents, the median price of a home in San Francisco has now topped $1 million with condominiums not far behind at $850,000. Equally impressive is the fact that inventory-for-sale products is a mere 1 month.","June's year-over-year job growth was over 2.2%, led by San Jose submarket at 2.7% growth. Office absorption in the region was modest during the quarter, leasing just over 400,000 square feet. However, Facebook and Samsung have both broken ground on more than 1 million square feet of development for their companies, and Netflix received approval for their 0.5 million square foot project in Los Gatos.","Turning to Southern California. Rent growth continues to be steady in the region. Average new rents have increased every month since January and renewals reached 4.4% in July, the highest rate of increase in 2 years. Additionally, renovated apartments, like our project, Highridge, in Palos Verdes are achieving average rent gains of $400, yielding 15% returns on our costs. We will continue to take advantage of these opportunities and still see Los Angeles and Orange County as our top markets in Southern California this year.","Overall job growth in June slowed in Los Angeles, but Orange County, San Diego and Ventura met our growth expectations. In San Diego, we are keeping an eye on the potential impact of sequestration. The positive impact is the troop deployments have been delayed, keeping service men and women home longer. However, roughly 25,000 of the civilian workers of the Defense Department were furloughed in July. This budget reduction measure is scheduled through September but could be extended.","Office absorption in Southern California was positive in all counties for the quarter and totaled 1.1 million square feet. But results in Los Angeles are still negative from a year-to-date perspective. However, the most significant commercial news coming out of the region for the quarter is the fact that Mercedes-Benz signed a 1.1 million-square foot industrial lease in Long Beach. Combined with Boeing's transfer of 300 to 400 engineering jobs in the second half of this year to the Long Beach facility, Hyundai's headquarter project, the Ford expansion and other large projects in the region, we still believe Southern California is poised for more meaningful growth in the coming quarters.","The majority of the economic indicators and leasing metrics are positive and signify continued revenue growth for us. Therefore, we remain confident in all of our markets and our ability to deliver results consistent with our increased guidance for 2013.","I thank you for your time. I'll now turn the call over to Mike Dance.","Michael T. Dance","Thanks, Erik. Today, I'll provide commentary on our second quarter results and changes to the full year guidance, as well as an update on a select balance sheet item.","This quarter's operating results for revenues and expenses outperformed our guidance. These results are consistent with the first quarter, in which results surpassed expectations. As such, we are raising our same property revenue forecast 20 basis points at the midpoint to 6% and same property NOI growth of 20 basis points to 7.2%. Our expense growth remains unchanged at 3% to 4%.","Expense growth in the first 6 months of the year was 4.8%, slightly better than our expectation. Expense growth in the second half of the year should be below the full year guidance range since the comparative period in 2012 is more reflective of our operating expense run rate for our portfolio. Of note is that the state of California is on a June 30 fiscal year, and we received Proposition 8 reassessments that are effective as of July 1 late in the third quarter. For the year-to-date expense results, Northern California taxes are up almost 5% over the prior period in 2012 due to the significant Prop. 8 adjustments, which were effective July 1, '12. The expense guidance for '13 assumes another $500,000 increase in property taxes in California from property assessments returning to their higher Proposition 13 assessed values.","I'd also like to point out that the lowering of the high end of the range for revenue and NOI guidance is due in part to the success we are achieving with our interior renovations. This year, we are planning on renovating between 1,200 and 1,400 apartment homes, which are achieving impressive returns. However, these renovations take approximately 30 days during which time these apartments are not available for rent. Accordingly, any renovations begun after July will not be able to generate enough incremental revenues in '13 to offset the additional vacancy. Our second half of the year guidance assumes we continue these interior renovations through the fourth quarter, which is expected to increase the '13 rehab vacancy by about 20 basis points for the second half of the year compared to the same period in '12.","As previously reported, last year we began liquidating Fund II, which terminates in September 14. To date, 3 properties remain, which are in the midst of being marketed and we anticipate selling them within the next 3 to 6 months. Depending on the timing of these dispositions, we expect to receive promote income of approximately $4 million after all 3 remaining properties sell. From accounting perspective, the Fund II promote income is not recognizable until the last asset in the fund is sold. Accordingly, if any of the Fund II assets sales occur in '14, the '13 total FFO will be at the lower end of the guidance shown on S-14. Postponing the promote income from Fund II into '14 will have a favorable impact on our core FFO guidance, which assumes all the co-investment income from the Fund II assets will cease on September '13.","We are raising the midpoint of our core FFO per diluted share by $0.03 to 5 -- to $7.58. The increase is related to higher same property net operating income of $0.06 per share, which is partially offset by $0.02 of lower interest income from the preferred equity investment that was repaid and not part of the guidance and $0.01 of dilution from the disposition of Fund II assets was sold earlier than the September 30 disposition date assumed in our original '13 guidance.","On the balance sheet, the notes and other receivables at June 30 stood at $110 million, an increase of nearly $100 million from the first quarter. This increase was the result of advancing our co-investment partnerships funds, which were secured by real property at terms comparable to secured bank loans. In July, Fund II repaid $45 million with proceeds from dispositions and loans totaling $57 million to the Wesco III joint venture, which are secured by recent acquisitions of Regency and Gas Company Lofts will be repaid this month with the proceeds from the permanent secured financings.","That ends my comments, and I'll now turn the call back over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nick Joseph with Citigroup.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","This is Michael Bilerman here with Nick. Mike, just had a question for you and it's hypothetical. If an investor was agitating for change at another company and they had capital sources backing them and you were such a capital source, would you want to stay silent in that or would you be public?","Michael J. Schall","It's a very good question, and I think I understand the context. However, it's hypothetical and every situation is different. So let me just start by making a broader comment, which is, as a general statement, I believe it is counterproductive to discuss strategic activities on the call. It leads to, I think, lot of possible unintended outcomes. In this case, I'm going to make this one brief statement and then decline further questions. And so that statement is as follows. We are not involved in any way, including any related discussions, with the July 31 letter from Land and Buildings to BRE nor were we involved in the other reference -- the offer referenced in that letter. So hopefully, that will take care of it. Again, Michael, I think every situation is different and there are pros and cons in terms of how these things are viewed strategically and how they play out. And there's great uncertainty as well with respect to what happens because we can't see more than a couple of steps ahead. So I think I'll just leave it at that and not comment on this any further. As you may have noticed, we had a great quarter, and hopefully, we can get some questions about the company and recent activity.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So I won't ask about the $8 million increase in marketable securities and whether that was BRE. We'll leave that aside. I'll let Nick ask a really good question about the company.","Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","You were able to buy condos that were trading at pretty large discounts to replacement costs and then convert them to rentals. So now that you've seen a larger cover in the asset prices, what are your thoughts for those assets longer term?","Michael J. Schall","Nick, it remains the same as it was before. We thought that there was a great opportunity to buy condos at apartment prices, something that I've not seen in my career, and I've been here, I think, it's 28 years or something like that. And so it was a very unusual opportunity and so now we're starting to see the median-priced home increase relatively dramatically and we are tracking the differential between condo values and apartment values. As a general statement right now, they're close to parity and that includes not only the condos that we bought in the 2009 to 2011 period, but almost everything that we're building that has a condo map as well. So we've got virtually our entire development pipeline that has condo maps as well. So we're tracking it. At this point in time, we don't see a big premium. The one market that's starting to be very close is San Francisco. But with apartments trading at very attractive cap rates, we don't see a large arbitrage even in that market at this point in time.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Toti with Cantor Fitzgerald.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","I was wondering if you guys are potentially bidding on the Empire State building as well?","Michael J. Schall","You're going to make me go back to my comment about counterproductive to discuss strategic items. I think I can deny that one outright as well.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Okay, okay. I have a couple of detailed questions. On the CapEx spending for the Gas Company and Regency, what kind of return do you underwrite on that sort of $20 million-ish?","Michael J. Schall","Well, in this case, there's a number of different things and I don't remember specifically what it is. In general, revenue-generating CapEx is underwriting to somewhere around in the 13% to 15% range, but that's if you exclude deferred maintenance, which inevitably is part of the CapEx spend. And in this case, I think it's somewhere -- it would be all the deferred maintenance gets included in that number as well. So it's probably somewhere in the 8 to 8 plus or minus percent range, which is not dissimilar from our general approach to renovating apartments.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then ...","Michael J. Schall","It's in the cap rate, too. We underwrite it as part of the cap rate. In the case of Gas Company Lofts, there are some other opportunities like potentially a rooftop deck and some other things that we think it's an under amenitized building and so we think there's some real value in a couple of things. But I don't have the details exactly, which pieces account for what. But as a general statement, it follows our overall approach to rent -- redevelopment, which is in that 8% to 10% on everything, which includes some deferred maintenance fees.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then I just want to go back to the topic of housing affordability because it feels to me like we're sort of replaying the scenario that we saw, let's say, I don't know, 10 years ago where the affordability gap has really sort of widened out pretty quickly except at that time we had a lot of -- you saw a lot of people moving out to purchase homes. This is a little bit different. So would you say that you have significantly more pricing power today because of the inability of your tenants to purchase homes? And is there a flip side risk to really sparking churn just for people moving up because of pricing? How do you sort of -- do you think about the dynamic?","Michael J. Schall","Well, maybe I'll start with some comments on rent to median income. In San Francisco, in that period of time you're referring to, the late '90s and 2000, 2001, our rent to median income was above 30% in San Francisco, it's about 25% currently, and that's the highest in the Essex portfolio. And so, we don't think that it's at the same level that you saw in that period of time, the dotcom boom and over that period. Now rents went up 40% in 2 to 3 years during that period of time. So we really haven't seen that kind of rent growth. And then of course, it came right back down. So I don't think it's the same as that period of time. And I think that, as I said on the call, that the rent to median income, in general, look like they're in the band of plus or minus 10% from the long-term historical averages. So we don't see that as much of a problem at this point in time. Then finally, the relationship between what's happening with personal income growth, which hopefully will become household incomes. When you're growing those numbers in the 3% to 4% range, which we are and a little bit more in some of the submarkets, it's not going to push that rent-to-median income ratio that quickly. And therefore, I see more sustainability there as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Harris with Imperial Capital.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Let me ask a question of you Mike that I asked David Simon on his call a little earlier in the week. Let's assume over the next 3 to 5 years we are in a rising rate environment. Today, you're allocating capital with the hope that some of that capital will produce nice returns over that time frame. You're making decisions actually today in that context. What do you think you might be doing differently if we suppose that perhaps we go to a more normalized longer-term rate environment?","Michael J. Schall","David, yes. Good question. It's a question that is being debated by our board, but I think we've taken several steps toward answering that. And the primary step is to extend maturities and in effect lock in some very favorable rates for as long as we can. And the significance of that is that, that allows us time to transition from the market that we're in into markets that may be not as favorable as the current one. I would also say or suggest that if that happens, if interest rates go up, we would certainly hope that we would have a more positive economic backdrop in terms of higher GDP growth rates, higher job growth and less unemployment. And so I'm not sure that even increasing interest rates at some not too extreme level would be beneficial, net-net, for the company. But I think in terms of our planning, it really leads to longer maturities and less debt ultimately. And I think you've started to see over the last couple of years us move in that direction. Our last bond deal was a 10-year deal and we're going to try to focus on that going forward, which, again, provides plenty of opportunity to transition into a different type of market.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Would you be more cautious today about underwriting a development than you would have been 3 months ago, say, or 2 months ago before we saw the move in long-term rates?","Michael J. Schall","Yes, I think I made comments on the prior calls that, in general, we're going to try to hit the bottom end of the cycle very aggressively on the development side and then tail off as we get into mid-cycle. And clearly, I think that we've done that as well. And so, development is something that we're essentially committing to a cap rate today and matching it with funds that we're going to generate or raise a couple of years down the road. And so we want to make sure that we have plenty of room for markets that change in that case as well. We had -- we'd announced in the quarter the Downtown San Jose 1 South Market development deal, which we're very excited about and it's interesting that some people look at downtown San Jose and say that's a less desirable area. From our perspective, we see this movement toward urbanization really and throughout the United States, but certainly here on the West Coast, as being something that's important to us. And we think that, the right urban hubs are going to generate higher rents ultimately. And so we look at it much like we did Los Angeles, Downtown Los Angeles where in the worst case scenario kind of continues down the same path, which is a market performed in a scenario where it transitions to something more like a 24-hour city, certainly as L.A. has, it becomes much more exciting than that. And so that was the thought process behind 1 South market.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then finally, a question on the ATM. There was no issuance in the second quarter?","Michael T. Dance","That's correct.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And just remind me -- I know we discussed this numerous times before. You're kind of hovering around where my NAV is. It may be below yours or whatever. But I mean, generally speaking, you would be -- I mean, unless you've got specific use of proceeds or were trading at or above your estimate of NAV, you wouldn't be using the ATM?","Michael T. Dance","We'll see. We had only used it to match fund investments that are accretive to NAV per share, improve the growth rate of the portfolio and improve the cash flows of the company. So we are not going to be issuing equities on cash.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","And you'd be very sensitive to the stock price relative to your own estimate of NAV?","Michael T. Dance","Yes. In the situation you described, when NAV drops below -- or the share price drops below NAV, we're much more likely to want to do our external growth with joint venture partners. And we have a platform that is very successful at changing to that platform at times, so that we're issuing less equity and typically using more leverage and a joint venture partner's equity as well.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","And no share buyback program in place at the moment?","Michael T. Dance","That is correct.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rob Stevenson with Macquarie.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Can you talk a little bit about the San Jose and Seattle markets in terms of supply and what you're seeing there and what sort of broken ground over the last couple of quarters and what you guys think is likely to break ground over the remainder of '13?","Michael J. Schall","Sure. I mean, the general comment that we expect deliveries to peak in '14 and '15. And it's interesting, I think someone has the planned units in one of our vendor data, which appears to be pretty substantial, but -- and John Eudy is here, so he's dealing with this on a daily basis. So even though there's a lot of planned units out there, and this is part of my comments, a lot of those are having trouble -- a lot of those deals, development deals, are struggling to become financed. And so even though there's a lot of planned deals out there, we still see a drop-off, not dramatic, in the '14, '15 period. In Seattle, I think we have about the same amount of multi-family supply in '14 as in '13. So -- and then it drops off in '15. I don't have that number right in front of me. In San Jose, because of the 5 development deals in North San Jose, they were all approved by the city at the same time, we think that North San Jose submarket, essentially those transactions, I think, is about 3,000 units, John?","John D. Eudy","3,500.","Michael J. Schall","3,500 units get delivered and then it drops off significantly in that submarket. But I think that the move will be toward about a 20% reduction in '14, '15 in Northern California. And then Southern California, we see -- we just don't see supply being a huge issue there. And again, we see Southern California essentially staying at a very muted level for the next several years, although there are some pockets where supply can be an issue. So I'm making a broader statement. Even though within a local pocket, there could be some issue and what -- Woodland Hills comes to mind. The Warner Center area has a couple of lease-ups that are essentially changing. And San Diego has something similar. But -- so that's the multi-family side. On the single-family side, again, Seattle continuing to produce pretty significant amounts of single-family for-sale housing but muted throughout the rest of the West Coast. And the discussion that I just had about condos and the relationship between apartment values and condo values and the absence of a premium on that condo value side is, I think, what is the limiting factor when it comes to the for-sale development. Again, if you -- I mentioned there was somewhere in the 20% to 35% median household or median priced home growth. Obviously, if that happens again, then I think we're going to start seeing condo development because that will create that premium that we're referring to, that is necessary for condo development. And John -- I just asked John this question yesterday and again he can comment if he wants to, to what extent are you seeing condos compete with our apartment sites? And his answer was just on a very limited basis, but we're really not seeing some lower density types of transactions in San Francisco there to be able to build those condos. We are not seeing that strong competition yield for our apartment sites by the condo developers. We view that as a good thing. So I think that there's a number of factors that are causing this limitation in supply. And we don't see it changing or we don't see it certainly going against us over the next couple of years.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","And how much has material and labor sort of changed between the Emeryville and the San Mateo development starts about 1 year ago and 1 South Market this year?","John D. Eudy","This is John Eudy. On a percentage basis, is that the. . .","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Yes, it's just a feel for an addition to interest rates moving up and land costs moving up, what's the change in construction costs.","John D. Eudy","To reference what Mike indicated, around 10%. Both of those starts last August, I believe, and then obviously we just announced the San Jose deal and if you were to mark it to market in that 10% range, plus or minus.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then just lastly, what are you guys currently expecting from a stabilized yield on the current development pipeline?","Michael J. Schall","We have not really changed our underwriting standards. So we measured on stabilization somewhere in the 6.5% range, again depending upon market rent growths. And underwritten today based on rents in place today is somewhere in the mid-5s.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","It didn't take long for the county questions to come up, just -- but listen at least, you guys talked about it, which is good. Just a few questions for Mr. Dance. Mike, you went over the California property tax. In the same-store, Seattle looked to be up strong year-to-date on property tax, like 23%. Can you just provide a little more color on what's going up and what's going on in Seattle?","Michael T. Dance","Seattle, they tend to do this every 2 or 3 years. So some of this is a catch-up from prior years. And we're appealing them, but until we're successful on the appeal, we pay the property taxes and accrue them accordingly. I think one thing to note, our accounting policy may differ from some of our peers in that when we do have an appeal that relates to prior years, we run that through a non-same-store, so we don't get the lumpiness in our NOI results. So basically, Seattle has a cap on what they can raise in revenue in any one year. So what that means is, apartments have recovered before the other real estate sectors. So we're taking the brunt of it this year. We would expect over time, Seattle would see recovery in the industrial and office space and we would just be paying our fair share rather than more of our fair share of property taxes in King County.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. So basically you guys are the 1%-ers up there?","Michael J. Schall","Seems like it. Alex, we were surprised as well because we had assumed that we knew we had big valuation increases, but we were surprised that they increased 1 milligrade in Seattle and, yes, 20-something percent increase in property tax is a tough hit.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. Next is if we look at your rent growth this year, San Mateo has been outpacing -- has been the strongest and it's been outpacing San Francisco, yet when you go out to San Francisco, you see a lot of the surge of people who want to live in San Francisco, they bus down to the peninsula. So sort of curious why San Francisco is lagging rental growth versus San Mateo? Is that rent control policy? Or is there's some other dynamic going on there?","Michael T. Dance","I think it's part rent control policy and then on the total rent side are capitalized into that on the non-rent-control building.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. And then just finally, on the condo side, you mentioned that condos are sort of coming back in San Francisco. Given that the biggest threat to rentals -- to rental apartments is really condos, not for-sale homes, do you guys foresee that there's potentially an issue where rents have gone up meaningfully where people say, I can still live in the same infill urban neighborhood, but instead of renting, I can now own and try and keep money rather than throwing money away every month. Do you see that as a potential threat in San Francisco?","Michael J. Schall","We see any housing development as a threat. I mean, we believe that we take, on the one hand, household formation; on the other hand, total number of units that are being built, whether they are condos or single family or apartments, and we try to look for where the greatest imbalance is. And the other piece of it is that we are located in areas with very expensive for-sale housing. In San Francisco, I think the median priced home is somewhere -- median priced condo is about $850,000. And therefore, that transition from a apartment renter to a homeowner is just not an easy one. Especially on the condo side, you certainly have monthly dues that are pretty significant, which take away some of that perceived benefit that you're talking about given low interest rates.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with UBS.","Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I just had a question on the Peninsula, San Jose. If you look at that mark and you look at your rent stats for your kind of renter profile and you talked about some of the new development and the absorption there, I'm curious if you could -- do you have any stats or commentary on how much of the demand over the past year or so has been from kind of people within the area moving there or whether they got job transfer within the Bay Area to that market versus, say, new entrants to the entire area who got a job from out-of-state perhaps.","Erik J. Alexander","This is Erik. I don't have the breakdown for people coming in and out. I would tell you that, anecdotally -- I can get back to you with that, but anecdotally, both Seattle and the Bay Area definitely include people that are relocating out of the area whether they're going to work for Google or Amazon, what have you. But that's definitely a piece of the demand. But more of it is related to the folks that already live in the region.","Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then I guess just a follow-up on that would be if you look at that then, how does that affect an area like the East Bay, which presumably, I mean, I don't think it's had a strong job growth. Maybe some people have moved from the East Bay to the Peninsula for jobs. Longer term, how do you guys think about the East Bay in relation to San Francisco or the Peninsula?","Michael J. Schall","Yes. This is Mike. I think that if the rental pool is very dynamic and depending upon who you are within the rental pool, you're going to have a set of decisions about where you're going to invest in housing. And so those relationships change every single day. And let's take the world as it is today, which is there are more have than have-nots in the, I'd say, in the economy that we've had before. Therefore, there's a growing disparity. There are some tech workers that are getting very high increases in compensation and then there is a group of people that are getting 2% to 4% if they're lucky. And obviously, those 2 groups are going to act -- react much differently. One of the group, the first group, is going to be the renters in the South of Market Street in San Francisco, the very expensive areas, the areas that are -- that everyone would desire, let's say. It would be their first choice in housing and where the greatest demand rests. However, people that can afford that have to make another choice and if we've given them now 3 10% rent bumps, that -- if we give them 3 10% rent bumps to someone that's gotten 2% to 3% compensation increases, which I guarantee has happened out there at some level, they're really forced to make another housing decision, which is exactly what we would expect to happen. And the East Bay will be a logical place to go because it's -- there are still very good markets within the East Bay and they're not as expensive as some of the better locations. And so, again, I think you have sort of a bifurcation between the people that can afford, the best locations and the best properties and those that cannot. And as rents go higher, there are going to be more and more people to fall into that latter category and are going to be forced into other locations and other housing decisions. I go back to -- we're talking earlier about the 1999 to 2001 period, essentially, the entire Bay Area, the interesting part was the entire Bay Area was 98% occupied. So that led the job growth and demand for housing outstripped supply by such a large amount that essentially the whole Bay Area filled up. So we're not at that point, but we're certainly going down that road.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Bragg with Green Street Advisors.","David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","I think you're flagging a modest increase for Class B cap rates, but can you provide a little color on this including whether or not you think it's broad based across your footprint or more isolated in one of the regions?","Michael J. Schall","Good question, Dave. I think it's pretty broad based. And again, I think it's driven more by who your buyer is than the category, which I think the institutional quality property is going to be generally focused on the better areas. So no, I think it's actually pretty broad based. This is within our footprint. And again, we've got a fair -- pretty significant amount of property that we've marketed in the last 90 to 180 days. And therefore, it's essentially drawing conclusions from that experience.","David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And just to follow up on Los Angeles, a comment made earlier. Do you believe that the significant job losses in the entertainment industry are they're just a seasonal issue, nothing structural?","Michael J. Schall","Again, we think mostly it's seasonal, but again, it was bigger than is normally part of that seasonal adjustment. So we're concerned that some part of it is structural and we're concerned that some part of the entertainment industry goes to another state or another area. We just don't know.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with BMO Capital Markets.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Apologize if I don't quite understand this, but is it accurate to say that a part of your portfolio qualifies for Prop. 8 and part qualifies for Prop. 13?","Michael J. Schall","No, it's not accurate. I mean, they're both California propositions affecting property taxes. And what happens is everyone is subject to Prop. 13, which locks in...","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","That much I know.","Michael J. Schall","Okay. And then so what happens is, you will create a line for property tax that starts with 1% of assessed value plus a couple of add-ons and gross of 2%. If the value of the property goes down in value, you will get a onetime only adjustment under Prop. 8, give you some relief in property taxes. And when that recovers, which is what's happening now, you'll go back to the Prop. 13 trend line.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I got you. I just wanted to make sure I understood those nuances. When you talked about you're being 10% above the prior peak rent, which I think you said was the third quarter of '08, is that really -- is that an apples-to-apples type of comparison? Or is there more to it than that? Is there like a change in the portfolio function that's creating that 10% increase over the prior peak?","Michael J. Schall","No, really not. That's what we're trying to do, is give you some idea of where we've come from and so we're doing that on essentially the same property-type of basis. So yes, there's quite a bit variation within that, yes, because certain areas are up more than others. But no, it's intended to be same property.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And then my last question is on the cap rates that you were quoting. Do you factor in the Prop. 13 issue and change of control issue when you come up with those numbers or is that sort of before that?","Michael J. Schall","Always. The buyer always considers Prop. 13. If this is going back to a merger context, then you have the Avalon and Bay situation where they merged into Bay to avoid the Prop. 13 adjustments on the Bay portfolio.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","So it really leads to the bigger question for you and that is do you have an estimate of what Prop. 13 does to your net asset value?","Michael T. Dance","We have it on an annual basis [indiscernible]. You can apply whatever cap rate you want to it, but it's roughly $30 million.","Michael J. Schall","And Rich, just so you know, for our internal NAV calculation, we make the adjustment.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And what is that internal NAV analysis?","Michael J. Schall","That is something that we aren't sharing.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Salinsky with RBC Capital Markets.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","First question, I think, Mike, in your prepared comments, I think you mentioned 3 wholly owned dispositions. What's the size we're kind of talking there? And as you wrap up Fund II, actively in marketing, you're getting a sense of price, what's the IRR you expect on Fund II at this point?","Michael T. Dance","On the dispositions, it's roughly $50 million to $55 million. The IRR really on the dispositions for Fund II ranges from 10% to 15%, that's levered.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Do you have the unlevered IRR, per chance?","Michael T. Dance","I do not. We can look it off and get back to you on it.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I appreciate that. Second of all, just given the move we've seen in interest rates over the last 90 days, are you seeing more opportunities in the preferred equity front? I know that had been kind of reserved for the last couple of quarters as rates were very low.","Michael J. Schall","Mike, I think it's too early to tell exactly what's going to happen. There's this -- whenever conditions change in the marketplace, there's this period of time where things just need to settle out. So I'm not sure that cap rates have settled out nor am I sure that other opportunities have necessarily presented themselves. We're continuing to look for preferred equity-type of transactions and I think we'll have some success. It's hard to tell whether that's attributable to the rate environment or just other things.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And finally, Mike, a bigger picture question for you. I mean, if you look at the supply numbers, they tend to be a bit more urban. One of your peers in terms of adding new development starts talked about focusing a little bit more on suburban markets. As you look across the portfolio today, given your track record for asset location, where do you see the better growth opportunities? I mean, urban is typically outperformed, but it's also facing a decent amount of supply pressure.","Michael J. Schall","I think I have 2 answers. One is long term and the other one is short term. And for the long term, I would pick the more urban locations. Again, you're having cities that are incentivizing the more urban locations relative to planned transit improvements and other infrastructure. And so there's a whole part of how the West Coast is developing, that it's going to, I think, urbanize or continue to urbanize the West Coast. Throughout of, an example, BART is now expanding into San Jose, and well, BART has gone as far south as on the east side as Fremont. And so, that represents really a major accomplishment and will intimately connect to the Caltrain, which goes back up to San Francisco. So trying to understand where the opportunities are going to be and where the best growth is. I think it's going to be urban. Having said that, in the short term, because of the phenomena that I was mentioning earlier where people are getting priced out of the best locations, you may see the secondary areas actually outperform the core areas and we're starting to see that, to some extent, with respect to the East Bay relative to San Francisco and other areas because again some people are getting priced out of the better markets and they're going to find other good, still good, apartment or homes in other locations that are not considered quite as attractive.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with ISI Group.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Mike, as you look out over the next kind of 10 years and you kind of assess the growth in your portfolio, how do you see that NOI growth compares to kind of what you've put up the last 15 years, which has been just shy of about 4.5% then. Do you think your portfolio grows slower, faster or kind of about the same?","Michael J. Schall","Wow, that's a great big picture question. I would say about the same. I think you had a period of hyper growth in the '90s and then you had a decade of fairly tough conditions from 2001 to '11, let's say. So I think if you were going to handicap it, it would be somewhere in that same result, which means that because you have affordability is probably the key consideration and other housing choices, those would be the 2 key considerations, I think that, that means that we expect personal income and household incomes to grow at about the same rate because you can't push it too far. And we expect also that housing scarcity or we're going to continue to essentially not produce enough housing in these markets pretty consistent with the last 15 years with the exception of that, that notable exception, of the 2006, 2008 period, where we were producing lots of housing.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And how have you -- I guess I'm trying to understand kind of your unlevered IRR hurdles when you're looking at new investments today. One, what is that figure? And two, how was that changed over the last maybe 60, 90, 120 days?","Michael J. Schall","Well, it's interesting because as a fund investor, we are pretty focused on IRR, and specifically levered IRR, so we're I think most of our acquisitions are in the 8% to 9% unlevered. And if we can find a value-add piece that will push us a little higher, all the better, which takes us to about somewhere in the 12% to 13% levered IRR range. On balance sheet, we really don't pay that much attention to IRRs because we're really trying to benchmark, improving the company on a per-share basis, so it's very tied to how we view the stock. So if I go back to Q2, we didn't issue stock and we used the JV because, A, we think we can generate a little bit higher levered return, but B, we just didn't want to issue the stock at that price. So we're really trying to look at whether we can -- how we add value on a per-share basis, we're using the stock we're using our co-investment partnerships.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And then I guess I'm just trying to tie this, so if class A assets are trading in the low 4s on presumably sort of Prop. 13 adjusted figure and you can maybe grow cash flow at 4.5% per annum, I guess I'm trying to figure out how you get to an 8% to 9% unlevered unless you assume that you exit that transaction at a 4% cap 10 years from now. Is that what you'd need to assume or...","Michael J. Schall","Exactly. I agree with you. But I think we haven't bought -- we're building those A properties in A locations. We can't buy them. I agree with you. We would struggle with buying A properties in A locations. Again, we try to find -- I think the average cap rate of what we bought over the last couple of years as somewhere, and I don't think cap rates have changed all that much, but it's somewhere in the plus or minus 4.75% range. And then the reversionary cap rate, we have not -- I mean, I understand from an IRR standpoint you have to use that. But again, if you're using your own stock, you're going to have the same reversionary issue whether or not you buy a building because it's going to ultimately affect the value of the company. So hopefully -- does that help? Does that answer the question? We haven't bought -- we don't buy at full cap. Deals can't make them work.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paula Poskon with Robert W. Baird.","Paula J. Poskon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I just have a local question. You mentioned the BART system earlier, Mike. Was there -- did your employees or your tenants have any significant disruption on the short-lived BART strike earlier in July, and what's the risk of significant disruption if they strike again?","Michael J. Schall","Good question, Paula. I can't -- I don't know. I don't have the sense that we were significantly affected by the BART strike here, primarily because Palo Alto is on the Peninsula and the Peninsula is not -- BART says it goes as far as south as SFO. So the significance is really on the other side of the bay for Fremont, going into downtown San Jose and connecting with the Caltrain that would make it possible to get to Palo Alto from Fremont. But at this point in time on, it's not possible. So I think that the impact was muted and as it relates to the Essex personnel. And I think as a general statement, given the congestion on the roads out here that as a general statement, the BART strike makes things a lot more difficult to get to places. I think as a broader statement, it has a big impact.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of David Harris with Imperial capital.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","I got a question about the size of your development program. If I'm doing the math right, it looks like you\u2019re the -- if I add your contribution to the development program and the redevelopment program, it looks like you're about 8% of total enterprise value and about 12% of equity. Is that sort of pushing the outer limits of where this program you feel comfortable about this size of this program relative to size of the company or do you think there's still room to -- for that number to go up?","Michael J. Schall","A couple of things. I think the risk associated with the redevelopment program is entirely different. So we do not look at that as being significantly -- we don't view it as being the same. So we've talked about development in the up to 10% of capital, our share, most of the development is in a co-investment type of vehicle. And -- but even with respect to development, once we're in the ground with a good contractor and a G-Max type of contract, I mean, our risk goes way down at that point in time. We have the capital risk, which is probably our principal risk that we're concerned about because again development is committing to a cap rate today but not having the certainty of your cost of capital locked down unless you want to pre-fund it, which is expensive. So if that's the key risk that we're focused on and the closer we get to delivery of existing deals and other things happening, the more willing we are to look at new transactions. So it's not just simply how much, it's really where are things, looking at the transactions individually and trying to make good risk-reward decisions as it relates to development.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So if I knock out the redevelopment, it may be 1 point less, sorry?","Michael J. Schall","Redevelopment, in my view, since it's so short term in nature in terms of most of the impacts, I just -- I don't view it as -- we can fund it easily off of our line. We only spend $30 million to $40 million a year in total in the redevelopment process. The returns are the highest as it relates to, again, as I said earlier, cash and cash returns on invested dollars is somewhere in the 8% to 10% range net-net. So we just don't see the risk associated with the redevelopment as being significant. And therefore, we're going to do as much as we can as long as the demand for upgraded units and better amenities and that type of thing are there.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","All right. Well, let's just take the redevelopment out of the equation. I mean, does your board talk to you about sort of having a limit of -- as to where they would feel comfortable about the size of the program, not in dollar terms, but relative to total enterprise value or equity value, whichever metric you want to look at?","Michael J. Schall","Yes. The board is comfortable with 10% as the enterprise value, which is again, that's their part of the decision.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And that's their max, is it?","Michael J. Schall","Yes, max.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Morgan Stanley.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So a couple of more questions on development. First, we're triangulating to a mid-5 current yield for your new 1 South Market project. Does that sound right? And what's the IRR you're underwriting for that project?","Michael J. Schall","Say that again?","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I said I guess we're triangulating to a current mid-5 yield for your new San Jose project, 1 South Market. Does that sound right? And what's the IRR you're underwriting for that project?","John D. Eudy","This is John Eudy. The 5.5% math is correct. The IRR is in the range of 9% unlevered; in the 12%, 13% levered.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. Can you also discuss development opportunities that you're seeing today in your core markets? [indiscernible] the challenge is on sourcing new deals at pencil, just kind of get a sense as to what you're seeing out there, how are you able to source this particular deal given the context of -- the challenge of these deals being more difficult to source and underwrite?","Michael J. Schall","It is more difficult, we've said that for the last for several quarters. And if you look at our current pipeline, all but one -- the 1 South Market deal were announced basically 1 year or more ago, in 2011, early '12. So you can see the amount of volume has gone down significantly. And the timing of it, we're in the somewhere between second and third base on deliveries. So we're not at the early -- at the late stage of jumping in. We're kind of at the late stage of completing the pipeline. And what we see in general is it's harder and harder to find deals that we like that make sense in pencil and we think the volume is going to go down over the next several quarters. I don't know if that answers your question, but timing-wise, we were early in, it's harder and harder to make deals at the current prices.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","One more. I think you guys mentioned earlier in the call that you noticed that certain developers are having trouble lining up financing for some of their deals. Wondering to what degree you'd be interested in stepping as a source of capital for these developers? And if so, what type of returns or type of structures would you seek?","Michael J. Schall","Haendel, we actually have considered that and we are looking at a couple of different programs. One is a preferred equity-type of program focused on development and that would be priced in the -- around 10% type of range. And we look at a couple of other options, including JVs and even JVs that involve a preferred equity piece. So we have a number of different approaches to it. But I think the point John was making is that even with those things, we're further along in the cycle and so we are cautious with respect to the development commitments. And I think that, that is going to be the way it is for the next couple of years.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","My question is actually a little bit more broad based. You've heard some of your peers make kind of very public comments about their views on the single-family for-rent business. I'm just kind of curious what you think about that business?","Michael J. Schall","Yes, we've made comments on that business as well. We looked at it pretty hard. We've actually -- and Mr. Eudy led this charge in the early '90s were we've got a portfolio of homes as part of RTC days. And we think it's difficult to execute in a REIT-type of format, but there's certainly money to be made as house prices go up fairly dramatically. So in our view, the real question is, the disciplined question of if there's opportunity to take a significant gain, will these entities take that gain or will they try to perpetuate something that might be more challenging to execute?","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","And your viewpoint on it being difficult to have it in a REIT format is based on what challenges you see in the business?","Michael J. Schall","The challenges are having assets scattered in lots of different places. And just the asset management challenges. It's really a CapEx and a maintenance and repair type of issue, I think, from our perspective.","Michael T. Dance","There's also complicated REIT laws about -- whether real estate laws is inventory or not and if you sell too many, the IRS may deem it as inventory or not, real estate held for investment.","Operator","Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the floor back over to you, all, for any closing comments or remarks you may have.","Michael J. Schall","Great. Thank you.

Thank you Mr. Schall, you may begin.","Michael Schall","Thank you. I would like to start by welcoming you to our First Quarter Earnings conference call and we appreciate you're spending sometime time with us today. Mike Dance and Erik Alexander will follow me with comments. John Eudy, John Burkart, and Angela Kleiman are also in attendant. I'll cover the following topics on the call: First, Q2 results and market conditions; second, rent control activities within the West Coast; and third, an update on the investment market.","On to the first topic, yesterday we were pleased to report quarter driven by robust job growth which is expected, produced demand exceeded overall housing supply, a reported 7.8% same property revenue growth represents the best quarterly result in the past 14 years. I thank the Essex team for their tremendous effort and for exceeding expectations once again.","Northern California continued its outperformance with the East Bay generating the best rent growth. Southern California continues its expected steady improvement in revenue growth led by LA and Orange County which both reported same stores revenue in excess of 6%. With the few exceptions, rents at the B quality properties and locations are growing faster than As due primarily to two factors. First, affordability has a greater impact on the rental decision given that rents have grown faster than income, and second virtually all the supply from apartment development is in A product category, changing the supply demand dynamic within that segment.","We updated our economic forecast on Page S-16 of the supplement, increasing our 2015 job growth expectations for coastal California and Washington to 2.8%, up 12% from last quarter. As before our total 2015 housing supply both rentals and for sale are estimated at 0.8% of total housing stock supporting our believe that the West Coast housing demand is outpacing supply more than 2 to 1.","Market occupancy remains high and the largest part of the millennial generation those between 20 and 24 years of age are about to enter their prime rental years supporting our belief to these conditions will not change materially in the next several years. Looking forward for the nation Axiometrics estimate that approximately 1.4 million households per year will be formed between now and 2018 while constructions start are only about 1.1 million to 1.2 million. This strong outlooks support the Axiometrics revenue growth estimates for selected West Coast market ranging from approximately 20% to 30% over the next five years.","We continue to make progress on the Phase III merger integration planning process outlined in our NAREIT presentation and available on our Web site under the presentation section of the Investor tab. Most of the Phase III impact will be realized after 2016, between now and the end of 2016 we should benefit from the restart of the BRE redevelopment program which should add around 50 basis points of growth to the BRE portfolio in 2016. The resource management initiatives should reduce cost on the BRE portfolio by about $100 per unit per year when fully implemented and we should eliminate the 60 basis points occupancy differential that was embedded in our Q2 results.","Now on to my second topic which is rent control on the West Coast, I commented last quarter the rent control is in ongoing discussion in several West Coast cities. We continue to see plenty of media coverage concerning the pace of rent growth and its relationship to income. The city of Richmond California recently decided to pursue a rent control ordinance although details remain in draft form. The ordinance appears to cover property constructed before 1995 a date mandate by state law and creates a CPI based formula for capping renewal rents.","Recall that California law generally mandates statewide D control [ph] upon move outs allowing rents to go to market when residents move out, which is very important to property values and the flow investment capital into rent controlled areas. Essex owns one property in Richmond and it does not appear to be subject to the ordinance given that it was completed after the 1995 date. We'll continue to monitor rent control discussion throughout outer portfolio.","And then on to third topic, investment markets. During the second quarter a combination of great NOI growth and a pullback in stock price caused our accretion hurdles for acquisitions to be difficult to achieve. But that in combination with fewer transactions makes the acquisition environment more challenging. Our acquisition preference is for undermanaged properties throughout our markets, transit-oriented properties and CBD Los Angeles given its relatively attractive price point that has been impacted by significant apartment deliveries. In CBD LA we believe that the short-term supply issues and relatively affordable rents for an urban market will draw residents from other parts of the metro area and meaningfully contribute to the transition of CBD LA to a 24 hour city. We thus believe that CBD LA is a great long-term investment.","The flip side of a more challenging acquisition market is a better market for property sales. Our plan is to continue to slowly call the portfolio. Headwinds to more aggressive selling of the portfolio include the impact of Prop 13 in California and the often higher rental growth rates in the non-urban parts of our portfolio.","Cap rates remain lower throughout our markets. Using the Essex cap rate methodology, our best estimate is that the highest quality property at locations create around a 4% cap while B quality properties in locations create around a 4.5% cap rate. Lesser quality properties create a higher cap rates in periodically and aggressively under written or trophy property will trade in the high 3% cap rate range. We are quite sure that aggressive assumptions on buyer pro formas often indicate that cap rates are 50 basis points or more above the cap rate that we determined using the Essex cap rate methodology especially on high rise apartment properties. ","Before passing the baton to Erik Alexander I would like acknowledge as previously announced that this is Mike Dance's last earnings conference call, so take your best shot in the Q&A. I thank Mike and Angela Kleiman for creating a smooth CFO transition process and again I greatly appreciate Mike's many contributions to the company's success. ","This concludes my comments thank you for joining the call. I will now turn the call over to Erik","Erik Alexander","Thank you Mike. I am grateful to the operations team that has remained focused on executing our plan and delivering the great results that we are reporting today. The second quarter was very strong and we continue to have positive outlook for all our markets. Higher than expected job growth continues to be the primary catalyst for rising rents and strong occupancies throughout our portfolio. The strong demand conditions that we expected pushed economic rents higher and generated a portfolio wide loss relief [ph] of 8% in July. We believe this is the peak season but expect a seasonal decline in rents during the fourth quarter to be of similar profile in 2014 which was less pronounced than prior years. Once again the Bay area led the way for Essex with San Jose and the East Bay posting the largest revenue gain. Seattle continued its healthy growth despite several new projects opening. We are monitoring CBD supply closely and believe the 2016 will have comparable levels to 2015. ","We also continue to see good growth in Los Angeles and Orange County and expect San Diego to improve in the third quarter with stronger scheduled rent growth. Gains from renewal activity increased 6.7% portfolio wide and we\u2019ll continue to support strong revenue results in the coming quarter. Renewal rates for the third quarter will be above 6% due to the portfolio. We are also pleased to see that year-to-date turnover has not increased over last year and was 55% during the second quarter compared to 57% a year ago and only 50% on a year-to-date basis for the same-store portfolio. As of yesterday the physical occupancy for the same-store portfolio was 96.4% with a 30 day availability of just over 5%. So while we are not giving guidance for the next year we believe the aforementioned condition, healthy job growth and static supply forecast for 2016 will help us deliver strong results for several more innings.","Now I will share some highlights for each region beginning with Southern California. Orange County and Los Angeles continue to be strong performers this quarter with job growth remaining above 2.5% in both counties. The composition of jobs in Los Angeles is improving with nearly half the job growth in June coming from professional and business service and education and health service sectors. San Diego's were weaker than the first quarter but were hindered by some planned renovation activity that is now completed and has been re-leased. Since we continue to see strong job growth in this market I believe we will see revenue growth return to levels above 5% during the third quarter. ","Office leasing for the region was positive in all counties with the greatest absorption realized in Los Angeles, where 1 million square feet was absorbed during the quarter. ","We remain excited about the renaissance of Downtown Los Angeles and are seeing strong leasing activity in the sub market. Our 8th&Hope project has added more than 27 units per month through July and will stabilize next month. We have also leased 35 units since closing Avant in the middle of June and are 98% leased. Los Angeles is one of the markets that is expected to have an increase in supply next year but it remains very low at 0.6% of total housing stock.","Turning to Northern California, the job growth engine continues to fuel great results in the Bay Area, not only did San Jose post a 5.5% gain in June, the 12 month trailing growth rate is also above 5% and more than twice the national average. The information in professional business service sector represented the bulk of the gain by accounting for more than half of the overall growth.","Oakland has not enjoying the same job growth as San Francisco and San Jose but certainly has more than enough when combined with limited new supply and the overall demand from these adjacent MSAs to make this submarket a top performer of the portfolio with 12% year-over-year revenue growth. Office leasing remain strong in the region as over 1 million square feet were absorbed during the quarter. Of note Apple leased two buildings near San Jose airport totaling 600,000 square feet and signed their first lease in San Francisco.","Palo Alto networks just signed and pre lease for 750,000 square feet in Santa Clara. As expected economic rent levels continue to be strong and are up 13% from the beginning of the year and we expect them to remain at similar levels during the third quarter.","Strong occupancies make these double digit growth numbers possible. Currently, the same store portfolio stands at 97% occupied with less than 5% availability. We\u2019re seeing the same strong demand for our new communities as well, we stabilized Park 20 and Emmy ahead of schedule during the quarter and one south market in downtown San Jose is 50% leased and has an averaged 40 leases per month since opening in April. With performances like that, very strong job growth and new unit supply we expect this trend to continue in the Bay Area.","Finally in Seattle, the employment growth in this region continues to be strong as well and remains above 3.5%. Trade, transportation and utilities along with professional business services account for nearly half of the job formation. And June represents the 9th consecutive month that construction has eclipsed 10% growth. With 7 million square feet of office and dozens of residential projects under construction, it is easy to see why this job sector is so strong.","Additionally, 40% of that space under construction has been preleased including two more buildings leased by Amazon totaling 810,000 square feet. As expected office leasing overall improved during the quarter with over 800,000 square feet absorbed. Demand continues to outpace supply which has led to strong revenue growth. Properties at the CBD have weathered the concentration of deliveries reasonably well so far but the suburbs in the south and north end continue to deliver the best results for us and we do not expect that to change in the coming quarters.","As expected, economic rent growth continues to accelerate since last quarter and was 13% higher on a year-to-date basis. We expect continued strength in the north and south end as well as B properties on the east side. Given our strong occupancy position and low exposure in the fourth quarter, we continue to expect strong revenue growth in the next year. Currently, the physical occupancy in the Seattle portfolio is 96.7% and an availability at 5%. We\u2019re very pleased with these results through the first half of the year and I think our momentum should lead to equally impressive second half.","Thank you. And I will now turn the call over to the honorable, Mike Dance.","Mike Dance","Thanks Eric. Today I will provide comments on the second quarter results and the increase to our \u201915 guidance. Operating results are outperforming our expectations. The second quarter results continued to build on the strong first quarter driven by greater than expected demand fueled by the high quality jobs created in our markets.","Accordingly, we are confident in raising guidance for the second time this year with a midpoint of our full year \u201915 same property revenue forecast to 7.9%. The midpoint of our estimated expense growth has been reduced by 50 basis points primarily due to lower than expected utility cost from reduced water use and accordingly we have increased our expectations for \u201915 net operating income growth to 10.5%. We are now forecasting same property revenue growth to be 60 basis points above the strong growth reported in \u201914 demonstrating the benefits of investing in supplies constrained trade markets.","Not surprisingly, our joint venture portfolio also contributed to our strong second quarter. Most of the stabilized operating apartment communities owned as co-investments are commutable to the urban job node and represent a value proposition compared to the rents in the urban location. The stabilized co-investment portfolio with comparable year-over-year results now total over 7,300 apartment homes and in the second quarter these communities grew revenues by 7.9% and net operating income by 11.4%.","Through the second quarter, we have received over two thirds of the supplemental taxes with new tax assessment of values pertaining to the legacy BRE portfolio. To-date the net impact of the supplemental property tax statements received have been slightly favorable to our conservative estimate. The estimated property taxes pertaining to the 15 same property portfolio is expected to be 27.2 million for the third and the fourth quarters.","The savings on property taxes are offset by an increase to our property management fees. We recently completed an analysis of our corporate G&A cost that concluded we should be allocating just over 2% of gross revenues as the cost of property management activities for the corporate department that support property operation. The new cost allocation is still 90 basis points less than the 3% property management fees commonly used by analyst and multifamily peers. The increase in property management fee allocation decreased general and administrative expense and accordingly we have reduced the \u201915 forecast for G&A expense by $2 million on S-14 in our supplement.","To summarize, this accounting allocation is merely a reclassification of expense that increases property operating expense and decreases general administrative expense by the same amount and has no impact to our net income or to our reported of core FFO. With the full year we're raising the midpoint of our core FFO per share guidance by $0.16 to $9.64 or a 1.7% increase over our prior projection. The revised midpoint in '15 guidance is a 13% growth in core FFO compare to 14.","Our year-over-year results coupled with the lease up of the development pipeline continued to strengthen our credit metrics contributing to the change in S&Ps credit outlook in Essex from BBB stable to positive. The debt-to-EBITDA ratio at June 30 was 6.3 times and total debt to our market capitalization was just over 27%.","In closing my last quarterly conference call, I do want to personally thank Keith Guericke, Mike Schall and the entire Essex Board for giving me the opportunity to serve as the Essex's Chief Financial Officer for the last 10 years. I have been truly blessed to have worked for such a supportive board and two chief executive officers that have great respect for. It has been a pleasure to be part of a management team and organization that cares about the qualities of homes we provide for our residents, the culture we provide for our associates and resulting financial returns that have benefited our shareholders.","Our success has truly been a team effort and I am proud to have been a small contributor to the E-Team. Given the many talents of Angela Kleiman and strength of her supporting cast and finance, accounting, co-investments, research, investor relations and economic research, I am confident that the transition of my responsibilities on September 30th of this year will be seamless.","And finally before the turn the call to the operator for questions, I want to stop the rumors that yesterday's earlier than expected press release was caused by my rushing to the exit.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And question-and-answer session will begin at this time. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question of the day from Nick Joseph with Citi. Please go ahead.","Nick Joseph","Congratulations Mike and appreciate the colors on the rent control initiatives, could you give us an update on a talk on changes to Prop 13?","Michael Schall","Not a whole lot, Nick, has happened on Prop 13, and this is Mike Schall speaking. Although it's always out there and there are a number of organizations, labor units, et cetera that have almost continually over the last 40 years mounted an attack to Prop 13. So I think it's still early we will wait unit we're closer to the election to see exactly what's going to happen, but there is no update as this point.","Nick Joseph","Thanks and then you've talked about rents growing faster than income, so how was the rent-to-income ratio changed over the last few years for the qualified renters?","Michael Schall","The fortunate thing is we've been adding some very high income renters to the [indiscernible], so not only do we have great job growth, but we have jobs that are worked for a lot of these tech companies that are also high paying jobs and therefore if you look at the personal income growth for per capita, we're in some areas that have some pretty stellar numbers. For example, Seattle is at 5.8% projected for 2015 again, this is personal income growth per capita. San Jose is 6.2% et cetera. So I think in any event holding rent at medium income constant, you still will generate a pretty significant rent growth outcome there. So we are very fortunate from that perspective. Rent median incomes are below generally long-term historical averages in Southern California and about 10% above the long-term historical average in San Francisco and Oakland and little bit above in San Jose. So I'd say in summary, we are starting to push a little harder in Northern California on that metric, but still have lots of room to run in Southern California and Seattle.","Operator","Next is Jeff Spector with Bank of America.","Jeff Spector","On behalf of Jana and myself congratulations Mike, on to strategy going forward, just again listening to the call and the results, not only this quarter but of course over the last year beating even your own expectations, stabilizing properties better, employment stronger again from a strategy standpoint is there anything else, any other lever you guys can pull at this point, anything new you could bring to the company or get more aggressive on to do, now that it seems like you're moving on to the next phase with BRE?","Michael Schall","Jeff, its Mike Schall speaking again. We have a lot of work to do here both with respect to the BRE, the Phase III transformational process. John Eudy is here with me and we're looking at a number of development deals. We would love to find more development especially in Southern California. We are looking at every deal that comes to market, that meets our criteria and we will continue to do so. Having said that, when you get back to the reality, the stock is done, okay but it's pulled back a bit while earnings are surging and when you get to that point that on a leverage adjusted basis the returns on the stock going forward look better than the returns on the real estate going forward it causes you to pause. And so we are in that period of time.","Now if the stock has some momentum here going forward, maybe that relationship changes. But we are going to continue to be prudent and we feel like we have an enormous amount of work to do as it relates to again the transformational activities, that we think that those will be material past 2016, it's going to take a lot of work to get there. So no means are we sitting on our laurels and we have a lot of work to do.","Operator","We will now go to Jordan Saddler with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Jordan Saddler","You guys mentioned a few items on the call about CBD LA being an attractive long-term investment. I guess, what's your appetite to add more to the sub market and do you think as new supply comes to market next year that there might be more opportunities?","Michael Schall","Hi, it's Mike Schall again. I think we do like CBD LA as we all acknowledged and I think it's one of the areas that when we look at price points and we look at demographic issues in the preference of the millennials for more urban settings and the transition together, the broader transitions that are happened in CBD LA. It will continue to be one of our key focuses going forward. In our world everything is about the basic strategy which is finding properties that are located near jobs in places where people want to live. And we find that up and down the West Coast in a variety of places. And so we will stick to our knitting as it relates to that. And CBD LA fits into that, but it's not exclusively CBD LA we're going to be -- we're going to react to the deals that we see and the opportunities that we have relative to other great areas to try to make prudent decisions as we've done in the past.","Jordan Saddler","Thanks for the color there. And then just sticking with sort of Southern California. How has Orange County performed relative to your guys expectations this year and what's your outlook for the remainder of the year given some of the deceleration that occurred in the second quarter?","Erik Alexander","Hi this is Erik. We're looking for Orange County to be strong in the second half of the year, again supported by good job growth and we've had a mixed performance there in Orange County with respect to As and Bs. So we are getting contributions from [indiscernible] the Skylines of the world and we think that we're going to see some better performance with some of the -- kind of the middle tier properties in the second half.","Jordan Saddler","So would you say that it's tracking in line or what are your expectations for the year?","Erik Alexander","Yes, I think at the beginning of the year we had a close to the top performer with expectations that could possibly do better and I still think that that's possible in Orange County.","Jordan Saddler","Great, thank you.","Operator","Next is Ian Weissman with Credit Suisse.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi guys this is Chris for Ian. Guidance seems to imply a little over 3% expense growth in the back half of the year. Mike is this -- it sounds like some of that comes from reallocation of expenses from G&A to property management, is the rest coming from like a normalization of property taxes and utilities or is there something else going on there?","Michael Schall","Third quarter is typically our highest expense month. We have most of our turnover and obviously the Southern California\u2019s hotter weather, people are using air conditioning more so I think just a high expense month historically or high expense quarter and we expect that to continue this quarter.","Unidentified Analyst","Got you, okay. And so we've seen NOI margins there approaching 70% and most will certainly go above there later this year in 2015 given your revenue and expense trajectories. But like on a DCS evaluation it seems like you'd almost have to keep it at 70% to get a meaningful upside on the stock. I just wanted to get your thoughts on where you think like a long-term NOI margin ends up, after things start to normalize?","Michael Schall","It's Mike Schall. It's ranged in that mid to high 60s to 70 historically, but I agree with you the math is math and it can push higher than 70%. We think that as we look at the world we are not a margin driven company, we are looking for rent growth, looking for supply demand imbalances and areas that we can operate properties efficiently on the expense side. And whatever happens to the margin happens to the margin.","So it\u2019s not the primary metric that we use. I understand how the math works and what you\u2019re refine to, but from our perspective if we do our jobs we\u2019re going to find areas where rents grow and expenses grow at smaller rates and it\u2019s going to push margin up.","Unidentified Analyst","And then the last question. How much if any of the sequential slowdown in Southern California had to do with the change in the same store pool?","Erik Alexander","I don\u2019t think much, I think the part of it was influenced by that what we talked about in San Diego, which we expect to normalize. And then we\u2019re looking for better performance from a couple of assets again Los Angeles. And I think Orange County will stay on the same strong trajectory and Ventura has been stable.","Operator","Next is Rob Stevenson with Janney.","Rob Stevenson","Michael you said before on one of the questions that you guys were hunting around for land in Southern California. I mean what\u2019s been your ability to acquire across all of your markets these days and backfill the pipeline because it doesn\u2019t look like -- I think it was like $38 million of land left that\u2019s not been started on. Is that correct?","Michael Schall","I don\u2019t know the exact number. We have several land parcels that we\u2019ve been entitling for the last couple of years, one in San Diego, one in Hollywood and one in Santa Clara. But we\u2019re always active out in the markets. And John Eudy is here and I know John and his team have worked hard to look at the transactions in Southern California which they have not been as attractive up to this point because of the rent growth differential in Northern California versus Southern California, but are becoming more attractive. John you want to comment on anything you see out there in the land market, I know we have trouble hitting our target in general. But any color on that?","John Eudy","As Mike said, we\u2019ve got a couple of more there. We have -- that will be most likely showing up on the reporting next quarter or two, but not many. Right now land prices have been bid up, construction cost are up as we know, exactions are tough [ph] to do a development deal. We love it when we get in the mid six cap range and above, but we have to have that spread between acquisition caps and development to take the risk and we see stuff below 5.5 to 6 on current economics. We\u2019re not going to pursue it and we\u2019re running into a lot of opportunities that are well below our threshold, that\u2019s the bottom line we\u2019re culling a lot and we\u2019re not seeing enough transactions worth taking the risk.","Rob Stevenson","Does that mean that in order to get to those numbers that you need to get to that it\u2019s highly likely that it\u2019s going to need to be done with a JV partners in order to access lower cost of capital and also get to promote in order to get you up into the range that\u2019s acceptable?","Michael Schall","I would say no, it doesn\u2019t have that much to do with capital per se. It has to do with remaining disciplined, since Keith\u2019s favorite thing that he taught us along the way, remaining disciplined, waiting for the opportunities that make sense for us. Again we are trying to -- since we use capital, a great deal of capital we\u2019re trying to make sure that on a risk and leverage adjusted basis the investments that we make are going to outperform the stock. And what the stock is going to do pretty well here given our growth trajectory.","So we\u2019re not going to push it just to make some deals work, we\u2019re going to remain disciplined and try to stick to the strategy. And we\u2019ll just wait for a better day. I think we\u2019re going to have great results for the next couple of years just based on what we already have locked in. So, there is nothing within us that motivates us to bunch of stuff that keeps us even busier and perhaps distracts us from all the other things that we need to do.","Rob Stevenson","And then how much condo conversion and ground up development are you seeing these days in your market?","Michael Schall","Well, condo conversion and actually John Burkart is here as well. But I can probably summarize what he would tell you, this is Mike Schall again. Not that much and mostly because the relationship between apartment values and condo values is pretty much non-existent. And we need -- actually all condo developers need somewhere around 30% to 40% premium to apartment values, otherwise why would you do a condo, its lot less risky to do -- to completing an apartment. And so the preference would be for apartments. And there is a commerce department statistic that we recently saw where only 5.5% of the multifamily construction starts are condos which is the lowest since the 1970s.","So I think that pretty much tells you what\u2019s going on out there, that condo values have not recovered to the point that condo conversions make a great deal of sense. And actually, I would caveat that with -- in the City of San Francisco there is starting to be some significant premium, but not 25% to 40% that we really need.","Operator","We'll now to go to [indiscernible] Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","The question we had was just again, in new markets just given how quickly rents are rising and also some initial public backlash you're reading in the papers about how quickly the rents are rising, are you starting to see municipalities talking about making it easier or cheaper to build in any of those markets or it's just on the homebuilding side and the apartment side, I think just new supply is very limited and there is a so much demand, both side of the equation just keep going up?","Michael Schall","Well, this is what we love about the West Coast markets because, no exactly the opposite. They believe that they can get more out at the developer not less because things just so good and I'll use as an example that there is a pretty strong group -- couple of groups in San Francisco that are suggesting that the below market rate unit should go from 20% to 30% because everything is going so well. So I mean you have a number of headwinds and this is why John Eudy's comments are so apropos. You've got construction costs that are increasing somewhere in that 10% range which that's probably as good as NOI growth is going to get, so your this idea of going from 5.5 cap rate today to 6.5 cap rate is little bit in peril given that scenario.","You've got cities that recognizes that they have housing shortages and especially with respect to the more affordable elements of housing and therefore they're trying to essentially give the developers to bear a greater part of that obligation and plus a number of other headwinds which are just long entitlement process NIMBY [ph], et cetera. This is why we love owning property on the West Coast because it's so difficult to build here. And so are we okay with not doing a lot of development, yes, we're because if we can't, guess what, no one else can either and if no one can develop significant amounts of property, then our existing $20 billion portfolio is going to do pretty well. So that is our dynamic and candidly we're going enjoy while it\u2019s here.","Operator","Next is Tom Lesnick with Capital One Securities.","Tom Lesnick","I just wanted to address H1B Visas for a second, it\u2019s becoming increasingly political top as we head into this election season and particularly for tech companies there has been report of a few major players laying off domestic workers in favor of asking for more H1B Visas, I am just curious on the West Coast in particular, what is your exposure as a person of your renter base and how do you guys view that risk politically?","Erik Alexander","Hi, this is Erik. I don't have the account of that in front of me, it is -- and you're correct, it is a segment of the population primarily in Seattle and the Bay area. And politically and I don\u2019t know, but it's hard to judge the risk. But clearly we benefit from having those renters there and we'd be in favor of keeping them. Mike you have something to add?","Michael Schall","Yes actually I have a comment, I think that those are targeted towards highly skilled workers obviously and the skills that you cannot find here in the United States, generally speaking and therefore the positions within the tech community are -- it's hard to find qualified workers to take the positions that are available in the tech market, mainly in Seattle and Northern California. And I don't see even if they increase the H1B Visas, it being a threat to the domestic workforce because I think that you have a situation where there is enough demand out there, enough open positions out there that employers are having a hard time filling their positions again specially in Northern California and Seattle.","And so I don't see the H1B issue being a big problem at all and in fact is probably beneficial. I think that one of your concerns as we look at cost going forward is actually because of the cost increases and difficulty in finding employees, I think that there is some wage pressure that we see throughout our market and I don\u2019t see that abating in the near future. I know that a lot of people that we're looking at or coming from out of state and so again I think that the markets very vibrant here, the employment market, and therefore having good quality people coming in irrespective of source is not going to be a problem.","Tom Lesnick","Thanks for that color and then my second question, I understand that there are several corporate housing agencies that work with the big tech companies down in the Valley and that a percentage of your units are probably working with these agencies, what is the percentage across your entire portfolio and what is the rent sensitivity on those units relative to traditional direct leases?","Erik Alexander","This is Erik. So we don\u2019t track the agencies separately, we do track the corporate leases as a sub category. So I will tell you that which is it is less than 3% across the portfolio and it is highest in the Bay area where it\u2019s just over 4% and in Southern California it\u2019s just under 2%. Our sensitivity is really related to concentration in individual properties and the thing that we pay most attention to is the lease expiration profile. So the thing that we don\u2019t want to do is load up in expirations in any one month. And so we will look at these on case-by-case basis and they reviewed with the revenue management team and they -- a more senior level person in operations to make sure that we get the composition correct. Because there are times when the sort of tenants can really benefit us, like in a lease up for example and they fit in nicely and add to the cash flow. And there are other times where we need to be careful about the timing and when they add.","Tom Lesnick","Alright, thanks. Appreciate that color. Congrats again Mike.","Operator","We will now go to Dan Oppenheim with Zelman and Associates.","Dan Oppenheim","Thanks very much. A quick question here on Nor Cal in terms of the efforts to sort of prevents on the rent control by limiting the renewals to 10%. Are you seeing that keeping turnover down so far in Nor Cal or how are you seeing that in terms of what's happening in turnover with those renewals limits at 10%?","Erik Alexander","Yes, this is Erik again. So it does absolutely help to keep the turnover down. So we talked about 55% turnover overall in the portfolio for the quarter. It was 51% in Northern California for example where we have the most renewing leases exposed to this 10% cap. And so last year it was over 54%. So again the turnover is coming down in that area. And we commented before that [indiscernible] nor I are getting thank you notes from anybody on this stuff. But what happens is they go out into the market and look at some of the competitors and they come back and tell our staff well I had to pay attention to this and this, several hundred dollars, few hundred dollar higher. So it's absolutely having an impact on turnover.","Dan Oppenheim","Great, thank you.","Operator","And Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities is next.","Rich Anderson","Thanks. Good morning to everybody. Mike last time Mike Schall last time you said you get to 600 million of acquisition by September not that it is a long way to go from there but is that kind of line of thinking off the table now?","Michael Schall","No I don\u2019t think so Rich, I think we're at 571.","Rich Anderson","No I know that, I know that.","Michael Schall","471.","Rich Anderson","471.","Michael Schall","471 with a pipeline of about a 100 million.","Rich Anderson","Okay.","Michael Schall","It should take us to 571 that includes the three joint venture buyouts that we did. So I think we are on pace but again we are looking at a few things and it's pretty tough out there, it's interesting that we have -- we had about what about a 50 basis point move in interest rates from when we did our last bond deal at around 3.5 we would probably be somewhere around 4% now and certainly cap rates have not changed over that period of time.","Rich Anderson","Right. I was thinking line of thinking not so much for your absolute numbers like going forward basis maybe not thinking so much about guiding to a number after this is done?","Michael Schall","Rich again in our case it's such a function of -- again the stock that we're going to issue and how we're going to complete the match funding process, again whether the investments, whether we can find investments that are going to generate a total return that's better than the stock. So that equation changes literally daily and if the stock does well we're going to be more active and if the stock does poorly we're going to be less active and\/or we would be more interested in selling.","Rich Anderson","Okay. I have heard from some folks that people are actually now living in rented tents in backyard in Northern California with access bathrooms from private individuals that own homes. Have you heard this? And before you answer that, putting the rent control issues aside, I mean do you guys have any concern about karma and alienating people at this point that cannot own a home or rent an apartment are actually taking very substantial steps just to put a roof or a piece of canvas over their head, just wondering if you could talk about the long-term ramifications of milking every last penny out of the market?","Michael Schall","Wow, somehow implied in that comment is that we are milking every last penny out of the market, which I would tend to disagree with, I mean as Erik just said we have cap on our renewal rents, we are trying to act as the responsible party and I am not sure I can comment on my karma. But having said all that.","Rich Anderson","Its Friday I am trying to keep it going here.","Michael Schall","I hear you. I've heard that people are actually living in freight containers for example, that was the most recent one. San Francisco is trying to entitle garages, unentitled units and second rooms. There is a variety of things that are happening. People are doubling up. And I think probably more telling is that people are essentially moving a little bit farther away from the core areas in search more affordable housing.","And I think that is the way that the rental market works, that the people in San Francisco when rents go up significantly and the same is true in Manhattan and a variety of other places. When rents go up significantly, some people are priced out and they could go to Oakland and then the people -- Oakland rents go up and then the people that are in Oakland get pushed up to San Riamone or Livermore. And this radiates through the entire rental market until everything within let\u2019s say the Bay Area in this case is completely full, in which case I think at that point it\u2019s a real problem.","I think at this point there is still pretty significant variations in price as you go further out from the primary rental market and the main job notes. And therefore I think it\u2019s still -- there is still opportunity within the marketplace. And again I think that\u2019s why we see the Bs are outperforming the As for example.","Rich Anderson","Thanks for humoring my question. And then last question is now that you\u2019ve finally upgraded the CFO position, do you think we\u2019ll see upgrade in G&A?","Michael Schall","Well, I guess I need to negotiate with Angela before answering the question.","Rich Anderson","I am sorry, had to do it. Good luck Mike. Thanks.","Operator","We\u2019ll now go to Greg Van Winkle with Morgan Stanley.","Greg Van Winkle","Wanted to get your thoughts on your Seattle and Bellevue exposures, you\u2019ve given the Bellevue supply risk. Would you guys look at trimming some assets in that submarket maybe?","Michael Schall","No, I don\u2019t think so. I mean Bellevue I think is another area that is undergone incredible transformation over the last several years and only continues to get better. I think you have high paying jobs and a vibrant economy in Seattle. And so I think we like our Bellevue exposure. I don\u2019t view our exposure as being excessive in any part of the Seattle Metro area. We\u2019re just somewhere in the 20% range downtown, CBD maybe that could get a little bit bigger. Although in the short-term we have some headwinds there from new supply. And we\u2019re in the better submarkets on the east side. And actually the north and south ends of Seattle are the ones that are generating the best growth which would probably be the areas that we ultimately would want to sell. So, I think we\u2019re happy in Bellevue and Redmond and Issaquah, and some of those core east side market. And we\u2019re enjoying some of the incredible rent growth we\u2019re getting in Renton and Everett so we\u2019re happy with where we are.","Greg Van Winkle","That\u2019s some good color. And then you guys issued above $90 million of equity during the quarter, did you do any dispositions. Should we read into that that you view equity as most important source of capital over dispositions today?","Mike Dance","As Mike pointed out earlier, we were match funding some compelling transactions in Southern California, that doesn\u2019t work right now. So, we would look to, as he mentioned in his comments, calling some of the portfolio to fund the development needs for the rest of the year to the extent that there is an acquisition that works then we would look to issue equity again.","Operator","We\u2019ll now go to Drew Babin with Robert Baird.","Drew Babin","Given your current outlook for property taxes and just visibility on the progress made with the CBE portfolio so far. Would it be outside the realm of reason to assume that same property expense growth might actually be lower in \u201916 versus \u201915?","Mike Dance","We pretty much have 2% this is Mike Dance. We have 2% expectation for the property tax increases. We are seeing some wage pressure right now with the strong economy. And so I think 3% is our expectation for \u201916 in terms of operating expense growth.","Drew Babin","But not guidance?","Mike Dance","Not.","Drew Babin","And lastly just did you look at acquisition opportunities, and what\u2019s the likelihood that the next acquisition could come from your co-investment portfolio? And what are sort of the advantages of doing it that way with regard to pricing?","Michael Schall","I think that that was an opportunity that was presented in the marketplace really framed earlier this year by the 10 year treasury been at 1.8% and the stock trading somewhere around 235 to 240 which we thought was a great time to match fund off a couple of the buyouts of our JV partners. Those dynamics have changed very considerably in a quarter and half, and therefore I don\u2019t see that happening any time in the foreseeable future.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our last question today from Conor Wagner with Green Street Advisors.","Conor Wagner","First question on development in some your markets, seen a tax purpose on development in Seattle in addition to requirement for affordable housing as well as a potential tax on residential development in San Francisco, can I get your thoughts on that and how it impacts you look at those markets in your future development?","Erik Alexander","By tax on development you're talking about in lieu for affordable?","Conor Wagner","Yes, in Seattle, I guess they're discussing having affordable acquirement on future buildings as well as linkage fee and then I've also seen in San Francisco discussion of that's the residential development that's currently on other commercial types of development?","Erik Alexander","Yes, that' is correct and there is also a few of those issues happening in California as well. It's another exaction that makes it tougher to make a number's work, that was what we were referring to earlier that dilutes the spread that we're looking between acquisitions cap rates and development. So it's out there with the pressure that's on, on the affordability side relevant to Mike\u2019s earlier comment. That's what, is the gatekeeper to keep things from being overbuilt because that puts more impediments to developing.","Conor Wagner","Then follow-up, I'd like to know what the historical relationship band between rent spreads with Oakland and San Francisco, where they now? And do you anticipate that relationship changing in the coming years?","Erik Alexander","They obviously differ by product type, given the growth in Oakland has been filling up faster this year. It\u2019s tightening and so it's been several $100 difference or more, and I think that's closing and I think you'll continue to see that as Mike talked about people moving from the peninsula and San Jose and San Francisco into the East Bay, including Oakland. So we like those markets going forward and we also like because over the years it just gotten better to commute back to job. East Bay has added some jobs as we've talked about, but certainly not as much as Silicon Valley and San Francisco. But the Bart line has been extended further. We see people with the properties that we have along that line commuting back into it, just becomes a better alternative to people every year.","Operator","And I'd now like to turn the call back to Mr. Schall for any additional or closing remarks.","Michael Schall","Okay, thank you. In closing, I'd like to thank everyone once again for joining on the call. We hope and your families are enjoying a safe and enjoyable summer season. Good day. Thank you.","Operator","And thank you. That does conclude our conference for today. I'd like to thank you everyone for your participation and have a great afternoon."],"8841":["Essex Property Trust, Inc.

As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.","Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs as well as information available to the company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found in the company's filings with the SEC.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you, Mr. Schall, you may begin.","Michael Schall","Thank you, operator. We welcome everyone to our second quarter earnings conference call. John Burkart and Angela Kleiman will follow me with comments before we open the call to Q&A. ","Results for the second quarter of 2019 exceeded our expectations with core FFO per share growing 6.1% compared to the second quarter of 2018. We are pleased to raise our full year core FFO guidance by $0.20 at the midpoint, which is attributable to strong operations and improving cost of capital and solid execution from the Essex team. Angela will provide more details about the quarter and the increase to our full year guidance in her remarks.","2019 is playing out mostly as expected with market rents for the Essex metros remaining unchanged at 3.1% as detailed on F-16 of the supplemental, generally the tech markets continue to outperform led by San Francisco and Seattle, while Southern California has lagged expectations. Looking at job growth on Page F-16 San Francisco's estimated job growth was revised upward from 1.7% to 2.6% pushing its estimated 2019 rent growth to 3.5%. As noted last quarter. Southern California job growth had a slow start to the year and has since experienced a modest acceleration. June trailing three month job growth in Southern California was 1.3% equal to our forecast on page F-16.","We will briefly comment on several indicators that support our expectation for continued job growth and housing demand, all of which are consistent with our belief that the West Coast vibrant economies remain well positioned for future growth, beginning with office development which continues to perform at a healthy pace and is required for job growth. For the nation, under construction office properties represent 2.1% of existing office stock; within the Essex footprint all counties except Orange and Ventura are producing new office space at a greater pace than the national average.","The Bay Area leads the West Coast in office development with over 16 million square feet or 4.9% of stock currently under construction. In Seattle, nearly 5 million square feet of office was under production or 3.3% of stock, not including the planned expansion of the Microsoft campus with an estimated 3 million square feet of office space. We also track the job openings at the top 10 public tech companies, all of which are headquartered in an Essex market. As of June 30, these job openings were up 19% year-over-year and remain near all-time highs since we began tracking the data several years ago.","It's worth note mentioning that Amazon continues to actively hire in Washington State where it has approximately 11,500 job openings. Venture capital financing remains at record levels in the Bay Area this past year with about $60 billion committed and the Essex markets accounted for 62% of all US venture capital funding. San Francisco led all US markets in BC funding the past year with almost $42 billion invested followed by Silicon Valley with almost $19 billion invested, the highest levels recorded over the past 20 years.","Unparalleled access to skilled workers and growth capital continue to attract entrepreneurs to the West Coast. Recent IPOs Uber, Lyft, Slack and Pinterest should catalyze growth given greater access to capital and improved liquidity, they join other publicly traded tech companies, many of which continue to expand in the Bay Area.","Google for example was actively buying or leasing additional office space in San Francisco and the Silicon Valley communities of Mountain View, Sunnyvale and San Jose. In San Mateo County, Facebook and YouTube expanded in San Bruno, Burlingame, and Menlo Park. We believe that a stronger IPO market will likely drive other long-term benefits to the local economies. By one estimate, several recent IPOs have created 6,000 millionaires which will ultimately unlock previously illiquid equity positions.","At some point, some of that wealth will likely be redeployed, which will increase consumption and set the stage for new start-ups down the road. A strong labor market, shortages of skilled workers, and low unemployment rates continue to push incomes higher. Essex weighted average unemployment rate was 2.9% as of May and the median household income grew an average of 5.3% in the second quarter. With market rents growing in the 3% range, rental affordability continues to improve in all of our markets. Turning briefly to apartment supply our delay adjusted estimate of around 36,000 apartment deliveries in the Essex markets in 2019 has not changed and we expect a similar level of deliveries in 2020 albeit with some meaningful regional variations.","Turning to the investment markets, our outlook has much improved relative to conditions experienced in 2018, significantly lower interest rates and strong equity markets have substantially improved our cost of capital. In 2018 we were a net seller of apartments using the proceeds to reinvest in development, preferred equity and to fund stock repurchases. We are now mostly focused on acquisitions and preferred equity investments. We are pleased to announce another accretive acquisition this quarter, which was a high-quality property in a market we know well. At this point, we hope to exceed the high end of our acquisition guidance range of $400 million. Overall market conditions for acquisitions have not changed much this year despite the dramatic reduction in interest rates. Apartment buyers continue to target value-add opportunities, which results in greater competition for these deals that leads to compression and cap rate spreads between value-add and core properties.","Even newer properties are being marketed, with a claim of a value-add component. In this environment, we remain focused on our disciplined underwriting process with market selection and timing our primary concern. Our disposition activity on the other hand will likely end up below the low end of our $300 million to $500 million guidance range given our improved cost of capital. Finally, we note that shortages in the construction labor force continue to cost development delays, both in the Essex pipeline and more broadly.","As noted on our prior calls, the combination of long entitlement processes in the coastal markets at a time when construction costs are growing significantly faster than NOI compresses development yields. For these reasons, we continue to believe that preferred equity investments in apartment development deals generally offer superior risk adjusted returns over direct development.","That concludes my comments. Overall, we are very pleased with our company's progress year-to-date and wish to thank all of the Essex employees for their hard work.","I'll now turn the call over to John.","John Burkart","Thank you, Mike. We are starting the second half of the year with strong momentum, achieving 3.5% revenue growth in the second quarter. Financial occupancy for the same-store portfolio was 96.6%, 10 basis points below the prior year's period and 30 basis points less than the first quarter, while market rents were up in Q2, an average of 3.4% over the prior year's period, setting us in a favorable position as we lock down peak market rents. Our turnover in Q2 2019 was 46.4% on a trailing 12-month basis, which is down 3.2% from the comparable period ending Q2 2018. Although there are some pockets of weakness to supply interest in the local market offering large concessions. The West Coast markets overall are performing above our original expectation, largely driven by better employment growth in the Bay Area. As a result, we are raising our same-store gross revenue guidance for the full year by 25 basis points to a midpoint of 3.3%. I'll note that third-party economic research estimates for Essex market rent growth continues to be inaccurate. For example, one vendor stated that our June 2019 rents were up only 40 basis points over the prior year when in reality, they were up 3.8%.","Strategically, we will continue to favor achieving market rents over higher occupancy, taking advantage of the strong market conditions to lock in higher rents. Regarding new multifamily supply, the pace of deliveries in Essex markets remains in line with the delay adjusted forecast we introduced last fall and we are maintaining our estimate of roughly 36,000 apartment units this year, which is consistent with 2018 volumes. Our estimates remain below third-party projections, but we expect additional construction delays in the back half of the year to bring third-party figures down closer to our forecast. Construction remains concentrated in a handful of urban core submarkets led this year by the downtowns of Los Angeles and Oakland. Deliveries also remain elevated in Seattle, but strong job growth is supporting the rapid absorption of new units and we are encouraged that the pace of new deliveries in Seattle is poised to decelerate in 2020. Beyond 2020, we would highlight that new multifamily permits in the Essex markets are down 11% over the past year on a trailing 12-month basis, suggesting that the near-term pace of deliveries represents a plateau followed by gradual deceleration of new supply growth.","Moving on to a market update. In Seattle, employment growth continues to outpace the US and other major East Coast markets posting year-over-year growth of 2.9% for the second quarter of 2019. Amazon job openings remain at peak levels while office absorption stored in the second quarter as large deals were delivered and occupied. Each of our four submarkets North, South, Seattle CBD and Eastside performed well, growing revenues between 3.2% and 4.5%. Moving down to Northern California, job growth in the San Francisco Bay Area averaged 2.5% year-over-year in Q2 led by San Francisco at 3.7% growth. As Mike mentioned, the continued expansion in the Bay Area is evident in the recent IPOs of sustained highs in VC funding.","In the second quarter, we started two lease-ups. Milo, a 476-unit property in Santa Clara is now 22% pre-leased offering one month free rent. Station Park Green Phase II with 199 units in San Mateo is 24% leased offering concessions up to six weeks. Last, we started pre-leasing 500 Folsom with 537 units in downtown San Francisco scheduled for initial occupancy in the third quarter. Year-over-year same-store revenue growth in the second quarter was strong on the Peninsula submarkets with San Francisco achieving 5.9% cemetery of achieving 4.4% followed by San Jose at 3.9% and Fremont with 3.6%. San Ramon and Oakland CBD came in at 2.4% and 2% growth respectively compared to the prior year's quarter.","Continuing South, Southern California continues to perform at the lower end of our markets, largely due to lower employment growth, the region and LA County each achieved 1.3% year-over-year job growth, which is in line with our jobs forecast on Page S-16. Revenue growth in Q2 was led by Woodland Hills with 5.2%, Long Beach with 4.7%, West LA at 4.4% and Tri-Cites with 2.1%. Our LA CBD revenues were down 2.2% due to the impact of the supply with the downtown lease ups offering six to eight weeks free rent plus other incentives, such as free parking.","In Orange County, jobs in the second quarter ticked up 1.2% year-over-year. Revenue growth in North Orange submarket achieved 3.3% growth, while the South Orange submarket achieved 1.8% growth over the prior year's quarter. Finally, in San Diego, year-over-year job growth in the second quarter was 1.6%, 10 basis points higher than the US, the Oceanside submarket continues to lead the San Diego market in year-over-year revenues achieving 4.8% growth in Q2, followed by North City and Chula Vista submarkets with 3.6% and 2.6% growth respectively. Currently, our portfolio is at 96.2% occupancy and our availability 30 days out is 5.2%. Thank you. And I will now turn the call over to our CFO , Angela Kleimen.","Angela Kleiman","Thank you, John. I'll start with a brief review of our second quarter results then focus on the increase to our full year guidance. Beginning with the second quarter performance. I'm pleased to report that we have achieved a core FFO per share of $3.33 which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 6.1%. This result exceeded the high end of our guidance and represents an $0.11 beat to the midpoint, the key components of this out-performance are as follows, $0.03 from same property revenues, $0.03 from lower interest expense, non-same-store revenue and other miscellaneous items, and $0.05 from property tax savings and refunds primarily from lower Seattle millage rates for 2019. This is contrary to our experience from the past several years, where our Seattle property tax increase had been in the mid double-digit range. Favorable year-to-date results enabled us to increase the midpoint of our same-property revenues by 25 basis points. While the benefits from tax savings and refunds enabled us to lower the midpoint of our same-property expenses by 80 basis points. The combination of these revisions resulted in a full year same-property NOI growth of 3.7% at the midpoint, which is 65 basis points higher than our initial outlook and near the high end of our original guidance range. In addition, we are raising our core FFO per share guidance for the second time this year. For the full year, we are raising core FFO per share by $0.20 to $13.20 at the midpoint, approximately $0.13 of this raise relate to improved NOI expectations, and the remaining $0.07 comes from a combination of lower interest expense, acquisitions and preferred equity investments made to date. On the preferred equity investments, we have exceeded the high end of our guidance of $100 million and this is primarily a result of larger deal size in this year's transactions.","Lastly, onto the balance sheet. In the second half of the year, we have around $100 million of debt maturities and we have the ability to prepay $290 million of debt, which matures in 2020 without incurring any prepayment penalty. We will continue to be opportunistic as we consider our refinancing alternatives to optimize our cost of capital. Currently, we have approximately $1 billion available to us and our 1.2 billion lines of credit and our leverage level remains conservative at 5.5 times debt to EBITDA.","I will now turn the call back to the operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Richard Hill with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Richard Hill, your line is now live. Please proceed with your question. Our next question comes from the line of Trent Trujillo with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question.","Trent Trujillo","Hi. Good morning out there. So these same-store revenue guidance raise was very nice to see. You brought up the low end of the range. So, Mike, with the positive market conditions you cited, how much consideration did you give to adjusting the top end of the range?","Michael Schall","I'll start with that and then maybe Angelo will have a comment. Obviously, we hit the top end of the range in Northern California, but we were pretty close to the midpoint or a little bit above the midpoint and the other markets. And so, we thought there was plenty of room within the range. So we didn't need to move it. We cannot move rents super quickly because we have to turn the leases. And in the second half of the year we turned fewer leases than we do in the first half of the year. So I think that the guidance range is appropriate where it is now. Angela, do you have anything to add?","Angela Kleiman","We had guided to a tougher first half and a lighter second half originally with the midpoint at 3. And given where the first half came in, certainly, we are comfortable with where our guidance range is at this point. But having said that, keep in mind that the second half now will contemplate heavier supply. And so, in that environment, it didn't make sense for us to raise the high end of the guidance range.","Trent Trujillo","Okay. I appreciate the commentary there. John, you mentioned turnover keeps improving on a year-over-year basis. How long is that sustainable and is there a level of turnover, at which point you say you will start implementing larger rate increases?","John Burkart","Well, as far as the rental increases, we are very focused on our customers being fair in their entire experience which, of course, includes what they pay. And so, we typically will not raise rents above the marketplace, that's effectively set in the marketplace. As far as how low can turnover go, I would love to see it continue to go lower. I think what's driving the lower turnover at this point in time are a combination of factors, one of them being the fact that our assets are well located, of course, they always have been. So that hasn't changed. But what does change is the quality of life in many of the metros, the traffic continues to increase and as it increases it makes our assets better relatively than other options. So that is one angle. Another angle is we continue to focus on the customer experience at the sites, and we do have room to continue to improve that. We will continue to work on making all of our customers have the best experience possible. And finally, affordability overall in all of our markets continues to improve as incomes grow significantly faster than rents. And so, it's putting a lot less pressure on people to move for financial reasons, whether it's further away from their jobs or it's other areas. So I do think there is some continued room to run. I think it works best for both our customers and ourselves to have lower turnover. So we're pretty pleased with it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nick Joseph with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Nick Joseph","Thanks. You're seeing more attractive acquisition opportunities versus the recent past. You mentioned you may have exceeded high end of acquisition guidance. So how large is acquisition pipeline today?","Michael Schall","Yeah. Hey, Nick, it's Mike. The acquisition pipeline is pretty decent. I would say that the fact that we're going to exceed the high end of the range is more a function of not having a real aggressive high end of the range given conditions at the beginning of the year, which we had a much higher cost of capital. And as we fast forward to today, interest rates have declined pretty dramatically and there's a lot more interest in property. So I think it's more a function of there's enough deals out there and our pipeline is a few hundred million, but there is no guarantee we're going to close all or even some of those deals, but we are much more in the hunt this year. Again, if you go back to last year, we weren't able to make the numbers work. We were selling property. We are a net seller of property, selling property 8th & Hope in downtown LA, for example, for a sub-4 cap rate and buying stock back, the conditions are just so much different. So we are back much more interested in the acquisition market.","Nick Joseph","Thanks. So then just maybe on the funding side, historically, you've been pretty active on issuing to repurchase shares if it makes sense. Looks like for most of the second quarter, you're trading above NAV, but given that acquisition pipeline and kind of the use for net capital, so I think you're issuing ATM equities in the second quarter?","John Burkart","Angela will have an answer to this, but I'll start. I mean, the simple answer is that we're debt-to-market cap is about 22%. So we just don't need to deleverage the balance sheet. In fact, we don't have any interest at all in deleveraging the balance sheet further. And we feel like we've managed it to where we want to be sort of late in a economic cycle. And so we're perfectly comfortable with where it is now and in fact could increase leverage a little bit, not that we're necessarily planning to do that, but we feel comfortable doing that. Angela, do you want to add to that?","Angela Kleiman","Sure thing. Hey, Nick. In terms of the equity issuance activity, if you look at our acquisitions to date, we really didn't have a need because it will require via a down structure and the preferred equity investments, they fund over time inevitably and so the funding is very small. But generally speaking, in addition to Mike's comment on our leverage level, we do look to match fund our investments relative to the cost of capital to optimize that yield. And so even though our staff may at any given point in time be trading at above consensus NAV, we will still look for ways to make sure they -- that funding is the most attractive and we have, as you know several alternatives to how we can fund an investment. And so it may, may or may not be the common equity issuance as the first thing.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Austin Wurschmidt","Hi, thanks for the time. Mike, you mentioned you view preferred equity, there is a more attractive risk-adjusted return versus development. So I'm just curious what it would take for you to restart the development pipeline or what spread maybe you'd need between cap rates to justify the risks you see today.","Michael Schall","Yeah, Austin, it's a good question. And again the driving dynamic there is that construction costs are growing faster than rents in general and with entitlement processes in California stretching out 3 years to 5 years, in many cases, you end up in a potential for lower yields on development than you otherwise have. I can cross out with the preferred equity where we're coming in just before the start of construction. So all about pre-development period is in the past and we're coming in and starting construction the next day. And so the risk-reward equation is much different. Having said that, we look at a lot of development in transactions and so it's not for not trying to make them work. We just had been pretty selective given where we are, our perception where we are in the economic cycle, and the risk-reward equation. And to get us interested in direct development, we would like to see between 100 to 150 basis point cap rate premium to stabilize yields, which for a quality property, let's say, are around 4% right now. So we'd be looking for that. And again, looking at the risk profile of what the entitlement process looks like, how long it's going to be in some of those other considerations in terms of our direct development appetite.","Austin Wurschmidt","I appreciate the thoughts there. And then just second for me,you discuss 2020 supply is going to be or is projected at this point to be a similar level as 2019. But you did mention, there are some variations in where that supply is concentrated. Could you just give us a little more detail of some of the moving parts by region?","Michael Schall","Sure, of course. Our research team goes and drives all most of these sites. And so we have really good intelligence and as John mentioned, some of the data vendors have much different numbers for multifamily supply projections, and we think our numbers have proven pretty accurate. So really, kudos to the economic research team for that. But, so, as you point out, yes, we have about 36,000 units in 2019 and about the same number in 2020. The big movers are number one in Orange County which goes down about 40% and actually San Jose goes up about 40%. It's not a tremendous number of units, goes from 2,700 units at 3,800 units and Oakland will go up about that same percentage. And then we will -- and then Seattle goes down about a third 2,900 units. So those are the driving forces. And again, it nets out to about zero increase.","Austin Wurschmidt","All right. Thank you.","Michael Schall","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Shirley Wu with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","Shirley Wu","Good morning there guys and thanks for taking the question. So, John, earlier in your call you and even previously, you mentioned that this year it's emphasizing more of a rate growth drive from occupancy. And occupancy actually was down 10 basis points compared to what you would have imagined with 20 basis points you mentioned earlier this year. So I was wondering what's going on there and just the strong demand that you're seeing and if that's going to continue in the rest of the year. Or if you just continue to expect that occupancy to come down to about 20 basis point you mentioned previously?","John Burkart","Sure. So the simple answer is yes. For the year, I expect it to tick down 20 basis points from where it was last year. But within that, a little bit more detail. So, yeah, as was mentioned earlier, the supply picture, there's more supply that is coming on to the market in the second half, it's about an increase of about 25% and it is my expectation because seasonally demand goes down, just a normal aspect of our markets. So as the supply increases and demand slightly decreases just because of seasonal factors, I think there'll be an increase in concessions and that will cause us at the end of the day to compete harder by either offering concessions at some of the stabilized assets or increasing what we're doing or allowing some things to go vacant longer. At the end of the day, I expect that there'll just be a little bit more pressure and that's part of the answer as to why we increased guidance where we did and we're comfortable with it.","Shirley Wu","Great, thanks for that color.","John Burkart","Sure.","Shirley Wu","And moving on the CapEx side, I noticed that in 2Q, it was slightly higher than the usual run rate and I was wondering if that, you can get a little bit more color and if that was a one-time thing and how we should expect capex to trend for the rest of the year.","John Burkart","Sure. Yes, the original guidance anticipated an increase to 1,600 a unit range and I expect that to be closer to a run rate than where we were. There are numerous factors that have -- that drive this, the same factors that drive the increase in development costs that we talked about on a regular basis, increased labor and materials costs. So that's the big factor and then of course some of the newer buildings with the systems and other things that we have that we bought and built, they also typically run higher in capex as on a per unit basis, not a percentage but a per unit basis.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rich Hightower with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.","Rich Hightower","Hi, good morning out there guys.","Michael Schall","Good morning, Rich.","Rich Hightower","So I've got a two-parter on affordability here. So I heard the stats, Mike, that you put out in terms of affordability and rent growth and income growth. I'm wondering if you're actually seeing affordability improved empirically in terms of the new leases that you're signing, if you're noticing that in sort of the screening mechanism. And then separately from that, we've started to see home values and home prices in the Bay Area maybe roll over a little bit, maybe in other West Coast markets as well. Is there any read through on affordability related to that or is that sort of a separate issue?","Michael Schall","Yeah, those are, those are all great, great questions. It's hard to get down to a very granular level on this affordability issue. We've been tracking this for the better part of 30 years now, and it's one of those market indicators, kind of bigger picture indicators that we know is really important and by that, I would say, let me give you a couple of statistics. So between 2010 and 2015 we had 20% higher rent growth versus household income growth. So we had rent growth that dramatically exceeded household income growth and I think that caused some of the concerns that we've had and we've been talking about this affordability issue for the last couple of years, largely because of that, that statistic. And then from, if I look at it from 2010 to now, that 20% higher rent growth and household income is now 13%, so we've actually moved the needle pretty significantly as it relates to that rent to income ratio. So I think that is incredibly important and I think it's one of the things that we would put on the top couple of considerations for these markets. We have grown rents very substantially over long periods of time. I think between 2012 to 2017 our same-store revenue has gone up by about -- by an average of 7% per year. So that's a lot of, a lot of growth. And as we know, incomes were pretty stagnant coming out of the financial crisis. And so we, again, think that is a really important issue as it relates to home prices, which as you pointed out, I think they're down 6% in San Jose and up about 3% in San Francisco and everything else, all of our other metros are between those two numbers. And I guess what I would say is the year before was exactly the opposite, we had exceptional home price growth and I think there is a lagging indicator here with respect to interest rate. So I don't think you've seen home prices recover given pretty significantly lower interest rates. So I would expect these home price numbers to get better from this point on just given mortgage rates.","Rich Hightower","Okay. Yeah, I think that's helpful color. And my second one here, maybe as a follow-on topic. Do you care to opine at this point in the calendar on the Rental Affordability Act that is I think currently gathering signatures as far as the ballot initiative for next year?","Michael Schall","Yeah. You know, the, we keep track of it. And for those that don't know what that is, it's essentially the industry is calling it Prop 10 2.0 and where there is a potential for a ballot proposition that would amend Costa-Hawkins in, on the 2020 ballot. And there has been a certain amount of money that has been contributed by Michael Weinstein to support a signature-gathering effort. It's, I think, too early to tell exactly where that's going, Rich. We obviously track it pretty carefully and we kept our entity, Californians for Responsible Housing alive and well and organized in case of this. So we'll wait and see what happens.","And because there's also the Assembly Bill 1482 which is the statewide rent control law, which started out as a, an anti gouging type of proposal and it's currently in the Senate and it would cap rents at CPI plus 7, at least that's the current proposal, again, it's in the Senate, could still be modified from here. But I think that that is pretty indicative of a better balance with respect to the discussion on housing, on the need for housing in California. Again, going back to the governor's campaign, campaigning on producing 3.5 million homes in California by 2025, that's about 600,000 a year. By way of background, we produced about 80,000 a year for the last 10 years on average. And so he as recognized the need for more housing and at the same time trying to balance that with the protection of the tenant base as well. So I think it's a more balanced discussion and I think that we will have to see where these things come. You're going to see action on AB 1482 long before you see -- get an update on what might happen with respect to Prop 10 2.0.","Rich Hightower","All right. Very good. Thanks, Mike.","Michael Schall","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Please proceed with your question.","Alexander Goldfarb","Hey, good morning out there. Mike, maybe just following up that last question on the whole rent control and discussion on California. Are you seeing any seepage of what happened here in New York where the restrictions and then in the, the regulation that was passed when they renewed rent control are so onerous that it actually discourages landlords and housing, are you seeing any of that creep into the California political landscape where California wouldn't want to be outmaneuvered by New York or is it where Sacramento sort of being led by Governor Newsom that wants to promote housing and is more cognizant of factors or legislation that would inhibit that?","Michael Schall","It's a good question, Alex, and thank you for that. I guess in New York, my perception is that that all happened very suddenly and there was a proposal and it was passed almost before people could","have time to properly react to it and understand the unintended consequences of it. Whereas I think it's different in California because we've had this dialog going back to the Prop 10 especially a year ago, and in so doing this dialog of regarding rent control in general has been ongoing. And again, this is why I think the governor, his comments are so important noting, another thing he noted was that there is a perverse incentive not to produce housing in California for variety of reasons, and again he is recognizing the need for balance in that equation.","And so I think we have a better discussion here and I think that it's been thought-through at a greater level than probably it has in some of the other states around the countries.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. And then moving to Seattle or actually Bellevue specifically with all the investment that Amazon is doing in Bellevue and focusing their office development there, are you guys sort of reassessing how you want to play the Seattle market, do you think that we would see you guys do more investment in Bellevue or maybe your existing footprint, you're happy with where it is based on the growth that Amazon is looking at for Bellevue?","Michael Schall","It all depends on yields and risk. We love Bellevue. We love downtown Seattle. I'd say in general, we're becoming more suburban focused than urban focused because of a number of issues. There's more supply in the urban core. I'd say actually both with respect to office development but also with respect to apartment development. And so trying to avoid the cities that are having these large concessions because you've got three, four or five lease ups competing with one another at the same time. So it's difficult to project forward that far. These concessions literally change on a weekly basis. And so I think our strategy is evolving too. Hey, let's just try to avoid the areas that have massive development given that the rent growth in those areas has been suppressed for pretty long periods of time now. So we will continue to monitor and I can't predict whether Bellevue or Seattle is going to outperform until we're a lot closer to looking at a deal.","Alexander Goldfarb","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rob Stevenson with Janney Montgomery Scott. Please proceed with your question.","Rob Stevenson","Good morning. John, you talked about the development pipeline and concessions earlier. When you layer on new supply and stuff that was completed a year ago that might be having its first renewal, the five developments that you either currently have in lease-up or will in the next quarter or so, are any of those of a concern in terms of concessions that you guys think that you're going to need to lease some up? I think you said Milo was currently one month free. And then I think it was Station Green, the first phase was six weeks. Anything that's going to be outside of that sort of range?","John Burkart","Well, let me give a kind of a broad answer there. So when we delivered vacant unit, we are greatly incented and this is really why it's logical why many of the developers are doing what they're doing as far as free rent. It's not a matter that the market is weak. It's the matter that they're trying to drive a significant amount of absorption fast because your option one is vacant unit, option two is a lower net effective with the qualified resident and getting cash flow. So we have the same economics there and, of course, it's different when we own the asset, I mean, when we have -- for our same-store assets, right. But we are one of those players on the development.","So what we try to do is look for what works best in the marketplace and what the consumers are looking for and react to that. So I expect we'll increase our concessions over time. It is within our plan to do that because it usually happens as we get into the fourth quarter. But we make these decisions literally daily and definitely reviewed intensely weekly. So we'll just follow it. But all of our -- you can tell by the pre-leasing performance, the markets are strong, and we feel very good about all of our developments where they're at.","Rob Stevenson","Any of them facing extreme new supply as Mike was alluding to before?","John Burkart","No, we are not in -- at this point we're not in a situation where we have extreme combat.","Rob Stevenson","Okay. And then, Angela, if I look at the same-store expense growth year-to-date 2.9% sort of implies a low ones for the back half of '19, is that all on property taxes or is there something else that's going to drive same store expenses down to the low 1% range for the back half of 2019?","Angela Kleiman","Yeah, you're right, it's actually, mostly driven by property taxes. So between the millage rate coming in lower than expected, and we of course have some refunds that we're recognizing in the second half. Those are the two key drivers.","Rob Stevenson","Okay. So if I can squeeze one more in. Maybe other than market concentration, what's keeping you guys sort of BBB+ from the rating agencies versus an A- like Avalon and Equity?","Angela Kleiman","Believe it or not, it's really market concentration.","Rob Stevenson","Okay.","Angela Kleiman","That's the key driver.","Angela Kleiman","Yeah, I think the rating agencies are so focused on the number of states versus the relevance of the actual state. I mean, California as we all know, has the -- it's like the third largest GDP and incredibly diverse and large. Having said that, I think just the fact that it's one state is what's tough with the rating agencies to underwrite.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Karin Ford with MUFG Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Karin Ford","Hi, good morning. Google announced it was looking to develop about $15 billion of real estate in the Bay Area with Lendlease, it sounds like a significant chunk of that is earmarked for residential. Do you see this as a significant medium- to long-term supply the threat that could be large enough to potentially affect rent growth, market rent growth in the region?","Michael Schall","Yeah, this is Mike. They're not alone. Microsoft has a program. I think Stanford University has some discussions about mainly student housing, but there are some other proposals of corporations getting involved in housing. It remains difficult to figure out exactly what's going to happen in the short term, I don't think there'll be any actually short-term impact, these are mostly over longer periods of time. And I think a lot of the corporate housing is probably strategically important to them and their hiring given that one of the key reasons not to come to the Bay Area is concern over housing and housing price.","So if you can assure someone that's relocating to the Bay Area that they have a home, I think that's a major positive in the hiring process. Overall, I don't think that any of this given the cost of housing and the size of these programs, I don't think it's going to have a material impact on the markets, but again we'll face that down the road ways.","Karin Ford","Got it. And then my second question is going back to your development pipeline. You've got an extraordinary amount of lease-up and development coming in the Bay Area in next six quarters, including 500 fulsome and you talked today a lot about the strong environment in those markets. Do you think your yields on those could outperform your underwriting and can you share were the deals are penciling today?","Michael Schall","I think that we've talked about stabilized yields a little bit and maybe I'll echo those comments stabilizing somewhere in the 5.5 range. And this is not today and it won't be next year, but it will be a couple of years out. As you can imagine, development deals have, for example, retail components and the retail components are important because you don't want to have -- a lot of people don't want to move into a construction projects, so you want all of that construction to be done. So that yield is a few years out. And so I think that for the next year or so, you will see some positive increment but not dramatic.","Karin Ford","And is that 5.5 yield number on trended rents are on rents today?","Michael Schall","No, on stabilized rents.","Karin Ford","Stabilized rents. Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Drew Babin with Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Drew Babin","Hey, good morning. A quick follow-on question on the\u2026","Michael Schall","Good morning.","Drew Babin","Good morning. On the lease-up properties coming in getting delayed, did that explicitly caused an increase to the FFO guidance where some of these properties you might have some initial drag, obviously, taking on the expenses, mid lease-up that might now occur or early next year? Is there any kind of dynamic there in '19 versus '20 with those development projects getting pushed out?","Angela Kleiman","Yeah, Drew on the FFO guidance, the delay impact which ultimately I think you're looking at the higher capitalized interest on our S-14, it's a couple of pennies, let's say $0.02 and for this year. So what that means is, of course, some of that dilution is going to get push next year as we continue to lease out, but I think the one positive is that this dilution instead of being as concentrated as we saw that occur this year, it'll be more moderated and it will just occur over time similar to the impasse of supply delivery, that if they all come at once it's obviously much tougher to digest if they were to, say, happen more ratably over time. It's much more manageable.","Drew Babin","Okay, thanks for that. And I guess one more topic kind of related to the corporate housing question. Should some of these projects really, the rubber meet the road, and some of them getting titled, some of them proceed, would Essex under the right economic conditions ever consider partnering with one of he corporations in some kind of project? And I guess, what would you need to see for that to make sense for Essex?","Michael Schall","Drew, this is Mike. A lot of these corporate housing entities have -- or proposals have included an RFP-type process, and so there might be some opportunity to work with some of these companies, and they'll be exposed more broadly to the development community. So it probably isn't going to be just us and it will be several projects over periods of time. So I'd say it's too early to tell exactly what it means. And again, we track pretty closely as you know the total amount of competing property that's going to be entering the rental pool down the road. So if we saw a huge impact, I think during the construction period gives us time to react as well. So what exactly would those terms be, we work in a joint venture on many development deals and the markets for those terms depending upon what side you're on change over time. And we're looking to actually at some joint venture development deals as we speak. They're complicated enough that I don't think I can reduce them to magnitude. We're going to look at more broadly at the yield premiums that -- to acquisitions measured today with market rents today that I talked about a little while ago. And whether we do it in a joint venture or ourselves really is a function of how much risk is there upfront in the deal, how much money do we have to spec and how long a period of time do we have to spec it in the pre-development period before you begin construction, and every deal is a bit different.","Drew Babin","Okay. I appreciate the color. Thank you.","Michael Schall","Did we lose the -- I don't hear anything.","Angela Kleiman","Operator, are you still there?","John Burkart","Operator?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Wes Golladay","Hey, good morning everyone. Glad we're still on. Going and looking at that slide you put in last quarter, you had the one about the permits falling quite a bit, I'm trying to use that slides to have good supply data. I wonder if you guys can give us some insight on when you think peak supply will be in your markets, it looks like next year will be comparable, but is it going to be the same thing in 2022 as well in 2021?","John Burkart","Well, yeah, no, this is John. Our expectations, it starts to tick down. So as I mentioned, we're really at a plateau right now and we expect it slowly starts to tick down going after next year. So yeah, where you, like, put it that way, we're at peak supply right now.","Wes Golladay","Okay, fantastic. And then when we look at those permits, I mean, they're falling quite a bit since we started by the middle of last year, is that mainly due to the cost that you cite where the rents are not growing fast enough or do you think the political uncertainty is also having a big factor in that?","John Burkart","I think, yeah, I mean\u2026","Michael Schall","Both, yeah, both. It's all the above. It's how much risk do you take and what types of yields are you expecting, how do you get compensated for that risk. And I'd say maybe adding to that is the project sizes are getting bigger and bigger and that the cost per unit is -- has increased pretty dramatically. So you need more, more equity and a lot of these deals. And as we see this in the preferred equity environment where in that pre-development period costs are going up faster than rents and when we come in with preferred equity sometimes, these deals are short of equity given cost increases and that's causing some delays there. So it's all this. But yes, it all involves the relationship between construction costs and development deals.","Wes Golladay","Okay, and one final one, if I may. Do you have the new and renewal leasing for the quarter and you're most -- your loss to lease?","John Burkart","Sure, I can give that to you. So the new leases for the quarter, second quarter were up 3.4% year-over-year or prior year's quarter and the renewals in Q2 came in at 4.4% year-over-prior year, and loss to lease you asked we are at 3.5%, which at this point in time because of seasonality is going to be at the high point. So I'll compare it to last June. So last June we're at 3.3%, so it's about 20 basis points better than last year and within that, So Cal has ticked down some, so it's a 2% loss to lease and Nor Cal and Seattle have gone up, so Nor Cal is 4.6% and Seattle is a 5%, all average rate of 3.5% for June.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with SMBC. Please proceed with your question.","Rich Anderson","Thanks, good morning out there. So I recall many years ago you guys were kind enough to offer a 10% cap on annual rent increases. And I'm wondering, obviously, that's a moot point today. And, Mike, I'm asking is that situation of excessive rent growth fundamentally over in your opinion in your markets or is it simply supply and that has to kind of readjust where you could get there or is there, the political side that if you've dare to go there again that you get, you reignite sort of the rent control conversation to a higher level?","Michael Schall","Yeah. Hey, Rich. It's a good question. I think where we are in the cycle is probably a key consideration there. You tend to get more rent growth when you go through a recessionary period, there's very little development, and so jobs start growing and you end up with a supply demand imbalance for housing and you can push rents more aggressively than we can now, now being constrained primarily by income growth and affordability type issue. So as it relates to the 10%, you're exactly correct. We internally capped our renewals at 10% for many years, well, when we had much more robust rent growth and we would do it again. I think it's, number one, the right thing to do, but I also and always concerned about we are always concerned about the impact on local regulators, etc. For example, when residents get a very large rent increase, they often go into the city Hall and tell the local officials about these huge rent increases and we get phone calls and push back almost immediately. And in fact, in some cases, in connection with CA and some of the rental groups, we take part in trying to mediate some of these situations. So I think it's just a good practice to cap renewal rents at 10% and it's something that we've done and we would do again.","Rich Anderson","Okay, great. And then on your earlier comments on office development, I found interesting as I usually do, but I'm wondering if you guys also track pre-leasing of that office development, which is really where the rubber meets the road as it relates to future demand for multifamily, there could be some stupid development in there?","Michael Schall","Yeah, Rich, it for sure will, can change and -- but eventually, I think the, those office buildings we would all agree will be completed. So yeah, you're right. In the short term absorption really matters. In the longer term, the fact that the property exists is probably what matters more. John, you want to comment?","John Burkart","Yeah, and all this add in, the developments on the West Coast overall that Mike was referencing there about 75% pre-leased on average across the market. So huge pre-leasing going on and that is the nature of most office development these days, they typically have a big portion of their tenants before they break ground or at least in our markets.","Michael Schall","And let me let me end with one final comment, Rich, and that is, we're always concerned that people are going to find California less desirable and some of the tech jobs move to Austin, for example. So again, the fact that big investments are being made in our markets is really important to us. We view that as sort of a leading indicator. What are the tech companies doing? Can -- everyone is concerned about migration out of California, we're concerned about it as well. Again, we try to cobble together a number of sort of leading indicators to give us some sense of what decisions are being made by developers and some of the big tech companies.","Rich Anderson","Yeah, I think it's a good practice. I appreciate it. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors. Please proceed with your question.","John Pawlowski","Thanks. Angela, could you remind us what you're expecting for property taxes in Seattle and property tax growth rate would be this year and are the favorable reassessments, do you think it's the beginning of a multi-year trend, the fever finally breaking in Seattle?","Angela Kleiman","Well, on the tax piece, we're expecting the full year to come in at the middle ground. Say, in the high 1%, so say, 1.07, 1.08-ish, somewhere around there. In terms of the trend, boy, that's a tough one. I wish I had that crystal ball. It's interesting because in the past three years, our Seattle property tax has gone up between say 15, I think it was 15% for two years and 17% one of those three years. And this year it was a decrease. And so, that -- and we actually didn't budget it, the 15, but I certainly didn't budget a decrease. And so I'm not entirely sure what's going to happen next year. I think we're going to just try to take up best estimate, talk to our consultants and get some advice on that, but if you have a better solution, by all means, please call me.","John Pawlowski","I guess the shorter question is, is there anything lumpy one-time benefits this year that won't persist in Seattle?","Angela Kleiman","Nothing significant. We have a some refunds but there -- those numbers are not big enough to drive year-over-year comp.","John Pawlowski","Okay. And, Mike, on the regulatory front, in Washington, what are your political contacts saying about 2020 legislative session and rent control chatter gaining steam again in Washington?","Michael Schall","I don't have any recent information on that. So I don't -- I haven't heard of any major movement in Washington at this point in time.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Hardik Goel with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question.","Hardik Goel","Hey guys, congrats on the strong quarter on the guidance raise. I just had a couple of questions for you. The first one on a comment, I think, John made, so permits are declining year-over-year across your markets, but the lay environment that persisted, do you think there is risk that even though supply is plateauing now and it's kind of getting smoothed out with consistent delays that there is still this pipeline of supply that has started but not yet completed or may be stuck in pre-development that already has been permanent in past quarters that will continue to dribble out supply even beyond 2020, early 2021 and onwards.","And my second one is easier. Sorry, you go ahead. I'll ask it afterwards.","Michael Schall","Yes. Okay, so, again, as we've said, we literally drive all the different sites. We take down from a process perspective, we have multiple vendors providing information as to permits that are obtained, sites that are started etc. And then we have a mobile program where our people drive all the sites and upload information into the cloud as to where they're at, what's going on, and we clean up that data quite a bit and reconcile what we get from the vendors to what we see on the street. So I think we have our hands around what's going on really well probably better than most.","And so, that's what's in construction right now. And then the permits, we reconcile the permits to the actual as built and obviously there is typically some leakage going back the other way, things, more things get permitted than actually get built for various reasons. But at the end of the day, I think we have our hands around it pretty good. I think we're at this point in time supply has plateaued. We'll start to see it tick down, and it would take something else like us increasing rents or something to change the picture, but as Mike had said many times, construction costs are growing faster than rents. So at this point it's, it looks like we've hit the peak.","Hardik Goel","Thanks. That's very helpful. From my second one, should be pretty straightforward, I guess. On the Seattle kind of tax savings, how much of that was just the market and will probably benefit others where in who own assets there and how much of that was something that was an Essex push where you have an appeals process or some kind of mechanism where you try to get a favorable appeal or saving?","Angela Kleiman","Yeah, that's a good question. It's mostly market driven. So this is a Seattle millage rate assessment, and so it's assessed across the board. As far as the savings, we go through our refund process every year and there is some benefit there, but that's not at all a key driver.","Hardik Goel","Got it, thanks. That's all from me.","Michael Schall","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste from Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.","Haendel St. Juste","Hey, I guess, good morning out there.","Haendel St. Juste","Welcome, Haendel.","Haendel St. Juste","Hey, Mike, I guess I'll start with an oldie but goodie. What's your current view on the Essex footprint? California is not getting easier, cost, taxes, regulations, keep on increasing, senior peers going to Denver, you been once, been in Portland, the weather is nice and there's -- it seems to be parity in Honolulu, I'm curious, if your view on your footprint here has changed or evolved at all, and if so, how?","Michael Schall","Well, Haendel, it's a good question and it's the -- probably the most essential and important question of all of them and here we go through a process each year of reviewing strategy with our Board and we kind of start with that, that very question and we look at many major metros around the country and try to distill them down into supply and demand and what it means. And so, it's an ongoing question and an ongoing process here at Essex. From where we ended up on this in the last year is we think that the resiliency of the technology world is something that's going to probably be with us for several cycles and that that along with the supply constrained nature of these markets and the difficulty of building here is going to keep a premium on housing and there is this virtuous cycle of high cost of housing drives wages higher which allows rents to go higher, which you see in very few places. And so we concluded and continue to conclude we are well-positioned in the West Coast markets.","Haendel St. Juste","Thank you for that. And then, I guess, back to, I guess, the growth, as you very well know, it's very hard to buy in California. Not much trades hands, Prop 13 being a clear headwind. So building is really the only game for the multifamily guys for growth in the Golden State. So I guess I'm curious if there's anything your shadow or future pipeline that's penciling yet or getting close to penciling given the continued rent growth, notwithstanding the rising construction costs you guys had mentioned. And if so, where? And as an add-on to that, maybe you could talk about potential interest in doing mixed-use development as well.","Michael Schall","Yeah, it's a good question. And we do have some land inventory. There is a Phase 4 of Station Park Green and there are a couple of other smaller projects that are behind our current pipeline that we will likely be active on. And as I said earlier, we continue to look for development deals and the challenge there as we stated earlier is that construction costs are growing faster than the rents, which means we have to see a fairly quick period between when we're financially committed to when we start construction because that's the period of greatest exposure. So it's pretty challenging. I would say, again, we continue looking and we have some deals that we are working on remains to be seen whether we move forward with them or not. So -- and again transitioning over to the preferred equity where we don't have that upfront risk because we're not financially committed from when during the entitlement period from when then period starts until when you start construction. We come in at construction and we eliminate that part of the risk and we've been very active in preferred equity and we will continue to do that. As Angela mentioned, we're above the top end of the range this year in terms of commitments there. So it's -- this is kind of a mosaic and we put the pieces together and every deal is unique unto itself, and we try to make decisions that makes sense in the broader scheme of things. And it's hard to bring it down to kind of the larger trends because every deals is a little bit unique. So I would say that more of the same that we will look at development deals whether they have a mixed-use component because obviously there are many deals that have mixed use components. There are other, actually other REITs and other land owners that are interested in having a multifamily component. There are no shortage of discussions out there for sure and we will look at all of the above and try to make good value decisions and make sure that I think the key part is that we're compensated for the risk that we take relative to our other opportunities.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I would like to turn the call back to Michael Schall for closing remarks.","Michael Schall","Thank you, operator, and I'd like to thank everyone for joining the call today.

As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded.","Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs as well as information available to the Company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found on the Company's filings with the SEC.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you, Mr. Schall. You may begin.","Michael Schall","Thank you everyone for joining our fourth quarter 2019 call. John Burkart and Angela Kleiman will follow me with comments, and Adam Berry is here for Q&A.","Today, I will review our 2019 results, summarize our expectations for 2020 and provide an update on the West Coast investment markets.","Beginning with our results. 2019 was a successful year for Essex as we generated 6.4% core FFO per share growth, representing over 50% better growth than contemplated in our original guidance. Same-property NOI grew 3.9% in 2019, which was at the high end of our original guidance, reflecting stronger job growth than we had assumed. For example, Q4 2019 job growth averaged 2.3%, 50 basis points above our initial 2019 estimate. Once again, the tech dominant markets in Seattle and Northern California are leading the way with recent job growth of 3.3% and 2.6%, respectively. Southern California, where economic growth generally resembles the United States, recently added jobs at a rate of 1.5% on a trailing three-month basis.","In addition, continued apartment construction delays resulted in less competition in 2019. We estimate that approximately 33,000 apartments were completed in 2019, about 7% less than expected. We continue to believe that tight construction labor market conditions will prevent significant acceleration of supply deliveries. John will provide more color on fundamentals in a moment.","Our initial outlook for 2019 did not assume a significant improvement in the cost of debt and equity capital. In early 2019, we eagerly bought back our stock at a significant discount to consensus net asset value. As volatility in the capital markets abated and our cost of capital improved, we altered our business plan and began actively pursuing investment opportunities. As a result, we are pleased to report that we exceeded the high end of our acquisition and preferred equity guidance ranges from the focused effort of our investment team.","In 2019, we added ownership interest in eight properties for $856 million, as further detailed on Page S-15 of the supplemental. These communities are mostly located in the tech centers along the West Coast and submarkets we know well and expect to be added to the portfolio\u2019s growth profile. We also committed to over $140 million to new preferred equity or subordinated debt investments, significantly better than our production in 2018.","In summary, 2019 demonstrated how we attempt to add value throughout the economic cycle.","2019 was also an important milestone for Essex as we celebrated 25 years as a public company with some notable achievements, a 17% compounded annual rate of return for our shareholders since the IPO through the end of 2019. In other words, $100 invested in our IPO would be worth over $5,000 today, with dividends reinvested.","Through several economic cycles, our business model has generated an 8.4% compounded growth rate in FFO per share and a 6.4% rate of growth in our cash dividend, which has increased every single year. We were very pleased to learn that Essex was recently added to the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrat index. I'd like to thank all of the longstanding partners, the Essex team and shareholders who\u2019ve contributed to the Company's achievements over the last quarter century.","Turning to our outlook for 2020. We continue to see healthy demand for rental housing. Recent job growth for our West Coast markets continues to exceed the 1.7% forecast for 2020, on page S-16 of the supplemental. However, we continue to believe the job growth will likely decelerate in 2020, given tight labor market conditions and a low unemployment rate, which was 2.7% in the Essex markets as of November, down 50 basis points from a year ago.","Turning to slide S-16.1 in our supplemental. We highlight a central theme of our West Coast focus. The chart on the right of this slide demonstrates that job growth has remained strong on the West Coast, and reaccelerated in 2019, diverging from the rest of the nation. On the left side of the chart, we note that multifamily permit activity in our metros peaked in 2018 and has declined about 14% from that peak, again, a divergence from the recent trends outside our markets. Rising construction costs and a challenging regulatory environment continue to compress development yields in most of our markets, which should lead to fewer supply deliveries in the future.","Our delay adjusted supply estimates for 2020 have not changed from our original estimates last quarter. Notable changes year-over-year indicate about a 30% reduction in Seattle apartment supply in 2020 and about a 45% increase in Northern California. Tight labor market conditions on the West Coast continue to push incomes higher. Per capita personal incomes are estimated to have increased 6% in our markets in 2019, significantly higher than the U.S., average of 3.9%.","Personal income growth has outpaced rent growth in most of our markets since 2016, which is leading to improved rental affordability. Consistent with this trend, the percentage of customers who moved out for financial reasons or a rent increase, was almost 16% in 2015. In the fourth quarter of 2019, this factor accounted for less than 8% of those moving out. Despite last year's outsized media coverage of the failed IPO of WeWork, or the disappointing stock performance of other unicorns, the outlook for economic growth and new jobs in our markets remains favorable in 2020.","Having closely followed Silicon Valley for the past four decades, we're not surprised to see volatility with respect to VC-backed companies. The venture capital model assumes many failures, which are more than offset by the hyper growth of the most successful investments. Bay Area venture capital investments dipped in the second half of 2019, but remained at healthy levels, well above this cycle\u2019s average pace of investment.","We continue to track over 26,000 job openings listed in our markets by the top 10 largest tech firms, a 12% increase compared to a year ago. The largest tech companies continue to add commercial square footage at a rapid pace, which John will comment on in a moment. Overall, we are tracking over 38 million square feet of office construction in our core market, which is almost 70% pre-leased and underlies the need for more housing.","Turning to the investment markets. Cap rates remain stable, with A quality properties and locations trading in the height 3% to low 4% range, while Bs traded 25 to 35 basis points higher. In this environment, we are looking primarily for A minus to B minus quality communities in markets with the best long-term growth prospects.","Six communities we acquired from our co-investment partner earlier this month are consistent with this strategy. We are pleased to increase our stake in these high-quality communities, while earning a $6.4 million promote from significant value creation from our partners and shareholders.","The majority of our development pipeline will be leasing up in 2020. We have experienced our share of development delays due to a challenging construction labor market. However, we remain pleased with the initial customer response at our development communities and the current leasing pace. We continue to pursue development opportunities, but often see a better risk reward relationship within preferred equity and other structured investments.","That concludes my prepared comments. I'll now turn the call over to John.","John Burkart","Thank you, Mike.","For the full year, we achieved 3.4% year-over-year same-store revenue growth, which was an increase of 60 basis points over the prior year's growth rate. Huge thank you to our E-Team for their outstanding work in improving the customer experience while delivering top results.","Our fourth quarter 2019 results were fantastic, with 4% revenue growth of the prior year's comparable quarter. This was driven by strong market and bolstered by our shift in strategy to increase occupancy in preparation for both the seasonally slower demand period and expected elevated supply in the fourth quarter of 2019 and the first quarter of 2020. This resulted in 30 basis points growth from the increased occupancy. We additionally had 40 basis points growth from other income, which included some one-time items such lease breaks. Overall, our markets continue to show strength, driven by year-over-year job growth, 2.3% in the fourth quarter of 2019, which exceeded our expectations by 40 basis points. Income growth continues to outpace rent growth, improving affordability in our markets.","Turning to 2020. Our guidance of 3.1% revenue growth at the midpoint contemplates rent growth for our portfolio of 3%, consistent with long-term CAGRs in our market and what is outlined on the S-16 in our earnings package. Additionally, we have factored in a slight reduction in occupancy of 10 basis points, as well as the negative impact of rent rollbacks related to the recently passed California assembly bill AB 1482, which is a 10 basis-point headwind for our California communities.","Regarding expenses in 2020, we continue to see pressure on utilities, taxes and wages with offsets in controllable, resulting in our midpoint guidance of 3% for our year-over-year operating expense growth. In terms of supply, the bulk of the new apartment deliveries continues to be in downtown location. We project that 2020 deliveries will be about 65% lower in our suburban sub-markets compared to the downtown urban sub-markets, consistent with 2019. Only 12% of Essex\u2019s portfolio is concentrated in downtown urban sub-markets.","We estimate the demand, supply ratio in our markets, assuming it takes two new jobs to absorb each new home, to be 1.7 times, meaning demand is continuing to exceed supply across our West Coast markets.","Lastly, we continue to drive our vision of optimizing our portfolio\u2019s performance through our strategic tech investments, various platform initiatives, and asset optimization through data science and analytics.","Recently, we implemented a new lead management system in our call center, and plan to roll it out to the communities this year. Also in the pipeline is our plan to upgrade 20,000 units for smart home technology and rollout our mobile maintenance platform 2.0 across the company.","Shifting now to an update on our market. In Seattle, our same store revenues in the fourth quarter were led by Seattle CBD with 5.4% year-over-year growth, while other Seattle sub-markets grew between 4.4% and 5%. On jobs, Seattle remains the strongest major U.S. market for job growth in the fourth quarter, growing 3.3% year-over-year. This growth was mainly due to an additional 32,000 jobs in the top four paying industries, a 57% increase from the prior year. Regarding major tax activity in the market in recent years, Amazon has committed to a sizable footprint of nearly 3 million square feet in Bellevue area while recently putting up 770,000 square feet for sublease in Seattle. Although we are seeing some local geographic movement, several other major tech companies such as Apple, Google and Facebook have recently expanded their footprints in Seattle. As mentioned on a prior call, Apple announced it would expand its Seattle workforce by more than 2,000 employees by 2022, a significant increase from its current census of 450 employees.","Other activity in Seattle includes, Airbnb expanding by 60,000 square feet and Bank of America committing to 116,000 square feet of Amazon sublease. On the other side of Lake Washington in Bellevue, Facebook preleased an additional 325,000 square while of Alibaba expanded their footprint by 50,000 square feet.","Office supply and demand is strong in the market with over 9 million square feet of office space under construction, 79% of which is preleased. Multifamily supply in Seattle was down substantially in the fourth quarter and we expect it to decline about 30% in 2020 from 2019. Combination of strong income and job growth as well as declining supply is leading to tight market rental condition.","Moving to Northern California. Year-over-year same-store revenues in the fourth quarter were led by San Francisco achieving 5.4% growth, followed closely by San Mateo 5.2%, Santa Clara at 4.6% and Alameda at 4%. Job growth from the Bay Area averaged 2.6% year-over-year for the fourth quarter. San Francisco, San Jose and Oakland grew at 3%, 2.9% and 1.8% respectively.","The Bay Area continues to maintain higher job growth in top paying industries compared to the bottom paying industries. Office expansion in the Bay Area remained robust in the fourth quarter. This includes biotech expansion activity, about 540,000 square feet made up of Amgen\u2019s new lease in down town San Francisco and Zymergen\u2019s new lease Emeryville. In the South Bay, Google expanded by over 800,000 square feet adding a new lease Sunnyvale, in addition to acquiring a trio of Cisco buildings in San Jose.","Airbnb grew their South Bay footprint by signing a 300,000 square foot lease in Santa Clara. There is currently over 15 million square feet of office space under construction in the Bay Area, over 70% of which is preleased.","Looking at 2020 multifamily deliveries in the Bay Area, San Francisco deliveries are expected to be slightly higher than in 2019, most of which is concentrated in downtown San Francisco and San Mateo. San Jose is expected to see twice as many deliveries in 2020 than in 2019. And in Oakland supply deliveries will remain elevated in the broader market throughout 2020 with significant supply continuing to be delivered into downtown Oakland, while Fremont will get an influx, half of which will be for sale condo.","Heading further south to Southern California. Year-over-year, same-store L.A. County revenues for the fourth quarter were up 3.5%, led by Woodland Hills with 5.5%, West L.A. with 3.7%, and the Tri-City submarket with 3.7%. The L.A. CBD submarket continues to decline with revenues down 1.6%. L.A. job growth in the fourth quarter was 1.5%, 10 basis points above the U.S. average.","On supply, we estimate consistently high deliveries throughout 2020 in L.A. County. Deliveries in the L.A. CBD submarket are expected to remain high at 4% of stock, but down materially year-over-year. Our West L.A. and Woodland Hills submarkets will see more new supply in 2020.","Moving down to Orange County. Year-over-year fourth quarter revenues were up 4.2% in the South Orange submarket and 3.1% in the North Orange submarket. Total 2020 supply in Orange County and San Diego remain consistent with 2019. However, deliveries in both counties are expected to decelerate through the year.","Lastly, in San Diego, our year-over-year fourth quarter revenues were up 2.8%, led by the Oceanside submarket with 4.9%, followed by Chula Vista with 4% and North City with 3.3%. Job growth for the period was a healthy 2.3% year-over-year, led by professional business services, which made up almost a quarter of the growth. Apple made progress on their plans to grow the footprint in the San Diego market by pre-leasing 200,000 square feet of office space in the Sorrento Valley. Our Q1 renewals have been sent out at about 4.4% and our portfolio is currently at 97.2% physical occupancy with our availability 30 days out at 3.9%.","Thank you. And I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Angela Kleiman.","Angela Kleiman","Thank you, John. I will start by providing some color on our 2020 guidance, followed by an update on capital markets and the balance sheet. The key assumptions for our 2020 guidance are available on page five of our earnings release and S-14 of the supplemental. We're guiding to a midpoint of 3.1% for same-property revenue and NOI growth this year.","Overall, operating fundamentals in our markets remain healthy, as we continue to assume steady market rent growth, near the long-term averages and for our West Coast market to continue to outperform the U.S. average. Compared to 2019, we're expressing a modest acceleration in Seattle and a slight deceleration in California, largely attributed to demand and supply trends commented earlier.","Moving on to the core FFO guidance. We are expecting a growth rate of 4.2% at the midpoint in 2020. As discussed in our previous call, we have a short-term headwind from the repayment of a highly accretive mortgage-backed security, which generated a 17% internal rate of return for Essex shareholders. The lost income from this investment accounts for approximately $0.18 of headwind in 2020 or 1.3% of our 2020 FFO growth, and mostly explains the sequential decline in core FFO between our fourth quarter results and the first quarter forecast.","Our 2020 guidance also includes the recent acquisition of a 45% joint venture partner's interest in a $1 billion portfolio. We expect to recognize a $6.4 million promote from this transaction as well as a remeasurement gain in excess of $225 million, which incorporates small impairments of $18 million recognized in the fourth quarter. This gain and promote will be recognized in the first quarter of 2020 and both are excluded from core FFO.","We remain committed to our co-investment platform as it provides for an alternative source of capital and an attractive risk-adjusted return for investors. Over the past three years, we have generated incremental earnings for our shareholders from promote income totaling approximately $66 million.","Lastly, on capital markets activities. In the fourth quarter, we issued $150 million 10-year unsecured bond at an effective 2.8% interest rate, prepaid several mortgages with 2020 maturities. Consequently, we only have $280 million of maturities to refinance this year. We continue to maintain our discipline to optimize our cost of capital and will remain thoughtful and opportunistic. Our balance sheet metrics remain strong with over $800 million of available liquidity.","That concludes my prepared comments. And I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] First question is from Austin Wurschmidt, KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question. ","Austin Wurschmidt","Hi. Good morning, everyone. With the move to a high occupancy strategy, what are you guys assuming for blended lease rate spreads for 2020? And then, could you also tell us what the spreads look like for the fourth quarter of 2019?","John Burkart","Sure. This is John speaking. So, the -- going forward, what we're looking at in guidance again is 3.1%, and that's really made up of about 1% -- or sorry, 3% rent growth as we have on our S-16, as well as some other income. When you say the blended, it would blend to that. We pretty much do not push our renewals above the market. We keep them consistent with the market, so they really run together. And that keeps it simple and it keeps it focused on the customer experience, which is critically important.","Austin Wurschmidt","And so, what is that blended number versus what it was in '19?","John Burkart","Sure. So, in 2019, all in, obviously our revenue came in at about 4% for the fourth quarter, 3.4% for the year. And that was really about 3.2% scheduled rent, which would be the blended number and the remaining amount relates to other income items.","Austin Wurschmidt","Got it. Thanks for that. And then, just curious what led CPPIB wanting to really dissolve that -- the venture and what opportunity set do you see across those six communities?","Angela Kleiman","Hi. It's Angela here. We have an excellent relationship with our JV partners. And the exit really relates to the timing of the investment. These properties were formed as individual joint ventures, and most of them were formed back around 2010. So, at this point, we're near that 10-year term. And so, it made sense to have a discussion for the exit. And so, going forward, we actually have continued to have active conversations about future opportunities as they come up. But, as you know, we decide to put an asset or investment in joint venture, it's really driven by a function of trying to optimize the cost of capital. So, it depends on where the stock is trading, where the asset sales are coming in, et cetera.","Austin Wurschmidt","Did you consider I guess, selling outright, or was the plan all along really to buy out their interest?","Angela Kleiman","Well, you see that we actually sold one of the assets in joint venture in the fourth quarter as well, and that was Masso. And so, and that was a very attractive sub-4 cap rate sale. And so, we do evaluate whether it makes sense to bring it on this wholly owned, or really what's the best return for our shareholders.","Operator","Our next question is from Alexander Goldfarb, Piper Sandler.","Alexander Goldfarb","So, just following up on Austin's question on the CPPIB. Can you just provide a little bit more color on funding? Was there anything transacted or was it sort of an even trade? And then, two Angela, what the benefit is for 2020? Obviously, you guys are working hard to backfill that CMO. So, just curious how much this played a role in providing an FFO assist for 2020?","Angela Kleiman","Alex, I'll talk about the funding and then Mike will chime in on the overall strategy. On the funding, we use our line of credit to bridge the closing, but our intent is to finance -- refinance with long-term debt. And on the equity portion, now since the portfolio is actually unlevered, we won't need to raise as much equity to be leverage neutral. So, this will allow us to be opportunistic in our equity issuance or we may sell assets depending on market conditions.","Michael Schall","Yes. And Alex, I'll just add real quickly. Keep in mind that we had a promote, which is noted in the press release. And we also have the different tax base than what the tax base would be at market. And therefore, our yield is a little bit higher. And that helps make these transactions attractive to us.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. Maybe I missed it. Did you provide what benefit this is on an FFO?","Angela Kleiman","It's incorporated into our guidance. And so, if you look at our -- we have a line on accretion from external activities. That does include the CPP transaction among others.","Alexander Goldfarb","And then, second question is, Mike, your favorite topic, regulation and taxation. So, with all the fun of Prop 10 2.0, Prop 13 split roll. Maybe you can just address your thoughts on what you guys see the Governor in Sacramento as far as increased taxation, if they do the split roll? And then, how you think the Prop 10 2.0 is shaking out at this point?","Michael Schall","Yes. Alex, I think it's a good question, and it came up very early in the call today, so all good. So, as I probably reported recently or actually last -- late last year, there were 18 bills that were signed by Governor, some dealing with housing. The biggest one was 1482, which is a statewide rent control initiative. Following up on that, there's been some pretty big allocations of funding for housing, $1.75 billion last year and $500 million that has been discussed as part of the \u201820 to 2021 budget. And so, I think that the political environment here is to try to wait and see what happens with these large investments and with 1482 as opposed to go to the ballot box and try to create a whole different scenario with Prop 10 2.0. So, I think that the politics for the matter are the legislature has acted and the state is funding, the housing shortage issue to a pretty substantial extent. And let those things run the course. So, that's what we hope happens. Obviously, Prop 10 2.0, they submitted around 950,000 signatures in December. We're still waiting to see if the ballot qualifies. I'd say that compared to the first go round, obviously, we're early innings. And so, the proposal has not received a great deal of attention at this point in time. And as I go back to think about Prop 10, the early polling was that it would pass. And that was noted obviously throughout the investment community. And it was in fact overwhelmingly defeated in the end. And even though this current proposal is a little bit more palatable to the owners, I still think that it will be difficult to pass. And by that or in support of that, I would suspect that it will be an ongoing discussion, and we will have an entity that will essentially commit to a robust opposition to Prop 10 2.0. And, again, given the outcome of the last go round, I expect it will be successful once again.","Operator","Our next question is from Shirley Wu, Bank of America.","Shirley Wu","So, my first question is for John. So, as you go into this new first half of the year with more downtown supply, and you're really focusing on that occupancy. I just kind of wanted to get this sense of in terms of cadence of that 10 basis points of occupancy headwind, how's that going, how do you anticipate that to play out through \u201820? Is it going to be pretty much an equal spread, or is it going to see more deceleration in the first half first versus the second?","John Burkart","Well, good question. So, let me step back a little bit and explain the occupancy or why we made an adjustment. We take a lot of effort, a lot of effort in understanding supply in the marketplace. And of course, we know from history that seasonally demand slows down in the fourth quarter and first quarter. So, as we ended up the third quarter, we held out as long as possible. And then, we rapidly made some changes to increase occupancy, getting ready for what we saw as a little bit of market disruption and most certainly in Northern California where the supply was going to hit the market during this lower demand period.","As we continue through into the -- in the first quarter now, we're still at good occupancy. And we expect to most likely carry that occupancy, but the reason why we did it is to put ourselves in a position of strength, so we don't have to. So, we if we start to see some isolated pockets of lower pricing, we may hold back and allow a little bit of occupancy to go down a little bit. So, we've positioned ourselves well, remembering, every time we lock in a lease at the beginning of the year, it impacts the entire year of course, 12 months. So, we're really got -- have our position -- ourselves positioned strong. All that said, I expect our occupancy will be higher in Q1, it'll go down in Q2 and Q3 and then pick back up in Q4. Does that answer your question?","Shirley Wu","Yes. That's extremely helpful. For my second question, Angela. So, previously you did mention the earlier redemption, which played out in 4Q. So, I was just kind of curious, is there still that expectation for more deals in your portfolio to be redeemed early or are those mostly done so far? And in terms of pipeline what's in the works to backfill from those deals?","Angela Kleiman","Hey, Shirley, that\u2019s a good question. We do expect heavier redemptions in 2020. And I think you may recall that that we have talked about carefully, investments tend to have a three-year life and sometimes they get extended longer, which is terrific. And so, the redemption timing can be lumpy. So, as for 2020, the redemption outside of the mortgage backed security investment, and so on the preferred equity event, it's about $145 million. And it's -- between the first half and the second half, it's pretty even and maybe a little bit heavier in the second half. And of course, you have -- there's probably somewhere around 110ish. So, that's the cadence. As far as the pipeline, Adam will chime in on that.","Adam Berry","Yes. Shirley, this is Adam. We're pursuing and underwriting several deals in parallel at this point on the pref equity side. These deals inherently have a long lead times, just like any development deal. So, when they actually come to fruition, it can always be an unknown. But, we are pursuing many and have quite a few in the pipeline.","Angela Kleiman","Yes. And Shirley, you may recall, we have a guidance between $50 million to $100 million, so it\u2019s 75 midpoint. So that's a good number too for modeling purposes. And then, the one thing I'll add is really the timing of the funding because they do lag a little bit. And so, you want to layer that consideration.","Operator","Our next question is from Nicholas Joseph, Citi. Please proceed.","Nicholas Joseph","You highlighted the decrease in permit in your markets? But given the current pipeline and the tight construction environment that you talked about, when do you expect the actual benefit from the decline in terms of delivery? ","Michael Schall","Yes. Hey, Nick. It's Mike Schall. I think that when we look at permits, you're looking a few years out, and there is a natural lag there. So, connecting the drop in permits over the last couple of years, I think we're still looking down the road in terms of when that actually comes out. Keep in mind that California, unlike many places around the nation, has a much longer period as you go through the permitting process and delivery process. And I think that's complicated to some extent by the lack of -- or the tight labor markets in construction in terms of getting things finalized and moving ahead. So, I'd say, we're looking beyond 2021 to really see a significant impact.","Nicholas Joseph","Thanks. And then, maybe following up on Shirley's question, and I think in your prepared remarks you talked about continuing to pursue development but seeing better risk adjusted return with preferred equities and the other structured investments. Obviously, you can get a better return from those, but there's a difference in duration and length of investments. So, how do you think about the size of both of those and the stickiness of the cash flows?","Michael Schall","Yes. I'll start big picture. And then, Adam can take it from there. Generally speaking, it's a risk reward equation. And we will do direct development. And I would say more to bottom of the cycle, because conditions at the bottom of the cycle are typically better. And by that, I mean, there's less pressure on construction costs. The cities are more receptive to development because they're trying to keep their construction labor force at work. And so, they're more willing to permit. [Ph] As you go through the cycle, more and more impediments. And I can use a variety of examples for that public artwork projects that are part of your deal, more difficulty in getting the phasing or temporary certificates of occupancy, et cetera. So, the headwinds become more substantial. And so, within the preferred equity, I mean, we\u2019re looking at the same deals we otherwise could do as a direct developer. But, we are looking at that risk reward continuum. And we're saying, all things being equal, let's do acquisitions and preferred equity as opposed to more direct development.","So, having said that, I'll turn it over to Adam, because he has been pretty active at looking at development deals. And it's not that we are -- and actually he's found a couple that he likes. So, we're looking at those. We just try to make good decisions and certainly be aware we are in am cycle, and again, construction cost increases and all the other related factors come into play.","Adam, do you want to add to that?","Adam Berry","Briefly, yes. I mean, we continue to underwrite and track all the land deals throughout our markets. Unfortunately though, given dramatic increases that we're seeing in construction costs relative to where NOI growth has been, we just -- we've been able to see this real time through our prep equity program. Generally speaking, we aren't seeing the necessary yield premium to really pursue the majority of the development deals out there. As Mike mentioned, there are some that fit into that parameter and provide the adequate risk adjusted return, but for the most part deals are tough to pencil right now.","Operator","Our next question is from Steve Sakwa, Evercore ISI.","Steve Sakwa","Just two questions, kind of both Seattle related. You guys spoke pretty positively about job growth out there, the strength that you're seeing. I think, you mentioned supply was going to be coming down. When I look at your 2020 outlook, you've only got at the midpoint about a 20 basis-point acceleration in revenue growth in Seattle. I'm just wondering, the commentary would suggest maybe the market is a bit stronger than that. So, I'm just trying to figure out -- are you just trying to be a little cautious here? Is there something that keeps you more or less flattish, or how do we sort of interpret that?","Michael Schall","Sure. That's a fair question. And at this point in time, you're right, Seattle is doing really terrific. Its rents are roughly 5% up year-over-year. At the same time, the unemployment is very low. It's 1.7% in that zone. So, we do expect the employment growth rate to slow down, and that's partly driving it. We are showing in our S-16, employment slowing down pretty significantly across the board, still staying 50 basis points over the U.S. over the U.S. average for the Essex portfolio, but slowing down because of the low unemployment. And Seattle has the lowest unemployment of all the areas. So, that's the scenario that we have out there. At this point in time, obviously employment is beating that expectation, and we'd love to see that continue.","Steve Sakwa","Okay. And then, I guess as kind of the other side on the expenses, clearly, you had very low expense growth in Seattle. I know there were some kind of tax benefits, real estate tax benefits you got. Can you just sort of remind us of the aggregate benefit in 2019 from that that kind of acts as maybe a headwind on the expense side in 2020?","Angela Kleiman","Sure. It's a good question there. On the Seattle property tax, it was an interesting year in 2019, in that our property tax bill actually came in lower than 2018, and it was all driven by assessment bills. And so, what that means is definitely from a year-over-year perspective, we have challenges on the comp. In terms of how we think about Seattle property tax, because it's not -- it\u2019s one of those things -- those numbers are just not as [indiscernible]. So, in 2019 it was 3% lower than the prior year from the assessment. But the five years before that those increases were in between 13% to 17%. So, in 2020, what we try to do is kind of thread the needle and looking at like a base run rate of 6% and then you add into it the refunds. We're looking at kind of low single digits, the 8, 9% for Seattle property tax increase. ","Operator","Our next question is from Neil Malkin, Capital One Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Neil Malkin","Hey. Thanks, guys. I'm not sure if you answered Austin\u2019s question in the beginning in terms of the new and renewals that you had in 4Q. But just curious as what you're kind of seeing in January for new and renewals, and what occupancy stands at for the portfolio today.","Michael Schall","Yes, sure. So, let me go back to make sure I answer that. I may have missed that. So, in the fourth quarter, new rents were about 2.2%, renewals were about 3.5%. And really, the bigger difference was in Northern Cal where the supply was coming into the market. Going forward, in the first quarter, I'll answer a question on renewals, they went out at about 4.4%. Today market rents are a 2% to 3% up year-over-year. And that's really a factor of where the slow demand period. So again, it always is a little bit of wonky in December and January. We expect us to -- we expect to achieve the market rents we have laid out in our S-16. And of course the strongest market as I already mentioned is Seattle.","Neil Malkin","Right. And then, what\u2019s occupancy?","Michael Schall","Occupancy is 97.2.","Neil Malkin","Okay, great. And then, next one, preferred investments obviously you've highlighted is what you guys are choosing to do in terms of capital allocation. Just curious on either the current book or the ones you're underwriting, is there an option, are you trying to get options to actually roll your preferred into equity or essentially take ownership of those deals when they complete, or is the financing market just too easy for the developer to sort of get permanent financing?","Adam Berry","So, this is Adam. We look at it several ways. I'd say the most basic kind of down the middle of the fairway, pref deal is going to be paid off after a certain period of time, whether it be two, three years. We do however -- with every deal, we have that conversation where there are potential hybrids, where there is that potential to convert into equity. And it is on a deal by deal basis. And we're seeing probably a little more of that opportunity now given where we are in the cycle.","Operator","Our next question is from Rich Anderson, SMBC. Please proceed with your question. ","Rich Anderson","So, on the MAA call this morning, they kind of outlined a sort of a silver lining in the supply that the rents are 25% above their in place rents. And so, it's an opportunity for them to deploy some redevelopments on. And so, a little bit of a good and a bad situation. Do you see a similar dynamic in your markets, considering you also are sort of B, B plus type of product? Is the incoming new supply, while problematic, provides some opportunities for you to redevelop and sort of find that middle ground between what's being delivered and where your market - where your rents are today?","Michael Schall","Yes, Rich. It's a good question. And I'll start and lateral to John after that. I guess, from our perspective, you can't produce a B. So, there -- and therefore all the supply is in the A category. So, the closer you are to the A, the more impacted you are by the concession environments and the new delivery. So, in addition to that, you have this -- where's the supply going, which tends to be more urban downtown as opposed to suburban. So, all of these things are factored into that equation. And I think that we are seeing the best opportunities to redevelopment -- to redevelop in the suburban B markets. And so, I would suspect that that will continue. John, anything I missed there?","John Burkart","Yes. No, I think you picked it up.","Rich Anderson","Great. And then, second question, perhaps for anyone. But, any comment on Park Merced? I know you know were gathering that years ago and not this time with AIMCO jumping in. I\u2019m curious if you took a hard look at it, soft look at it, not looked at it at all? Anything, any kind of color would be interesting.","Michael Schall","Yes, Rich. This is Mike again. It was pretty broadly marketed. And so it wasn't as if that was acquired deal. It was marketed around. And when I think about our preferred equity business, we think about really two things. One is, development deals where we're coming in at the last minute, just before start -- just before the start, so we know what the construction costs are. So, we are trying to take that construction cost risk off the table in those deals. And then, we also will do preferred equity on stabilized portfolio, which actually was the first go round that we had with Park Merced when we - as you alluded to, we had invested in it once before at a much lower value by the way. And so, this transaction is neither of those, because it is looking at the development deals and trying to assess how they might look. And so, it didn't really fit our basic strategy. And, we will from time to time deviate a little bit from our strategy, if we really see a lot of value. But, we just didn't think that was applicable or appropriate this time.","Rich Anderson","Okay. Sounds good. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from John Kim, BMO Capital Markets.","John Kim","I was wondering on the CPP portfolio, if you could provide some color on where the assets are located? Do they contribute immediately to the same-store pool? Or will it be 24 months from now? And also, how do you think the performance of this portfolio will be on a same-store basis relative to your existing consolidated assets?","Michael Schall","John, so as Angela mentioned, we sold Masso in Q4. So that was in Downtown San Francisco. And so -- and Angela, why don't you take it from here?","Angela Kleiman","Yes. And the rest of the portfolio, it's all throughout Northern California. So we have one in San Mateo, one in Dublin, one in Pleasanton so in the East Bay, and San Jose, and of course, Walnut Creek. So those are the locations, but it's all Northern California. And as you know, we built these and have operated them. So we know the assets very well and certainly like them very much and glad to have all of them into our consolidated portfolio. They will be in the same store next year because, as you may recall, we roll them in, and we'll have one year of comparable results before we add them to the same-store pool.","John Kim","Okay. And can you just remind us why the co-investments generally are accounted for under the equity method when you own, in many cases, 50% or more of the joint venture?","Angela Kleiman","Yes. It's an off-balance sheet because of the control reasons. Our partners have essentially comparable approval authorities on basic items like budgets and financing, and so it's really a technical reason.","John Kim","So is there anything different in asset management that you're going to do as you take these assets under your control?","John Burkart","Yes. This is John speaking. No, not at all, the operationally, asset management-wise, we operate all of our assets consistent -- in the consistent way. Our partnerships, we have great relationships, and we don't have an Essex way and then the other way. It's, I call it, the family, it's all one way. We operate in an integrated approach across the board. So there won't be changes there. We do like the locations of the assets quite a bit. They're in the technology markets that are growing, and we're excited about that. But there's not a change like -- would happen when we're buying an asset from a third party.","Operator","Our next question is from Rich Hill, Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Rich Hill","Hey, guys, Mike, maybe I'll start with you. Just wanted to think about the age of your portfolio and sort of the age of your assets within your portfolio? And how that influences your capital allocation decisions to maybe buy some assets and sell others?","Michael Schall","Sure, Rich. Yes, our portfolio, as you note, is a little bit older than other portfolios, and I would attribute most of that to the fact that we produce less than 1% of our stock, of our housing stock per year. And therefore, as you can imagine, over 20 years, you produced less than 20% of your stock, and therefore, 80% of your portfolio is more than 20 years old. So just a fact of life, and we think that this is a very good thing that we don't produce a lot of housing in general.","And so I think it's just -- that is the nature of our markets, and we are a reflection of our markets. In terms of opportunity, again, I would say, you can't build a B. And therefore, you see less competition. And so I'd say, generally speaking, at the early part of the cycle, maybe the As outperform the Bs, synergy up later on in the cycle, the Bs outperform the A, so all of those broader themes are out there.","And then I would also say that as the A product becomes more luxury oriented, it opens the door toward very thoughtful redevelopment programs where we can add value. And add a yield that is higher than the cap rate and benefit both from the growth embedded in the redevelopment program and the increase in the value of the portfolio when you cap it out. So it's kind of all those things.","Rich Hill","Got it. That's helpful, Mike. John, quick question for you. Look, we definitely agree that there's not enough supply of apartments relative to demand, sort of, picking back up for what Mike said. And so look, I think a lot of the questions on this call have been about supply, which is obviously a near-term consideration. But we've always thought demand and job growth is a big long-term driver over the medium to long term. So I was wondering if you could just maybe take a step back and help us think about what are you looking for in your West Coast markets where demand could accelerate to the upside? And maybe what makes you -- would leave you a little bit more cautious?","Angela Kleiman","Sure. What we see right now is, as I mentioned, we have great demand in the Seattle area. And that combination with the great demand and the decline in supply is tightening up the rental market quite a bit, that's terrific. As it relates to cautious, it gets back to just the temporary impact, the disruptive impact of the supply entering the market. And that, again, is largely located around the downtown locations.","There's some level of that certainly in L.A., although L.A. is getting a little bit better, a little bit less supply than last year, still downtown L.A. is problematic. Oakland to some extent, but of course, Oakland is -- you have to understand Oakland. It fits into the broader Bay Area. And so whereas L.A., downtown L.A., sits there in its own market.","Oakland is really interrelated to San Francisco because people take BART across. So you have to look at the demand in a broader area there. But it's the supply that causes some concern, and it's temporary as you noted. Does that answer your question?","Rich Hill","Yes. Yes, yes, it does. It sounds like what you're saying is that the demand side of the equation remains very, very strong. And although, tech is diversifying across the United States, tech remains very strong and the economies you operate in are quite diverse.","John Burkart","That's true. And I would say with the tech, it is -- it does -- it is going across the U.S., but the headquarters are still here and the highest paying jobs are still here. So it's -- they're doing a natural thing as far as taking more of the back office and moving that out and then taking other components of the business, but the creative design, the top-notch aspect of the tech, really still located in West Coast. You find that in each of the different companies that are out here, the major companies. And so it's that and the incomes that are tied to that, which really drives income growth, and that is certainly beneficial.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from John Guinee, Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","John Guinee","Great. Just building on the current discussion, the great affordability migration is alive and well, and although you have a really good property tax-driven competitive advantage in your markets and with an ability to really grow outsized FFO. Any chance you would ever look at the higher-growth markets, whether it's Denver, Phoenix, Austin, Portland, places like that?","Michael Schall","John, its Mike. Well, we've been in Portland before and exited Portland and we do look at it from time to time. It's definitely on our list. Portland, the reason why we exited is because they had an urban growth boundary that they essentially kept expanding, and we convinced ourselves it was not supply constrained. So I guess it depends on what housing and how these markets adjust. So in our experience, it's not just the apartment supply, but relatively inexpensive single-family housing meant that essentially as soon as rents get to a certain level, people go, you know what, I don't need to pay this rent anymore. I'll just go and buy a house.","And so we look at that dynamic of what we charge for rent and what the comparable house and how difficult it is for our renter base to be diluted by homeownership. And so if we could find markets that satisfy and that look appealing from both those perspectives, good job growth and the overall amount of supply is somewhat limited and the transition from a renter to a homeowner is somewhat limited.","We think that, that is a good market. Practically speaking, and we go through this process with our Board every year in terms of current markets and other possible markets. So Portland is definitely on that list. And there are some other markets that are on the list as well. Generally speaking, they are the more supply constrained markets.","Operator","Our next question is from Hardik Goel, Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question.","Hardik Goel","As I look at your guidance, your same-store revenue guidance, just focusing on Northern California. That range of 2.6% to [3.6%]. Can you give me some color around what has to happen in the market for 2.6% to be achieved? And then what has to happen for 3.6% to be achieved? What are the scenarios there?","John Burkart","Well, it really revolves around supply of new homes and then demand and that interaction. The -- we obviously believe we're going to hit the midpoint, that is the probable target. But the impact, the disruptive impact of supply coming into the market in Q1 could negatively impact things.","Again, at that point, you're locking in rents, lower rents possibly, for a longer period of time for the year. On the other side, if supply gets delayed and it moves into the higher demand season, Q2, Q3, that's beneficial. So it's a range we expect to hit the midpoint. We knew there's enough supply\\\/demand dynamics going into this. But if they move around a little bit on us, that will adjust that. Does that make sense?","Hardik Goel","No, it does. And just as a quick follow-up, I noticed you guys are going to be planning on being net acquirers and you discussed why with your cost of capital. Just the type of product you're looking to buy, is it going to be more of selling older stuff that others see us value-added and buying recently built stuff? What is kind of the niche there that you're targeting?","Adam Berry","Okay. So on the dispo side, this is Adam. On the dispo side, we're going to target the assets that have been slower growing within the portfolio in order to maximize our overall portfolio growth. On the acquisition side -- on the disposition side, our target is between $100 million and $300 million. As you noted, we expect to be net acquirers this year.","And again, we're looking at just increasing shareholder return overall. So we're going to be looking at our higher growth markets. And as Mike alluded to earlier in the call, we're going to be looking at that probably A- to B category, the brand-new stuff, as we've seen over the last few years, given whereabout the supply is coming, that product has not grown nearly as well as the Bs.","Hardik Goel","Got it. And then are there plans to renovate something when you buy it? Or is this something you like to look for something that's already -- that doesn't need any incremental capital?","Michael Schall","Yes. This is Mike. Yes, we do just about everything. So if it needs a renovation plan, we will build that into the pro forma. And if it's in good quality shape, we will look at that as well. I mean we're really sort of agnostic as to where the property is from, again, that, let's say, the B- to A level, it's all about growth as Adam suggested.","And if that growth comes from redevelopment, we're happy with that. If it comes from us understanding the market and growth rate a little bit better than everyone else, so be it. Again, we're totally focused on what is the return of what we're buying versus -- compared to the portfolio as a whole. And that's how we make those decisions.","Operator","Our next question is from John Pawlowski, Green Street Advisors. Please proceed with your question.","John Pawlowski","Thanks. Just one question for me. John, you mentioned there is a 40 bps lift to other income this quarter, largely due to lease break fees. It's a lot larger than the last several years in the fourth quarter. So just curious, what's driving the outsized lease break fees right now?","John Burkart","Yes. Lease break was one component, it's the biggest component and I called that out. There was other items as well. But yes, what was driving the lease breaks really relates to the supply that was coming into the market in Q4. And again, that goes back to our decision as we saw that the supply was going to start hitting the market, and we filled up or increased occupancy.","We did anticipate this type of thing to happen. But you go into the low demand period. The concessions start to increase at the new supply, and you get to about eight weeks free in some cases, and people will break their lease and transfer. So that's what was driving it.","Michael Schall","Actually, John, I can add that the move out to purchased homes was -- has recovered a lot and was at 12.1% in Q4, a little bit higher than it's been in the recent past.","Operator","Our next question is from Rob Stevenson, Janney. Please proceed with your question.","Rob Stevenson","Good afternoon. Mike, does the continued legislative environment and ballot initiatives in California make condo projects any more attractive in certain submarkets? And any chance we see some of the under-construction apartment projects go condo before leasing?","Michael Schall","Yes. And that is a good question. One of the conundrums that we've experienced over the last several years, as we bought many failed condo buildings in the last cycle, and we had hoped to convert them back to condos and sell them at a lower cap rate than we could otherwise sell apartments. We have not found that that's the case at all.","In fact, if anything has gone the other way, we've produced more rental housing, much more rental housing than we have for sale housing, and that's been an ongoing dynamic. So we haven't seen that spread that we had hoped for in purchasing a condo versus an apartment value, and which of course is what triggers tha",". And with the recent past increases in the price of the single-family home being in the minus 3, I think in San Jose to about 1% in the best of our locations. It hasn't helped that condo versus apartment valuation.","Rob Stevenson","Okay. And then I think I heard you guys say that the negative impact of 1482 is 10 basis points in 2020. Given your supply issue commentary, do you guys really have that many units where you'd be raising rents by more than 5% plus inflation this year if you could?","John Burkart","Yes. So we are -- this is John. Where that negative impact comes, it hits the revenue. It really relates to short-term rentals and the premium associated with that. And so oftentimes, at the end of a lease, we will always give our customers the options they want. And on the short -- if they want a shorter-term option, there's a premium related to that, and 1482 restricts that premium, and so that's where the 10 basis point headwind comes from.","Rob Stevenson","Okay. And does 1482 restrict fees for like parking and other stuff? And is it based on gross or net effective rents. In other words, most of the apartment REITs are operating on an effective rent basis, does 1482 lead you to offer a higher face rent and then use concessions to get to essentially a market rate level? Or does the legislation see through that game?","Angela Kleiman","That's a great question. And like a lot of legislation, things aren't always spelled out as much as we would all like. So that's not necessarily contemplated in the legislation. My sense is that it will get addressed in the courts. But it's really focused on rental revenue and not other revenue. But as far as the details of that, I think it will get resolved somewhere in the future.","Rob Stevenson","Okay. And so there's no clarification right now whether or not it applies the face rents or net effective?","Michael Schall","We interpret it as being applied to face rents.","Rob Stevenson","Okay. So if a unit was renting -- if market rent was $1,000 for 12 months, you guys could theoretically raise that rent to 1,200 and offer two months free, and be in the same place economically and have ability to have more greater rent growth in the 5% plus inflation by just discounting less?","Michael Schall","Yes. I mean, first, let's go back a step. So the 1482 really impacts renewals, right? When a unit goes vacant, it's the market rent. So at the end of the lease period, we typically and the residents typically respond to direct renewal. There's not generally concessions in there. And we are not anticipating going that direction.","Rob Stevenson","Okay. Just curious, given your sub-50% turnover, and it keeps heading south every year, whether or not you get into a situation where you actually are going to need at some point greater turnover.","Michael Schall","Yes. No, I mean, frankly, I love the fact that we have lower turnover. I think it's reflective of quality of service out of the assets as well as being fair. We meet the market. We're not trying to push rents beyond the market. We're fair in how we price things. And again, I think that the site teams are doing a terrific job. So I think the lower turnover is reflective of that. I'm not sure it's going to go much lower than that. It -- there's a natural need for people to move.","Operator","We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Michael Schall for closing comments.","Michael Schall","Thank you, operator. I want to thank everyone for joining the call today and look forward to seeing many of you at the upcoming Citibank Conference. Have a good day. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs, as well as information available to the company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found in the company's filings with the SEC.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you. Mr. Schall, you may now begin.","Michael J. Schall","Thank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to our second quarter 2012 earnings call. Erik Alexander and Mike Dance will follow me with brief comments on operations and finance, respectively; John Eudy and John Lopez are here for Q&A.","I'll cover the following 3 topics on the call: number one, Q2 results and market commentary; second, the investment market; and third, an update on California, California itself and the policies and political situation.","First topic, Q2 results and market commentary. Last evening, we reported core FFO of $1.66 per share for the second quarter of 2012, which was at the high end of the company's guidance range discussed on last quarter's call. We continue to see strong growth in Northern California and Seattle and an uneven recovery with pockets of strength in Southern California. Apartment conditions remain strong, demonstrated by same-store revenue and NOI growth of 6.3% and 9.2%, respectively. These results lead us to reiterate our expectation for a strong second half of 2012 and continuing into 2013, driven by limited supplies of housing and job growth that exceeds the national averages in Northern California and Seattle and is modestly below the national average in Southern California. We don't see a significant departure from this basic theme until at least 2014. Erik will discuss portfolio trends in greater detail.","Our research team tracks many of the major employers in our coastal markets for insights into hiring expectations and other trends that can affect apartments. While job growth has remained quite strong, there are several companies, including Hewlett-Packard, Yahoo! and Cisco, that have reported job reductions, along with restructuring programs. Still, other tech companies have missed analyst expectations and have reported slower earnings growth.","We view these announcements as typical and necessary for technology companies. Tech companies of all sizes are forced to innovate or fail, as timely product R&D, product updates and similar advancements are necessary to survive. When innovation fails, companies are quickly forced into a restructuring mode, and layoffs are a common result. Our expectation is that a relatively small number of tech companies will be in a restructuring mode nearly all the time.","Despite the concerns noted above, current trends support continued job growth in technology. In Silicon Valley, for example, year-over-year job growth accelerated from 2.9% in 2011 to 3.8% in June 2012, with no slowdown in Q2. And the labor force grew by over 2.5%.","Commercial activity continues to be positive and steady, and many large-scale commercial real estate projects have been started. We provide our annual job growth estimates that are part of our market forecast on Page S-16 of the supplement. This quarter, we increased our estimated job growth for 2012 in Northern California from 1.9% to 2.4%, and in Seattle from 2.0% to 2.4%.","Our primary economic concerns relate to the ongoing uncertainty within the broader business environment, including the effects of public sector indebtedness, the potential impacts of the fiscal cliff and global financial issues. These issues threaten to derail the fragile U.S. recovery. We believe that these issues are best addressed by a strong balance sheet and a conservative capital structure.","In development, we announced new apartment projects containing 971 apartment homes with an estimated total cost of $422 million. This brings our development pipeline outlined on Page S-9 of the supplement to almost $1 billion. I'm very pleased with the performance of our development team led by John Eudy, as the locations, designs and expected financial benefits from our apartment development activities are exceptional.","As suggested on previous calls, most of our development transactions will be in a co-investment format, in which we own from 50% to 55%. We believe that the co-investment format improves our risk reward scenario and also reduces our forward funding commitments. We've commenced construction on most of our development pipeline, reducing risks of entitlement and construction costs, increases in delays and compressing the time between our funding obligation and the delivery of the community.","We also moved up the opening of our Expo project to this October, approximately 6 months ahead of our original schedule, and reduced the estimated cost of construction by approximately $3 million. We now estimate that the stabilized cap rate on Expo will be in excess of 7%.","Second topic, the investment markets. Cap rates continue to be aggressive in the coastal markets, and we have not -- and have not changed materially since last quarter. Cap rates range from 4% to 4.5% for A quality property in A locations and from 4.5% to near 5% for B property in A locations. As with 2011, transaction activity abated at year-end and increases throughout the spring and summer months. Through July, we closed $248 million in acquisitions, including the partner buyout at Skyline as outlined on Page S-15 of the supplement.","We also have a very active pipeline of potential acquisitions that are under consideration, which makes us believe that acquisitions may exceed $500 million for 2012 versus our $400 million guidance. In fast-moving markets, we have an information advantage, given our economic research and historical data from our own portfolio. We continue to find value in acquisitions through redevelopment, anticipating market trends and value-added situations.","Development deals on the West -- development deals on the West Coast, underwritten base on today's rent, generate development cap rates ranging from 5% to 5.5% or estimated to be 6.25% to 7% upon stabilization.","Third topic is State of California. We remain concerned about the well-publicized fiscal issues in California, both at the state and local levels. At the state level, Governor Brown announced in May that the projected deficit has increased from approximately $9 billion to $16 billion. Governor Brown also warned that severe cuts to schools and public services would occur if the voters do not pass a tax increase proposal that he endorses.","Under the plan, California would temporarily raise state sales tax by 0.25% and increase income tax on people that earn more than $250,000. Governor Brown has estimated that the tax initiative could raise up to $9 billion. Notably, the plan does not change Prop. 13. Given this situation, we continue to assume that government jobs will continue to be reduced as reflected in our market forecast.","We are also concerned about growing political interest in pursuing rent control ordinances in various California cities. With rents increasing at double-digit rates in many parts of Northern California during 2011, 2012, obviously, many residents are being priced out of the local markets. This coincides with more complaints from residents and growing opposition and greater exposure to negative publicity from electronic media. I have commented before that we have provided residents with at least 1 renewal option that limits the rent increase to no more than 15%.","Beginning in September, we'll reduce this renewal limitation to 10%. We believe that this will have a nominal impact on our financial results, as lower renewal rents will be partially offset by lower turnover costs, increased occupancy and increased rental rates for new leases. It will also be beneficial to our residents, which will hopefully -- who will hopefully differentiate Essex from many other landlords that impose no such limit. I believe strongly that the industry needs to impose thoughtful self-restraint with respect to renewal policy.","That concludes my comments. Thank you for joining us. I'd like to now turn the call over to Erik Alexander.","Erik J. Alexander","Thank you, Mike. As always, it's a pleasure to be here. I'm happy to report on another solid quarter of operations for Essex.","So following the strong first quarter we executed the plan that we discussed on our last call, by trading some occupancy for rent growth in order to achieve the desired revenue gains. We actually only shed 70 basis points of occupancy during the quarter compared to the estimated 90 basis points, of which about half of that decline is attributable to increased renovation activities.","As with the first quarter, demand in all of our markets remained strong, including improvement in San Diego. As expected, we experienced seasonally higher turnover during the second quarter, but our annualized rate of turnover through the first half of the year is only 50%. We still expect this ratio to be in the low 50% range for the full year.","Although move-outs due to home purchases and rent increases were higher this quarter compared to the first quarter, both reasons for move-out are well within historical ranges. Less than 12% of residents moving out during the second quarter stated that they were doing so to purchase a house or condominium. This compares to 11% of responses received last quarter and 10% of move-outs during the second quarter of 2011. You may recall that this figure was north of 12% as recently as the second quarter of 2010 and as high as 18% in 2007.","During the quarter, about 18% of residents moving out cited some kind of affordability issue as the primary motivation for giving us notice to vacate, including their most recent rent increase. This compares to 15% of all residents moving out last quarter and 15% in the second quarter of last year.","The primary reason people give for leaving one of our communities remains moving out of the area and\/or job change, with 25% of existing residents claiming 1 of these 2 factors. The bottom line is that so many qualified customers are coming in the front door where you have to be concerned about the pattern of move-out activity impacting our ability to grow revenues in our markets.","Furthermore, new multifamily housing supply remained very low and largely concentrated in a few areas of the portfolio. These favorable supply conditions will allow Essex to grow rents at or beyond expectations in the coming quarters. Therefore, as long as job growth continues to meet or exceed expectations, we continue to believe that the fundamentals in our West Coast markets will help us deliver solid revenue growth into 2014.","I think the rental rate growth that we continue to experience throughout the portfolio helps support that claim. During the quarter, we completed more than 3,400 new lease transactions and signed nearly 4,300 renewals. Portfolio-wide, renewal rates for the period were up 5.4% and were steady throughout the quarter. However, new lease rates continue to grow each month during the quarter and were 7.6% higher than expiring rates for the period and 8.5% better in July. Renewals recorded during July were 5.2% better than the expiring rental rates, with the expectations for August about the same.","We are not concerned about a deceleration of rental rates. The fact is that we continue to see healthy rent growth throughout the portfolio and is merely being achieved in a different manner. I would note that the average expiring rate for those July renewals was $60 higher than the average expiring rate on renewed leases during the second quarter.","Looking ahead, renewal offers for September and October average over 6% portfolio-wide, with a range of 3% to 5% in Southern California and 6% to 8% in Seattle and the Bay Area. At the end of July, our loss to lease for the portfolio was 5.1%.","Turning our attention to new lease-up activities. We stabilized the Reveal asset during the quarter and are successfully renewing existing residents. Last month, we also began our pre-leasing activities at Expo in the Queen Anne section of downtown Seattle. As Mike commented, this development is tracking 6 months ahead of schedule, and we now expect to move our first residents in October.","During the first couple of weeks of our soft opening, we've managed 16 net rentals despite not having access to the building. We expect to be conducting limited tours later this month so that we can take advantage of the persistent strong demand in Seattle. I'll provide more details about the project on our next call.","Operating expenses continued to be under control with the second quarter same-store results, up less than 1% compared to last year and flat for the first half of 2012. Repairs, maintenance, administration and utilities all remained lower compared to the first half of 2011. Even with higher budgeted turnover costs related to volume, these little increases in repairs and maintenance and possible property tax adjustments related to California's Proposition 18 -- sorry, Proposition 8, we now expect total operating expenses not to increase by more than 2% for the entire year.","Now I'll share some highlights to each of the regions beginning with Seattle. Year-to-date, Essex market rents were up 9.4% compared with 2011. The region as a whole is above the prior peak, and Seattle downtown in the East side remained the strongest submarket. As of July 30, occupancy was 96.2%, with a 30-day net availability of 6%. The jobs picture in the region continues to be strong, with unemployment falling to 7.2%. We have again raised our jobs forecast for the Seattle MSA and now expect 34,000 new jobs to be added in 2012 or a 2.4% growth. Tech and business services continue to lead the way for the region.","The future outlook remains bright, as office leasing continues to be very strong as well. Another 850,000 square feet were absorbed during the quarter. Additionally, there is 1.2 million square feet of office space under construction, most of which is pre-leased.","One of the more important factors that we see changing amidst the strong economic growth during the past 6 quarters is that we now expect rent-to-income levels to increase above the long-range average of 17%. Although still below that level today, development in Seattle is much more infill in nature, with barriers to supplier higher than in the past, home prices are rising and the region continues to evolve into a high-wage and tech-oriented economy. Therefore, the rent-to-income level will be able to push up to the 20% range like other established metros in the U.S.","In Northern California, Essex market rents are up 8.1% year-over-year and 8.6% year-to-date. As of July 30, occupancy for the region was 97%, with a 30-day net availability of just 4.4%. Job growth in the Silicon Valley has been well-publicized, and similar to Seattle, this economy has outpaced our initial expectations. Led by technology expansion, we have revised our regional forecast up to 2.4% for the year. Despite the impressive job creation over the past 2 years, unemployment is falling but still above the national average and currently stands at 8.6% for the region. We view this as an indication that there's still room to grow in the Bay Area.","Supply expectations for the year remain unchanged, but as the first projects in San Jose are being delivered, we're very pleased with the brisk leasing velocity being reported by others in the market. And as expected, these new offerings have not adversely affected our stabilized properties in the area.","Looking to Southern California, the jobs picture remains a keen interest point as we all look for signs of growth, strength and sustainability in the region. Year-to-date, growth of the entire region is significantly better than last year, with June's year-over-year growth improving 1.7%. Specifically, Los Angeles is helping the cause, with growth in the private sector posting a 1.5% gain year-over-year. So despite losses in government jobs, we now see employment in Los Angeles growing by more than 1% in 2012. We recognize that we still need 350,000 jobs in Southern California to return to 2008 employment levels, but we are definitely headed in the right direction and I think have good reason to be optimistic about this market in the coming quarters.","Office-based absorption for Southern California was positive for the fourth quarter in a row, and 1.7 million square feet was absorbed during the period. This represents the strongest commercial leasing quarter since the recession. There have not been any significant developments with the military since our last call, and we still expect troop rotations to be net positive for San Diego in 2012. Our exposure to military residents in San Diego stands at 14%.","As of the end of July, occupancy for Southern California was 96%, and the 30-day net availability was 5.3%. Market rates are up nearly 4% in Southern California since the beginning of the year and have now reached levels equal to their prior peaks.","All that translates to a slow and steady revenue growth, with noted strength in Downtown Los Angeles, the Wilshire Corridor in the West side. San Diego and Ventura are largely performing to expectations, but one area that has posted inspiring results for us is Orange County. Increased renovation activities have muted the results some, along with a few properties transitioning from concession-aided pricing last year to net effect of pricing this year. However, given the above average job growth for the County and low supply, we expect all properties in Orange County to realize improved rent growth in the coming quarters.","So with more than half of the year in the books, we continue to be pleased with our overall results and think that we have positioned the portfolio well to maintain healthy revenue and NOI growth for the balance of 2012 and achieve our revised guidance.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike Dance.","Michael T. Dance","Thanks, Erik. Today, I will provide brief commentary on our recent balance sheet activities and an update on our 2012 guidance.","During the quarter, we prepay $138 million of secured mortgage debt on 8 properties, with proceeds from our private placement note offering announced earlier this year. We recorded $1.5 million of prepayment penalties during the second quarter and expect to record up to $1 million of additional prepayment penalties in the third quarter from a repayment of additional secured debt with the proceeds from the last tranche of our unsecured notes offering.","We also expanded the capacity on our 5-year bank term loan by $150 million to $350 million and reduced the spread to 130 basis points over LIBOR. We entered into a $100 million of swap contracts to lock in an effective fixed interest rate for 5 years of 2.2%. With the prepayment of secured debt obligations, we have approximately 50% of the portfolio's net operating income generated from assets that are now unencumbered.","This quarter's capital market activities reduce our cost of capital and our variable interest rate exposure, extend our debt maturities and strengthen our balance sheet so that we are now in a position to access the public debt market.","Now turning to guidance. Our second quarter funds from operations results exceeded the guidance we provided on the first quarter call by $0.02 per diluted share, with better-than-expected net operating income results from our balance sheet portfolio and the co-investment activities, leading to the increase in the midpoint of our guidance of $0.05 per diluted share.","Our same-property net operating income for the first 6 months is up 10.2% over the 6 months results ending in 2011. The new guidance for 2012 forecast net operating income increasing in a range of 8.5% to 9.5% for the entire year. The new guidance range includes an estimate for increases in property taxes of up to $400,000 per quarter, starting in the third quarter.","Our second half forecast also assumes we continue to increase our renovation program to include over 700 apartment units before year-end, increasing the rehab-related vacancy by approximately $750,000 over the same period in 2011. The benefits from our renovation program will be reflected in better 2013 results.","I will close my remarks with some numbers that underscore our sequential growth. The sequential same-property average rents actually increased 1.7% in the second quarter, with average rents increasing from $1,439 per month in the March quarter to $1,464 per month in the June quarter. This compares to the 1% sequential growth in average rental rates achieved in the first quarter.","Based on the July 2012 preliminary results of over $1,560 per month on over 2,600 new and renewal lease transactions, we are not seeing any slowing in sequential average rental rates.","This ends my comments, and I'll now turn the call back to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Eric Wolfe of Citi.","Eric Wolfe - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","You mentioned this in your remarks, but you moved up the stabilization date on a couple of development projects. Just wondering whether that reflects a more optimistic view on your markets, in general, being able to sort of absorb supply faster, if it's something particular to those particular assets.","Michael J. Schall","Eric, it's Mike Schall. I think we just moved up this time the Expo deal, and I think it's more related to the construction labor pool. I don't -- we're not moving up the stabilization. We're moving up the date that the building is available for occupancy. And as you all know, the quality of the labor pool increases when there's not a lot going on in the development world, and so I think it's just, overall, we're able to build things faster and better and get better contractors and better subs, which ultimately leads to a faster construction period. And John Eudy is here, he probably can answer that better than I did. John, [indiscernible]?","John D. Eudy","Expo, that's pretty much it, Mike. The only other difference is we had a really light winter last year in Seattle, so we picked up probably 2.5 to 3 months just because it didn't rain until February, March, to any degree.","Michael J. Schall","I think the basic comment still -- well, also holds true to other development deals because the quality of the construction and labor force is very good, I think, right now, right?","John D. Eudy","Yes, on everything we have under contract.","Eric Wolfe - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. Yes, I mean, I was just looking at the stabilized operations data and comparing with last quarter's supplemental, but I'm probably just reading a little wrong or something. You talked about the initial and stabilized yields you're seeing on development as well. I think you said 5% to 5.5% on initial, 6.5% to 7% maybe on stabilized. Just curious, what sort of value creation that implies relative to where you could acquire assets today. And if you think about that spread there, how that compares to the typical value creation that you've been able to achieve over time.","Michael J. Schall","Yes, it's a good question. The reality is, we can do both though, right? We can build and we can buy. We can find opportunities to, on a risk-adjusted basis, contribute meaningfully to the portfolio. And so we're pursuing both aggressively. I would say, in the development side, I think I reported last quarter that our cap rate, based on today's rents as of March 31, just mark-to-market, the cap rates, they were around 6%. I think everyone of those development deals would sell for a 4-type cap rate, if not lower than that. And so there's very significant amount of value creation. And I updated this quarter on Expo and said it was probably going to be around the 7% or higher stabilized cap rate again. I think that would sell for a 4 all day long. But we view those -- the value proposition differently between development and acquisitions. Development obviously involves more risk from a variety of perspectives. We expect to get a premium for that risk, and so we underwrite it a little bit differently. With the expectation, again, on the acquisition side of trying to get -- trying to accomplish something, improve our growth rate of the portfolio, we can move a lot more money faster in acquisitions, obviously. So if we see a change in market growth rates, we could buy into that with acquisitions, which is very difficult to do with development because you have transactions delivering several years after you start up. So I think that they're fundamentally different. I think you can add value in both of them. And so we continue to have a dual-pronged type of approach to investments, and we're still very active in both areas.","Eric Wolfe - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got you. That's helpful. And then just last question. On the co-investment structure, you mentioned the need, I guess, there, I guess the want to mitigate your risk in forward funding commitments. Is there any risk to giving your JV partner though too much control over asset management and operating decisions? Or do they just, at the end of the day, not have that much control based on the way you're structuring it?","Michael J. Schall","Yes, we're in control of all the major decisions on those transactions. In the case of the CPP joint ventures, they have say over major decisions, obviously. They're an important part of the overall equation. But they trust us for 55% of those -- 55% ownership in those transactions, and we're the providers of the services. And we believe in communicating very well with our partners, and we spend a lot of time and effort to make sure that, that goes right. But I think that, that partnership has worked very well up to this point, and we're excited about that relationship. So we try to maintain control, but we don't have complete control, obviously. And -- but I think in the broader scope, it makes sense from a risk reward standpoint. Again, if the world wasn't maybe as uncertain as it is and the issues weren't what they are, we might approach it differently. But I think in this world, this is a prudent strategy, and again, increasing your risk reward or improving your risk reward relationship, we think, is our objective here in what we've been able to accomplish.","Operator","The next question is from David Toti of Cantor Fitzgerald.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Quickly, I want to follow up on some of Eric's questions from a more strategic perspective on the development pipeline. Clearly, you feel there's an advantage to your timing and delivering a lot of these assets in the submarkets. What are some of the signals that you would look for to make -- sort of dial back on that volume, is my first question. And the second question is, based on your outlook, what does the development pipeline look like around year-end?","Michael J. Schall","Again, this is Mike. We have pretty much concluded that we're going to be early- to mid-cycle developers, and we are going to -- and our format will change a little bit depending upon how much compensation we receive for risks that we take. And we believe in this world, we're better off trying to compress the time periods between when we commit and when we deliver a transaction. And so we've tried to focus on sort of the shovel-ready type of projects that are out there. And so as you've noticed, over the last several quarters, when we buy something and announce it, we are under construction on it the next day pretty much. And again, we're trying to squeeze that period because of the uncertainty inherent in the world. And -- but having said that, all these projects are going exceptionally well. And so we have -- clearly, we feel like maybe that we did leave something on the table, but you don't know that upfront. And I think overall, that strategy makes complete sense. We're very focused on this unfunded liability that is -- or unfunded exposure from everything but including, in particular, the development projects. So we have agreed that we're going to be early-, mid-cycle developers, and we're going to tailor off at the top of this cycle. We've done a lot of time -- spent a lot of time and -- looking at cycles and where we are in the cycle, and of course, none of us really know exactly where we are. But we certainly are going to take a shot at trying to get it right. And so I think that as time goes on, if we get another great year in Northern California, you'll probably see us decelerate on the development side there. There is a possibility that we will try to find some more transactions in Southern California. We fundamentally believe that as good as Northern California and actually Seattle have been, Southern California really hasn't caught on where rents didn't fall as far, but we haven't seen the recovery coming back the other way. And as all of us know, in a world that is 8% unemployed, if you get any change in that scenario, there could be a lot more demand for housing that would be generated by better employment scenario almost overnight in markets that are just chronically undersupplied. So I guess to answer your question, if we get another great year in Northern California, we'd probably scale back a little bit, but we could scale up a little bit in -- or maybe pretty substantially in Southern California.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And just as a follow-up, are you seeing any signs of inflationary trends either in the material side or the land side in your Shadow pipeline?","John D. Eudy","This is John Eudy. On the land side, there are a number of transactions that are out there that are really priced up that we won't be able to pursue or choose not to pursue. On materials, yes, there's been a little bit of movement at the beginning of summer. It backed off here in the last -- probably 30 days. On labor, there still seems to be where we are in our buyout sort of the last couple of announcements to be plenty of capacity even in Northern California. I do think by the middle part of next year, that will change with the pipeline that is scheduled to start in '13. But right now, as Mike said, we think that beginning in the middle part of the cycle, we're trying to catch the wave early and not be caught with runaway cost.","Operator","The next question is from Paul Morgan of Morgan Stanley.","Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just on the cap offering, 10% cap on rents, can you talk a little bit more about kind of that decision to go from 15% to 10%? And maybe what's the adoption rate experienced when you have offered the 15% cap? And I mean, are these essentially economically neutral to you in a sense that the premium rent that you get roughly offsets the lack of upside at a various point of the cycle?","Michael J. Schall","It can be a little bit different. I mean, this is something that we've done before. As we all know, especially the tech markets can be very frothy when it comes to rent growth. You look at the late '90s and other periods of time, and also just the political nature of obviously California and I'm sure other places around the country. If you look at the nominal numbers, it doesn't look like it has much of an impact. If you break it down into actual property-by-property impacts, it clearly does have an impact. But again, there's also quite a bit of resistance. Certainly, the CEO website and Erik, as I'm sure 100x, that -- in his direct involvement of people that just say we just simply -- no one can afford 15% increases 3 years in a row. And some of those magnitudes are certainly out there. So we think that, overall, the cost of the company, if you ignore some of the side benefits or if you make some assumptions about side benefits, it's probably $1 million to $2 million a year in revenue. And at that, we think it's a prudent thing to do. I mean, obviously, we're not going to get a lot of Christmas cards limiting rent increases to 10% because people will still view that as being excessive, but it's something and it's something that we will likely publicize because there are companies out there that are charging much, much more and trying to go after every nickel. And again, obviously, one company cannot completely change the political situation if there's gouging by 2 companies. And if 10 companies are showing some restraint, the politicians could still act upon a rent control type of measure, but there's little we can do about that. From my perspective, it's the right thing to do, it's a prudent thing to do. There will be some other side benefits to it, and I think it's an important thing. And I'll note also that the California Apartment Association has a task force that is trying to mediate large rent control disputes between people and landlords, and they're getting more and more activity in that. And again, where that fails, where all the processes to try to mediate and come to a normal resolution fail, I think, is where you potentially have some political exposure.","Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","But am I correct that it's an option, it's not an automatic and it comes with a different starting rent?","Erik J. Alexander","Yes. So this is Erik. So as Mike said, there's always an option at 10%, and that option is anywhere from 10 to 13 months, depending on our lease expiration profile. And then there's an alternative that's offered at a different term, and of course, residents are always invited to let us know what's most important to them and we'll price that option for them as well. As Mike said, we're not getting very many thank you cards. However, what the sites tell us is that even though initially, it doesn't seem like that big of a deal, when people realize what the market rates are for their same floor plan and when they have done their shopping in the market, they realize there really is an economic benefit to them, and I think they generally feel better about it. So we have done or have accomplished, I think, what we're setting out to do, which is to defuse the issue, take a little wind out of the sail.","Operator","I think Swaroop has one question.","Swaroop Yalla - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes, just actually following up on the development pipeline question. I noticed in S-15 San Jose, you expect 1,200 units coming online this year. My question is, what do you expect for 2013 and 2014? And how does that relate to your plans for the Cadence project, also given your decision for Phase 2 and 3. Does this impact your decision to maybe start the project earlier than expected or later?","John Lopez","Yes, this is John Lopez. We expect the buildup in North San Jose to probably peak later in the summer next year, somewhere around 2,500, 3,000 units in that range, which would put it -- there's about 225,000, 230,000 total units in the marketplace, so we're talking up potentially up to, I guess that's about 1.4%, 1.3%. And it will probably cap at that for a couple of years if you look at the -- if we look what that construction right now that can be delivered by 2014.","Michael J. Schall","And actually, the other number that you gave out, John, it is 1.4% that we talked about in the past but amid very limited single-family housing production, right? So I think if you look at total housing production relative to stock, it's still in the under 1% range.","John Lopez","Because the single-family supply in Silicon Valley, in particular, is like 0.2%. And you've got to remember that in Silicon Valley, unlike San Francisco, 60% of the homes are single-family. So when you do your 1.4% plus 0.2%, it comes out to be about 0.5%, 0.6% for the total residential area, which we think is very manageable. If you drop me into a year and say you're getting 0.5%, 0.6%, then good job. I'd be a happy economist in that market.","Michael J. Schall","Yes, so probably the issue obviously is that the job growth continues to be very strong in San Jose. So -- and as I recall, the number is now 3% projected for 2012 job growth in San Jose. So if the job growth continues, we don't think that, that supply will be an issue. It will be quickly absorbed.","John Lopez","And just one last point, Swaroop, because I think you're looking at the difference in this. If you look at previous cycles on total multi-family apartments and in condos, the only thing that's different here, this isn't going to be a peak year necessarily. It's just that a lot of it is coming into North San Jose, but that's also sort of indirectly where the jobs in the office construction in that light rail line is you just can't underestimate the impact to being on the light rail line.","Swaroop Yalla - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So if we just add all the phases in Cadence and the Via project, how many units are we talking about that Essex will eventually build in San Jose?","Michael J. Schall","The third phase of Cadence is 192. So -- I don't have it right in front of me.","John Lopez","So you're talking about on stabilized properties?","Swaroop Yalla - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes.","Michael J. Schall","Yes. So it's 569.","John Lopez","769.","Michael J. Schall","Yes, 769.","Operator","The next question is from Jana Galan of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess following up on the prepared remarks regarding Hewlett-Packard and Cisco and Yahoo!, can you remind us how much of your portfolio is corporate leases in Northern California and Seattle? And have you noticed any changes in demand from that segment?","Erik J. Alexander","Yes, this is Erik. We have a very low exposure to the corporate business in our portfolio throughout. There are some properties that do more of that type of business, as you might expect, in Seattle, in San Jose and in Redmond. Overall, to answer your question specifically, the corporate exposure is 1.1% for the portfolio. And I think the most any one of the buildings have is 15%, and even that is a little deceiving because it's staggered. And we asked corporates to take some longer-term leases, and they're usually -- and they're used to taking, again, to protect our backside.","Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So completely under control. Appreciate it.","Operator","The next question is from Dave Bragg of Zelman & Associates.","David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","A couple of follow-up questions on this renewal policy. Mike, you mentioned the potential revenue loss, but you also mentioned potentially lower turnovers. So what's the offset on the expense line? How do you expect this to increase -- or decrease turnover? And just to put this into context for us, what percentage of your renewal notices that you have been sitting out were above 10%, anyways?","Michael J. Schall","Dave, all these numbers within the context of what our total annual revenue is are pretty meaningless, so I think it's all fairly nominal. I think we've done some estimates of what the impact is, $1 million, $2 million, using assumptions with respect to what turnover might be and what -- because you'll have less turnover, you'll have less turnover costs, you'll have less vacancy and you will put more -- you'll have more ability to push rents on the other side because you have less availability as well. Obviously, those are not numbers you can plug into a model, you have to make assumptions on them. But with the total impact of somewhere between $1 million and $2 million, we think this is nominal. And to get more specific about it, I'm not sure we'd be really all that helpful. Erik, do you have anything to add to that?","Erik J. Alexander","No, other than the timing of the 10% increases, we just started doing the first offer, 60 days out a couple of weeks ago, that impact the October 1 and beyond -- or sorry, September 15, I think it is, and beyond. So we don't have any -- or many of the results back from that yet. And as Mike said, I would -- the impact that's hard -- or the offset that's hard to estimate is the lower availability and what that does to pricing on the new lease side. For whatever reason that we're able to reduce availability, net availability, we always see it increase in pricing on the new lease side. So that will certainly help us mitigate some of that. And as I commented, we're looking to get -- continue to grow revenue and are most comfortable doing it on the new side.","David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","Well, Erik, on that point, there seems to be a divergence between your renewal and new move-in gains in this third quarter of this year versus last year. Seems like you're doing better on new move-ins just based on your July metric and a good bit lower on renewals. Could you speak to that trend?","Erik J. Alexander","Well, I mean, I think these 2 periods, this summer and last summer, are different. As noted in the highlights, our net availability overall is lower this year than it is -- or than it was last year. And so again, I think that's helping us accelerate the pricing on the new side. So as long as those conditions hold up and as I reported on 30-day net availability, those are very much in control. I think we've said before that we're trying to manage around 6%, and only Seattle is at that level. Southern Cal and Northern California are lower.","David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","Right. And what do you think is driving the lower renewals?","Erik J. Alexander","What I think is driving the lower renewals?","David Bragg - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","Versus last year.","Erik J. Alexander","Well, at this specific period of time, I would say that it's part of our aggressiveness last year compared to the balanced approach going into the fourth quarter this year.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The next question is from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Just want to go back to David Toti's question on Northern California versus Southern California. You guys, in the past, have been very good about switching markets. When you tell 1 market was peaking, jumping to another market that was picking up steam, it seems like this cycle, the Northern California market seems to have longer legs than the Southern California market is taking longer. But I thought you said that there may only be 1 more year Northern California before you switch to Southern California, given the pace of new development activity starts that you guys are doing. Just sort of wanting more color on your thoughts between investing in the 2 markets.","Michael J. Schall","Alex, it's Mike. What we do operationally is rank our 30-some-odd submarkets by expected growth rate over the next 3 to 5 years. Mr. Lopez does that. And pretty clearly, the last several years, that is -- focuses more on Northern California and Seattle, not -- but that doesn't mean that we didn't like some parts of Southern California as well, it's just you can only buy so much and build so much in Northern California and Seattle. The markets are only so big, and it didn't mean that we wanted to essentially not look at Southern California. But as time has gone on, you have now a pretty significant amount of rent growth in Northern California, 20-plus percent, a similar number in Seattle. And so as we looked at the market rankings, there is greater parity. We think Northern California -- and it varies a little bit by location, but Northern California, as a general statement, is about a parity with respect to projected growth rate as Southern California. And so you will see a more balanced approach, I think, from an acquisition standpoint between North and South. As to development, development is a little different because what happens at the top of the cycle is the contractors are busy, they want bigger profit margins when they're busy, costs tend to spike a bit at the top. So as the comments I was making earlier were really more from a development standpoint, trying to keep our development earlier in the cycle to avoid the potential for costs spiking that can happen toward the top of the cycle. And so moving more of our development interest into Southern California would therefore be something, I think, will happen and will be advantageous to us.","John Lopez","And Alex, this is John Lopez. I know we made a comment last quarter that it might be sometime in the midpoint next year where -- when the crossover between rental growth rates might occur. But I think if we look at what's going on in the Northern California and Seattle economies, that is probably not going to be the case where before '14, that the rates in Southern California will greatly exceed Northern California. So although Southern California will pick up and pass Northern California, it's probably not going to be the case where the gaps are as big as they are, say, a year ago between North and South, if you get that.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay, that makes sense. And then going to your development program, the $1 billion that you outlined and met in the supplemental, that's a gross number, right? That's not your pro rata, correct?","John Lopez","Yes, that's correct. Of the deals that are under construction, worth about half, between 50% and 55% ownership of those.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. So like Avalon Bay has outlined a sort of target limit relative to their asset size and such, do you guys have a limit that you're looking to keep the development program under?","Michael J. Schall","We don't have an express limit. We've typically been in the 10% to 20% of our activities develop -- or capital, let's say, in development. So that would an imply an $8 billion -- $800 million will be 10% to $1.6 billion will be the absolute maximum we would consider.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. And then just the final question is just going back to the rent control. Given that part of what causes the rents to spike is making it very difficult for developers to build, as you hear various politicians speak about rent control, is there -- do they give any like sort of acceptance to the need that they need to make development easier to also alleviate the burden of rents or it's the typical sort of let's limit rent growth -- I mean, let's limit rent and not talk about the other side of the equation?","Michael J. Schall","You're being way too rational, Alex. So no, we do not hear those 2 concepts being spoken about together. And in fact, I'd say that because the local governments are under so much financial pressure, that there will be more pressure with respect to city fees and other costs, not less pressure going forward. It will become more difficult to build and probably not easier.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","So as you speak to local politicians, it doesn't seem to be anyone who's amenable to hearing the development side of the picture?","Michael J. Schall","That's maybe a little bit too tough, too. No, I think that -- I think some of the politicians are very aware of the issue, and -- but unfortunately, the political will, as a general rule, I don't think is there. So I think our expectation, and as we've seen in the past, California can be very undersupplied with respect to housing from time to time. And I believe that we're going into one of those periods of time, I'm not 100% sure. But I know it's difficult and it takes a lot of time and effort, and there are a lot of obstacles to producing housing here and I don't think that changes.","Operator","The next question is from Jeffrey Donnelly of Wells Fargo.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just building on Alex's question about market rotation, how significantly do you think you guys could shift your NOI contribution around California to reweigh your exposure? Because arguably, that was easier a few years ago when Essex was a slightly smaller company.","Michael J. Schall","Yes, that's a very good question. We don't think we're going to change -- make any huge changes to the concentrations. I think that Southern California got up to about 50% to low 60% range of our portfolio a couple of years ago. Now it's down, we've been pushing more in the north, and it's become closer to 50%. So I think that those types of magnitude are what you're going to see. So we're not talking about wholesale changes in the company. We try to find properties in locations that are solid locations for the long haul. This is a long-term business, not a short-term business. And so I think you will see us make plus or minus 5% to 10% moves in terms of our allocation over time. I don't -- I suspect it won't become larger than that.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And just a few housekeeping questions. Concerning Skyline, and I apologize if I missed this, but can you talk a little bit about how the NOI that project has performed versus your original performance? I guess I'm just trying to figure out how much of the appreciation that asset stems from performance versus this cap rate compression over the last 2 years.","Michael T. Dance","Over the last couple of years, most of it was cap rate compression. So to give you a little bit of history, we bought it for $128 million, but we needed to complete a lease-up. It was 100% completed, but it was vacant. And so that lease-up cost probably took cost from $128 million to maybe $100 million -- low $130 million range. And I think that rents increased by somewhere in the neighborhood of 2% to 3% over that period of time, not great, obscured maybe a little bit by what was the impact of the concessions at the initial lease-up. But close as we can determine, it was somewhere in the 2% to 3%, and then the rest of that value was really cap rate compression. We bought it at about a 5.25% type cap rate, and the partner buyout was in the low 4% cap rate range.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","That's helpful. Is it fair to say though that, that project still is on pace with your original underwriting?","Michael J. Schall","Yes, I mean, operationally, we were ahead of our underwriting. I know in the first year, we've filled it up faster than we thought. And more recently, actually, it's performed better as well. So yes, I think it's achieving our estimates. We had hoped for a little bit more rent growth in Orange County, and that has lagged. So I think from the rent growth expectation, we did not hit the rents that we had hoped for. But obviously, we re-underwrote it. We still think that, that rent growth is -- that rent growth potential is still there, and we believe that we'll be able to see that in the next couple of years.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And how do you think about the timing of -- or I guess do you think about the time of selling these inevitably as condos because I think your new basis is probably about $425,000 a unit? What point does it pencil out to explore a sale of these because with interest rates probably 200 basis points lower than when you bought it, does it make it easier for consumers to get this master work? I don't know where the condo market is in that particular part of Orange County today, but...","Michael J. Schall","Yes, we track the condo market, and we believe that this is a better condo than it is an apartment building. And therefore, it's simply a matter of time that -- in terms of realizing that value. And -- but having said that, the condo market is not strong. And for a lot of different reasons, clearly, there was an overbuilding of for-sale that happened as you're giving people mortgage -- mortgages they can't afford, the homes that they're buying. And then in the process, a lot of people destroy their credit. And so now you look at it a couple of years later, you've got a normalizing homeownership rate, you have people that have -- don't have the credit that they need to get a mortgage, don't have the downpayments you need to get a mortgage and therefore, you haven't seen a big resurgence in terms of values on this type of product. And therefore, I don't think we're even close to where we think condo prices would need to be in order to lead to a sale of Skyline. I think it's still several years off.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And just a last question is, do you guys have an estimate you can share with us around what the promote could ultimately be in Fund II?","Michael J. Schall","We obviously do have estimates of that. I think it's preliminary to talk about it. I can say it's pretty comfortably in excess of $10 million, but I don't want to go farther than that.","Operator","The next question is from Mike Salinsky of RBC Capital Markets.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","First question, just an update on dispositions. It seems like it's been pretty slow here the first half of the year. And also, as you look at development and acquisition, I mean, typically, you match fund. Is there any impetus given current valuations to give a little bit more pre-funding of the investment there?","Michael J. Schall","Yes, Mike, it's Mike. We sold a couple of assets in San Diego, and at least at this point in time, our focus is trying to market and sell the half of the Fund II portfolio that is on the market now. So I think our disposition focus is pretty much right there. As we approach the end of the year, there may be a couple of other properties that we put on the market, and there will be a culling process over time within the company from that point on. So as of right now, we have our hands full with respect to the sale of those assets, and we don't want to dilute that. And at the same time, obviously, we had a very active quarter both in development and acquisitions, so we want to keep our time and effort focused on the things that are most important and not take on too much. So it's a balanced program as it always was. And then you had a second part to the question. Do you guys remember what that was? Mike, what was the second part?","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Second part was just talking about funding. I mean, several of your peers have moved to more kind of a pre-funding model where they started development, they're issuing the equity to fund it completely upfront as opposed to match funding.","Michael J. Schall","Right, right. Yes. Well, that number is an important number to us. The forward commitment to fund our development pipeline is somewhere around $375 million. And we have -- we're trying to reserve liquidity within our line and other places in the balance sheet to fund that if we need to. So we will -- we may look at pre-funding some of it. But the nice thing about the co-investment program is those forward funding obligations are not as large as they otherwise would be, obviously. That's why we do it. And so we don't have to, but if we can opportunistically pre-fund some of it, we will.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And related to that comment, is there any plans to cap the current development exposure?","Michael J. Schall","Other than what I said earlier, probably, we've operated at 10% to 20% of capital. We're a little -- on a net basis, we're not even at 10%, so I think we have some room to go there. But we will transition out of Northern California development at some point in time, likely in the next year. I'm expecting, again, good market rent growth that would have to happen to make that occur, and then we may transition a little bit to Southern California. We're going to start delivering some of these development deals as well. Expo obviously later this year, but after that, we'll start having some deliveries. And so we'll look to try to recycle some of the development programs going forward as well.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And Erik, just a final bookkeeping question. The renewals that you guys talked about being sent out, how much do you -- what is the actual achieved rate usually versus what's sent out? How much negotiation is in there?","Erik J. Alexander","Yes, so I talked about this a little bit last quarter. And what we've sent out for the second quarter was in the 6% range, and what was achieved was 5.4%. So it ends up being pretty close to what we send out. The difference is usually end up being mostly related to people wanting different terms. There are some negotiations, if you will, again, mostly related to turn -- sorry, to term, because by giving them a limit, we already figured we've given them -- or by capping, I should say, our increase, we've already given them a best price, if you will. So what ends up happening a little bit is, I'd like to get that rate, but I'd like to have it on a 9-month basis because I'm moving after that. And so sometimes we'll split the difference with them. They don't get the same best rate. But that's our expectation.","Operator","The next question is from Paula Poskon of Robert W. Baird.","Paula J. Poskon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Could you give us a little more color on the Valley Village project? And what do you think the opportunities [indiscernible] is for similar pre-sale-type development deals.","John Lopez","It's a small deal, 121 units. We were working on it for about 8 months with the developer. And there aren't that many out there that makes sense, and the reason is, the developer has to come to the table with a lot of cash to get his deal financed. We're the take-out basically for it because a combination of a developer with a take-out isn't going to be enough to get a deal financed. In this case, they own the land for a long time, there's a substantial amount of equity in it but not quite enough to get it over the line. And that's where our presale helped to get it financed with Wells Fargo and deliveries roughly 18 months out. And there aren't many of those opportunities. We've looked at other pre-sale opportunities. The problem is, if the developer has a deal, wants somebody to pre-sale contract to do it, it's not going to get done. Otherwise, there will be a lot more out there.","Paula J. Poskon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And clearly, you have a long track record of success in being opportunistic with capital deployment. Do you ever think about the friction between acting that opportunistically and trying to maintain a high level of visibility into your earnings streams for investors? Or is that just not something that enters your calculus?","Michael J. Schall","It's -- Paula, it's a good question. We're not here to manage same-store revenue. We're not here to manage same-store NOI. We would make different decisions if we were focused on those metrics exclusively. For example, you would sell more at the bottom edge of your portfolio to make those metrics look better and\/or you would buy more aggressively at lower cap rates, in other words, in order to buy the higher growth assets. So those are not things that we are per se interested in. We are interested in a combination of growth impacts on net asset value and cap rate or accretion over our existing cash flow of our own portfolio, which generates positive returns. I think that's why we have been able to be as successful as we have been as we're very careful about the total picture of what we're trying to accomplish and not focused on -- not overfocused on any one metric.","Paula J. Poskon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And then just finally, you mentioned, I know, Yahoo! in your prepared remarks. Clearly, the challenges for the new CEO have been beaten to death in the national press. What are you guys hearing out there in your proverbial backyard of what the prognosis is for Yahoo!?","Michael J. Schall","I don't know, Paula. I'm not sure that we have anything that's going to be helpful in terms of that transition of leadership, and it's a very significant company, obviously. And as I said in my comments, these restructurings are normal and necessary parts of the technology world because the product is an intellectual product. In many cases, it's not a -- well, in the case, I guess an iPhone is more than an intellectual product, it's actually a product, too. But it's some combination of intellectual assets and other types of assets. And so again, when you get into these situations where companies don't perform, this is the normal process, and they tend to evolve until they come back to a winning scenario. So whether this transition is the right one, we'll know. If it's not, there will be another transition afterwards. We've seen it a thousand times out here. And it's, I think, the healthy part of this market in that it's very dynamic. And whereas some companies that have products don't innovate, everyone out here is forced to innovate. And this is the process that forces innovation. So again, I don't know anything specific about the current situation, but the process is ongoing. And I hope it's successful at Yahoo!, but if it's not, the next one may be. So I think that's what will happen.","Operator","And our final question comes from Rich Anderson of BMO Capital Markets.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","So I have a suggestion. Maybe if you drop the rent cap to 9.9%, you'll start to get some thank you notices.","Michael J. Schall","Rich, we were wondering where you were, so I'm happy you joined the call. Appreciate the thought.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","So just on that topic, really, can you just -- is it a public relations thing primarily? Is it something a little bit more selfish in the sense, and not in a bad way, but you want to kind of keep the engine going a little bit longer over a longer period of time? What is -- is that playing into your decision to provide this lower option?","Michael J. Schall","It really isn't to keep the engine going longer. That is not the motivation. The motivation is a -- it's partially -- look at my constituencies. I have the investment community, I have the Essex employees and I have the residents. It's trying to balance the constituencies appropriately, and this is what we think is appropriate. We think that this will give us a defensible position with respect to the local leaders as it relates to some of these -- some of the stuff that's gone on out there, which can be pretty egregious. I mean, we're talking about 15%, but there are 20% and 25% rent increases going on out there and they are not well-received. And in the world of Facebook and electronic media and the ability to publicize these types of situations that are really pretty tough to accept in the normal world, I think there's real exposure. So again, my feeling about the thing is that the apartment world should exercise some normal self-restraint, and I give California Apartment Association kudos for trying to do that with this mediation process. Or you've got to be regulated. I mean, I think that's pretty clear. I mean, we've all seen that in a hundred different ways in other areas, so I don't know why we'd expect housing and apartments to be any different. So [indiscernible] motivation.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","So this isn't -- in your mind, if you owned a national portfolio, you might be doing the same thing?","Michael J. Schall","Yes, although it could be different. It's different from locale to locale. So I mean, we'll be sensitive to the local political situation. But again, I mean, if -- I'm telling you, 20%, 25% rent increases, they are not accepted. If you publicize them, we're going to look as an industry as not -- as something we don't like. So again, we're really trying to balance the 3 constituencies and make the right longer-term decision for the benefit of the company's reputation and its long-term health.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I think you're right. I mean, we've said this before that you guys have been the winner in an otherwise losing environment in terms of the economy, and I think it's the right and appropriate step to take. So I just wanted to give you a little credit for that.","Operator","We have no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for closing remarks.","Michael J. Schall","Thank you, operator. Well, on closing, I just appreciate your participation on the call. Obviously, we're pleased with the progress made during the quarter and believe that our outlook remains bright. And we look forward to hearing from all of you on the next quarter call. Thank you again.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. ","Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs as well as information available to the company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found in the company's filings with the SEC.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Mike Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you, Mr. Schall. You may begin.","Mike Schall","Thank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to our third quarter earnings conference call. John Burkart and Angela Kleiman will follow me with comments before we open the call to Q&A. I will begin by highlighting that our third quarter results exceeded our expectations. Core FFO per share for the quarter was $0.04 better than the midpoint of our guidance, which represents 6.3% growth compared to the third quarter of 2018. We are pleased to raise our full year core FFO guidance by $0.05 at the midpoint. This is the third time this year we've increased our core FFO per share guidance, which is attributable to a solid summer leasing season, dramatically improved cost of capital compared to the start of the year and continued execution by the Essex team. John and Angela will provide more details about the quarter and the increase to our full year guidance in their remarks.","Turning to our expectations for 2020 rent growth in the West Coast markets. We have continued our practice of providing our baseline and key budgeting assumptions on Page S-16 of the supplemental. This is intended to be a scenario based on macro level forecasts, such as U.S. GDP and job growth that we obtained from third-party sources. Key to this scenario is our ground-up research on apartment supply throughout the Essex metros. In recent years, apartment supply has become more concentrated in California's urban areas, resulting in periods of high rental concessions that often substantially impact submarket pricing power. ","Therefore, apartment supply estimates are more important than ever, and our delay adjusted supply estimates for 2019 have proven invaluable in targeting acquisitions and dispositions. Overall, we expect 2020 to look much like 2019, representing the continuation of rental growth near long-term averages. Overall, we expect market rents in the Essex targeted areas to grow an average of 3% compared to 3.1% in our S-16 forecast a year ago. Once again, we expect very tight labor market conditions, exemplified by a very low unemployment rate of 3.3% as of August 2019. ","This is down 20 basis points from a year ago and is expected to slightly reduce job growth for 2020 compared to 2019. The tech market should continue to significantly outpace the nation with 2% job growth expected in Northern California and 2.4% in Seattle. Our outlook for supply in 2020 contemplates similar apartment supply deliveries compared to 2019 for a total of around 35,000 apartments in the Essex metros, with meaningful variations in certain markets, including lower apartment supply in Seattle and Orange County and higher supply in Oakland and San Jose. There are several positive factors and confirming indicators that impact our 2020 forecast.","Tight labor markets may constrained job growth, but they also push incomes higher. While higher wages will pressure operating expenses, they will also help relieve pressure on the housing affordability issue that has constrained growth rates for the past several years. We have added Slides S-16.1 to the supplemental this quarter to demonstrate the historical context for the West Coast superior income and job growth compared to the rest of the country. Income growth in Essex markets has outpaced the nation by 12 percentage points on a cumulative basis this decade and has accelerated in the past several years.","Office development continues to expand at a healthy pace. All of our markets are building out new office space to accommodate strong demand. Seattle and the Bay Area currently have 19 million square feet of office space under development or nearly 4% of existing inventory, which compares to national average offers, office growth of just 2%. Each of our markets had very strong office pre-leasing and solid absorption in the third quarter as well as positive rent growth compared to 1 year ago, with San Jose and Seattle office rents up 11% and 5%, respectively.","Hiring at the top 10 tech firms, all of which are headquartered in an Essex market, continues to be very strong. These companies currently have 25,000 job openings in California and Washington, up 19% as compared to the third quarter of 2018. Amazon's job openings in Washington are up 52% compared with 1 year ago. And it's also notable that Facebook now has over 5,000 employees in the Seattle market, while Google and Apple are also expanding rapidly in South Lake Union.","Turning to the transaction market and acquisition activity. We transitioned from being a net seller of property in 2018 to a net buyer in 2019 given a dramatic improvement in our cost of capital throughout the year. As a result, we are pleased to have exceeded the high end of our acquisition guidance range this year, with $660 million of acquisition deals closed through September 30, and we expect to remain active for the remainder of the year. The acquisition market has become increasingly competitive as positive leverage is a powerful force for multifamily housing. ","The higher demand for apartments has been accompanied by more property being marketed. In late 2018 and early 2019, there was a slight upward pressure on cap rates, and this trend has reversed with cap rates down about 10 to 20 basis points. We believe that we added value by reacting quickly to changing market conditions. In terms of cap rates, recent activity indicates that A properties in A locations typically trade between a 3.9% and 4.1% cap rate with B properties in B locations trading 20 to 30 basis points wider. ","We remain selective in this environment, and we will, and we have significant advantages, including great research, strong relationships and track record and a robust balance sheet with ample liquidity. As noted on previous calls, we continue to favor preferred equity investments over direct development primarily because yields are compressing given that construction cost increases have exceeded rental and NOI growth rates for the past several years represent a significant headwind to direct development.","Lastly, before I turn the call over to John, I'd like to comment on the passage of California's Assembly Bill 1482, 1 of 18 housing-related bills that were signed into law by Governor Newsom earlier this month. Most of these new laws are expected to remove barriers to build more housing, incentivize affordable housing and fund housing production. AB 1482 will generally cap rent increases to CPI plus 5% and is intended as an anti-gouging measure.","At Essex, we've had a longstanding practice of limiting renewal rents to 10% and do not expect this legislation to have a material impact on our results. With rent regulation a recurring theme amongst legislatures across the country, we remain committed to California and will continue to advocate for smart housing policies.","With that, I'll turn the call over to our COO, John Burkart.","John Burkart","Thank you, Mike. Q3 was a good quarter for Essex. Overall, our markets follow the historical seasonal pattern with the market rents peaking in early August, a little later than normal. As a result, we continue to favor achieving market rents over higher occupancy, taking advantage of the strong market conditions to lock in higher rents into September, allowing our same-store portfolio occupancy to dip to 95.8% or 60 basis points below September 2018. This strategy enabled us to increase year-over-year scheduled rent by 3.5% for the third quarter compared to the prior year's period. For comparison, year-over-year scheduled rent growth in the third quarter of 2018 was 2.5%. This 100 basis point increase sets us up in a better position going forward.","Our total same-store market rents were up 3.4% year-over-year in the third quarter over the prior year's period. Revenues for the same period grew 3.1% with financial occupancy of 96%, which is 40 basis points lower than the prior year's period. On a trailing 12-month basis, portfolio turnover rate was 46.3% through September. This is a 200 basis point decrease from the prior year's period. Finally, we continue to be on pace to achieve the 3.3% midpoint of our full year 2019 same-store revenue guidance.","On supply, multifamily supply growth as a percent of stock is projected to be 120 basis points higher in downtown urban submarkets during 2020 at 2% versus suburban markets at 80 basis points. Concentrated downtown urban supply is a consistent theme in this cycle in the West Coast markets. Looking forward, we continue to be excited about the various platform initiatives that we are working on, including our new CRM that we're collaboratively designing with a third-party vendor, our mobile maintenance platform 2.0 as well as our smart units and many other initiatives. ","We are tracking over 40 separate initiatives or workflows, all directed at improving the customer and\/or employee experience as well as leveraging technology to reduce labor. The initiatives are at various stages in our process from design or proof-of-concept to pilot to rollout, and their impact will be felt over the next 1 to 3 years.","Turning now to an update on our markets. In Seattle, our same-store market rents were up 5.2% year-over-year in the third quarter. Submarket revenues for the same period grew at 4.7% in the Seattle CBD, 3.7% in the East side and an average of 4.7% in the North and South. Seattle MD remained the strongest major U.S. market for job growth in the third quarter, growing 3.4% year-over-year, with the top 4 paying industries adding over 30,000 jobs, a 60% increase from the prior year. Along these lines, major tech company expansion was healthy with Amazon job openings remaining around 11,000 for 3 consecutive quarters, while Facebook continues to expand in the market. With multifamily supply forecasted to decrease about 25% in the second half of this year, the Seattle market is benefiting from the delivery slowdown.","Moving to Northern California, same-store market rents were up 3.9% year-over-year in the third quarter. Revenues for the same period were led by San Francisco achieving 6.4% growth; followed by Santa Clara at 3.6%; Alameda at 3.4%; Contra Costa at 2.9%; and San Mateo achieving 2.5%. We continued our 3 lease-ups to Bay Area. Mylo is now 27.3% leased, offering 6 weeks concessions. Station Park Green Phase 2 is now 63.3% leased, offering 4 to 8 weeks concessions. And we started lease-up of 500 Folsom, now 10.8% leased, offering 4 to 8 weeks concessions.","Regarding Mylo, the Santa Clara market is very strong. We have the asset 28.2% pre-leased in mid-August prior to units becoming available. However, as a result of construction delays, we lost several leases. Job growth in the Bay Area averaged 2.7% year-over-year for the third quarter. San Francisco, San Jose and Oakland grew at 3.3%, 2.8% and 2%, respectively, with all 3 markets seeing the largest gains in professional business services. Tech expansion activity was robust in the South space, mainly attributed to Google's acquisitions activity, including 16 acres of land in Sunnyvale, 56 properties near San Jose's Diridon Station and an additional 1.3 million square feet of office space in the submarket.","Looking at multifam supply in Northern California. The deliveries are heavily weighted toward the second half of this year with double the number of units coming online compared to the first half of this year. As a result of the increase in supply during the seasonally low demand period, we expect the Bay Area market to be choppy for the next 2 quarters with isolated buckets of weakness from the supplies. Heading further down south, same-store market rents in the region were up 2.3% year-over-year in the third quarter. Job growth in our SoCal markets averaged 1.2% in the same period, L.A. at 1.2%, Orange County at 1.1% and San Diego at 1.9%.","L.A. County revenues for the third quarter were up 2.7% led by Woodland Hills with 4.6%, West L.A. with 3.3% and the Tri-City submarket with 2.7%. As expected, L.A. CBD declined by 3.6% as the submarket continues to feel the impact of concentrated supply in the downtown urban area with stabilized comps offering up to 8 weeks concessions on new leases. In Orange County, year-over-year third quarter revenues were up 2.7% in the South Orange submarket and 1.4% in the North Orange submarket. ","Lastly, in San Diego, our year-over-year third quarter revenues were up 2.3% led by the Oceanside submarket with 3.5%, followed by North City with 2.1% and Chula Vista with 1.9%. As the market enters a seasonally slower demand period, which is usually the fourth and first quarters of the year, we have adjusted our approach to favor occupancy. Our Q1 renewals have been sent out at about 4.5% and our portfolio is currently at 97.2% physical occupancy with our availability 30 days out at 3.5%.","Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Angela Kleiman.","Angela Kleiman","Thank you, John. I will start with a brief overview of our third quarter results and the increase to our full year guidance and provide an update on our structured finance investments and balance sheet activities. Beginning with our third quarter performance. I'm pleased to report that we exceeded the midpoint of our core FFO per share guidance by $0.04. This was primarily driven by investment activities and low interest expense, including favorable refinancing and higher capitalized interest from development delays. Following these results, we are raising our full year core FFO per share guidance by $0.05 to $13.33 at the midpoint, representing a 6% year-over-year growth. ","The revised guidance range assumes we sell a large urban asset in Northern California in the fourth quarter, which is owned in our co-investment platform at a 55% pro rata share. The sale of this property will take us to the low end of our full year disposition guidance range in the low $300 million.","Turning to our structured finance investment activities. The recent decline in interest rates in a strong transaction market have enabled developers to either refinance or sell their development projects. As a result, there has been an increase in early redemptions of our preferred equity and subordinated loan investments. During the third quarter, we have $31 million of early redemptions, and we currently anticipate an additional $110 million of redemptions in the fourth quarter. As we maintain an active pipeline, we plan to reinvest the proceeds from these early redemptions and achieve comparable yields. But until the reinvested proceeds are fully funded, there will be an impact to core FFO on a temporary basis.","In addition, during the fourth quarter, our investment in a collateralized mortgage obligation, which was originated back in 2010 for $70 million, will mature. As a result, we expect to receive a payment of approximately $80 million. This investment has been highly profitable for our shareholders, earning around a 470% return over a whole period. It is another good example of our opportunistic approach to investing. ","However, replicating this investment in today's low environment, low rate environment will be challenging and will lead to an estimated FFO per share headwind of $0.14 to $0.18 in 2020, subject to reinvestment yield and timing. Lastly, on capital markets activity, we also took advantage of the decline in interest rates to issue $550 million of unsecured bonds in the third and fourth quarter with a coupon of 3%. The majority of this debt is being used to repay secured debt maturing in 2020. We will continue to be opportunistic as we consider our refinancing alternatives to optimize our cost of capital.","This concludes my remarks, and I will now turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Austin Wurschmidt","First question is really around Prop. 10, 2.0. And I guess, since the initial Prop. 10 vote in 2018, other than AB 1482 getting passed, I was just curious what else has changed in your mind that could potentially swing the vote in 2020 in your view.","Mike Schall","Okay, Austin, it's Mike. Yes, we certainly hope that we would not be following up on Prop. 10 this quickly, but here we are. So to the contrary, actually, we are hoping that the bills passed would be given time to work. And so anyway, what's happening currently is signature gathering is ongoing for the proposition. They're somewhere around 600,000 signatures. They probably need around 900,000 signatures in order to get rid of the duplicates and unregistered voters, et cetera. So they still have a ways to go.","As you know, we've kept our Californian for Responsible Housing entity in place that was used as part of the Prop. 10 battle, and we're just starting to focus on the proposal. But I would say, remember that Costa Hawkins Prop. 10 was overwhelmingly defeated in 2018, a lost in all but 1 county in California. It was a decisive victory. And again, I think the politics are a little bit different this time in that the, I think the Governor and legislature would like have some time for the existing bills to work before going to the ballot box. So I think it's still too early to tell exactly what's going to happen, but we are definitely focused on it. And we're organized and ready to fight it as needed.","Austin Wurschmidt","But would you say anything sentiment-wise from the voters that either changes to the proposed bill or something amongst, I guess, just voters in general that they're taking a different view because we all know that it obviously was voted down pretty significantly in 2018?","Mike Schall","Yes. So I think that there have been some changes that make it more palatable to voters, but again, less palatable in another sense. So it exempts individuals that own 2 homes or less, for example, from the provisions. But then again, there is a vacancy control element, which I think will be viewed as being undesirable. So I think that there are offsetting pieces there. And again, I think the politics are very different this time because, as you'll recall, with respect to Prop. 10, the Democrat party endorsed it. I think that's very unlikely this time. So we still think that it doesn't get supported and will be voted down. But again, it's a little bit early to come to that conclusion, I guess.","Austin Wurschmidt","Okay. Appreciate that. And then I know you said there's not a material impact from AB 1482. Was just wondering if you could put a finer point on that and what the impact to 2019 same-store revenue growth would have been if we were looking at that being implemented Jan 1 of this year.","John Burkart","Yes, this is John. The, again, from Essex's perspective, for years, we have done a couple of things. One, we self-imposed rent caps, which are relatively consistent with 1482. And number two is we typically, we always focus on the market and we try to bring the renewals slightly below or at market. So we're not really ahead of the market with our renewals. So with that said and the fact that rents are growing roughly 3% a year, it probably would not have had a material effect on '19 and nor will it on '20. The types of issues that you can run into is if you're pushing ahead of the market or, so there is a little bit of friction as it relates to the term. Sometimes, shorter-term leases get some price premiums, but we have relatively few of those. So I don't see it having really a material impact on our business, but we'll obviously include whatever that will be in our guidance when we issue that next quarter.","Operator","Our next question is from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.","John Kim","I was wondering on the CPI with 5% rent cap, what do you think that will have as far as impacts on your renewal rates and your same-store results?","Mike Schall","Yes. John, I think John will probably want to add to this. We run our renewals and new leases, new lease rates at pretty similar numbers for the September '19 year-over-year. New was 3.1% and renewals 4% overall for the company. So because of that, again, as John said, we don't see it having a huge impact on our portfolio. John, do you want to add to that?","John Burkart","Yes. No, I mean that answers that. Again, it's the way we operate, it's, again, consistent with how we've operated for years with self-imposed caps, with how we look at the market and how we look at our renewals with respect to the marketplace. So yes, again, I do not see a material impact. There may be minor impacts as it relates to terms and how we adjust, and we're working through all that right now, but it's just really not a material impact.","John Kim","Okay. And then my second question is on now being that acquirer with the cost of capital getting more attractive, are there any major underwriting assumptions that you're doing differently this time that you, that you're taking now versus before? And can you update us on where you see the best return as far as acquisitions, preferred investments and development?","Mike Schall","Sure, John. This is Mike. In terms of underwriting, we look at things much like we have in the past. We will look at every transaction based on the submarket rent growth. And again, our research department ranks our submarkets by 4-year rent growth divided into 30 submarkets. And so we're trying to invest in the top performing submarkets from a rent growth perspective over that period of time. So that's how we do that. And we'll call the portfolio with respect to the bottom part of that hierarchy. And in terms of best overall performance, I think that on acquisitions, we look at it relative to the portfolio. ","So in other words, what are the returns that are available in the private markets versus what other, what returns are implied in the stock and try to understand how we create value, how we can create core FFO per share and NAV per share growth. Both of those metrics are the key to what we, how we look at an acquisition and then, of course, whether we use on balance sheet sources of money versus our co-investment program. So all these factors go into how we underwrite a transaction and how we approach it and really no different from before.","Operator","Our next question is from Trent Trujilio with Scotiabank.","Trent Trujillo","On your 2020, I guess, preliminary outlook there, the job growth forecast for Southern California looks to be basically a continuation of what we've seen year-to-date. And now as you look at your markets and think about you seem to do a deep dive into office space requirements, tech growth, VC funding and other factors, would you say that Southern California job growth has a higher likelihood to surprise the upside or downside than what you put in that forecast?","Mike Schall","It's a good question. I wish I have that answer. And it would, if I did have that answer, it might influence what we, what our decision-making is, but we tend to gravitate. At this point in time, if you look at the top part of our portfolio from a growth perspective, it still remains the North and the tech markets. Although definitely, Southern California is betting, benefiting from some of the tech companies moving operations to Southern California. I think Seattle is benefiting more from that trend out of the Bay Area, but Southern California definitely will get some advantage. As in Southern California, it's been in this low 1% range for several years. And so to bet that it's going to move a lot is probably unlikely, I would guess. It's a huge, it's the, the largest part of our portfolio. It's a huge amount of people and jobs. ","And so it's hard to make that work. It's a more diversified economy, more reflective of the United States. And so practically speaking, I think that the job forecast is not going to vary by a whole lot. If you look at this past year, we said, originally, Southern California a year, going to a year ago, the '19 forecast. Southern California would be at 1.3%, and we had Northern California at 2%. So we've done quite a bit better in Northern California. It's currently at about 2.7%, and Seattle has done a lot better. So it's really been driven by the tech markets. And so I think our view is ride that tech wave. And we think Northern California and Seattle are the best way to do that.","Trent Trujillo","Appreciate the color on that. And then looking at your development schedule, I noticed that Station Park Green Phase III looks, it's nearly complete and yet construction cost went up about $10 million or $58,000 a unit versus last quarter. Can you talk about that a little bit more and maybe provide some context to why that is and how that's perhaps affecting your view of future development starts?","Mike Schall","Well, yes. We, I've commented actually in the script and many times before about this difficulty of direct development in that construction costs are growing much faster than rents, and it's compressing development yields. And as you see us go from Phase 3 to Phase 4, you see the cost go up pretty significantly. Again, as it relates to Phase III, specifically, it's caused by shortages of labor and longer periods that the building that's under construction and similar type problems. And so again, this is, I'd like to say that we're different from the comments that we make about direct development, but we are part of that world. And so you're seeing the outcome.","Operator","Our next question is from Shirley Wu with Bank of America.","Shirley Wu","So my first question has to do with the supply that you've seen in '19. So in your '19 forecast, you guys forecasted around 35,700 units coming online in '19. So I was curious about the slippage that you do anticipate going into '20 and what submarkets those were, are probably going to be in.","Mike Schall","Yes, Shirley. This is Mike. Yes, there are some nuances here. As to '19, we were actually very close. If we go back to our original expectations for 2019, we're still very close to that number. So I give our research department great credit for doing the, such a good job building the supply pipeline up and being pretty accurate. There was, there have been some delays that were a little bit greater than what is implied on our forecast, but it's really been something that has added a lot of value. What will change between '19 and '20 is the sort of the cadence of the supply delivery. So in 2019, in Q1 and Q2, we had roughly 16,000 units delivered out of the 35,000 total. In 2020, that will go to about 19,000. ","So we're actually projecting that Q4 2019 is the peak on a quarterly basis to supply. So even though it looks like it's the same number year-over-year, the reality is that it's peaking now and will decline throughout 2020. This will have an impact on pricing in that we will have more supply deliveries in the first and second quarter, which, obviously, are more impactful to our 2020 guidance. And, but again, as we've noted on, in our presentation at the BAML meeting, overall, we hit the peak on building permits in a couple, a year or 2 ago. And so we're now down about 13% from that number. So we think that we get the peak of supply as to permits. We think that we'd hit the peak as to deliveries in Q4 2019, and it looks like we get better as the year goes on in 2020.","Shirley Wu","Great. So then I guess, just to follow-up on that. Your strategy going into the early '20 would be to keep occupancy and to pull back a little bit on rates then.","John Burkart","Our strategy going forward, you're saying. Yes, as I mentioned in my remarks upfront, our portfolio right now is at a 97.2% occupancy, and that was very purposeful. We held out, benefiting from the stronger peak leasing season and the peak in rents, which was later this year, again, another good thing that we benefited from. But then we rapidly repositioned the portfolio, recognizing the supply that's coming at us. ","So yes, we will hold out higher supply, but, I'm sorry, higher occupancy, but more than that, we positioned our portfolio, which will enable us to avoid some of the lows. When I say choppy, what I mean is, occasionally, people start pricing units down too aggressively. And if we're in a good position like we are in right now, we'll have the ability to hold back, wait a week and hold back and let things clear up and then lease our units. So I do expect our occupancy to come down some from the 97.2%, but we'll generally favor occupancy for the next couple of quarters, for sure.","Shirley Wu","Got it. So my next question is on expenses. So year-to-date, your expenses are up 3%., but you maintained expenses at 2% to 2.4%. So I guess, how should we think about the rest of the year with just the different buckets in expenses and admin and R&M was a little bit higher for the quarter as well?","Angela Kleiman","Yes. Shirley, it's Angela here. On the expenses side, it's tough to look at quarterly run rate and then try to assume what that means because expenses are, by nature, very lumpy. And you'll see that last year, our expenses ran higher in the second half, particularly in the fourth quarter, whereas this year, it's a little bit more throughout the year. And when we set our expense planning with the team, what we don't do is we don't focus on when they're going to execute certain expense items. It's really whenever it makes sense for them to do so and if there's a good window to do so. And so at the end of the day, you'll see that lumpiness and it's probably going to continue. Having said that, we are expecting to come in, in our guidance range, and we are on plan as far as the expenses are concerned.","Operator","And our next question is from Nick Joseph with Citigroup.","Nick Joseph","I appreciate the color on the operating strategy. And sorry, if I missed it, but what's the current loss to lease for the entire portfolio versus this time last year?","John Burkart","Sure. Let me start. The loss to lease is obviously a function of the market rent versus scheduled rent. And so as I mentioned, we had a phenomenal year this year, increasing our scheduled rent 3.5%. So we took a lot of the rent that was available in the marketplace, the 0.5%. So we took a lot of the rent that was available in the marketplace. And then we also held out longer for adjusting our portfolio, which meant, that said, our numbers are 90 basis points for September of '19 versus 150 basis points for September of '18. But again, because of these adjustments, a better way to look at it is really recognizing that the, if we average August and September together for both years, they come up actually equal. So we're about in the same spot as we were last year, but we drove more money down to the bottom line because of the market conditions and how we played it. Does that answer your question?","Nick Joseph","It does. That's very helpful. And then Mike, maybe just on the transaction market. For assets broadly that are impacted by 1482, what do you think the cap rate impact could be going forward?","Mike Schall","It's a good question, Nick. For sure. I don't think it's going to have a huge impact because as long as CPI plus 5% is somewhere around 8%., the market is not underwriting 8% rent growth. And so you may have some years that you're coming out of a recession, for example, where you might be constrained by those current parameters. But I think the marketplace is underwriting longer-term rents. I know everyone on the call looks at things much shorter term, the markets take the longer view. And you don't get anywhere near CPI plus 5% in terms of long-term rent growth. So I think it will have relatively small impact on transaction values.","Operator","Our next question is from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley.","Rich Hill","I wanted to come back to the supply comments just for a moment and really ask 2 questions. First, and foremost, just so I'm clear, it sounds like supply has just been pushed out a little bit into 2H. 4Q '19 is the peak and that will still have some ripple effects through 1Q and 2Q. But once we get past that, if I'm thinking about this correctly, we should finally be past the supply. Am I thinking about that correctly?","Mike Schall","This is Mike, and we don't have our numbers for 2021 yet, so flying blind a little bit, but I definitely agree with what you're suggesting. We think that the peaks have been had with respect to permits, and we're starting to see it on the deliveries. And so I think it will level off at a level that will be quite a bit below the 35,000, but there's still plenty of interest in development. So we're not saying it's going to a nominal amount. We're just suggesting it will trend down. And I think it continues into 2021.","Rich Hill","Yes. Helpful. And I want to come back to your comment about plenty of interest in development. And Mike, I just want to play devil's advocate here for a second. You've noted that interest rates have really helped your acquisition volumes, and there's a tremendous amount of negative yielding, fixed income, debt globally, by our count, around $15 trillion. Is there any scenario where development yield, or do development suddenly begins to reaccelerate because development yields actually look really compelling on a relative basis, particularly in markets like San Francisco?","Mike Schall","Yes. I mean, definitely, I think that, that could happen. It tends not to happen later on in the economic cycle because you have things that pull against you. Labor shortages cause construction cost increases to be very large. And that is a top-of-the-market phenomena, generally now bottom of the market phenomena. For your assets and rents are at pretty high levels. So compare it to the 2012 to 2016 period where we were growing same-property revenue, an average of 7% per year, that's not likely to happen at the top of the cycle given the constraint of rent to income and affordability. ","And so we try to triangulate this stuff pretty carefully. And what we've thought is, as I said in the prepared remarks, preferred equity is a better way to approach that because we're coming in late in the process. We're coming in at the point the construction begins. The costs are known. The bank financing is in place, et cetera. And similar to one of the deals that we did a couple of years ago, Century Towers, where we would take both an ownership position in a development deal, as well as a preferred equity piece. So we would consider doing that. But the point is we want to come in late in the cycle and, because that's where you get better growth and cities generally are more agreeable to helping make development work. And just the whole scenario is better.","Operator","Our next question is from Rob Stevenson with Janney Montgomery Scott.","Rob Stevenson","Mike, of your 3 acquisitions this quarter, it looks like 2 JVs and 1 wholly owned. How do you guys think about how much more aggressive you can bid for deals in a 50% JV with the various fees and promotes than you'd be comfortable bidding for a wholly owned asset? I mean, does the 50% JV structure allow you to bid 25 basis points lower, 50 basis points? How meaningful is that gap when you're able to bring the co-invest program to bear?","Mike Schall","Yes, it's a good question. Actually, the, we have a partner on the other side. And if we're going to pursue something, which will generally be the larger transactions in a joint venture mode. We're working with them on these scenarios. We generally have a sort of an internal benchmark sensitivity analysis as to whether it's more beneficial for us to be in a JV format or on balance sheet. And essentially, over time, we go back and forth in terms of, depending upon the cost of capital and the impacts on core FFO per share and NAV per share. ","So we're constantly changing the mix. And, but I would say, we're not trying to push the pricing because if we start pushing the pricing, guess what, we start affecting future deals. And so we want to buy properties that we think are well suited, well located at an attractive yield, a yield that works, it adds value both from a core FFO and an NAV per share basis and not influence the market. So that's our basic program. It really hasn't changed a lot. And I cringe a little bit about the thought of, oh gee, we should bid more because we can bid more. We really try to avoid that.","Rob Stevenson","But there has to be some sort of gap there, right? I mean whatever it is, because, otherwise, at this point in the cycle, given your $20-some-billion entity and opportunities are more scarcely capital for you, you do them all on balance sheet, right?","Mike Schall","Well, no, not really, actually. So in the sensitivity analysis that I was talking about, we need a certain premium to NAV in order to utilize our balance sheet as opposed to a joint venture transaction. So just working through the math on these things. And so right now, our preference, strong preference is to use joint ventures. You will notice that we did do one deal on balance sheet, but it was a relatively small deal township, and it, that was driven more by the size of the deal rather than its overall impact. ","So that's how we look at it. Again, it's not in our best interest, I don't think, to try to push the market cap rates down. We want cap rates to remain as high as possible. So, and then it's really the other way around. Our transaction people try to find high-quality deals in markets that are going to grow and then we try to find the best capital to fund that deal. So the transaction comes first. The capital decision comes second.","Rob Stevenson","Okay. And then second question. Year-to-date, average monthly rental growth in the same-store portfolio was 3.4%. How much are you seeing expansion in fee growth in the same-store portfolio, pets, parking, trash, et cetera, and how we sort of reached the point, not only in your portfolio, but it is an industry when you're sort of maxed out on the fees, you can charge the residents that you're already charging $4,500 a month for rent?","John Burkart","Sure. This is John. The fee part of it is running just slightly in front of the base rental revenue at this point in time. But that said, there's a level of change that's going on within the different line items. For example, you have cable and you have the cable cutting, so that's going down. At the same time, parking is going up. And then there's few other line items that are moving, where pets is fairly flat. So I think longer term, there'll be some opportunities. I had mentioned a while ago, we were working with, renting some of our amenity space to nonresidents. ","And at the same time, I commented that immediately, 2 of our peers picked up, that off the call and with our same vendors. So we're pretty quiet about the details that we have going on but, going forward at least. But I do think there will be some level of opportunity with that. The big thing though always is rents. And Essex has always been focused on our assets, on our locations, on our research, and that will always be the number 1 most important aspect of Essex. But we do try to enhance our returns wherever possible.","Rob Stevenson","And how meaningful are the overall fees or whatever you're calling fees out of the revenue standpoint these days?","John Burkart","You're talking a few percent.","Operator","Our next question is from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander Goldfarb","Mike, on the rent regulation, on AB 1482, and then you got Prop. 10 2.0, I thought that part of 1482 superseded whatever local towns wanted to do. So what would overturning, and maybe that's not correct, but what would overturning Costa-Hawkins do given the implementation of 1482?","Mike Schall","Yes, Alex. Actually, 1482 does not affect what current rent control regulations that are in place. So it sits separately from that. So those regulations remain in place.","Alexander Goldfarb","Right. I didn't mean overrule the current regulations. I thought it governs stuff going forward. Is that not the case?","Mike Schall","Well, you have Costa-Hawkins out there, that's a statewide law. You have 1482, that's statewide law. And then you have the local regulations. And maybe I'm not understanding your question. But each of them sit as a separate entity, and they, one does not supersede or overrule the next. They, you have to comply with each of them. Does that make sense?","Alexander Goldfarb","Yes. No, Mike, that absolutely does. That absolutely does. And then the second thing is, Angela, you mentioned the $0.14 to $0.18 of headwind. And I think, if I heard correctly, that was from the early repayments that you got in third Q and that you're expecting in 4Q. So maybe just a question of how quickly do you think you can put that to work. And then, Mike, you spoke about the competition or what's going on in your preference for the developer equity. But clearly, others, your peers are getting into that business. Maybe you can talk a little bit about how you guys view a deal for income versus underwrite a deal that you may actually want to own the asset at the end.","Angela Kleiman","Alex, on the structural finance and, comments, let me just make sure I clarify. So on the early redemption of, that's coming toward us in Q4 of $110 million, that does not relate to the $0.14 to $0.18 headwind for next year because we do expect to backfill those prefer equity investments. So the question really is there will be some headwind because as these deals get backfilled, they don't fund immediately. They tend to take up to 6 months to fund. And so that's one item, and I don't have a specific number for that at this point in time. But I highlighted the 14 to 16, I mean, $0.14 to $0.18 because that's more meaningful from a single investment, and that relates to the CMO that we originated back in 2010. So it's separate from the preferred equity. And that's a onetime item for that instrument.","Mike Schall","And then, Alex, I'll try to hit the second part of your question. So when we realized that there definitely is more competition for preferred equity, that's definitely a true statement. We feel pretty good about the relationships that we have formed, and a number of our relationships have come back for a second transaction. And so we feel pretty good, and we feel like we have an advantage there relative to others. We're a known quantity. We've been in the business a long time. ","We have great construction lending relationships that we can marry with our preferred equity, et cetera. And we've always tried, and I've commented on this on the call, too, to leverage those preferred equity investments into other types of relationships, either by trying to get an option to buy at the end. And we generally don't get an option to buy primarily because the developer thinks it's worth a lot more than we do at the end of the construction period. So that's been a headwind. So you end up, you would take a much lower yield and then have an average transaction at the end. That's not attractive to us. ","We do have a seat at the table. There have been several of these transactions that we've either purchased at the end or purchased shortly after construction completion and\/or converted to a longer-term, lower preferred interest that keeps us in the capital structure. Again, as I said in my comments, one of the, there are a couple of opportunities to do some direct development, and this would be one of them, which is marrying our preferred equity with a direct ownership interest in the deal, where we're coming in, again, later on in the process. ","So we continue to look for ways to leverage the preferred equity into other types of transactions. And for whatever reason, this whole series of refinances, I think we looked at a couple of those deals, refinances and sales Angela referred to in the comments, looked at some of those deals. But a number of them, we did not, we just went on and sold the property and\/or we didn't want them. So again, I think that preferred equity keeps us in the hunt from a variety of perspectives, and it's worthwhile and it's also great financially.","Operator","Our next question is from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI.","Steve Sakwa","Really just one question, Mike. As you sort of think about AB 1482 and some of the other potential legislative changes, has it sort of altered your investment strategy as it relates to submarkets, age of assets, types of buildings that you're willing to buy? And conversely, is it impacting how you think about the portfolio and what you might want to sell going forward?","Mike Schall","Yes. Steve, good to hear your voice. It does, to some extent, I guess, beginning at the, a couple of years ago when this risk was increasing, looking at our portfolio from the perspective of the cities that have really horrible rent control, rent control that basically shuts down new development. It was essentially fixed by Costa-Hawkins in that Costa-Hawkins prohibited pernicious forms of rent control to older property in effect. So I'd say we have been more cautious with respect to those cities. ","They'd be basically San Francisco, Berkeley, Santa Monica, et cetera. But beyond that, I think that the discussion in California has become a pretty balanced discussion in that it's not just about protecting the renter, which is obviously important, and it's why 1482 was a bill that the California Apartment Association did not oppose, but at the same time, don't change the ability or the attractiveness of developing more housing because there's an enormous shortage in California, estimated by one study at 3.5 million homes and probably getting much worse. ","That was as of 2015. It's probably gotten worse since then. And maybe another way of looking at it is, I think, in this cycle, we produced about 5x more jobs than homes created in the Essex markets. So 270,000 jobs to 55,000 homes. So the housing shortage is getting worse, not better. And the last thing we need is to shut down the development pipeline. So I guess we view 1482 as a balanced proposal. We view the amendment of Costa-Hawkins as essentially an anti-growth, very unbalanced proposal. And so that's how we look at it. So I guess it would change it in a couple of very specific areas in terms of where we want to own property, but it hasn't had a huge impact on the overall company.","Operator","Our next question is from Hardik Goel with Zelman & Associates.","Hardik Goel","I've got 2 for you today. The first one, on supply, just to understand your thinking here. I acknowledge permits are down 13% over the last 12 months in our markets. But if I look at the pipeline of units that have been started, that pipeline, whenever it's slated to be delivered, if I just add up all those that have started, that's 5x what's been completed over the last 12 months. So even if I assume like a really high abandonment rate or I assume a lot of it is delayed, it seems like it's a multiyear supply pressure kind of thing that's maybe either in late 2021. Is that consistent with what you're seeing? How would you think about that?","Mike Schall","Yes. No, it's not at all consistent with what we're seeing. I mean here's the problem. I mean the data vendors have a very difficult time trying to weed out which projects are shown 3 different times: by name, by location, by, and you really need to sort through that data and really understand where it is in the process. I know there are a lot of metros in the U.S. that you can take a permit and\/or a start and you can go out 24 months and you have an apartment building. It just doesn't work out here. And so you really have to be involved in a more fundamental level, driving the assets, understanding what they look like, where they are in the development process in order to get a good estimate what's going to be produced. ","So, because for 2020, if it's not under construction right now, it's not going to deliver in 2020. So I think we know, again, 50 units and more is what we do, but we send our people out and they drive the buildings because we view supply as being a critical thing. Supply used to be more scattered around, throughout our marketplaces. It's become much more concentrated. And as a result, we have to understand it much better than we have in the past. And so that's why we spend a lot of time on it, getting that right. So we feel very comfortable in our 2020 numbers. And yes, sorry about the basic data that's out there. It's tough to follow.","Hardik Goel","No, that's really helpful. And I completely agree to 2020 kind of outlook. It's just hard to see through to 2021. And just to follow up on what you just said, what does that pipeline number look like in terms of, I mean you said it takes so much longer to build in California. That must mean that if you look at what's under construction right now, you can see through the visibility is higher for 2021 as well, right?","Mike Schall","Yes, you're right. Yes, you are right. We just haven't focused on 2021 yet. So we'll get there. We'll be talking about 2021 next year. I don't have that information right now. I'm sure it exists within Essex. I just don't have it right now. And I suspect that, again, as you go through 2020, you have a pretty significant drop-off. You start with 10,000 units in Q1 and you have somewhere around 7,000, 8,000 units in Q4. So that drop-off is definitely there. But I just don't have the next steps in front of me, and I don't want to make it up.","Hardik Goel","Sure. And just lastly, if you could share the new and renewal for the quarter, just those spreads.","John Burkart","Sure. This is John. So for the quarter, our new leases were, on average, the, here we go, sorry, 3.4% and the renewals going out in the fourth quarter, 4.5% on average. The actual achieved for the third quarter was 4.2%.","Operator","Our next question is from John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors.","John Pawlowski","Mike, the acquisitions this year have been focused in Northern California. Can we expect the Northern California bias to continue next year if your cost of capital stays advantageous?","Mike Schall","It's a good question, John. The pipeline right now is pretty heavily weighted in Northern California and for, maybe to add a little bit of color to that, we see this rent-to-income ratio at about 103%. So incomes have done really well in Northern California, and so that becomes less of a constraint. And Southern California has not really kept up to that number. But we hope that we can also buy in Seattle. So those 2 markets would be our focus. But we might buy an asset or 2 in Southern California as well.","John Pawlowski","Okay. John, could you help us quantify a bit the choppiness you're referring to in Northern California that you expect over the next few quarters and just be a bit more specific? If, so for instance, if Northern California today, on average, is printing 3.5% revenue growth, if choppiness hits, what does that trajectory of revenue growth look like this time next year?","John Burkart","Sure. So the choppiness really relates to what's going on with market rents at any point in time, not necessarily revenue. There's a difference, obviously. That, in part, was why strategically we filled the portfolio up to 97.2% and are in a good position going forward. So what I'm expecting the, as I mentioned, in Northern California specifically, the supply is twice as much in the second half of this year, '19, as it was in the first half. And unfortunately, that's coming at a time when demand is seasonally slower or lower. So that will impact market rents, and it will largely emanate around where the supply is being delivered. ","So you can, you can imagine, in places like downtown Oakland, where there's a little bit more supply, there will be an impact. But in the sense of revenues, we're obviously not giving out next year's guidance, but we're reaffirming this year's guidance. And it really, I don't see it having a huge impact on us because we positioned ourselves well to avoid that. I think there'll be some headlines of rents being down. But again, I use the word choppy because it's not that they're going to be down long term.","You got to step back for a second and realize the Bay Area is a very strong market, has very strong job growth. There's supply that's coming into it. Big picture is under 1%. So we're in a good spot. It's just going to create some headlines of lower rents for the quarter and probably into the first quarter of next year, and that's what I'm really referring to.","John Pawlowski","Okay. Understood. Just a follow-up there. One submarket that stood out within that broader healthy backdrop this quarter was San Mateo and just in terms of the sequential trends. Anything specific there on the demand side that you're seeing outside of lumpy supply hitting?","John Burkart","Yes. No, that one is really a market that the results there for the quarter for San Mateo are really a result of the market being strong. And what I mean by that, actually, it's a very strong market. And I think our own ops team got over there. Skis on that a little bit. And so we had a vacancy decline of over 200 basis points in that market, which is what drove that number. But that's obviously resolved. So it was really the function of the market being so strong. They got, I think, a little bit overconfident with that particular market.","Operator","Our next question is from Rich Anderson with SMBC.","RichAnderson","15 minutes before the call starts, this is what I get. An hour and 10 minutes in. So thanks for sticking around. But I do want to ask a couple of, so when I think of the Essex perhaps of old, you're always kind of at least a couple of hundred basis points better than the national average from a same-store growth perspective. And you're kind of more, by your standard, more pedestrian type of internal growth today. Is it all entirely this concentration of supply issue? Or are there other dynamics, perhaps on the demand side, that have changed such that kind of a return of Essex as being this premium growth provider are perhaps gone for a while?","Mike Schall","It's a good question, Rich. Appreciate it. I'd say every economy, every recovery period is a little bit different. And so there is no one size fits all. And there will be times when we, I think, pretty significantly outperform. And this business is one, I think reasonable people would agree, that rents and incomes have to grow pretty close to one another over long periods of time. And so, but this cycle, I think, is somewhat different. And I said earlier, from 2012 to 2016, rents grew. Our same-property revenue grew 7% a year. And that was much faster than incomes. And therefore, we created an affordability issue, which we are now mending. And it is getting better.","So we see, I don't think anything has changed. I think we are in the markets that generate the highest CAGRs of rent growth over long periods of time. And certainly, this cycle seems to be pretty strong. We got a lot more, a lot better rent growth for a long period of time, which I think everyone has forgotten. But it's set up this affordability issue, and we're working through that. And you know what, we've made progress, a lot of progress. So from, as I mentioned before, from 2010 to 2015, rents outgrew incomes by about 220%. If you look at that number from 2010 to 2019, rents outgrew income by about 30%. So it's getting tighter. And we are solving that affordability problem, and there will be a point down the road where rents will do better.","Rich Anderson","Okay. That's great color. And then very early on in the call, you mentioned how supply is really concentrated in the urban areas, which you generally are not. And I'm curious if you've been able to quantify how well Essex has done relative to your urban counterparts from an internal growth perspective. Is there a number that you track to see how you're doing purely on that, using that supply observation?","Mike Schall","Yes. This is Mike again. I think that there are just fundamental differences between us and the competitive set. And I think one of the key differences is that we, our focus is core FFO per share growth and NAV per share growth. It really is not tied to the same-property metrics that are quarter-to-quarter, et cetera. And why does that matter? Why would it disconnect? Well, it would disconnect to the extent that you make investments in property or you overinvest in property, for example, which use capital dollars. And yes, it will push up your same-property revenue growth, but it doesn't actually add value on a bottom line basis. So when you look at large capital investments, capital investments that have relatively short duration income, we're less excited about that. ","We are interested when we do renovation projects, for example. We're looking for a long-term return consistent with real estate. And there's lots of things that can be done, investing in personal property, shorter-term, revenue-generating type proposals that can make those numbers look better. That's not our focus. Our focus is on growing income and core FFO per share, cash flow over long periods of time. And I think, go look back at the chart, Rich. There, I think the proof is in the detail. There's actually one chart on our, in our presentation that, I think, sums it up, which is we produced a long-term, 25-year CAGR. We've been a public company for 25 years. The CAGR of shareholder return is 16%. I don't think there's a lot of companies that have done that over 25 years.","Operator","Our next question is from Neil Malkin with Capital One Securities.","Neil Malkin","I just have 2 questions and 5 follow-ups for each of those questions. The first one is I saw that your notes receivable increased by about $145 million this quarter. Is that a change in classification of that remix that I think you were talking about selling? Or is that something else? Some color on that would be helpful because that's a pretty large amount.","Angela Kleiman","The notes receivable increase on the income line is really because we have 2 bridge loans associated with the acquisitions that we provided to our joint venture. And so those are, once again, temporary in nature, but they do generate some income for a couple of quarters of their outstanding until we secure permanent financing.","Neil Malkin","Okay. I know that a lot of questions have been asked about supply, but some, I'm trying to dig into the data. It looks like the East Bay, San Jose, 2 of your largest markets, supply is expected to, as a percentage of existing stock, should go up by more than double. And even if you assume this double counting phenomenon you're talking about, that would imply that like almost all the products are double counted. So I guess, is it just a gross error in the vendor, like Axiometrics, for example, that is massively overstating the impact? Or any, again, any help there, trying to understand because to me, it seems like you're setting up for a situation like we were a couple of years ago when the Bay Area had rents that fell precipitously due to clusters of supply relative to job growth that was not of the early cycle?","Mike Schall","Yes. I might preface the history with I think you're referring to probably 2015, '16, when the Bay Area slowed pretty dramatically. But again, still very positive. And back to my prior comment that if rents get too far out ahead of incomes, it creates an affordability issue, which is like a constraint. It isn't a supply-demand issue. It's a constraint issue. But people make different decisions like doubling up, tripling up, whatever. And so that becomes a factor. Again, back to this rent to income in Northern California, it's currently at 103% of the long-term historical average, which makes it more affordable than Southern Cal at 109%. And so we think that Northern Cal is essentially fixing that affordability issue faster than everyone else. Our numbers, and again, I can't comment on that, as to the data vendor. And we realize it's challenging to get accurate data with respect to supply.","Having said that, as I said previously, we were really accurate in 2019. I give our people a lot of credit for doing the hard work of putting this together. But if I just look big picture at 2020, we expect in Northern California about 72,000 jobs and we are producing about 18,000 total housing units. So 11,000 apartments and 6,400 single-family homes. That relationship is 2:1. So candidly, we need more housing in Northern California, and it doesn't appear that there's a supply-demand issue with respect to that. I mean you would, so I think it looks good. 72,000 jobs should translate to about, demand for about 36,000 homes, total homes, not apartments, so total. And we produce about 18,000. So that still seems to work as far as we're concerned.","Neil Malkin","I hear you on that. I just, like I said, I mean, some of the data providers, they have addresses, names, a lot of details. So I mean it just seems like it's odd that they'd be off by such a large amount. So maybe that's something I can look into more.","Mike Schall","Well, maybe just go back, go back a year and look at what the projections were and then look at what they are now. I mean I think that's probably the best way to do it.","Neil Malkin","All right. And then last one. Short-term rentals are becoming a little bit more talked about. I just wondered, just given the, especially your types of markets, maybe a higher transient or migration-related demographic. Are you, how much, if any, are you looking to put that into your portfolio? Is that something that you're seeing more demand for, more interest in? And if so, what kind of role do you see that playing in your portfolio?","John Burkart","Well, this is John. We are, of course, always looking to figure out how we can maximize the value of the assets. And so we do explore different opportunities and evaluate the impact. What we see oftentimes on, if you're meeting like the overnight type rentals, we see that, that has a negative impact on the quality of life for our customers or other customers and ultimately hurts our overall market, hurts our market rents. At the end of the day, it creates issues there. Having, you can imagine having people coming in with all their overnight stuff through the leasing offices and into the amenity space. ","And they have a different frame of mind, a very short-term frame of mind as opposed to the tenants that live there, and it's their home. So we continue to look for opportunities. And there are some situations where that's working, where people are taking a floor or a building and segregating it that way to basically define different spaces. But there are still issues then with the amenities crossing over. So we'll constantly look at that, but I think it's not a huge opportunity at this point in time unless something changes.","Operator","And this does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks.","Mike Schall","Thank you, operator. And thank you, everyone, for participating on the call today. We hope to see many of you at NAREIT in a few weeks. Have a great day. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation. "],"8831":["Essex Property Trust, Inc.

As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded.","Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions, and beliefs, as well as information available to the Company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found in the Company's filings with the SEC.","When we get to the question-and-answer portion, Management asks that you be respectful of everyone's time and limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you, Mr. Schall, you may begin.","Michael Schall","Thank you for joining us today, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. John Burkart and Angela Kleiman and John Eudy is here for Q&A. This morning, I will comment on Q4 results, market conditions and investment activities.","2016 was another successful year for Essex even the though operating environment became more challenging with each passing quarter. Apartment supply deliveries with large lease concessions intensified the normal seasonal slowdown in apartment demand that occurs every fourth quarter.","These factors underlie our Q4 same property NOI results, which hit the midpoint of guidance range and a $0.01 per share beat to core FFO. I believe that our operations team did a good job of managing the portfolio given these conditions and we greatly appreciate their effort.","We have noticed that consensus estimates for our 2017 FFO have risen in the past six weeks, attributable to an expectation that the U.S. economy will strengthen improving the outlook for apartments. Clearly, we agree that a better economy will produce more housing demand. Although the timing of that improving is debatable.","As anticipated and discussed on last quarter's earnings call, we experienced a challenging fourth quarter and a slow start to 2017. In the near-term, we continue to experience deliveries of apartment supply with large concessions, particularly in Northern California.","Loss-to-lease, which is defined as market rents minus scheduled rent was negative as of year-end and should rebound as we approach our peak leasing season. Therefore, any positive impact from an improved economy is not apparent at this point and therefore likely won\u2019t materially impact our outlook for 2017.","Generally speaking, our 2016 expectations for the U.S. economy were too optimistic both in terms of GDP and job growth. With respect to job growth, the most disappointing result last year was the Los Angeles, which we expected to outperform the nation much like it did in 2015.","Unfortunately LA Q4, 2016 quarter-over-quarter job growth was only 1.5% versus our 2.2% year ago estimate. Measured against its historical relationship to the U.S., job growth in the tech markets over the past several years has gone from extraordinary to good.","Although the U.S. underperformed our outlook in 2016 the San Francisco Bay Area produced 2.8% job growth, nearly matching our year ago estimate and Seattle outperformed with 3.7% job growth.","We have continued to overweight the tech markets from an investment standpoint, largely because it is one of very few industries with above average growth prospects.","In a slow growth economy, which we expect for the next several years, we believe that tax continues to be the best alternative. Thus, we view this economic cycle differently as we have not increased our South California portfolio allocation like we did during the later and in the prior economic cycles.","On last quarter's call, we discussed our 2017 market forecast and in F-16 is materially the same with the exception of lower market rent growth in Los Angeles attributable to lower job growth as previously noted, which resulted in LA 2017 market rent growth forecast to be reduced from 4.2% to 3.7%.","We still believe in our overall thesis as to Northern California that rents will improve as apartment supply deliveries decline, with reduced supply the large concession should also declined given stabilized owner greater pricing power.","While affordability will remain, a key issue in Northern California estimated median household incomes improved in the three Bay Area metros by between 5% and 7% in 2016 leading to an overall improvement in affordability. We expect wage pressures for tech workers and minimum wage loss to push incomes higher.","As noted last quarter, we have confirmed our supply definition to Axiometrics. Although there are differences from Axio due to project completion timing. In general, apartments supply is expected to increase about 11% in Southern California and most of that increase is attributable to a 65% increase in Orange County.","The Bay Area should see apartment supply decline about 9% and we estimate that 64% of the total 2017 supply in Northern California will delivered in Q1 and Q2. The greatest reduction in apartment supply in the Bay Area will be in San Jose at 28% drop.","This leads us to believe the pricing power in the Bay Area should improved in the second half of 2017. Venture capital investment remains healthy, although each of six quarters had less PC investment compared to its peak of 8.5 billion in the second quarter of 2015.","We share concerns about potential slow down in the technology industries. We still see tech as the world\u2019s leading economic engine and believe that leading tech hubs in the U.S., including the Bay Area and Seattle, will be the primary beneficiaries.","The least part of the slow down and job growth appears to be finding workers that have the skills and backgrounds that needed by the top tech companies. We track the number of job opening at the top 10 tech companies all of which are located in an ethics target market, which indicates some 21,000 open positions compared to the 17,000 last summer.","We anxiously await news on immigration policy especially with respect to the H1-B visas. An example of tech potential is the internet of things or IOT. It has taken about five decade to bring the microprocessors to its current state and its usefulness is about to expand dramatically.","Coupling the microprocessor with sensors and actuators while being connected to the internet creates a different time machine, one that is capable accomplishing a wide variety of task in almost every industry in household.","The estimates of its growth are extraordinary, for example, our PricewaterhouseCoopers\u2019 report suggest a massive increase in devices connected to the internet from 14 billion in 2014 to 50 billion by 2020.","IOT products that relate to housing have hit the market and they are mostly focused on single family housing at this point involving devices that they can remotely control a variety of system including locks, alarms, blinds and garage doors.","It is not difficult to image a refrigerator that reorders essential food items or a device that reports a malfunction or leak. With reductions in cost and integration of common item into comprehensive systems, you will start to seeing an IOT devices in apartments.","They should allow us to utilize our [indiscernible] productively by understanding traffic patterns, improve property security, while reducing cost and become more efficient and knowledgeable in our use of utilities. We expect our tech markets to be at the forefront of this activity and are well position for the related economic growth.","Our next topic is investments. We noted on our Q3 earnings call that we expect to be more active in the transaction market in the fourth quarter. Impart that relate to increased disposition activity, necessary given that we did not issue common stock in 2016 and we won\u2019t in 2017 unless our cost to capital significantly improves. Recent dispositions are outlined in the press release and Angela will discuss in further in a moment.","As to the acquisitions, we bought two communities in Valley Village, a submarket of Los Angeles for 185 million. The San Fernando Valley continues to perform well and this area has minimal apartments supply expected for the next several years.","We also converted our preferred equity interest in the recently built 166 unit Marquis Apartment in San Jose into a common equity interest. Being a good partner allows us to be part of the discussion when construction end, which in this case provided an opportunity to acquire half of the property.","Cap rates remained stable last quarter with A quality property and locations creating around of four to four and a quarter Cap rate using the ESSEX methodology and from time to tome more aggressive buyer to pay sub four cap rates. B quality property and locations typically have cap rates from 25 to 50 basis points higher than A quality property.","With most of the reef on the sidelines, there are fewer motivated apartment investors in the market compared to the year ago. Recent increase in interest rates have caused some noise in negotiations, but ultimately cap rates have not changed.","As noted before, we continue to be active in our preferred equity in subordinated debt program, which aggregates around 250 million in outstanding including the two new investments closed during the quarter.","As noted last quarter, we continue to see headwinds to new development deals and believe that the trend for apartment supply is downward in 2018.","That concludes my comments, thank you for joining the call. I'll turn the call over to John Burkart.","John Burkart","Thank you, Mike. The ESSEX team had another solid quarter delivering total same-store revenue of 5.8%, and NOI growth of 7.1% relative to the comparable quarter. Our performance was impart related to our strategic decision to save our occupancy. The team did a great job executing our strategy and increasing occupancy by 70 basis points relative to the comparable quarter.","In 2017 to maximize revenue, we will favor occupancy, yet take advantage of market strength as the opportunity presents itself typically in the summer. I'll now comment on the each of the major markets from the North to the South.","The economy in the Seattle MD continues grow by the rate well above the national average, fueled by both the major well-known technology employers as well as the developing technology ecosystem that is nurturing numerous system start up and smaller technology firms similar to the ecosystem in Silicon Valley.","There are over 30 technology focused co-working office spaces and about 20 accelerators and or incubators. The top nine angel networks and 15 venture capital firm have made over 1200 investments in the Puget Sound area.","Employment grew at a rate of 3.7% for the fourth quarter 2016 over the prior year's quarter adding 59,300 jobs. Office absorption was 2.6% with 5.9 million square feet under construction, 46% of which is pre-leased.","Numerous leases were signed in the quarter by companies such as Facebook, Amazon, Pokeymon, Snap, Big Fish and Big Titan, with activity focused in the South Lake Union and Bellevue Market.","Each of the market performs well with respect to the fourth quarter revenue growth with the CBD submarket achieving 6.6% and the East, North and South submarkets achieving between 8% to 10% revenue growth relative to the comparable quarter.","Onto the Bay Area where the economy continues to grow with employment growth of approximately 2.8% for the three Bay Area MDs, San Francisco, Oklahoma and San Jose for the fourth quarter of 2016 over the prior year's quarter, substantially outperforming the nation's employment growth of 1.5% for the same period.","During 2016, the Bay Area office market absorbed 4.4 million square feet or 1.9% of total office space. Currently there is 15.3 million square feet under construction, 43% of which is pre-leased.","As Mike mentioned in 2016 median household income grew in the three Bay Area MDs while market rent declined approximately 1.8% December over the prior year's period improving affordability.","The decline in market rents has created a gains release in our Bay Area portfolio, therefore although we're expecting market rent to increase 2.5% in the Bay Area in 2017, the impact on Northern California gross revenues will be muted and are expected to be less than the market rent increase.","In 2016, our Bay Area revenue substantially outperformed the market due to loss-to-lease. In 2017, the conditions are reversed and we expect to grow loss-to-lease setting the portfolio up for a better 2018.","The impact of the lease up is now reflected in the market rent. The supply deliveries are expected to be greater in the first half of the year subject to weather delays with some of the pressure abating the second half of the year.","The likely impact will be a reduction in concession for the product impacted by the new supply ultimately positioning the market for a stronger 2018. During the quarter, we started lease up at Century Towers a 376 unit high rise in downtown San Jose, currently it is 13% leased.","Galloway at Owens continued to lease up during the slower demand period and is currently at 87% leased with concessions at six weeks on selected units, which is consistent with the new lease ups in the local market. Finally as planned, we are preleasing Galloway at Hacienda a 251 unit podium building adjacent to Galloway at Owen.","Moving down to Southern California each of the markets performed well this last quarter. Despite LA\u2019s slower job growth the MSA achieved 5.5% revenue growth in the fourth quarter relative to the comparable quarter.","It is noteworthy that West LA achieved 4.6% revenue growth in the fourth quarter below the average while our CBD assets achieved 6.1% above the average. The best growth during the quarter was in the Tri City submarket where we achieved 8.3% revenue growth all relative to comparable quarter.","Technology footprint continues to grow in Santa Monica, Hollywood, Century City and other West LA locations. WeWork, Fandango, Snap and Netflix all added space during the quarter.","Additionally Citi National Bank, which is headquartered in downtown LA signed a lease for 300,000 square feet of space on Bunker Hill as part of an expansion plan in downtown LA and of course, George Lucas has chosen Exposition Park to be home to his $1 billion Museum of Narrative Art with the groundbreaking before year's end.","In Orange County, the market continues to a solid Southern California performer with year-over-year job growth for the fourth quarter of 2.3%, the North Orange submarket outperformed the South Orange submarket achieving 6.4% revenue growth compared to 4.1% revenue growth.","In 2017, there will be significant increase in supply being delivered in the Orange County market with the greatest concentration almost 2000 units being delivered into the Irvine market where we have limited exposure.","Finally, in San Diego the performance across the submarkets was fairly consistent leading to a 6.3% revenue growth relative to comparable quarter. In 2017, the supply increased significantly with approximately 1,700 units being delivered into the San Diego CBD that will clearly impact the CBD market as those units absorbed into the marketplace.","Currently our portfolio is at about 96.6% occupancy and our availability 30 days out is at 4.8%. Our renewals are being send out at about 4% for the portfolio overall which breaks down to 2.4% for Northern California and 5% for the Southern California and Pacific Northwest.","Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to Angela Kleiman.","Angela Kleiman","Thanks, John. I\u2019ll start with the brief review of 2016 results then focus on 2017 guidance, capital markets activities and the balance sheet.","2016 was another good year for Essex, we generated same property revenue and NOI growth of 6.7% and 8.1% respectively. In addition, we achieved core FFO per share of 12.4% for the full-year which exceeded the midpoint of our original guidance by $0.12 per share.","Turning to 2017, our same property revenue growth of 3 in quarter percent at the midpoint reflects our view that rent growth in our market will moderate to the long-term average following five years of exceptional growth.","We also expect same-store revenue growth to be lower than the market rent growth published on 2016 as current in place rent are slightly above market. Our operating growth forecast is 3% resulting in NOI growth of 3.4% at the midpoint.","As for the FFO guidance, we continue our track record of driving operating results to the bottom line and are projecting core FFO growth of 5.8% at the midpoint, which is 240 basis points higher than our projected NOI growth rate. A complete list of assumptions supporting our FFO guidance range can be found S-16, S-14 of the supplemental.","Moving to capital and funding activities. In 2016, we funded our investment activities with disposition proceeds and joint venture capital in lieu of issuing common stock. We expect to maintain this funding plan in 2017 with the common stock pricing remains unattractive.","We are cognizant of changing market conditions and are focused on allocating capital appropriately in Salta. For example, in the fourth quarter, the $185 million acquisition in Valley Village was funded by contributing four wholly owned properties into a newly formed joint venture where we have retained majority ownership and it is what we have been referring to as a dispo JV.","In general, the dispo JV provides for an alternative source of capital to match fund our investment activity in lieu of issuing common stock.","Key consideration to transact via a dispo JV are to divest from properties with lower total return expectation relative to the portfolio. And minimize dilution and rational sales cost via management fees, promote and other economic benefit. Leverage is not a key driver to transact in an off balance sheet vehicle. In fact, our joint venture platform leverage is only around 28%.","Lastly, our private equity platform has done well, currently with a total estimate promote ranging from $30 million to $50 million. We will look to optimize our returns as we evaluate opportunities to monetize this value creation.","Lastly, onto the balance sheet. During the fourth quarter, we retake the existing $225 million term loan and originated a new $350 million term loan, which matures in 2020 and priced at LIBOR plus 95 basis points. We have swapped $150 million of this term loan to a fixed rate of 2.2%.","Major debt maturities in 2017 primarily consists of $300 million unsecured bond in mid-March. Our current preference is to finance this debt with five to 10 year unsecured bonds depending on the treasury rate and underlying spread. But we will be opportunistic as we have several options to refinance this debt.","With a low level of unfunded commitments for 2017 of $215 million, which represents only 1% of total market cap. Our $1 billion line of credit expandable to 2020 and a light maturity schedule over the next couple of years. We continue to be well positioned to weather any potential capital market dislocation.","That concludes my remarks. I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a Question-and-Answer Session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first comes from Jordan Saddler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, it's [indiscernible] here with Jordan. I was wondering if you could provide a little color on your Southern California outlook of 3.5% to 4%. How that breaks off across the various submarkets, you mentioned an Orange County having significant supply this year. So some color on the various submarkets would be helpful.","John Burkart","Sure, this is John. The submarket that what we're seeing going forward is Irvine and downtown San Diego are going to get hit with more supply significantly more than they had this year. So those areas most certainly would be weaker.","As we look at the on the job side, the LA market slowed down quite a bit in employment just broadly, but yet supply is kind of in the zone. But the big hits on supply big changes would really be in the Irvine area, we don't really have assets, very many will be impacted by that and then downtown San Diego. Does that give a little bit more color on what you need or are you looking for more?","Unidentified Analyst","No, no that's helpful. And then just Northern California, I was curious it sounds like it's going to be a little bit volatile or choppy at the beginning of the year with the deliveries more heavily weighted. How would you expect sort of the quarter-by-quarter trends to spread across throughout the year across Northern California? I mean do you expect it to snap back in the second half of the year or once concession begin to abate or more of just stabilization.","John Burkart","Yeah I would call it more stabilization. But one of the good things last year I used the word choppy I\u2019m kind laughing to that we're using it now. A lot of the impact of the lease ups is really in the market rent, as last year was kind of transitioning in, so things were somewhat choppy. I think going forward it will be softer in the first half as we continue to absorb the supply.","As we get into the second half, I think what is going to happen ultimately is some of the concessions are going to evaporate. And so it won't be like a pure snap back, but if you think about it a property giving two months concession, if that goes away as they finish lease up that's effectively a 15% rate increase.","And so ultimately as we move through the year, I think the market will move up a few percent, some of the new lease ups are going obviously be reducing the concessions, and so they will see better rental strength, but not necessarily pushing rents up, per say coupon rents. As we roll into 2018, we should be in a pretty solid position for a good year in 2018.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. Thanks for taking the questions.","Operator","Our next question comes from Juan Sanabria from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Juan Sanabria","Hi good morning. Still just wondering if you can give a little bit of color on, you talked a little bit loss-to-lease, kind of what you are expecting on new leases, may be across three regions and the spread to renewals you are forecasting. It sounds like you are saying Northern California new lease growth could be negative but, if you could just give us a little on that that would be fantastic.","Michael Schall","This is Mike, thanking for joining the call. Our January to March renewals are going out at somewhere around 4% and within that Seattle and Southern California are in the 5% range and Northern California is in the 2.5% range. So that should give you some idea.","As to sort of follow-up on what John just said, because again we expect the supply and hangovers John said to clear over the next six months. And from that point market should recover. The issue that we have is that for market rents to recover, it takes time before it really hits the bottom line.","And so I think this year is one, first couple of quarters being pretty challenging especially Northern California, but in the several others Southern California submarkets is well.","And then as we get into the second half of the year, feeling much better about resumption in pricing power and again, where this weird dynamic where the 1% that are leasing up apartment are effectively setting price for the 99% stabilize donors. So when that clears the market, we think it will be a much different environment.","Unfortunately we will be probably at that point in time in July or August and there are just not that many month, that we can turn the corner with respect to the rent that actually get reported, because there are just not enough months left.","So, I think those dynamics what we see happening on market rent looks much better in terms how they get the number is the part that we think lags and its causing the little bit getter lag then expected as it relates to same property revenue.","Juan Sanabria","Okay great and then so for concessions, how are you guys seeing about it, I guess Northern California specifically is the level going to be pretty similar 2017 over 2016 for the year as a whole, any color there in terms of how 2017, because just because of the supply is still pretty elevated on an year-over-year basis in 2017 and how you guys have approached that?","Michael Schall","This is Mike again, and again it varies dramatically by market, like right now for example in Sunnyvale which is just north of San Jose, there are eight leases ups in the marketplace. And therefore as you would expect, because they are all trying to get 25 to 30 units a month. it's not surprising that there is six to eight weeks of concessions in the marketplace.","That is not true for all of Northern California that is that specific submarket and really is derived from the number of lease ups that are competing against one another. Fortunately I think the trend for concessions is getting better, although slowly in the fourth quarter off course you have two phenomenon that are affecting price.","One is the normal seasonality in the marketplace where demand drops off in the fourth quarter and the second is the continuation of delivery and supply into the market. So those two factors together I think is what really caused a very weak Q4 relative to other Q4s.","So I think Sunnyvale being the key example where we have lots of lease ups in the marketplace. Salta market is probably near that around six lease ups, one to two months free and some of the other submarkets in northern California continuing to improve.","So with demand resuming as we approach our peak leasing season, I think that the level of concessions will be starting to scale back as these deliveries come online and by the time we get into the summer, I think we are going to be look at much better scenario in terms of less concessions and better pricing power.","Juan Sanabria","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gaurav Mehta from Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.","Gaurav Mehta","Thanks. A c1ouple of question on investment activity, I was wondering if you could provide more color on the expected development stuff in 2017 and how are the yield expectations for new starts versus last couple of years?","Michael Schall","Well Mr. Eudy is here, so I'll let him handle that one.","John Eudy","We have as many as three starts plan for this year, all of which are land yield that we negotiated two, three, four years ago and titled prior to the current exaction that are being asked for on new deals being transacted with various cities.","And relative to the amount of exposure compared to say two years ago, our peak will be stabilized out a third where we were at the peak, if I heard your question right.","Gaurav Mehta","That\u2019s helpful. And then as a follow-up you talked about dispo JV as form of expected funding in 2017. So I was wondering the $400 million to $700 million guidance that you have for dispositions does that include assets currently going on JV or is that only for wholly owned dispositions?","Angela Kleiman","The guidance is a net number, so it include disposition. Is that what you are asking?","Gaurav Mehta","Yes sorry I didn\u2019t include both dispositions as well as the asset that you will contribute in a JV.","Angela Kleiman","Right. So its 400 million to 600 million in our guidance range of acquisition.","Michael Schall","Yes, 400 million to 700 million in disposition. Dispositions probably will include some dispo JV activity, but it will also includes the continuation of calling the portfolio. And so there is a couple of different disposition strategies, one of them is call the portfolio, in other words, the property that don\u2019t perform up to the level that we expect and we expect the underperformance to continue we will sale those assets out right.","Then there are some properties that have decent growth rates and decent operations and they will become dispo JV possibilities. One of the things about dispo JV is we can again through management fees and promote and some other savings opportunities, we can get a higher yield on dispo JVs.","But we are only going to do that obviously for properties that we want to own for the long haul. And then every once in a while there is an opportunity to sell an asset and reinvest at a higher total return expectations. So we will pursuing all three dispo strategies and it\u2019s difficult to tell you right now how much will fall into each bucket.","Gaurav Mehta","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Tom Lesnick from Capital One Securities. Please go ahead.","Tom Lesnick","Hey everyone. I guess first off, I know you guys mentioned preferred equity investments that you originated a couple or converted one in 4Q. As you look out to 2017 especially given the development market right now, how do you view the size of that market and how that will trend through 2017, is that a fairly significant opportunity there or is it just kind of one up opportunities.","Michael Schall","Hi Tom, it's Mike, I would say that it is market that we see a fair amount of opportunity, we have a goal of about a 100 million, most of that related to apartment development transactions, again these are properties in our core market that we would otherwise like to own, but they don't generally hit the yield thresholds that we would be willing to put our own money into them as a common equity owner.","And so we see 100 million as being a goal that is achievable, but there is a lot of transactions out there candidly that are falling below the yield thresholds that will allow that to work and as time goes on we see more and more transactions that the going in cap rates are so low that you can't layer in a preferred equity piece with a 10% to 12% coupon and make the numbers work.","So I would say that we have a decent pipeline, we have good reputation in the marketplace, but I don\u2019t think we would be able to for example double the $100 million goal. I think that we will get four or five deals done, it will be around 100 million and that's probably what is likely to happen this year.","Tom Lesnick","That's very helpful. And then I guess bigger picture, how are you guys expecting, I don't know, have you guys done any studies on how immigration policy might impact your major markets over the next four years. Do you have some sense as to the number of H1-B visa residents in your portfolio?","Michael Schall","We have a substantial number of H1-B residents in our portfolio, you have this huge purpose in my prepared remarks of talking about the number of open positions within these big tech companies really highlights that issue.","The H1-B program in general allows 85,000 H1-B visas to be granted annually, I think that happens on April 1st. I think they are somewhere between 500,000 to 600,000 people in the United States on H1-B visas. I don't know where they are per se, because that is not disclosed so.","But it's an important factor and I don't think we know what is going to happen with respect to policy coming out of the new administration for this and a wide variety of things. And so I really can't go there, I can say that from our perspective, we are a big fan of allowing the best and brightest of the world to come into the U.S. and I think that's really important that that happen.","I saw a statistic the other day which I think kind of underscores this, which is about half of the U.S. based unicorns were founded or cofounded by immigrants, which seems to be a pretty compelling and amazing statistics.","So as it relates to policy going forward, I don\u2019t think we can predict what is going to happen, I\u2019m hoping that the groups of people from Silicon Valley that are meeting with the administration are making the same point that we\u2019re making now. But we\u2019ll have to wait and see what happens.","Tom Lesnick","All right. Thanks. I appreciate the color.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nicholas Joseph from Citi. Please go ahead.","Nicholas Joseph","Thanks. Just want to clarify your expectations for the same-store revenue growth in 2017. Decided consumer deceleration on a quarterly year-over-year basis throughout the year or does it assume a stabilization in the back half?","Angela Kleiman","We are assuming a stabilization in the second half as the supply pressure abates a little bit more and also the fleet work through the concession that both Mike and John commented earlier.","Nicholas Joseph","Okay. So, I know its little early for 2018, but would it be fair to state getting your comments about economic growth and what supply that you might see a reacceleration into 2018?","Michael Schall","This is Mike, Nick. You know how we are, we are more conservative. But I certainly would think that 2018 is shaping up to be a very good year. This year the problem is that we start the year with a gain-to-lease or schedule rents are above market rents in Northern California by 3.5% and - I'm sorry by 1.9%, excuse me and overall in the portfolio by 25%.","So, with respect to that systems that we have over the last several years from loss-to-lease, we\u2019re not going to see that. And in fact, we\u2019re going to need to rebuild some loss-to-lease. I mean we need market rent growth happen, if its happen tomorrow it would immediately become loss-to-lease and then it would roll into schedule rent over the next year.","So, a moving rent does not translate into a move in same property revenue for some time. So, we\u2019re in that rebuilding year in my view and as we get into the summer, I think we\u2019re going to see things look much better and unfortunately it doesn\u2019t really help us that much in 2017. But I think it does help in 2018. So, we look forward to that.","Nicholas Joseph","Thanks. Appreciate that. And then finally, what was the gain on sale of marketable securities in quarter?","Angela Kleiman","From time-to-time we have marginable securities that we just sell out. And so that\u2019s all that is.","Michael Schall","We have captive insurance entity that has generated a lot of cash and so we have reinvest that cash and so from time-to-time they would be selling securities.","Nicholas Joseph","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question c is from John Kim from BMO Capital Market. Please go ahead.","John Kim","Thank you. Mike I appreciate your comments and your color on immigration reform concerns. I know it\u2019s very difficult to answer these kind of question. But I was wondering is the 21,000 job openings by major tech companies is that a recent high or high as far as you can remember. And also is your concern at all embedded in your rental projection for Northern California in addition to the gain that we\u2026","Michael Schall","Yes. I mean, 21,000 I think is the biggest number that we\u2019ve found since we've been tracking that and again, up from 17,000, last summer sometime. So, there has been a surge in that. We all know, I think the unemployment rate for college educated people is somewhere under 3%, 2.5% to 3%. And so, obviously, we have a shortage of skilled workers, and that is causing some of the issues here I think in the tech world, because the demand is there for those workers. Those workers are not able to find the jobs for whatever reason. We saw for example Apple\u2019s opened a campus is Austin. We view that as not as nearly as attractive as having those jobs here. In other words, the tech companies may go and build facilities and move jobs to the places where the right types of workers exist. And that could be in the U.S., and we fear potentially, it could be outside the U.S. So, again, this is an important issue to us, and we try to track it fairly closely.","And I'm sorry, you've asked another question and I forgot what it was. Will you please repeat it?","John Kim","I\u2019m just wondering if that was embedded in your Northern California rental projection?","Michael Schall","Well, I think it's embedded in the Northern California actual job growth numbers. And yes, again, what we try to do is create a scenario with respect to job growth in our markets; it\u2019s really based on historical relationships to the U.S. So, we know for example that LA is very close to the U.S. in terms of job growth. And we generally don't deviate very much from what the U.S. job growth expectation is in LA because it mirrors the LA in many respects. We actually pushed quite a bit higher in 2016 because we thought there was some lag, and we were wrong because the job growth in LA is almost exactly the same. The job growth in the tech markets tends to be better than the U.S. And so, based on those relationships, we expect it to do better than the U.S.","Now, I\u2019d say generally speaking, some of these factors, the shortage of skilled workers to get employment rate of people with college degrees and other factors are really holding back the entire U.S. and holding us back at the same time. So, some solution to that problem, some of those problems is really important to us.","John Kim","Okay, great. And if I could ask just a quick balance sheet question, what is the net debt-to-EBITDA including joint venture debt? And also, where do you think you could price 10-year unsecured notes?","Angela Kleiman","Well, the net debt-to-EBITDA including joint venture, that won't be a whole lot different, just because our joint venture is only at 28% leverage, so it's very similar to the parent entity. And so, if you're -- in terms of the net debt-to-EBITDA changed from last quarter, it's more of a transaction timing, it's more that we had sold properties, so we lost EBITDA there and then the newly acquired properties just have not had chance to have an EBITDA.","As far as where the rates would be, it would be somewhere -- if we issue today, a 10-year bond, unsecured bond, will be in the high 3s to 4%, in that range.","Operator","Our next question is from Rob Stevenson from Janney. Please go ahead.","Rob Stevenson","Good afternoon. Mike, why sell 50% of the four older assets into disposition JV, why not sell 90 or something like that, if you\u2019re really a disposition JV?","Michael Schall","Why not sell 90?","Rob Stevenson","Percent.","Michael Schall","Yes, with that. There are some pretty good reasons for that actually. But, the main ones are we have fees; we have promoted interest. And as we\u2019ve seen, these promoted interests can be pretty substantial over time. And there are -- from a structuring standpoint, we would like to prevent a reassessment, generally speaking under of property taxes. So, there are some pretty important reasons to structure it this way.","Rob Stevenson","Okay. So, the latter was really the driver. You sold another -- you sold Downtown minority shares and then the tax, would you revisit it?","Michael Schall","We look at the whole equation.","Rob Stevenson","Okay, all right. And then, given the comments before about starting three developments, I don\u2019t know if any of that\u2019s the next phases of Station Park Green or whatever. But, I looks like, at least from your listing on development [ph], you're guys are starting to run short of land. I mean, how aggressive are you guys at this point in backfilling either through ownership or through option of future development parcels?","John Eudy","This is John Eudy. First off, you are correct on Station Park Green being a piece of the three deals that we think we\u2019re going to do this year. As far as being aggressive, yes, we're on the sidelines and we're looking at a lot of opportunities, and we\u2019re trying to be opportunistic. But no, we're not going to do four to four and a quarter cap development deals to do deal. So, that\u2019s an easier talk than it is an execution, as you know. That said, with the stress in the market, with financial ability being very difficult and the preferred program that Mike talked about earlier, we do think that this is a year where we may be able to strike opportunistically in a few occasions, but we're not going to do it in retail.","Operator","Our next question is from Jeffrey Pehl from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey Pehl","Just a quick one again on investment activities. How are you guys thinking about redevelopment opportunities in your portfolio? And could your redevelopment pipeline grow from current level?","John Burkart","Sure. This is John. We take a very deep look every year at the entire portfolio, sit down in a meeting, go through every asset and every angle of opportunity, whether it\u2019d be unit returns, adding laundry, backyard extensions, complete full renovations like we have at some of the assets. And at this point, I would say, we're pretty much at a stabilized number. If you look at our unit turns versus the total portfolio, we\u2019re somewhere in the 5% to 6% range typically, which implies a 20-year life, somewhere in that zone for the kitchen and bath. On the larger assets, we're putting a few two, three to four through major renovation at any one time. We're pretty much on a sustainable level to continue forward. To accelerate from here, there is few things we're looking at, some opportunities that relate to technology and a few other things but not a lot of acceleration as it relates to major assets or unit turns. We\u2019re probably slow unit turns down a little bit in 2017, just based on market conditions but not huge.","Michael Schall","I'll add one more thing to that that is when you have new lease-ups that are submitting concessions at the levels that we\u2019re seeing, it compresses the rehab return. So, it makes it more difficult to make them work economically. And so, we've seen some rollback in terms of the number of unit trends that we\u2019re able to do. That\u2019s a factor that will be a drag until the concessions start burning the off in the marketplace.","Jeffrey Pehl","And then, just on the development pipeline, how much of that is condo math? [Ph]","Michael Schall","That we will have condo math, it would be two to the three deals.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nick Yulico from UBS. Please go ahead.","Nick Yulico","I just wanted to go this -- back to this issue of market\u2019s forecast in rents that you guys have for this year of 3.6% and your same-store revenue growth midpoint below that. I think you gave some reasons, but I just wanted to be clear on why is that occurring this year?","John Burkart","This is John. So, if you look at the -- big picture, if you look at the economic rent forecast , you end up with 3.6%. Right now, we have a gain to lease in our entire portfolio of about 0.5%. So, if you do the math there you end up little bit over 3% and the difference that gets you to the midpoint at 3.5 -- 3.25, is other value added, those types of things, big picture. The practical side is the rents come throughout the year at different points in time where we have lease expirations. And so, some of the leases are going to expire and they have a gain to lease, so they are going down, while at the same time, the market\u2019s moving up. And so, it never matches perfectly. It\u2019s a timing issue that rolls through. But, big picture answer, it really relates to the gain to lease versus the market.","Michael Schall","Maybe one more thing to reiterate what John said, using maybe little bit different words. If supply abates, as expected, in Northern California, after the second quarter, we would expect market rents to grow. But again, that won't show up in revenue until -- it won\u2019t be fully priced into revenue until the middle of 2018. So, in other words, you can see market rents grow but the impact on same store revenue is delayed to some extent, just to know operationally how this works.","Nick Yulico","So, it seems like this is an issue of -- sort of a timing issue in the first half of the year where you face this pressure and then things get better in the second half of the year. Is that the way to think about it?","Michael Schall","Well, I think that that is part of it, that\u2019s given the fact that we have all this delivery of new supply in the first half of the year in Northern California, which is the primary concessionary market. The second half looks much better than the first half. But more fundamentally, in terms of looking at loss to lease, I think I said on last quarter's call that at September 30, 2015, we had about 7% loss to lease and by September 30, 2016 we had about 2% loss to lease. So, of the reported revenue over that period, 5%, the difference between 7% and 2% came from loss to lease. So, when rents are going up, you are building loss to lease and it\u2019s not been reported as rental revenue. When that flips around on you and rents are going down, you start eating in your loss to lease, and it makes your results look much better than they really are when you look at market rents.","Nick Yulico","I guess the question is whether -- and I think it's definitely helpful to get all this market level forecast you guys give. But as we think about the last couple of years, you\u2019ve been outperforming the market forecast on rent growth. And now, this year, you are underperforming a little bit. And you\u2019ve kind of got this original number of the market rent forecast, it kind of felt like that was a guidepost to where your results could be this year and yet ended up being little bit optimistic, I guess. Do you think about maybe changing that kind of messaging going forward or\u2026?","Michael Schall","If we had to do over again, yes, I think we would change the messaging. I mean, we don't like the market to be surprised with respect to anything that we do. But candidly, Q4 was part of the problem and that Q4 was much weaker than we thought it was going to be and the deceleration that happened. Again, you had the combination of seasonality plus lots of concessions in the marketplace. So, Q4 was just a really tough quarter. And so, I'm not sure if we replay the whole thing again. I am not sure that we would have come to the right conclusion, because I would have thought if we had 2% loss to lease at September 30th, as I just said, I would have thought we still would have some gas in the tank with respect to going into the New Year. And again, I think that as we get into the peak leasing season, what goes away quickly, tends to come back. And so, maybe we'll get a little bit stronger bounce back as we get into the peak leasing season. But again, I think Q4, the underperformance and the issues that we had in Q4 are part of this issue.","Operator","Our next question's from Alexander Goldfarb from Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.","Alexander Goldfarb","I'll still say good morning out there, I think we've got another few minutes. Mike, on the JV capital front, has there been any change from the JV partners for their appetite to invest in your market? And then, if there has been a change, if you could just talk about where they may be either more interested in investing or less interested in investing?","Michael Schall","I'm going to let Angela handle that one because she's probably the point person in touch with most of the institutions on that. Angela?","Angela Kleiman","Thanks, Mike. Hey, Alex. In terms of the demand of institutional investors in our markets, that has been actually steadily increasing. The change is really in the type of products and their return profile. So, for example, three four, years ago, there were -- a much stronger demand in development and correspondingly higher return threshold. And more recently, the focus has moved toward more of a core, core process type of investment. And as a result, the IRR, our return hurdles have also decreased. But, the net dollar interest in our products still remained at a high level and has continued to stay strong.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. But Angela, they're still happy to invest in Northern California as much as Seattle and Southern Cal, or are they focused more on one specific geography versus the others?","Angela Kleiman","They're happy to invest in all of those markets because they're not-- they're very long term in terms of -- these funds are 7 to 10 years. And so, they're not as focused on a one-year supply concern with say Northern California. They definitely understand and then believe in the trade of technology as the engine and driver of growth, not just with West Coast but for the U.S. economy. And also, given the thirst of transactions available in the West Coast, they have demanded just as much as in North Cal, SoCal and Seattle.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. And then, just second question is, again, looking at Seattle, that market just continues to impress and you guys have a sort of the same type of growth as Southern Cal. So, despite all of the supply and all the stuff like union contraction et cetera. Do you have any concerns about that market or in your view the decoupling that you\u2019ve witnessed between San Fran and Seattle will just continue for another year or two?","John Burkart","This is John, Alex. Actually, we respect the amount of supply coming into the marketplace, the market has performed really well. There has been a lot of job growth out there. At the same time, there is -- the supply is something to be alert to, we see some supply coming in at the east side. I can tell you our east side portfolio performed very well in the fourth quarter as it relates to revenue, as I mentioned in the remarks. But at the same time, slowed down somewhat significantly as it just relates to just really achieved economic rents. And that\u2019s typical for the season but it was a little bit more than normal. So, we\u2019re going to wait and watch as we roll into really past Super Bowls Sundays when leasing kind of picks up much more and see how that market performs. I think we\u2019ll hit our numbers, but it\u2019s slowing down a little bit from where we were before, and I think we have the right outlook.","Operator","Our next question is from Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies. Please go ahead. ","Tayo Okusanya","Good afternoon. First of all, just thanks for all the detail on calendar on the call, that\u2019s really appreciated. I just wanted to focus a little bit more on some of the acquisitions and disposition activity. I think the schedule on S-16 gives some basic pricing information. But, I was hoping, maybe you could just talk in terms of cap rate, where some of these 4Q and 1Q transactions were done especially the JV and generally what kind of cap rate just being in most of your major markets?","Michael Schall","Yes. Tayo, it\u2019s Mike. And they are very consistent with what my comments were in the prepared remarks. The JVs and the non-core assets were in the 4.5 cap rate range. So, they tended to be a little bit older assets. And the Jefferson Hollywood deal that was closed was in the 4 cap rate range. So, very consistent with what we talked about. I think in every case, we\u2019ve hit our internal NAV estimates for these assets. And so, again, we haven't seen very much movement in cap rate. We certainly had some noise. I think we had two or three buyers on the Jefferson deal, so some backed out. But, obviously -- and interest rates were our concern out there. But, all you need is one buyer to go through and complete a transaction. So, there is different sensitivity levels to interest rates out there. And there is still as Angela said, quite a bit of interest in West Coast department product.","Tayo Okusanya","Got you. Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then just another quick one from me. I mean, apart from kind of the whole situation with integration reform, everyone's freaked out about it, tax reform under the Trump administration. Could you a talk a little bit about how you guys are thinking about that? And if it could have any material impact on you in regards to your dividend or anything of that nature?","Michael Schall","That's a great question, Tayo. I'm not sure I'm equipped to exactly answer it, because again these proposals are dramatic in terms of is 1031 exchange is going away, are we going to be able to write-off all of the non-land purchase price, buildings that we buy, and how will that relate to -- do you really even a reelection if the corporate tax rate is 20% and you have all these other write-offs. I mean, these are all questions that candidly I can't answer at this point in time. We're just going to have to wait and see. As we get closer to having something written, we promise you we'll be studying it. But right now, we've looked at it but it's just too unclear to draw any conclusions from. And we have lots of other things to do, at least right now.","So, as soon as we feel like it's coming down the road and we really have to focus on it, we're just going to spend our time on other things. But, I got to agree with you, it's potentially very significant in terms of its breadth. I have a feeling that it won't be anywhere near as [indiscernible] comes out. I think it's like the story is going to be much worse in the pipe. But I don't have any reason to know that that's going to happen. ","Operator","Our next question is from Wes Golladay from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. ","Wes Golladay","Hello, everyone. Looking at Seattle, do you think that could be the next San Francisco or is there just enough job demand to absorb the supply?","Michael Schall","Hey, Wes; it's Mike. That's a great question. We have been -- as you know, we've been a little bit reserved on Seattle for the last couple of years because we're so concerned about the supply. The flip on Seattle is that it's much more affordable, rents are lower, incomes are still pretty high, and so it's -- I suspect it's taking some of the jobs that would otherwise have landed in Northern California; they're going to the Seattle area. So, what I think we\u2019re seeing here is the market reacting to conditions and affordability specifically and moving some of that job growth to Seattle. For us, it remains a market that has too much supply, could be let\u2019s say to double down in. Because candidly, I wish we knew with certainty exactly how these things were going to roll out. And obviously, if you look at the quarter and look at the guidance, we obviously don't know exactly how they're going to roll out. But, there is a multi-family supply, the stock of 2.3% expected for 2017; that's a lot of units; that's a lot of multi-family units. And it concerns us. So, you haven't seen those expand a portfolio in Seattle recently, and that is the reason. So, we'll probably see on the sidelines; we're not settling in Seattle either. Although we might sale an asset or two in that area that will be part of the calling process. But that percentage of the portfolio is somewhere around 18% of the portfolio; we feel pretty comfortable with it. And we'll continue to write it out. But it's a little bit concerning to us.","Wes Golladay","And what\u2019s the behavior of the development during -- are they being rational to this point?","Michael Schall","No, developers have a much different view of the world than a stabilized donor. This is what causes our problem, because the developer and we\u2019re developer too, and I\u2019m not saying industry [ph] is not rational. However,\u2026","John Burkart","[Multiple speakers] have 10,000 units in the pipeline.","Wes Golladay","Relative to San Francisco may be, the developers out there.","Michael Schall","Yes, maybe, but we have the same dynamic, I mean -- and we\u2019re like everyone else is a developer. When we have a building, we want to fill it up as soon as we can, because what we're trying to do is we're trying to minimize free rent over the whole building over that initial period of stabilization. And the way to do that, like or not, is to offer some big confessions or the net effective equivalent of that. And whatever that takes, that fills up your building and then you become a stabilized owner and then you're back with everyone else throwing rocks at the guys that are giving 4 to 6 on the street. So that\u2019s the dynamic. And until that goes away, it has -- as we've seen, it has an impact on pricing over the broader marketplace. For example in Northern California, we\u2019ve had enough of this concessionary environment in San Francisco and San Jose that it really started to affect even the markets that were protected initially, like the East Bay for example. And then, again the same thing can happen in Seattle.","Right now, the Downtown is two to four weeks in concession and Capitol Hill has four to six weeks in the other part of Downtown and four weeks in Bellevue. So, I think the concessions in that one month period, people generally don\u2019t want to move in great numbers, to get one month concession, but you start bumping that to two month, and you will find that people will move. I think that the thing that really helps Seattle given the level of supply is this just continued to knock the cover off the ball with respect to job growth. The expectation for next year is we have Seattle at 2.7%, which is quite a bit of slowing from the 3.7% it did in the fourth quarter. If it continues at 3.7%, I think we have probably no problems in Seattle; if it goes down to what we have on S-16, which is 2.7%, I think they are going to see more concessions and more concessions will lead to once again the lease-ups setting price for the stabilized owners, and that\u2019s the scenario we don\u2019t want to be part of.","Wes Golladay","Okay. And then, last one, looking at Northern California, I know a lot of these are just going to be baked in by t the time we get to the second half. But how do you see the new leasing participants playing out? You mentioned it could be good but are we talking here may be 5%, high single-digit, what type of snapback are you looking at, in your base case, assuming your employment projections are achieved?","Michael Schall","It\u2019s less than that. I mean, realistically, what we would expect in the portfolio overall is in the 3% to 4% range. But, what you're going to see again is some of the A product that competing head on with the new lease-ups, yes, net effective is it\u2019s going up in essence 8% to 16% all the way to concession. But if you go across the whole market for our portfolio, which includes the BS, it\u2019s all the way through; you're going to be closure to the 4% to 5% range, somewhere in there.","Operator","Our next question is from Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. ","Steve Sakwa","Most of my questions have been asked, but I guess I just had two quick ones, just in terms of general development activity and kind of what you're seeing from private developers. How\u2019s the landscape changed maybe over the last six months? And I guess what is your expectation for starts and have you seen projects actually get put on hold here? And then, I guess secondly Mike, maybe you could just address where the share buybacks sit into your overall capital allocation strategy?","Michael Schall","Okay. Steve, thank you. I\u2019ll have Angela answer the second part and John Eudy is here. And John and I meet every week and we talk about deals and what's going on out there. And what I hear John tell me week in and week out is the factors of construction lending continue to get - become more difficult to obtain. Costs have moderated a little bit but still are significantly up from where they were. And then the cities are atop in general; there are couple of exceptions to that. And so, it\u2019s a very challenging development scenario. Having said that, there are some deals that are out there that have very low land basis because they started many years ago and are carrying forward a rally low land base. And some of them will be dealt and we see some of them. Those are the ones that typically work for our preferred equity program.","There is a whole significant portion of other deals that have much higher land basis and maybe even developers that aren\u2019t completely in touch with how far costs have gone, that is where the distress is in the marketplace, because they are trying to scramble to see how they can get their deal done. And again, our preferred equity program works really well at somewhere between 4.75% to 5% cap rate measured today, not stabilized. But, if you stop pushing that down to the 4.25% to 4.50% and we see a lot of deals in that range. If our preferred equity doesn\u2019t work, nor does anything else work. So, that\u2019s my view. Again, John and I talk about this stuff all the time. We look at a lot of deals. I mean, especially as it relates to the preferred equity program, there are more people looking at that now. There is a little bit more competition within that area. But for the last year or so, we have had great visibility into the development world given preferred equity and it\u2019s pretty interesting to watch. So clearly, I think from my perspective, clearly the trend is for construction declining and 2018 looking like a pretty decent year. John, do you have anything to add to that?","John Eudy","No, I think you hit on everything, Mike. Clearly, there are a number of deals that were conceptualized in double digit rent growth years that don\u2019t work in 3% to 4%. And when you do the math, there are a lot of transactions that are being talked about that will never get executed. You see the burn off of inventory; we think it's going to continue in the direction that it is going in 2017. It\u2019s a challenging time to get deals done. And you can't borrow any money to get more than about 50% which you could get 80% from a construction lender three years ago.","Angela Kleiman","Yes. And on the stock buyback, as you may recall, we have $250 million buyback program and we did buy back such a small amount of stock earlier in the quarter. But it was immaterial, so we didn\u2019t need to report it. But as far as how we think about that piece of the allocation, when we sell an asset, what we would look to is how we maximize the returns. And so, we look at what are we selling the asset, what kind of cap rate and then what are the acquisition opportunities versus buying back stock and what the stock is trading at that time. And so, it's a relative consideration. But, we certainly -- if a window opens that makes sense, we certainly would execute.","Operator","Our next question comes from Conor Wagner from Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.","Conor Wagner","Thank you. Good afternoon. Could you please comment on the measures in Los Angeles, the one that was passed in November and the one that's coming up in March that would limit supply growth? What do you think the potential impact that could be, and then how that plays into your outlook for LA over the long term, please?","Michael Schall","Yes. Conor, it's Mike. And what was that proposition, was it...","John Eudy","SSS and then I think JJJ was in November than S in March.","Michael Schall","Well, anyway, these are proposals and we've seen several of them, not just in LA but in San Francisco and a variety of places. Then those actually were passed but there are many cases where city councils want more below market rate units, want other exactions and those types of things. So, even though in LA they're actually mandated now, there're plenty of other places that the spirit of that is in play. I think we've seen this many times before where you end up layering on more requirements and then the next thing you know, you build less housing. And I've mentioned -- I made some comments on last quarter's call about just the sheer number of housing demand versus the amount of supply. In effect, we built -- California's built somewhere around a third of the number of housing units that would be indicated given its job growth. So, it\u2019s incredibly chronically undersupplied housing market, and you're finding the political process leading to further restrictions and further exactions on building more housing. And so, I think it has the effect of slowing down housing production and actually exacerbating the rent issue, the affordability issue because if you slow down the number of housing, the number of apartments you build, it will improve the price or rents will go up. It's a conundrum that one would not expect, but this is the state in which we live.","Conor Wagner","And then, since Measure JJJ was passed in November, have you guys observed any changes in land pricing or developer activity within Los Angeles for unentitled land?","John Burkart","We haven't yet but we expect to.","Michael Schall","I'd say there is distress, again within the land area because again the construction costs continue their relentless March upward. And the cities, they look at developers like a problem as opposed to a solution. And so, the more that sentiment gets baked into various places, the less housing you're going to have built. So, I don't know where this is going to go exactly. I suspect that the landholder ultimately bears the brunt of anything that happens to cost. So, if you\u2019re going to have BMRE and it\u2019s going to increase cost relative to returns and it comes out of the land. So, it has to affect the land values at some point in time. But again, I think it's too early to tell.","Operator","And our last question comes from Neil Malkin from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Neil Malkin","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Two questions real quick. First, given the elevated supply environment in your markets, are there any markets in particular that you view as particularly opportunistic or that you think you have a better chance to acquire into, to gain more exposure? Any thoughts would be helpful.","Michael Schall","That is a great question. And I think as rents have moderated here, again, we\u2019re focusing more on Northern California than we are Southern California, principally because the job growth or just the relationship of how many jobs are being produced and what the future looks like as compared to the amount of supply hitting the marketplace. So, I think we\u2019re still better -- in California, Northern and Southern California, you have similar levels of supply, yet Northern California has much better job growth. And so, our preference has been, given that prices come down pretty significantly in Northern California, to continue to be active in the acquisition and investment market in Northern California.","So, to get more granular than that is somewhat more difficult, but so maybe I\u2019ll leave it with that at this point in time. Northern California still would be our preference in terms of making acquisitions. ","Neil Malkin","Okay. And then, lastly, everybody\u2019s talking about immigration and the visas and job openings, but I think job openings is no concern [ph] here; I guess it doesn\u2019t really matter, people who take their jobs [indiscernible]. So, I'm just wondering if you have any sense and I don\u2019t know if you have any numbers, but the people in your residence who maybe are again H-1Bs, are they more in Asia or is it more Middle East, because I would suspect that if it is more Asia, there is really no risk of anything happening as far as immigration goes, whereas there'll be a bigger question mark if it was more -- of the seven countries primarily on the list?","Michael Schall","Yes. That\u2019s a good question as well. And I don\u2019t -- I haven't seen a breakdown of what countries the H-1Bs are coming from at this point in time. I know that they are wildly oversubscribed. Again, it\u2019s 85,000 a year, they get granted in, I believe it\u2019s April 1st, and they go almost immediately because they\u2019ve got many times that number of people that would like to come into the United States. I can tell you that we have -- it\u2019s interesting, 20 years ago, we didn\u2019t have communities that were one ethnicity or from one background and we do have that today. And so, I do suspect that there are more people, but again, exactly, where they come from, I can\u2019t really tell you as it relates to the H-1B. So, I don\u2019t know who's here on an H-1B and who is the country through other sources. So, again, I can\u2019t tell you; it\u2019s changed a lot in the last 20 years.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude our question-and-answer session. I\u2019d now like to turn the floor back over to Schall for any closing comments.","Michael Schall","Thank you very much. And in closing, I just want to note that we appreciate your participation on the call. We look forward to seeing many of you at the Citi Conference in March. Have a great day. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time."],"8830":["Essex Property Trust Inc.

As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded.","Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions, and beliefs, as well as information available to the Company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found in the Company's filings with the SEC.","When we get to the question-and-answer portion, Management asks that you be respectful of everyone's time and limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you, Mr. Schall, you may begin.","Michael Schall","Thank you for joining us today, and welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call. John Burkart, Angela Kleiman and I will make brief comments followed by Q&A. I'll discuss the following three topics: the third quarter results and current conditions; our 2017 preliminary market forecast; and an update on investment markets. First topic, we're pleased with the Company's performance during the quarter in which we reacted opportunistically to rapidly changing conditions. As a result, we exceeded our core FFO per share guidance for the quarter by $0.05. I thank the E team for their great effort and result.","Similar to the second quarter Q3 was challenging from an operations perspective against a very tough comp in 2015. Job growth remains strong relative to the U.S. especially in Seattle where September month-over-month job growth increased from the prior year to 3.5% in 2016 versus 3.2% in September 2015. Northern California continues to significantly outperform the U.S. in job growth although it has decelerated. For example, in San Francisco, September 2016 job growth was reported at 2.6% significantly below 5.1% reported for September 2015. Southern California job growth was significantly better than the nation in Orange County and San Diego and slightly behind in Los Angeles and Ventura. Overall, against the backdrop of decelerating of U.S. job growth, the West Coast economies continue to outperform.","Rent growth continued to be muted in Northern California which we attributed to the large concession being offered by lease-up communities. Job quality ranked by annual salary levels for each industry was another issue in Northern California as there were more service jobs and fewer tech jobs being produced. In San Jose for example approximately 10% of the jobs created year-to-date were in the highest paying information and manufacturing industries as compared to about 32% in 2015, less significant deterioration in job quality occurred in San Francisco and Seattle. It\u2019s surprising that more service jobs are being created given the wealth effect related to the financial success of so many tech companies and their highly compensated workforce.","Our venture capital contacts tell us that there is considerable movement of personnel within the technology industries as the next ways of new product services and companies are emerged. Recent loss of pricing power of Northern California and a few other submarkets could indicate that we have achieved equilibrium between housing supply and demand. We don\u2019t believe that this is correct, and we use historical data from San Francisco and San Jose metros to demonstrate.","For the period 2011 to 2016, San Francisco and San Jose have produced about 440,000 jobs, assuming two jobs equals to one household that would equate to demand for about 220,000 home. The actual total housing units built over that period was about 65,500 or less than the third of the expected demand that would ordinarily result from 440,000 jobs. We experienced exceptional pricing power in San Francisco and San Jose from 2011 to 2015, and the delivery was about 10,000 apartments in 2015 which are included in the 65,500 previously noted that has done little, we believe to eliminated pent up demand in prior years which leaves us with the question of why such concessions are required if there is so much pent up demand.","We believe that the answer to that question relates to the concentrations of supply, the fundamentally different financial objectives of the apartment lease-up versus stabilized community and affordability factors. Apartment developers in an effort to minimize overall free rent over the lease-up period typically set absorption targets of 25 to 30 leases per month. In some markets as many as five leases are directly competing for this lease volume.","That means that over 100 leases per month are needed in that submarket to achieve leasing velocity to be target. Recent job growth has not generates sufficient demand and the large concessions run out of stabilize communities. Two months free rent again equate into 16% annual rent drives that absorption and at least temporarily resolves the affordability problem at the same time. We see this is a short-term phenomenon that will likely clear the market as supply deliveries decline in 2017.","Higher incomes are probably the most important solution to the affordability issue. Many rentals are displaced by large rent increases and search for more affordable housing when rents grow faster than income levels. The opposite occurs when income begin to grow faster than rents which is now happening. In Q3 2016, as compared to the comparable period of 2015, San Francisco and San Jose are estimated to reproduce 6% growth in medium household income, which is the huge growth rate that improves affordability relative a year ago.","As through supply we expect about a 20% drop in apartment supply in San Francisco and nearly 30% in San Jose in 2017, and fewer deliveries in each quarter for our 2017. Therefore, we expect supply pressures to moderate in northern California especially in the second half of the year, assuming of course the job growth was kneeling on track. Southern California apartments supply will be similar to 2016 and will decelerate throughout 2017 with the exception of Orange County, which is expected to have a 30% to 40% increase in supply.","I wanted to provide a quick update on rent control there are ballet proposals during that rent control in five Northern California cities, while slower rent growth has removed some of the motivation for rent control. There are well organized and finance groups that are pushing ahead. At this point, we expect some but not all of the ballot proposals to path. In any events, these measures are not expected to have a significant impact on the Company's the reasons provided in previous conference calls.","And then my second topic market outlook for 2017. Page S-16 of the supplemental provides an overview of the key housing supply demand and economic assumptions supporting our market rent growth expectations for 2017, as before our macroeconomic scenario for the U.S. realized on leading third party sources. The Essex economics we have been estimate how the national economic picture will impact housing supply and demand for each submarket we have selected for potential investment. For 2017, the U.S. economy is expected to experience muted grow with U.S. GDP and job growth of 2.2% and 1.6% respectively.","This year we made three notable changes to our assumptions that are incorporated in the S-16 including; first, we have modified our definition of multi-family supply to be similar to add few metrics, which includes multi-family properties under development with at least 50 units and excludes senior student and 100% affordable communities. We diligence this information by driving each property to understand deliveries schedules, saving and remove project duplication. Therefore our supply estimate should differ from the data vendors.","We have observed that the various research providers estimate supply in a variety of ways often with materially conflicting conclusions. We hope others will follow our lead with respect to using a similar supply methodology. Second, as we approach the top of the cycle development deliveries are often delayed due to shortages of trained construction personal. This causes some development deals to be pushed into the following year. With that some of our 2016 schedule deliveries have emerged into 2017 and the same thing may happen at the end of 2017. Therefore our supply estimates may be too high.","Third, as noted in my previous comments the typical relationship between supply and demand is connected in Northern California in 2016, there is no historical President for the adjustments we made to consider affordability they represent our best judgment.","Notably on Page S-16, each of our West Coast metros is expected to outperform the national average job growth. In each metro again assuming the two jobs equals one household, housing demand exceeds total expected housing supply that's both rental and for sale. The resulting 2017 market economic rent growth is slightly above the long-term CAGR of rent growth in Southern California and Seattle and slightly below in Northern California. In summary, 2017 seems likely to produce a soft landing, thus the extraordinary rent growth from several years should transition to the long term averages in the Essex portfolio.","And now the third topic investments, we experienced a relatively quite quarter from an investment standpoint as outlined in the press release. During the quarter the stock traded mostly at or below net asset value making accretive acquisitions challenging to execute on a match funded basis. We expect to be more active in the fourth quarter with all new deals being funded with disposition proceeds. Cap rates remain stable in the last quarter, with A-quality property and locations trading around a 4 to 4.25 cap rate using the Essex methodology. And from time to time, more aggressive buyers will pay sub for cap rates. Generally, there are fewer motivated apartment investors in the market as compared to a year ago. We don't see cap rates changing materially given the extraordinary amount of positive leverage that is generated when cap rates average around 4.5% and a seven year fixed year loan is approximately 3%.","In connection with our preferred equity program we look at both existing and to be developed apartment communities that are consistent with the Essex portfolio. Recently we've noticed an increasing number of development transactions that don't meet our criteria, typically used due to increased cost of construction and conservative construction lending practices. This supports our belief that 2017 will represent the peak of supply in Coastal California.","That concludes my comments. Thank you for joining our call. I'll now turn the call over to John Burkart.","John Burkart","Thank you, Mike. The Essex team had another good quarter, delivering total same-store revenue growth of 6.9%, and NOI growth of 8.3% relative to the comparable quarter. I want to thank our associates for their daily commitment in providing exceptional customer service and for their enthusiasm in achieving our company objective and helping make this possible. Our markets are reaching a point where the strong performance in Southern California will enable the region to outperform Northern California. Although, this quarter, they both were equal at 6.5% revenue growth.","In Seattle, the strong demand in the market fuelled by above expectation in climate growth enabled the market to absorb the new supply and continue to grow revenue. Our Seattle portfolio grew revenue 8.5% in the third quarter of 2016, relative to the comparable quarter. The CBD submarket outperformed the expectations growing revenue approximately 7%. East side, North, and South submarkets were over 80% of our portfolio located, all grew revenues between 8.4% and 10.8% in the third quarter of 2016 relative to the comparable quarter.","During the quarter, the market absorbed 950,000 square feet of office space or 1% of total stock. Amazon continues to expand with our 10,000 posted job openings and signing another 360,000 square foot office lease for a building under construction located in Belvieu where the Company would founded. Currently, there's approximately 7.2 million square feet of office space under construction with 41% of it preleased. In contrast to the strength of Seattle, the Bay Area rental market has been impacted by affordability and aggressive lease-up.","Currently, Axio shows September rents in San Francisco and the San Jose market relatively flat compared to the beginning of the year. Submarkets that are most impacted are those with higher levels of new lease supply and related lease-up concession. Concessions in the marketplace vary they are driven by the concentrations of high-end lease-up which largely podium and high rise buildings, where in order to obtain this difficult typical occupancy the entire property needs to be largely completed resulting in 100s of rent ready unit at each property hitting the market simultaneously.","Generally, the lease-up managers generously give away concession to achieve certain coupon rent and absorption goal. In certain markets with concentration that supply such as San Francisco and South San Jose, we are seeing selective cases were managers are providing two month free rents or more. During the quarter, we completed the lease-up of Agora of 49 unit luxury property in downtown Walnut Creek and continue to successfully lease-up the Galloway in present and private station. Currently Galloway is 63% lease and in order to maintain leasing velocity we have increased concession to about six weeks for lease which is up some four weeks offered during the peak demand season of the summer.","Office absorption continues to be positive in all three Bay Area market with over 800,000 square feet been absorbed in the quarter. Some of the quarters leasing activity included General Electric expanding their footprint adding their additional 100,000 square feet in San Ramon and Google signing a lease to occupy the entire Moffat Gateway campus, which is approximately 612,000 square feet. Currently, 11.5 million square feet of office space is under construction in the Bay Area of which 46% is preleased.","Moving down to Southern California. The region continues to be a solid performer overall. In the LA market, CBD grew revenues 4% in the third quarter compared to the prior year\u2019s quarter, as it continues to absorb the new supply. The Woodland Hills and Tri-City submarkets continue to be strongest in the LA market growing revenues about 8%. In Orange County, the North Orange submarket continues to outperform the South Orange submarket in the third quarter with revenues growing 6% and 4.4% respectively. With 1.9 million square feet of office space under construction, this would support the addition of approximately 11,000 jobs in the Orange County market.","Finally revenues increased 8.4% in San Diego with Northern submarket outperformed in the CBD and Southern submarkets relative to comparable quarter. Third quarter office absorption in these three Southern California markets was over 1.4 million square feet with San Diego leading the way of almost absorbing 1% of total stock. Currently our portfolio occupancy is at 96.7% and our availability 30 days out is 4.4%. Our renewals on average being sent out at about 4.5% for Northern California a little over 5% for Southern California and about 6.3% in the Pacific Northwest. We are positioned well for the end of the year and 2017.","Thank you. And I will turn the call over to Angela Kleiman.","Angela Kleiman","Thanks, Don. Today, I will discuss our quarterly results, the full year outlook and comments on the balance sheet. We are pleased to report that our core FFO per share exceeded the high-end of our guidance. The outperformance this quarter was primarily attributed to favorable operations, accretive investments and lower G&A, some of which is timing related.","Turning to the full year outlook, we are reaffirming the midpoint of our same property guidance of 6.8% revenue growth and 8.1% NOI growth. As for our core FFO, we have increased the midpoint by $0.05 per share to $11.03. We are now projecting a 12.3% year-over-year core FFO growth, which represents our sixth consecutive year of double digit growth. Onto the balance sheet, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio improved to 5.7 times this quarter from 5.9 times last quarter primarily due to continued growth in EBITDA.","In addition, we received an upgrade on our senior unsecured debt rating from Moody's to Baa1 and from S&P to BBB+ with stable outlook. The upgrades substantiated the strength of our balance sheet and our improved debt metric. The rating agencies also face their upgrade on the solvent operating track record and long-term favorable economic fundamentals in our select race course market. We believe this upgrade will enhance our cost with debt capital going forward.","That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Richard Hill from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Richard Hill","So, I want to just get a little bit more color from you about the comments about the peak and supply in 2017. Does that mean you see supply pressures still accelerating into 2017 and then looking forward into 2018, when do you really start to see these supply pressures starting to decelerate and maybe providing a little more release for me in the reasons that you mentioned?","Michael Schall","This is Mike. Thanks for joining the call. I would say what we are seeing is movement of some of the supply from 2016 into 2017, and we see it continuing at a pretty significant level through about midyear in 2017 and then dropping off pretty significantly from that point. And again, I think that there is a lot of deals being discussed here on the west coast, the issue is because of construction cost increases delays in the cities because the cities are very busy and the construction lending environment which is becoming more and more conservative that is starting to make deals push them off or hand over they are not achieving the level of returns required to make the deals work. So, we are seeing those deals being pushed off. And so that gives us confidence that the supply is underway it will be delivered late and hence the movement from supply from 2016 into 2017 but it gives us confidence that we are going to see a pretty significant slowdown in the middle of 2017.","Richard Hill","And just two quick follow-up questions about that, your same-store revenue growth and same-store NOI growth, should we think about that as sort of the steady state right now, with supply pressures being moved into 2017? And then I've follow-up to that. Thank you very much for the disclosure on high end job growth, that's really helpful. Did I hear you correctly that you thought the high end job growth would begin to reaccelerate as some new products are coming to market?","Michael Schall","We're hitting that one first, we don't know. We can't tell you. We think that, there will continue to be more service jobs created and more services consumed for the reasons noted namely that we have very high income workforce, and we're going to consume more services, so we feel pretty confident with that. We do think that there'll be more tech jobs, again, we think that tech is going through a essentially a retrenchment or really defining what the next chapter is going to be in fact, which is a variety of things for example the Internet of Things, the use of Big Data, more mobile applications, sensors and security devices as it relates to many-many applications and including apartments for example, sustainability in cyber. So there's a whole bunch of things that are happening in the tech world that are being pursued but we're not really seeing it in the job numbers yet. So, again, we view the tech industry as an ongoing revolutionary type of process and -- but it's not a straight line. And so, but we expect it to take on more momentum as we get through the next couple of years.","Richard Hill","And the same-store revenue growth is -- is that sort of a steady state that we can expect at this point, do you think? I know it's hard to project.","Michael Schall","Yes, it's hard, I mean we don't want to get in the -- into giving guidance at this point in time, but from our perspective here, we think that probably Q1 and 3Q will be a little weaker. You have our market forecast expectations on F'16, so you know what the overall view is for the year. But if I were to look at the first part of the year versus the second part of the year, I think we'll have somewhat of a slow start and then pick up momentum as we go through 2017.","Operator","Our next question is from Nick Joseph from Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Nick Joseph","I guess just sticking with that theme, what's the loss to lease for the portfolio today versus at this point last year?","Michael Schall","This is Mike. Welcome to the call. It is September '16, '16 is about 1.9% and 7.2% last year. And it was back in July typically, if we had the peak of loss to least in July was 4.9%. So, it's been a fair amount of deceleration since just July.","Nick Joseph","And then, for the 2017 economic rent growth forecast, when you think about the potential variability of each regions, which regions are you most or I guess which region are you most confident and which is the widest range of potential outcomes?","Michael Schall","Let's see, that's a good question. I would always point to Southern California as being more stable. We don't -- it's more like the U.S., it doesn't have really the upside or the downside typically because you've got more pieces to the economy and they trend a little slower. When I think about Northern California and Seattle I think overall over the long term it grows faster, but it's more volatile and is generating faster growth over the longer period of time. So, I think that\u2019s always case, I don\u2019t think there is anything unique about right now the Southern California is closer to the U.S. economy, Northern California has the ability to move aggressively a little bit aggressively in both directions. And you\u2019re seeing part of that, I mean affordability is the concern about Northern California because demand grew so quickly and we have the great pricing power that rental grow at much faster than incomes and you can do that for some period of time. And but at some point rents and income have reconcile one another over the long haul.","Operator","Our next question is from Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Tayo Okusanya","Yes. Good morning on your end. First of all big congratulations on a putting up such great numbers against the backdrop you\u2019re operating in. Just on the Northern California in general again you look at the aftermarket data on the pin to a very green picture. If we look at your results and you guys are still doing very, very well. Just trying to understand again how you're managing against all that pressure from aggressive developers trying to fill up their buildings, the concession, the store job growth. I mean is it just the quality of the portfolio in regards to owning a lot of the assets not at the very high end of the market. Is it -- what is that actually you guys doing this is creating this kind of massive alpha?","Michael Schall","Well. Thank you, Tayo for apprising to that. I would like to believe it\u2019s because we have the smartest operations team led by Mr. Burkart. So, we\u2019ll get hit more shut out on that point. But I think that if you look at the Axio charts what we saw this year was a pretty weak peak leasing season and so I think John and his team did was anticipate and really understand and execute around that. And so, but I don\u2019t want to steal John's thunder. John, what if you do that was magical this quarter?","John Burkart","I prayed a lot. As Mike said, we think our reaching the strategy typically the software where we\u2019ll do what I call is actually closing the leasing door where it takes certain units and it holds them out above the market trying to identify top potential market rents. And so we make some changes in the settings to bring those units to market which enabled us to gain occupancy during the peak demand period and positioned us very well going into the fourth quarter. That strategic change plus the loss lease that we have taking the advantage of that as well as quite frankly nickels and dimes executing in all different many different places from collections to reducing models et cetera. We worked very hard and I\u2019m very proud of the team, they did a very great job.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nick Yulico from UBS. Please go ahead.","Nick Yulico","Well, thanks. A couple of questions, first on the 2017 market forecast that you gave on rent growth. Are those numbers only for like a new lease growth or is that some sort of like a blended rent growth?","Michael Schall","Yes, Nick, it's Mike. This is supposed to be marker rents and not the asset portfolio but all the assets in the submarkets in which we are invested weighted as if it was our portfolio. And so we\u2019re not trying to make a comment at all about Essex or As versus Bs or anything else. Just broadly speaking what do we expect, the submarket to do take a market rents at the beginning of the year versus the end of the year.","Nick Yulico","Okay, so I guess when we look here at Northern California 2.5% that's higher than I guess where the latest sort of monthly Axiometrics data has been, which is sort of no growth or slightly negative, it is some sort of difference and then you are assuming that there rents actually are growing and across the market next year just trying to kind of reconcile.","Michael Schall","I think the question is that I would ask historically back to you is how many straight lines do you see on these rent graphs and pretty much the answer none they don\u2019t act in the straight line they move. So yes if you look at September alone you'll say okay that's this is extrapolate and figure out where things are going from there I think you end up with the bad answer because I would say what impact as of September the seasonality have on the overall results we already know but we have affordability issue, we have too much supply in the form of these lease ups to operating typically 16% off on your annual rent and then now we have the affordability factors layered on top of that.","No one can get aggregate what each of those pieces means, so by focusing exclusively on September, I think that you are making an implicit assumption that, hey, this is the way, it's going and it's going to continue that way. We don\u2019t believe that if you look at just look at the Axio chart for San Francisco, San Jose and in California markets. There was the point on which we were getting 2% to 4% rent growth, and again trying to stagger leases so that you take advantage of that and make good decisions with respect to building occupancy during the right period of time, allows you to have some ability to manage around that. And so I wouldn\u2019t focus too much on the one September number, but look more broadly at where rents have gone this year.","And I would to assume the next year again will be a little bit challenging in Q1 and Q2 because we're going to be dealing with this issuer to much supply and big discounts because lease ups operator is heavily incentivized, they have a bunch of big units to discount and absorb apartments. And he does so by just stealing from the stabilized -- so I think that dynamic is not going to change and that will have the effect of dampening our results. However, we start building demand in February or March. And we would expect that to happen and that will temper that. So, again we try to understand these relationships and how the rents vary throughout the year and try to make good decisions and execute well around what we expect to happen.","Nick Yulico","Okay, that's helpful. Mike just as a follow-up I don\u2019t know if I miss this but can you give a sense for where new lease growth was in Northern California through your portfolio in the quarter and how it's trending in the fourth quarter so far? Thanks.","John Burkart","Sure. This is John. So our new leases in the third quarter So-Cal were about 3.6% and Nor-Cal about 1% and Seattle about 5.6%, so on an average about 3% year-over-year and where it's trending we're going to the lower demand periods, so I don't have the correct numbers but it'll trend typically little bit lighter, but one thing to remember is that last quarter -- a year ago quarter '15 was a weak quarter so that'll help the year-over-year comps.","Operator","Our next question is from Dennis McGill from Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead.","Dennis McGill","First one just has to do with the -- I think people are trying to get their arms around whether the supply curve peaks in '17, extends in '18 and you draw out the point, I think others have as well, that you might get more of a smoothing effect, as things get delayed and pushed out. I guess, the question is, if you guys look at it, do you feel like we end up in a different place in 2018 whether it pokes up into '17 or it gets smooth outs? Is there a preference in your market as far as one or the other? And do you think it matters as far as the end game?","Michael Schall","It's Mike again. I think it does matter and I think that it's very difficult to look out too far out there because conditions changed and back to the point I was trying to make before there're no straight lines, and it's industry we react based on what we see happening on the market day-in and day-out and again what we see and we see a lot of this with good visibility onto what's going on in the development deal, because of our preferred equity program where we are coming at that 55% to 85% loan to cost ratio on development deals and so we're seeing a lot of deals and we're originating these preferred equity loans on properties that we would -- that would be very consistent with the Essex portfolio.","But I guess the point is that a number of those are ready to go development deals that don't hit the yield thresholds that make them buyable in the marketplace and therefore they're being pushed off and they don't qualify for our program and a lot of that is when you get into the discussion of reconciling costs, I think a lot of that land owners think that the cost are much lower than they really are when they sit down and actually price things out. And that process I don't think is going to change any time soon. It's possible for example that the construction industry will have less fewer projects and they will become more competitive from the cost standpoint and some of these land deals will start working.","But we're certainly not seeing that at this point in time. So, what we've before us is a number of I'll say half the deals that we're scheduled or could come to market or actually getting done because of again these constraints, the cost rising issue, silly delays from deal and planning departments -- they're really busy and the impediments from conservative construction lenders. So, as long as those circumstances remain in place, I think we're going to see the development pipeline moderate as we model for 2017 and you would not expect it to get any better in 2018. Hope that answers the question.","Dennis McGill","I think so, but just making sure, I am thinking about it -- so I think it smoothed out, do you think that ultimately leads to more supply because they make the underwriting a little bit less cautious?","Michael Schall","No, I don't think it's a matter of the underwriting being cautious. I think that -- again we've never seen a pro forma that didn't have the right numbers on it. And so we see lots of pro forma's that have un-trended cap rates development deals in the 5 to 5.25. But again when you actually sit down with someone to price that out it is coming out to be somewhere in the 4.5 to 4.75 range. And that pressures the numbers in terms of how much equity you need and some of the other constraints. And begin very conservatively lenders, lenders that have a huge balance sheet that are somewhere in 55% to 60% loan-to-cost ratio et cetera.","So, I don\u2019t see that, I don\u2019t see that will see that changing I don\u2019t see construction cost moderation happening in the very short-term again if developers become or if the developers become less busy, I\u2019m contractors becomes less busy and cost are down and maybe some of these deals will made it through. But, again right now I feel pretty confident and our forecast in terms of first half of 2017 be in a bit heavy and then abating each quarter throughout 2017 in the second half of the year been much better. So, I feel very confident in that although again like we\u2019re seeing before there could be some movement of projects quarter-to-quarter as delays and other things happen.","Dennis McGill","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then and you did mention the preferred equity program. Can you just give us an update on how you see that pipeline it seems this quarter was as their resignation quarter and heavy relative to the outlook that you gave last quarter? Are you seeing more opportunity or that opportunity expand?","Michael Schall","Yes. I think, what I would say about that, so we\u2019re at 186 million outstanding and we did few deals that funded a few million dollars this quarter. We have a pipeline of around 50 million, but and talking to our team there they are again lot of deals of this business, they can make work. And so they it is not like we have 30 deals and we\u2019ll pick in deals the best of it, it\u2019s more or like we\u2019re looking at the lot of deals and somewhere around half of them are making sense to the other half or again not producing the returns. One would normally expect that you\u2019re going to take development.","And I would, but that's against the context of looking at an acquisition and an acquisition you can lock in somewhere around 4.5 cap rate, with seven year loan in around 3% range. So you have a huge amount of positive leverage. So, I guess I would say, why would you take all that development risk when there is so much positive leverage on existing acquisition all things being equal. So, I think that the alternatives with respect to where capital get allocated are putting in interest in and it means that development deals plenty of handful into the development deals at lower yield because there is another alternative out there that is better economic and certainly risk rewards.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tom Lesnick from Capital One. Please go ahead.","Tom Lesnick","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Most have been answered already, but just wanted to adjust subjective buybacks since you\u2019re share price still looks relatively discounted, any update or thoughts on that?","Angela Kleiman","Well, as you may recall we have a $250 million program in play and we\u2019ve always been opportunistic when it comes to us capital allocation and we plan to continue to do so. And so, we had a small purchase, but not enough as it relates to subsequent investments to the very small amount. And like I said, we're just continuing to be opportunistic on that front.","Tom Lesnick","And I guess where the stock is trading today, how do you evaluate that as opportunity against your overall investments?","Michael Schall","I think we like the better yesterday. It's interesting I mean the one thing I would add that it's a continue conversation between Angela and me is that it's isn\u2019t like we can sell our whole portfolio primarily because the cost to routine tax planning etcetera we have somewhere around a 1 billion dollars, so we call sell relatively easily. You need to pay us special dividend and\/or buy shares back, we don\u2019t really care about which of those we might want to do. But I guess the point is there are some assets that are many assets that we had huge games on the business large difference between while we pay as property tax as wasn\u2019t what the buyer pays his property tax and the buyer will cap out that difference and you get a lower value.","So, there is something there is a headwind in California to large scale dispositions and we purchase transactions and so we have essentially gone through our portfolio and categorize them by type and so we have a list of assets that we know we can sell, we have a calling portfolio, we have opportunistic sale portfolio and again we are just trying to get the relationships right but we are not going to do it if it has a very small impact with much rather weight for opportunities to see meaningful differences between the value of the real estate portfolio and the value of the share and so we are going to be patient on that. As Angela said we did execute on debt repurchase and so that will give you some ideas that we're interested in it and following through.","Tom Lesnick","That's really helpful. And just one last one from me, I think you mentioned the aggregate loss lease figure earlier in the call, but I was wondering if you can provide that between your three portfolio segments?","John Burkart","Yes, sure. This is John Burkart. So, the aggregate as we said is about 1.9% and that breaks down with Southern Cal at about 3.4%, the Bay Area with a slide gains in lease at this point in time about 40 basis points, and then Seattle add about 2.6%.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rich Hightower from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Rich Hightower","So, another sort of twist on the loss to lease question, so and I don\u2019t know if you can answer this readily on this call, but I'm trying to get a sense of what loss to lease has represented in terms of Essex's outperformance tend to your rent growth versus the market rent growth or your competitors rent growth over the past couple of years, if you could attribute that outperformance the last at least if you can attribute part of it to that a revenue management just trying to get a sense of the split there again attribution of outperformance I guess.","John Burkart","I'll take a shot at it and if Mike wants to follow up, but ultimately loss to leases is the product that of rent growth, right. So, it's assets by acted in the marketplace and are we investing the right locations? What's the rent growth look like? And then loss to leases is drives by what we actually rent at versus where the markets at? So, at Essex we've had very strong markets. As Michael said many times on the call, we had a self-imposed rent cap that we put in at basically 10%, that has plus the market strength has led to loss to lease growth over time and over the last year as we said earlier, about a year ago we were about 7.2% loss to lease now we're about 1.9% loss to lease, so you can see that a big portion of that has rolled through to the bottom line. Does that basically answer your question?","Rich Hightower","And then my second and final question is just on Seattle, I think you guys quoted renewals running around 6% and change in the Pacific Northwest earlier in the prepared comments and then when I compare that to the market forecast for next year around 4.5% and then also measuring that again it's around 8% which is what you guys have done so far in 2016, I'm just wondering what all that implies in terms of new lease growth in Seattle for next year? It sounds like it should be pretty low to get to kind of those numbers when you tie it all together?","Michael Schall","We think we've laid out -- in our supplemental we see as rental growth rate whereas 4.6% for next year for the market place. As it relates to the renewals for the fourth quarter, what we say, what we're setting at this point in time, that's going to be a function of the leases in place that are there. And as you get to the fourth quarter you got to pull back a little bit, but we're setting it now like 90 days in advance or 60 to 90 days in advance. So, the renewals are very strong. I won't look at that as staying the market is not strong.","John Burkart","I think, let me add something important to that. In Seattle, we have two couple of things that have happened, so we have supply in '16 estimated as 9,800 units, this is multifamily. So we have that increasing to about 10,900 units and we have job growth decelerating from 3.5 to 2.7. So, now will that happen, exactly like that? I'm not sure, but again our market forecast is based on a scenario and those are the two key inputs in the scenario so we have some moderation of market rent growth in Seattle, again this is market growth on F'16. It does not include loss to lease.","Operator","Our next question is from John Kim from BMO Capital Market. Please go ahead.","John Kim","I think John mentioned in his prepared remarks, that pick up in office net absorption in some of your markets and I realized there's different supply and leasing dynamics but I'm just wondering if you -- office leasing has the leading or lagging indicator to your market?","John Burkart","This is John. From our perspective we look at that, we try to look at a variety of pieces and that's one of them to understand A do we have enough space that's going to be available which is via optimal measuring construction because we've got such jobs -- strong job growth, we've enough space for the people and then B is that space being leased up, in another words so the Company is making decisions, real capital decisions preparing for the people. And so that's why we bring that up and somewhat is a leading indicator, confirmation of our jobs numbers.","John Kim","And then on Page S-8, you had an increase sequentially in both turnover and financial occupancy and I'm wondering how we should read that?","John Burkart","Turnover, yes I look at it as it from a yearly perspective. So, if you look at year-to-date our turnover for the portfolio is about 55% that\u2019s up about 1% from last year year-to-date and its pretty consistent there.","John Kim","But are you leasing second year faster or turning over units quicker?","John Burkart","We are and it's kind of get about to the change of strategy where the software would typically holds unit vacant at above market rent trying to find the peak of the market so to speak. And so we're making that modification and a few others we\u2019ve reduced our vacant days down.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rich Anderson from Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.","Rich Anderson","Thanks. And still good morning. So, it\u2019s unlike if we use a word analogy you were a mood ring did you wear that in the last year it would be kind of nice shade of blue and it\u2019s now kind of brownish. I don\u2019t know if you wear mood ring, but it did that would probably be the right analogy. And you\u2019re talking about the soft lending scenario in 2017. But so often our expectations of whatever happens to the future, it\u2019s hard identify until they actually happen. So, the point is, I know you\u2019ve mentioned behaviors of municipalities and behaviors of lenders to kind of cut off the supply chain to some degree. But is that all that\u2019s kind of pinging on what could either pivot from being a soft lending to something materially worst than that, because if you were to kind of just plod how your view has changed over the past year, it would suggest that it could be something worst than that soft lending in 2017?","Michael Schall","Well, Rich only you could phrase a question like that. I appreciate it, I guess I would say I\u2019m not sure what color this should translate into is, I would say is we are cautiously optimistic.","Rich Anderson","Well, green is jealous.","Michael Schall","Okay. Well, we need to send me that wheel, the motion wheel. But, I think we are cautiously optimistic. We think we\u2019re, it feels timing to be like starting to be late cycle and so that is one element of caution be the weaker GDP report looks great, but the jobs are decelerating. So, we see a lot of inconsistencies out there in the marketplace and that cause the great deal is concern. We feel pretty good about the supply projections, there is been a lot of time on them. If we miss that, it\u2019s our bad. So the broader issue I think is what goes on in the economy, and we\u2019re always concerned about that and especially over the last several years where we just every time it seems like we\u2019re getting a little bit of momentum something come better to wood work to knock it again down.","So, I guess cautious optimism is what I would get, as it relates back to supply, just look back. So, if you get, what there's been 7% to 12% rent growth in Northern California for four years guess what\u2019s going to happen, every piece of land it's available to put some apartments and its going to be build. And that is predictable. And so the current pipeline deliveries is really a function of the extraordinary rent growth we had over the last several years. Normally, half of those sights there were some portion of those sites would not have been build able and so and then this is what always seems to happen as they get delivered in a different economic environment and soften conditions further so this is what causes the greater volatility of Northern California and Seattle again with better long-term growth rates overtime.","So I think it's just various function of what's happened in the function of history again huge rent growth making every deal work and then have been all of that hit the development pipeline at the same time and then delivered at the same time. Again as you are looking at development deal today versus looking on it two or three years ago it is completely different world out there you don\u2019t have the expectation of rent growth that you had couple of years ago you don\u2019t have this financing infrastructure from the banks and specialty that have become much more conservative and you got a backlog in the cities and a variety of other constraints so we feel very comfortable that we are not materially up as it relates to with the current conditions and what's going to be build that comes out of this for those reasons. So again from my perspective it's all about the economy.","Rich Anderson","Okay, I guess as it seems to me that you get 12% rent growth then you're destined to get, have these wide swings as you describe, but I guess it's just, maybe different this time I don\u2019t know, but if you recall back to when the year to before Northern California went to heck. And if you guys saw that coming as clearly or do you think it's just there is so much more information well now you just had a at more of an advantage to see this things coming a little bit more clearly?","Michael Schall","Well, I think to comment we saw the supply coming definitely where we miss is what's going on with the economy when the economy paying, so we didn\u2019t see how correctly the mortgages became in 2007 and 2008. We didn\u2019t know that. And then the impact of that was something that clearly we didn\u2019t see, we have I think a very good idea what the supply was going to be. But I don\u2019t really, and again this is where our asset doubles, something that keep you awake at night because we just didn\u2019t see that asset double develop.","And we didn\u2019t see if lowered up in the days when you go back into the internet boom\/bust period we will be coming a lot more conservative. We were moving our portfolio pretty dramatically from Northern California to Southern California because we didn\u2019t believe in the rents and we didn\u2019t believe in the sustainability. And so actually I think that we play out when pretty well, but again did we see the magnitude of the economic sort of disaster that happen when the internet companies in floated, no I don\u2019t think we've got that one right either.","Operator","Our next question is from Conor Wagner from Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.","Conor Wagner","And as you guys, you mentioned the development is leasing up and the aggressive pace or at the pace that they had to do there. How do you guys anticipate things going when most of these lease up turned within a year of the development. Do you have any idea what impact that will have on the market or are you trying to position yourself for that in anyway?","Michael Schall","Conor, it's a great question. I will just start trying to figure out how to put that into my call comments because I think it remains to be seen, it's enormous question. Developers, there's a limit on which they can offer concession and that limit in effect what it does is it pressures the first renewal to huge extent. And if you're -- in essence, it becomes a something that fills up their buildings quickly sometimes with the wrong tenants, and so when there're first lease renewal come, you end up with either another concession or people that have to leave in fairly large numbers.","So, I'm not sure exactly how that's going to play out, I think that that is been big problem with a lot of people that are moving into San Francisco for example or San Jose because they can now afford it. And even though they are relying on that 16% concession in order to make those numbers work I think you're going to see a change because each of those newly developed apartment communities go from being a leased up with their very unique financial equations to be stabilized owner and when they do I think there's going to be a lot of people who're going to be shocked within their resident pool.","In our experience one month it's no problem, at two months it begins to be a problem as it relates to your tenant base cannot generally pay market rent and they end up with this problem on the renewal. And you start getting above two months you end up with a real problem. And I think that we're starting to see that as John noted in his comments. There are some two plus months concessions out there by the time we added free parking and a variety of other things and I think that's going to make for a very ugly first renewal on those buildings.","Conor Wagner","And the impact they'll have on your pricing power or is that sounds like negative for owners who've stabilized that?","Michael Schall","No, no, I don't think so. I think you go back into normal supply and demand. People that can't afford it have to move into more affordable housing which means longer commutes for them and or double ups. And so I think it's a good thing for us because again they become a stabilized owner, they're -- right now they're disconnected from the stabilized ownership. We've got two different constituencies with dramatically different financial objectives. So, as soon they become a stabilized owner they're interested in generating the most rent they can.","They're going to have a messy situation in dealing with the people that they let in. They can't afford to pay mark up rent. And you're just going to see another transition within the renter pool. I think it's all better because net-net the places that the properties of best locations and the best property will go back to having the pricing power that they normally have whereas the secondary or tertiary areas are going to have people moving to them that they will probably they will underperform and the better areas will recover these 16% rent with their loss or some portion of that. So, it's good for the area.","Conor Wagner","And then with the diminished outlook the rent growth in the Bay Area, 2017 does that change your ability to do revenue enhancing CapEx in the region or the economics there?","Michael Schall","I'm afraid it does, because again if they can offer on your A product to 16% discount you're going to compress As and Bs and the -- we have premium somewhere between the difference between the A rent and the B rent and so your premiums that you're going to achieve on your rehab properties will likely change a little bit and then be lower. And so, from our perspective, I would aspect the volume of turns in our rehab program to moderate or decline, and as we become more selective and find the market that can get the premiums that we need in order to make the number for us.","Operator","Our next question is from Drew Babin from Robert. W. Baird. Please go ahead.","Drew Babin","Hi. Quick question on your expense growth side given the market forecast from the deceleration from next year is there anything you might be differently next year relative to this year in terms of running when you normally do earnings that you\u2019re doing specifically there?","John Burkart","Yes. This is John. A couple of comments there, to the skit market get slower there is commonly and there is been a little bit more on market. So, cutting back to necessarily work in that spend but, we are pretty focused on procurement and FX and really refining some of our pricing and taking advantage of our largest scale here. So, that\u2019s working for us at this point in time. And I think that two will work together will end up that at a reasonable spot. But, normally when the market slows down there is been a little bit more in marketing and that\u2019s often which is expenses up a little bit.","And the other thing just to note, in California we have the minimum wage growth so that is effecting lower wage positions like the turnover, the landscape security the effective rate going up at about a 7.5% rate a year, it\u2019s not the same each year, but effectively that\u2019s what\u2019s happening for several years so that is putting pressure, upward pressure on those different area and where we\u2019re working to offset that various ways.","Drew Babin","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And secondly, Alameda County had posted -- it wasn\u2019t the worst, but had a decent amount of sequential revenue growth deceleration. Is that a product that Alameda County just having the most robust growth last year? Or is that an indication that the new supply in downtown San Francisco, San Jose the impression expression are aggressive but not to draw from lower price point further out in the suburbs?","John Burkart","Yes, it\u2019s more of the later. It\u2019s a -- it's benefitted from people moving out there for affordability and now you can see the reverse of that as people search them back as there is not as much rent pressure in San Francisco and San Jose.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Kodish from Canaccord. Please go ahead.","Michael Kodish","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I just have a one quick one. And I\u2019m sorry if you answer this previously but, in your developments at 500 fulsome, I believe cost went up about 35 million on the \u2013 underlying assumption changed. Do you know what drove that cost increase?","Michael Schall","I do. This is Mike Schall again. The same things that we\u2019ve been talking about as it relates to the broader issues and development it was driven by delays number one in terms of getting through the city process and construction cost growing at double-digit rates which out-script our expectations for that property. And so, again back to these conditions that are leading to lower supply obviously we\u2019re not immune from those conditions and that 500 fulsome deal is a good example of that.","Michael Kodish","And is the same thing kind of happening with the Galloway Hacienda and Pleasanton? I mean, is that part of the under the same issues there?","Michael Schall","No, it really isn\u2019t because that was started couple of years ago, so again 500 fulsome we just signed the contract with the general contractor. Finish up the city requirements. We hope to have done that several months ago. And again the delays and movement of cost increases are really the reason for that cost bust. And Hacienda was fortunately done before that. Again, this is one of the reasons why we are trying to decelerate the development pipeline. The bottom of the cycle we end up with really good cruise because it's not that much going on. Cities are helpful, trying to push deal through. At the top of the cycle, it's sort of the opposite. The cities are trying to increase fees, increase supportability requirement; have greater say in the product that's been built. They are less motivated actually to get the construction workers back working because the construction workers are really busy. And so, this is why we tail back the development at the top of the cycle.","Michael Kodish","Thanks, that's very helpful. And then just one follow-up on that, with cost up and pricing power down, how is that affected your yield functions on 500?","Michael Schall","It was certainly had an impact. I think were in the 4 and 3 quarter percent expected cap rate un-trended 500 fulsome where I was somewhere around the 5 to 4.","Operator","Our last question will come from Jordan Saddler from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Austin Wurschmidt","Hi, guys. It's Austin Wurschmidt, here. Mike, you mentioned early in the call that the concentration of supply is contributing to the heavy concessions by developers, and I was just wondering if that concentrations spreads further out. And if so, could we see that concessions start to abate before our overall supply actually abate?","Michael Schall","That's a good question, we do have some increase in Oakland for example in terms of development but again off a very small base and so we don\u2019t see that is that's a major issue. I think it has more to do with California's Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 where California is trying to create a residential model that is going vertical as opposed to horizontal and trying to eliminate urban sprawl. And the way to do that is to have high density projects on all the major transit hubs. So, later seeing is greater concentrations of apartment buildings and actually condos and other housing in an effort to become more efficient from an environmental perspective.","And I don\u2019t think that that changes, so I think that, again, in the Bay Area, we need to go through a map which is upgrade of our public transit system and but I think you are going to see more and more residential construction just on the main trends at lines at all in that urban core I do not think that's going to change anytime in the next several years. And I think, if that access a further supply constraint that is a more recent phenomena.","Austin Wurschmidt","Thanks for that. And then just lastly on the investment side you mentioned last quarter you were previously working on some acquisitions. Did those just get push further out or does anything change with the deals you were previously looking at?","Michael Schall","No, we do have some acquisitions that remained in the process. We're trying to 10\/31 Exchange which has caused us to push out some of the closing dates. And again, we'll be more active in the fourth quarter, so you'll start seeing a few deals closed, again funded with disposition proceeds.","Operator","I'd now like to turn the floor back over to management for any closing comment.","Michael Schall","Thank you. While in closing, we appreciate your participation on the call and look forward to continuing the conversation with many of you at the NAREIT Conference in a couple of weeks. So have a great weekend. Take care. Thank you.","End of Q&A","Operator","This concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time."]}}
