As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. ","I will now turn the conference over to Drew Vollero, Senior Vice President of Corporate Strategy and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Drew Vollero","Thanks Stephanie. As you know, this morning we reported Mattel's 2014 fourth quarter and fiscal year end results. We've provided you with a slide presentation to help guide our discussion today. The slide presentation and the information required by Regulation G regarding non-GAAP financial measures is available on the Investors media section of our corporate website, corporate.Mattel.com.","In a few minutes, Chris Sinclair, Mattel's Chairman and Interim CEO, and Kevin Farr, Mattel's CFO, will provide comments on the results and the call will be opened for your questions.","Certain statements made during the call may include forward-looking statements relating to the future performance of our overall business, brands and product lines. These statements are based on currently available information that are subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties which may cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. We describe some of these uncertainties in the risk factors section of our 2013 annual report on Form 10-K and our 2014 quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and in other filings we make with the SEC from time to time, as well as in other public statements. Mattel does not update forward-looking statements and expressly disclaims any obligation to do so. ","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Chris.","Chris Sinclair","Thanks, Drew, and good morning everyone. I want to thank you for joining us today. It\u2019s been a busy week for all of us here at Mattel. By now you\u2019ve had a chance to review our preliminary fourth quarter and fiscal year 2014 earnings results, as well as the full earnings release that we issued this morning. Before I get into the results, I\u2019d like to take a moment to describe why the board decided to make the leadership change that we announced on Monday. After that I\u2019ll quickly recap our performance for the fourth quarter and the full year and I\u2019ll talk about what I\u2019m focused on as we work to drive improved profitability at Mattel. Kevin is then going to take you through our results in more detail and we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions. ","Let me start by saying that Mattel has a unique leadership position in the toy industry. Given our unmatched portfolio of brands, our global scale of infrastructure, and our strong balance sheet. We also have a strong management team, along with our many talented employees around the world. Now we appreciate Bryan\u2019s efforts and contributions over the years, but the board determined that it\u2019s time for new leadership to change the trajectory of the business and to maximize our potential going forward, and certainly to take advantage of our many assets. I\u2019m honored that the board selected me to serve as Chairman and Interim CEO and I assure you that I\u2019m committed to delivering improved performance. Having served as a member of Mattel\u2019s board of directors since 1996, and as the independent lead director since 2011, I know the company well and I have tremendous confidence in our ability to revitalize this business as we work to identify the right leader for Mattel\u2019s next phase of growth and value creation. ","Now let me shift gears and turn to our fourth quarter and to our full year 2014 results. Quite simply, our results were not acceptable. So what happened? While our performance was impacted by a number of factors, some of which were out of our control, but most of which were not. As evidenced by the declining POS momentum in the fourth quarter, the company did not execute well during the holiday season. Specifically, we fell short in three areas. First, our brand propositions were simply not compelling enough to consumers. This is particularly true across our Barbie and Fisher-Price brands. ","Our product innovation was inconsistent. Some brands performed well, but many did not. In addition, the success of our marketing activities was mixed as our spending did not generate a lift to brand sales beyond the specific products that we were promoting. These results make it clear that we need to do a better job with creating compelling brands and products for our consumers. At the same time, we must maintain our brand engagements throughout the year instead of waiting until just the holiday season. This is important to help sustain a more consistent consumer mind share each month, with advertisements peaking at the holiday season.","Second, we were impacted by the most dynamic and challenging environment in the doll category that we\u2019ve seen in many years. Our doll brands account for approximately 40% of our business and Mattel owns or licenses the top five fashion doll properties. However, the white hot success of Disney\u2019s Frozen, particularly during the holiday season, did not drive significant overall growth in the doll category and as a result, Barbie lost ground. On American Girl, while we saw growth in its Girl of the Year product line, we did see declines in its other brands. And again, we think this was a function of intensified competition. Beyond this, we were also not successful in delivering captivating products on our Monster High brand, where we became much too dependent on line extensions. ","Finally, our global retail execution also fell short, especially here in North America. For the year our results were clearly hampered by the inventory overhang from 2013. And in the fourth quarter, the retail environment was far more competitive and challenging than it had been in the past. Against this backdrop, we exacerbated the challenging environment through poor execution in store, which was not offset by our efforts online. We saw a decline in retail ad lifts and shelf space productivity, all of this as we work with retailers to move through much of the channel inventory.","Bottom line is that our global marketing programs and go to market strategy did not effectively breakthrough in a highly competitive environment. But clearly, we must do a better job to reignite momentum. I spent this week working closely with the leadership team and immersing myself in the details of the business. And over the next few months, we will evaluate all aspects of it. We do not anticipate a fundamental shift in strategy at this time, but we clearly need to act with urgency to make the necessary changes around how we execute and how we support and build our brands and drive new innovation. At a high level, we\u2019ll be focused on actions designed to improve performance across our key brands in the adult category, to develop and implement a rigorous sales plan, both in store and online to improve our customer performance, to accelerate our efforts to better position Fisher-Price as a child development brand. And we\u2019re also going to concentrate our efforts around capitalizing on the most significant international market opportunities.","Once we\u2019ve had a chance to more thoroughly evaluate the business, I look forward to providing you with a lot more specifics on our Q1 call about the actions we intend to take. ","Beyond our focus on execution and driving the topline, I also want to mention that we\u2019ll continue to pursue our Funding our Future program to reduce costs and to re-invest savings to support growth. Now while we have a lot of work to do, I think it's also important to note that we are making good progress in terms of new innovations, product developments and partnerships. And you\u2019ll hear more from us on this Toy Fair in a couple of weeks. We look forward to seeing many of you there. ","Finally, while I'm not going to speculate on the timing, I'll also be working with the board to evaluate internal and external candidates to identify a permanent leadership for the company as we go forward. Let me wrap up by saying that the board and I believe very strongly in Mattel. We believe in its brands, its financial strength and most of all, its people. I look forward to engaging with all of you, as well as with entire Mattel community as we work to revitalize this business, and to deepen our connections with children and parents around the world. ","With that, let me turn it over to Kevin.","Kevin Farr","Thank you, Chris and good morning everyone. Given all the changes this week, I will not be going through my typical review of our earnings slide deck, but instead will focus on providing additional color on our operating results and free up some more time for Q&A. With Chris being in his CEO position on an interim basis for just five days, will not be making any specific comments on 2015 outlook at this time. As Chris said, over the next few months, our management team will evaluate all aspects of the business. During our first quarter investor conference call in mid-April, we plan to update you on the specific actions we plan to take to build and support our brands and drive new innovation in order to change the revenue trajectory of our business and deliver improved profitability. ","Let me start by echoing Chris\u2019 comment that our fourth quarter and full year results are unacceptable. At a high level, our international business did okay from a topline perspective, but our domestic business really struggled in the quarter. Neither business met our expectations with respect to revenues and profitability. As we previously said, our objectives in 2014 were to exit the year with improved POS momentum and lower retail in Mattel owned inventory levels. We did see POS continue to outpace shipping in the quarter, but our overall POS momentum in the fourth quarter decelerated. International POS was flat, while domestic POS declined high single digits, resulting in global POS being down mid-single digits in the quarter. For the year, global POS was down slightly, with domestic POS down mid-single digits, partially offset by international, which was up low single digits, led by growth in emerging market including Russia and China. ","Clearly our issue is that POS exiting 2014 is not where we need it to be. As Chris said, our brand propositions were simply not compelling enough to consumers, particularly across our Barbie and Fisher-Price brands. And our marketing activities didn\u2019t generate the lift that we expected. And our global retail execution in-store also fell short, especially in North America. That said, we did make some progress in retail inventories as we partnered well with retailers to move through much of the channel inventory on a global basis, although pockets remain in some markets and for some brands. ","Domestic retail inventories were down significantly and retail inventories were down in most international markets as well. That said, given our current POS trends, retail inventories may still not be where they need to be in certain markets. Similarly, our Mattel owned inventories are lower versus last year, but higher than our historical averages. And looking at our POS results by brands, overall our Girls portfolio ended the year with positive POS, but that was driven by the success of Frozen. Barbie experienced steeper declines in the very competitive holiday period, ending that year with POS down single digits, high single digits. Monster High POS coming off record sales last year, was down high teens for the year, pretty consistent with where it has been in the last two quarters. Global POS for total Fisher-Price brands remained challenge on our overall basis, which was down mid-single digits for the year. But we did see some pockets of strength in two areas. First, Fisher-Price international POS grew mid-single digits for the year. This is good to see as the brand is starting to gain traction in emerging markets, including China and Russia. And second, we saw positive global POS for the year in our infant business, which includes baby gear and laugh-and-learn product lines where we had some really good innovation. ","Finally, for the US, overall Fisher-Price POS was down low double digits for the fourth quarter and the full year. Of the remaining core brands, we had solid POS gains for Hot Wheels and Thomas in the quarter, and throughout the year we saw very positive results in our international markets for these two brands. ","Now turning to revenues, gross sales were down 3% in the quarter and down 6% for the year. Chris briefly touched on our Girls portfolio and the key reasons why it did not grow in the quarter. I will focus my comments on the performance of our other core brands. Worldwide sales of Hot Wheels were positive in the quarter. Hot Wheels continues to do particularly well in international markets, with the basic car and track segments, which highlight the brand\u2019s core play pattern. ","Worldwide sales of total Fisher-Price brands were down double digits in the quarter, driven by declines in key Fisher-Price core brands like Little People and Imaginext, as well as top comparisons related to Fisher-Price Friends licensed entertainment properties. Thomas shipping was positive internationally, which was a strategic priority with the HIT acquisition. And finally, we worked hard to successfully integrate MEGA Brands in 2014. Where our sales for the partial year have been impacted by things such as international distributor transitions, they were consistent with our expectations. Looking to 2015, we now have the opportunity to sell MEGA Brands products globally by utilizing Mattel\u2019s global infrastructure, which is an important growth opportunity going forward. ","From a regional perspective, our North America business was down 2% in the quarter. And we had mixed results in our international business, which was down 5% including the impact of foreign exchange. Not surprisingly, the strengthening of the US dollar significantly impacted reported revenues in the fourth quarter. Our 3% decline in worldwide sales included 4 percentage point unfavorable impact due to foreign exchange. And the 5% decline in our international revenues included an 8 percentage point unfavorable impact due to foreign exchange. With respect to international markets in the fourth quarter, sales of our European region were down 6%, which included a negative 9 percentage point impact of foreign exchanged driven by continued strong growth in Russia despite the challenging microeconomic environment. ","Sales in our Latin America region were down 8%, which included a negative 7 percentage point impact of foreign exchange as we continue to weather macroeconomic challenges, as well as work through retail inventory overhang from 2013. Sales in our Asia Pacific region were up 12%, which included a negative 5 percentage point impact of foreign exchange, driven by contained strong growth in China. We expect that the headwinds related to the strengthening of the US dollar will continue in the near term. With respect to projecting the impact of foreign exchange in our financial performance in the future, our general rule of thumb remains that a 1% change in the US dollar index should impact annual EPS by about $0.01 to $0.02 and revenues by one half of a percentage point. ","Moving beyond the top line, I'll touch on the key divers of the P&L. For the fourth quarter, gross margins was 50.4 %, down 410 basis points versus last year\u2019s 54.5%. Gross margins continue to decline relative to record highs achieved in 2013, reflecting the cost of trade programs to drive holiday POS as well as the impact of our MEGA Brands acquisition. The gross margin of 50.4% include 160 basis point negative impact for MEGA Brands in the quarter. Excluding MEGA Brands, a little over three quarters of the remaining 250 basis point decline was related to trade programs to improve POS during the holiday season. And the balance was spilt between the loss of manufacturing scale and mix related to lower sales of our Girls portfolio products. ","Finally, pricing actions and net saving from 0E3.0 initiatives, roughly offset increases in product cost. For the full year, gross margin was 49.8%, down 380 basis points versus 53.6% in 2013. This included a 150 basis point impact from MEGA Brands. Excluding MEGA Brands, more than half of the remaining 230 basis point decline was related to efforts to clean up inventories and trade programs to improve POS, both during the holiday season and throughout the year. And the balance was split between the loss of manufacturing scale and mix related to lower sales of our Girls portfolio products. ","Finally, pricing actions and net savings from OE3.O initiatives roughly offset increases in product costs. Looking forward on gross margins, we continue to manage the business for the long term and believe our long term gross margin objective of about 50% is reasonable. Looking forward to 2015, we should see some tail winds with favorable commodity trends, cost savings from our Funding our Future initiatives, and the absence of MEGA Brands fair value inventory adjustments. And we also expect headwinds like the ongoing impact to MEGA Brands, potential product mix related to the performance of our Girls portfolio, investments in improving core brand POS through retail execution, foreign exchange and higher input costs, including direct or labor. ","Despite the revenue shortfall and the gross margin challenges, we continue to manage the middle of the P&L. We made excellent progress against our OE3.O cost saving initiatives, exceeding expectations and delivering $119 million of gross savings in 2014. As a result, we have delivered cumulative gross savings of $179 million over the two year program. Combined with our first two programs, GCL and OE 2.O, we have delivered almost $600 million in gross savings today. ","Advertising on an absolute dollar basis was lower for the full year, reflecting lower overall sales volume. However, advertising was up substantially in the fourth quarter in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales, reflecting the shift in spending to align with consumer purchase patterns. ","Our marketing activities and promotional programs did not generate the POS lift that we expected, which made it clear that we need to create more compelling product for consumers and we must maintain our brand engagement throughout the year. ","Total SG&A spending was up for the quarter and up slightly for the year. If you exclude incentive and equity compensation and the impact to MEGA Brands, SG&A spending was roughly flat on the fourth quarter and the full year compared to 2013. ","The fourth quarter and full year results include $22 million and $53 million respectively of MEGA related acquisition, integration and amortization expenses. And our incentive and equity compensation was lower on a full year basis, given that we are a pay-for-performance Company and our results were well below our financial objectives. ","Our bonus pool was $25 million, which was down about 60% versus last year. Our most senior executives will not receive an annual bonus and there was no equity compensation accrued related to long term incentive plan this year, because we did not hit our performance targets. Our incentive accrual reflects a small discretionary bonus paid for the rest of our employees. ","Severance charges were also high in the quarter, primary related to integration charges for MEGA. Looking forward to 2015, we see tailwinds in SG&A from lower MEGA acquisition integration expenses, and lower amortization of acquired MEGA intangible assets, gross savings from our Funding our Future program, and the impact of foreign exchange. We are also likely see headwinds related to severance investments in our Funding our Future initiatives. ","Overall, operating income was $653.7 million, versus $1.17 billion in 2013. Excluding some discrete tax benefits, Mattel\u2019s tax rate for the year was 22% and we expect our tax rate to be 22% to 23% going forward, assuming no changes to current tax laws. EPS for the quarter was $0.44, which included $0.05 of MEGA Brands integration cost and a negative tax impact of $0.03 per share. Full year EPS was $1.45, including $0.16 of MEGA Brands acquisition and integration cost and a tax benefit of $0.13 per share. ","Now turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, we improved our Mattel owned inventory position as we exited 2014, but it's still higher than our historical averages. Excluding the impact of MEGA Brands, our own inventory was down about $40 million versus 2013. ","Despite the very challenging year driven by a decline in topline revenue and gross margin, we generated almost $889 million in cash flow from operations, versus $698 million in 2013. The increase in cash flow of $191 million from operations was primarily driven by reductions in net working capital, partially offset by lower net income. ","We ended the year with about $970 million of cash in our balance sheet. This puts us at the higher end of our $800 million to $1 billion target in our capital investment framework. Our 2014 results also reflects our ongoing commitment to disciplined and balanced capital deployment, which included $260 million of capital expenditures, $515 million allocated to the dividend, $423 million dedicated to acquire MEGA Brands, and $177 million to share repurchases, including $49 million in the fourth quarter. After reinvesting our business, dividends remain our first priority and the company declared a first quarter dividend of $0.38 per share, which is flat compared to the first year of 2014. ","As we\u2019ve historically done, we will evaluate capital deployment priorities as the year progresses, consistent with business performance, as well as our capital investment framework, which balances many factors. These include cash generation potential of the business, potential deployment opportunities, and our overall financial flexibility. ","In closing, we are clear eyed about the challenges that lie ahead of us. And I'm excited about working with Chris and the Mattel management team as we take on these challenges with an even greater sense of urgency. As we do, we continue to be confident in our ability to win over the long term. The toy industry continues to grow and accelerate with new innovation. The depth and breadth of Mattel\u2019s brands continues to be unmatched. Out global scale in infrastructure is a key differentiator and we\u2019ll continue to be financially discipline as we expect to generate significant cash, which could fund further growth and be used to reward our shareholders. We look forward to seeing most of you at Toy Fair next months as we show you some exciting product and marketing innovations. ","Stephanie, I would now like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Sean McGowan of Needham & Company. Your line is open.","Sean McGowan","First question, where is the decline in the entertainment category coming from? What\u2019s really driving that decline?","Kevin Farr","I think the decline in the entertainment category is planes and cars, with part of it in decline as well as Superman and games.","Sean McGowan","Okay. And of the MEGA Brands -- looks like MEGA Brands was up nicely in the quarter. What drove that?","Kevin Farr","I think it's had momentum this year with respect to I think is Halo and Call of Duty as well as the basic products. And that\u2019s the biggest drivers.","Sean McGowan","Okay. And then last question for now. It\u2019s hard to see in the P&L all the $600 million in savings that you outlined over those three programs, with the SG&A in a kind of record high percentage of sales. I know that that\u2019s driven partly by sales decline, but just in gross dollars, where has all that savings gone?","Kevin Farr","As you know, this program was really focused in on the supply chain and initiatives like packaging, design for manufacturing. The majority, I think 60% of the savings are in cost of goods sold and you can see that in gross margins. However, as you know, this year with respect to gross margins, there was a lot of moving pieces in the year. Our gross margins were impacted with the acquisition of MEGA Brands, our efforts to clean up inventory, loss of manufacturing scale and mix related to lower sales of the Girls portfolio products. But we did see good savings with respect to gross margins from our O3E.O activities.","Sean McGowan","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gerrick Johnson with BMO capital markets. Your line is open.","Gerrick Johnson","Good morning. Just wondering, the flow of goods, did you bring goods in early to avert port issues? And did this cause any problems down the road? And then secondarily on your promotional activities, you saw a nice big increase in the ratio of promotions to gross sales. Can you talk about the progression of those promotions? Did you take more prior to the holiday relative to last year? Was it more after the holiday? How did that work out? Thank you.","Kevin Farr","Okay. So with respect to the port, I think we did have some delays, but we didn\u2019t bring back -- bring a product much earlier than we planned to. So that wasn\u2019t a big issue in the quarter. I think with regard to the promotions this year, I think from a perspective of promotional aspects, it really was as we saw two changes with respect to our spending mix model. We really looked at the research and analytics and applied the spending mix model. First, we spend more media on digital versus TV. And second, we spend more on advertising in the fourth quarter and it was spend later in the fourth quarter. ","I think we feel good about the shift to digital where we had good success, although the success of our marketing was mixed as the spending didn\u2019t generate the lift we expected it to. As Chris said earlier, we think we need to continue to engage our brand connections early throughout the year to sustain more consistent mind share each month with advertising peaking at the end of the year. And then we work with customers, particularly as consumers came out later to move the inventory and those occurred later in the fourth quarter.","Gerrick Johnson","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tim Conder with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Tim Conder","Thank you. A couple here. I guess on a fundamental basis -- and, Chris, I understand that you may not -- this is just being very informative here, how do you see the ability or opportunity to change Mattel's fundamental innovation process? Basically, so you can take consumer feedback earlier in the process and either kill or proceed with an idea so that the ideas that you do get out there have a higher batting average, I guess is the root of the question. And then, Kevin, any geographic and brand color on the inventory where you\u2019re still say some of the highest areas globally? And then finally, pricing. You took some price in 2014. I guess on a go-forward basis, given, let's just call it global deflation, and then the POS issues that you have, how do you feel about pricing in 2015? Thank you.","Chris Sinclair","Hey Tim, it\u2019s Chris here. Let me take your first question then I'm going to let Kevin pick on the balance. But one of the things that\u2019s clear and we\u2019ve been looking at this I guess for the last six or nine months is we have some work to do on the talent front and certainly a lot of work to do on the culture front to spur innovation and creativity. I think we were all sort of focused on bringing Richard Dickson in to spearhead this. I think he\u2019s done a great job. And you\u2019ll see some of this as we get to Toy Fair and kind of igniting the creative talent of the organization. Part of it is also broadening our outreach for innovation. There\u2019s a lot of people and veterans in the marketplace that we\u2019ve had to rekindle our relationships with. ","We are starting to work with some of the digital partners out there that can bring us a lot of innovation. And importantly, I think using research is something you alluded to. We brought in a lot of talent there to help us get better analytics, better focus on our consumer and understanding them and upgrading our testing capabilities. And I think you\u2019ll see us start to move quicker to get some research going on some of our ideas to catch it early. Clearly not everything works and you want to know that and make adjustments. ","All of that is inscribed. But I come back to talent and culture, and I think we are feeling actually very good about what Richard is doing with his team. And don\u2019t forget we have had -- despite the grim news, we\u2019ve had some very good successes in the last year. Ever After High, BOOMCo, things like that have actually been good wins for us. It\u2019s a matter of doing more of that, making sure we are doing it with bigger bets and in the right areas and stay tuned. I think this will get better and it\u2019s something that we are laser focused on. A lot of the issues we deal with come right back to the topline and it comes back to our branding and our innovation and we\u2019ve got to get that right as a first priority.","Kevin Farr","And following up on your question on inventory, this is a key objective for us and we\u2019ve worked hard on it and saw some improvement. If you look at our owned inventories, they\u2019re lower than last year as I said, but they\u2019re higher than historical averages. So we\u2019ve got work to do to customers to move through that product. Retail inventories are down around the world, led by the US. It\u2019s down almost a third in our top six and down high single digits in key international markets. And we made progress in most countries, but we have pockets of retail inventory remaining in certain countries and regions, particularly core Europe, and there is some in Latin America. So we are in a better position I think as we enter 2015 and we left 2014. We\u2019ve made some progress here. ","With respect to pricing, we do a lot of research to try to understand the strength of our brands and products. And as we price our brands, we consider many factors. One of them is our POS momentum of our brands. Others, product innovation and brand strength. Right now we are not feeling that we need to do more work around that, retail dynamics and competitive assessments. So when we look at our overall product line, we\u2019re going to price appropriately and given the recent volatility around import costs and currencies, we are still the midst of talking to our customers about the price for our 2015 product lines.","Tim Conder","Okay, great. Thank you, gentlemen.","Operator","Our next question comes from Taposh Bari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Taposh Bari","Good morning, everyone. I was hoping to get an update on where you stand regarding your dividend, specifically which metrics are you most focused on going forward as you consider sustainability.","Kevin Farr","As I said in my remarks, consistent with our capital investment framework, dividends remain our first priority after investing our business. And the company did declare a first quarter dividend of $0.30 per share, which is flat with the prior year. As we have done historically, we\u2019\u2019 evaluate capital deployment priorities as the year progresses, consistent with business performance, marketplace opportunities in our capital investment framework. As we look at it right now, we are okay and we will continue to evaluate capital deployment priorities as the year progresses.","Taposh Bari","Great. And maybe if I could just follow up on that point, on the point of financial flexibility that you mentioned in your script, Kevin, how committed are you to an investment-grade credit rating? And do you have any clauses in any of your license deals that require you to maintain that kind of credit rating?","Kevin Farr","First I\u2019d like to say, we don\u2019t have any clauses in our license deals. I think what we do know about this business is it\u2019s working capital intensive, not capital intensive. And the most efficient way to finance this business is through access to commercial paper markets. So our credit rating is very important. We are committed to our credit rating to be investment grade and we do target single A metrics. So as we look at financial flexibility, we look at that in terms of our single lay metrics as well as with respect to, we also have a backup revolver of $1.6 billion that\u2019s out there till March. And we\u2019ve got plenty of liquidity as a company, but we are focused on those credit metrics.","Taposh Bari","Great, thank you","Operator","Our next question comes from Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Your line is open.","Felicia Hendrix","Thank you for taking my questions. Mr. Sinclair, you said at the beginning regarding the CEO search you weren't going to talk about timing, but you did say you were looking internally and externally. Just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the type of person you are looking for, perhaps what kind of industries you would prefer that they came from. Any kind of color on this search would be helpful. Thank you.","Chris Sinclair","Felicia, let me just at the outset, we don\u2019t have a search going right now and I wouldn\u2019t prejudge where that\u2019s going. Clearly, our focus right now on revitalizing the business and energizing and focusing this management team, the things we are going to be keeping an eye out for is clearly leadership. You want proven leadership and an individual that\u2019s going to direct the company. Certainly experience in innovation and creativity and building brands, global brands. I think first and foremost, it would be that, a track record of success and decisiveness. That could be inside, it could be outside. I think we in the board will work on that in due course. Our priority right now is to get the business righted and back in good shape.","Felicia Hendrix","Thank you. Kevin, you all talked in the prepared remarks about the competitive doll category in the quarter and some specifics around Barbie and Monster High and why those might have underperformed. But I'm just curious; you had the doll in the quarter with Frozen, or dolls. We have 200 of them in my house. Just wondering competitively, if you don't want to talk specifically about who or what you were competing with, maybe just generically so that we can understand what else was out there because between Frozen, Monster High, Barbie, I can think of a few others from competitors, but really when you say competitive, what exactly are you speaking of?","Kevin Farr","Clearly we are talking about Frozen. It was white hot property as you know this fall. I think you\u2019ve seen it in your home. That\u2019s principally what we are talking about and it up-aged the brand, up-aged and it\u2019s also sitting in between Barbie and Monster High. We saw that be competitive. And also we saw being competitive we think against American Girl.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay, so you are speaking mostly about mode of cannibalization versus growing the whole category for you? Okay, so now I understand that. Then just finally, Kevin, getting back to this dividend question, and I think you've been very clear about your commitment to keeping the investment-grade rating and how you are going to evaluate things as the year goes on. I'm just wondering, what is the commitment here to the dividend? Has there been any thought about perhaps using some of that cash to reinvest in the business, particularly as you are going through this transition now?","Kevin Farr","I think as we said before, I think we are okay right now and I think we are going to look forward through the year and evaluate our capital deployment priorities as the year progresses. What\u2019s the best use of cash at the time we generate it.","Chris Sinclair","Felicia, that\u2019s an ongoing process at the board. This is not new to where we are today. We typically evaluate things on a regularized basis. Clearly we are committed to dividends as a major component of our capital deployment. I think Kevin has got it right. Right now we feel fine, but obviously we are evaluating a lot of things.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Linda Weiser with B. Riley. Your line is open.","Linda Weiser","Just to go back again to the issue of the retail inventory, I believe you said that POS in the US was down high single digit in the fourth quarter, and yet your North American sales were down 2%, and that would include American Girl, which was actually a little bit worse. So it seems to me that POS was actually worse than your shipments in. So how did that really function to reduce inventory at retail? It seems to me that might have actually worsened the situation. So maybe you could explain that. ","And then my second question is on Fisher-Price. It seems that -- I've heard comments from MGA that their Little Tikes brand is just really doing well. It's actually growing and I would assume this is in the preschool area. So are there any lessons you can take from whoever is doing well in the category and what they are doing right and kind of try to come up with something on Fisher-Price? It seemed Richard Dickson had some ideas on Barbie and Monster High, but it seems he was further behind in analyzing the Fisher-Price situation. So maybe you could just -- am I accurate on that or will we hear more from him at Toy Fair about Fisher-Price or? Maybe you could comment on that. Thank you.","Chris Sinclair","Linda, I\u2019ll take your last question and I\u2019ll let Kevin go back on inventory. But Fisher-Price has probably been a tougher nut to crack for a while because it\u2019s so fragmented in terms of the segments it competes in and the brands that are underneath it. But we do actually have a pretty good focus right now on that pre-school segment. I think you will see some things from Richard. I think he and his team are definitely catching up there. And a lot of it has to do with branding and innovation work, but also we\u2019ve got to get price value and things like that right in select markets. So it\u2019s kind of a holistic approach, but I think -- stay tuned. I think we\u2019ll have more to talk about on Fisher-Price.","Kevin Farr","With your question with regard to retail inventories, I think as you look at the full year, our sales were down high single digits and obviously our -- basically our retail inventories were down a third.","Linda Weiser","Okay. And then just one follow-up on the financials. In terms of cash flow for 2015, I know it's hard to project it because it's hard to project earnings, but on the working capital front I would expect there wouldn't be as much cash thrown off from working capital reduction. Is that an accurate assumption? Do you think working capital will be a positive source, though, Kevin? Do you have any idea about that? Thanks. ","Kevin Farr","Again we are not going to give guidance on it. I think what we\u2019d say though is we\u2018ll continue to manage our working capital tightly. We look at realistic revenue assumptions and again manage it tightly like we did this year.","Linda Weiser","Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator"," Our next question comes from Drew Crum with Stifel Nicolaus. You line is open.","Drew Crum","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Kevin, I wonder if you could address MEGA Brands and specifically the 100 basis point headwind that you are expecting for gross margin. Absent the inventory adjustments that you had in 2014, what are the drivers for the headwind? And I guess more generally, are you abandoning the guidance you had provided a couple quarters ago that MEGA Brands should be accretive to numbers in 2015?","Kevin Farr","I think with respect to MEGA Brands, I think as we did the acquisition, we looked at it strategically. MEGA Brands I think on a standalone basis had margins of about 30%. We looked at the category, it's a great category. Obviously, our competitor is a strong player in that category, but it has great margin profile much like our doll portfolio. What we see is near term that it\u2019s actually going to be dilutive to our gross margins because it\u2019s lower margin. I think consistent with what we said as we acquired it is we think it's going to have about 100 basis point ongoing negative effect to our gross margins because of the mix to our margins. That said, we think there is plenty of opportunities to improve the margins I think with regard to some of the properties that we have, with regard to new properties like SpongeBob and Despicable Me Minions. Those are good margin products. ","And then again I think our synergies in running the manufacturing operations and getting scale in sales should allow us to improve margins over time. With respect to talking about whether MEGA Brands is accretive next year, I think it was accretive if you take out restructuring, integration and amortization charges this year. It's too early to really talk about 2015 because we haven\u2019t made decisions as we\u2019re using this as a great platform for growth in 2015, how much we\u2019re going to put behind the brand on a global basis as we use our sales affiliates, and our global infrastructure around the world to build the brand through investments in things like advertising. We are excited about the progress was made in 2014. We did integrate it effective of January 1 for most places around the world. We are going to be selling it through our existing subsidiaries, including North America. We\u2019ve got a good platform for growth and I think we are still trying to determine how much advertising dollars we should put behind it to drive that growth. So more will come on that later.","Drew Crum","Okay. Thanks, Kevin. Then Brazil is one of your biggest markets. I think in the slide deck you noted that you are seeing some improvement there. Can you just expound upon what's working or where you are seeing improving trends in that market?","Kevin Farr","I think we\u2019ve got a strong -- our brands are probably the strongest in the world in Brazil and obviously there has been macroeconomic issues in Brazil. And also we did have some inventory issues, but things like Fisher-Price is doing well and other brands like Barbie and Hot Wheels are doing well down there.","Drew Crum","Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jaime Katz with Morningstar. Your line is open.","Jaime Katz","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So piggybacking on that MEGA question, can you just talk about how the reception has been with international retailers and the ease of getting the distribution through the Mattel channel? And then, as far as share repurchases are concerned, I know the slides say they are still an important piece of the capital investment framework, but can we assume that that will be at a much slower pace at least in the first half of the year until things are sort of back in order over there? Thanks.","Kevin Farr","I'd say on the international business with regard to MEGA, we were in transition in 2014. We were getting out of distributors. 70% of our business was in the U.S this year, about 30% outside. Really we were getting ready for launching in international markets. We think it\u2019s a big opportunity because there are only 30% outside the US. And I think really we\u2019ll see much better distribution as our affiliates pick it up and manage that business in 2015. With respect to share repurchases, as we said before dividend is our first priority after investing in the business. And as always, we\u2019ll be opportunistic as share repurchases based upon our cash flow satiation. But again that\u2019s going to be based upon our business performance and it would be consistent with our capital investment framework. But I think it\u2019s safe to say in the near term we are not going to be doing any share repurchases.","Jaime Katz","Thanks."," Operator","Our next comes from Mike Swartz with SunTrust. Your line is open. ","Mike Swartz","Good morning. I just wanted to kind of circle back to the opening remarks that Chris was making about some of the areas where maybe you fell short in the fourth quarter and just kind of digging down. When you think of those three items that you mentioned, how many of those were actually -- do you perceive as being in your control versus maybe being dictated by the externals?","Chris Sinclair","Mostly in our control, Mike. Clearly the market was more competitive than historic and particularly in dolls, which Frozen led that charge. But having said that, we created our own problems with inventory, proliferation of line items that weren\u2019t particularly impactful. We missed consistency on our branding, particularly on Barbie and Monster high. A lot of those things are to me imminently fixable. Execution in the marketplace, obviously we can do a much better job with that on the retail front. It all comes back to driving strong brands, which makes everything else work. ","But we missed the mark on lining up a lot our execution in retail with some of our key brand program and so forth. These are fixes that we can make. We are obviously making progress on innovation and we\u2019ll get some of these other things sorted I assure you. The competitive environment is always going to be there, the stuff we need to be doing a better job at. ","Kevin Farr","And I think the organizational change where we\u2019ve appointed Richard last year as lead of all brands and then we have Tim Kilpin being the Commercial Officer. I think that alignment will help us execute on bigger and better ideas in 2015 across the globe. I think that\u2019s also going to help us.","Mike Swartz","Then, Kevin, just switching over to currency, I know you put out kind of the -- or put the rule of thumb in the slide deck, but help us understand, does that currency impact include the impact of any hedging? And maybe remind us what your hedging policy is on currency.","Kevin Farr","Yeah. It does including hedging to a certain extent with respect to as we look forward. The rule of thumb is a high level calculation. And when we look at our hedging strategy, we usually hedge 12 to 18 months looking forward. And our goal is really to take volatility out of the P&L with respect to hedging because we don\u2019t know whether foreign currency is going to strengthen or go down. Our target over that 12 to 18 month period is about 50%. Really the key -- some of the key currencies that you need to really focus in is on Euro, on the Peso and Brazilian Real.","Mike Swartz","Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next comes from Stephanie Wissink with Piper Jaffray & Co. Your line is open. ","Maria Vizuete","Thanks for taking our question. This is actually Maria Vizuete on for Stephanie. We just have a couple of quick questions. Just wondering if you can talk a little bit about the strategy of utilizing trade programs versus the impact on margins, both in the quarter and the strategy longer term.","Kevin Farr","Again with respect to trade programs, again as we looked and planned for 2014, we were facing some issues with losing shelf space. So basically in the second half of the year, we are really focusing on in-aisle displays and promotional ads and promotional programs. And then when we see we didn\u2019t have the POS momentum that we needed, we really use additional trade programs to sell in and try to sell through our products in the holiday season where people were in store looking for toys. With regards to the trade programs, as Chris said, it wasn\u2019t as effective as we wanted it to be. But again, I think as we look at 2015, we are going to look at what worked and basically try to do more work in 2015.","Maria Vizuete","Thank you, that's helpful. Then just looking at the American Girl performance, can you just talk a little bit about what the declines were tied to?","Chris Sinclair","Could you repeat that Maria please, on American Girl?","Maria Vizuete","Yes, just looking at American Girl, the declines there, could you talk about what maybe the underperformance was tied to?","Kevin Farr","I think with American Girl, I think as we said, I think Frozen impacted our dollar portfolio in total and we also think it impacted American Girl. There were two principle drivers of AG\u2019s decline in the last two quarters. First, it was very competitive in the doll environment as I said and that primarily impacted the AG segment. Second, we did have a new BeForever launch. They\u2019re promising, but they came out late. What are we doing about it? We had a great Girl year. Our stores are good and what we need to do is really reassert American Girl\u2019s strong point of differentiation, particularly in the My-AG segment. And also then we are building off of the continued success of Girl of the Year product lines. Our new doll is off to a good start in 2015. And we continue to work on our retail expansion, particularly outside the US, in Canada and we do have a new partnership in Mexico. You are going to see a lot of innovation and also some differentiation about My American Girl at New York Toy Fair in a couple of weeks.","Maria Vizuete","Great. Thank you so much and best of luck.","Operator","Our next question from Greg Badishkanian with Citigroup. Your line is open.","Greg Badishkanian","Great, thanks. If you look at just from a very high level, you mentioned some issues that impacted you for the fourth quarter and for the full year. Is it one or two things that you could have done differently, or is it just a lot of smaller execution issues across the board that was the problem?","Chris Sinclair","Greg, I don\u2019t want to prejudge it completely at this point. But I do think it was a host of issues, starting with the brand innovation and branding programs we had on our major items. But we also had a lot of alignment and execution issues that went along with that. We are focused, I think as I said at the beginning, on a number of priorities to reignite things. But largely it\u2019s hitting some bigger things and getting those right. It is a lot of small execution issues.","Greg Badishkanian","Okay. Second question, just with retail inventory, I just want to make sure I understand it properly. So retail inventories seem like you\u2019ve reduced those pretty significantly. Maybe you have a little bit in Europe and LatAm that you have to -- there are some pockets that are higher than you\u2019d like. When we look at the first half of 2015 compared to 2014, the fact that you had to reduce inventories so significantly last year, is that going to be a tailwind for you this year because you won't have to reduce it as much as you did last year?","Kevin Farr","I think we are in a better position coming into 2015. Again our POS trajectory isn\u2019t where we\u2019d like it to be. And then finally I think our owned inventories are a little bit higher than desired, but we are better than last year.","Greg Badishkanian","Okay. And you're not -- you don't want to quantify the tailwind, do you?","Kevin Farr","No.","Greg Badishkanian","Okay, all right.","Kevin Farr","That\u2019s good, Greg.","Greg Badishkanian","Yes, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Eric Handler with MKM Partners, your line is open.","Eric Handler","Yes, thanks for taking my question. I actually got two questions for you. First, quickly on your cash. What percentage of your cash is onshore versus overseas? And then secondly, just digging into Fisher-Price. So Fisher-Price revenue is down 25% from its peak in 2007 and that's even after you layer in the HIT Entertainment acquisition in 2012. And I just wondered, given how fragmented Fisher-Price is, does it make sense to be in all those segments that it's in? Might you be better off and get higher returns on capital if you sold off pieces of Fisher-Price that have just been in perpetual decline for the last five to seven years? And along those lines when you look at HIT Entertainment is Thomas a growing brand? And when you look at the other brands within the HIT Entertainment portfolio, they had a pretty deep portfolio when you acquired them. It seems like you've been under utilizing some of those brands. Might it be better to sell off to an entertainment company some of those brands as well?","Kevin Farr","Okay, so with respect to Fisher-Price, I think we do have certain segments that we\u2019re playing in and I think we like all of the segments and we have been making progress with this child development angle and approach and focus. And with regards to our baby business, which accounts for almost half of the sales, we\u2019ve seen positive POS. With respect to where the issue is, is really in the play school area, pre-school where we struggled in 2014 and prior with regard to playsets like little people and Imaginext. We do like that category is -- probably from a global perspective, pre-school is the biggest category in infant pre-school. ","We have historically been strong there. I think we just need to strengthen our brands as Chris has said and also create more innovative product in that space. And then Fisher-Price brands again is great with respect to when we have good license properties and they\u2019re strong and there\u2019s a cycle that you go through from time to time and this year wasn\u2019t as strong as we\u2019d like it to be. We do like partnering with companies like Disney and Nickelodeon to really drive toys with their great intellectual property. ","And then finally, Thomas is a great pre-school property. We think we\u2019ve got a lot of opportunities with regards to Thomas with regards to building that brand, creating more compelling product around that brand. It is doing well on a global basis, particularly in international. When we looked at international and we looked at the fact that the business for Thomas was about 75% in the US, 25% outside the US, principally in five markets around the globe, all in English speaking countries. We think there\u2019s a huge opportunity for us to grow Thomas globally and we were very pleased this year to see us start to gain traction after building awareness for a couple of years. ","We continue to look at other things in the HIT portfolio. Next up I think is Bob the Builder. We are working on content for that. We are looking to launch that later in 2105 or early 2016. And we are looking at rebuilding that brand. And many years ago, Bob the Builder was actually bigger than Thomas. So we think that\u2019s a great opportunity for us. With regard to cash offshore, I don\u2019t have it in my fingertips. We do have cash in the US as well as cash offshore. I just have to say that we can get at the cash when we need it, where we need it and that isn\u2019t a problem from the perspective of our liquidity and also our ability to pay dividends or do share repurchases or do acquisitions.","Eric Handler","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim Chartier with Monnes, Crespi & Hardt. Your line is open.","Jim Chartier","Good morning. You talked about believing that your long-term gross margin goal of 50% remains reasonable. You did comment on your near-term goal, which I think as recently at the October Investor Day you thought was the low to mid 50% range. Can you just give us an update there if that has changed and just talk about the puts and takes behind that. Thank you.","Kevin Farr","Yeah. Again I think you know we don\u2019t give guidance, but we do continue to believe our long-term gross margin objective of about 50% as reasonable. With respect to commenting on the near time, as Chris mentioned, over the next few months we are going to evaluate all aspects of the business. So again, I'm not going to comment on near term with regard to gross margins.","Jim Chartier","Okay. Then is it fair to say that the Funding our Future initiative is primarily an SG&A-related opportunity versus gross margin?","Kevin Farr","I think as we talked about it last October, we really said there\u2019s a couple of parts on it. It\u2019s more focused than OE 3.0 was on SG&A. We said with regard to, we\u2019ve got a goal of $250 million to $300 million of savings under this new program over the next two years. We said about $100 million of that would relate to global supply chain, which is principally going to improve our gross margins and then the other $150 million to $200 million is again with regard to SG&A.","Jim Chartier","Great, thank you.","Kevin Farr","Operator, we have time for one more question.","Operator"," Our final question comes from John Taylor with Arcadia Investment. You line is open","John Taylor","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I have two I guess. One, Kevin, so we went through a period of rising oil prices there for a long time, which put pressure on gross margin. I wonder if you could talk about what the outlook for the next year or two might be if we stabilize somewhere in here. That's the first question. Then I wonder, in talking about the doll portfolio, so we are looking at the sunset of your Disney Princess license at the end of next year. And I'm wondering how you\u2019re likely to manage the flow or the cadence of that as you approach the end of that particular thing. And I guess the third question is I think a lot of us would -- it would be nice to have a sense of how big that Princess business might have been in 2014 so we can start to think about what kind of gap there might be down the road. Thank you.","Kevin Farr","I think with regard to our cost, there\u2019s a basket of cost and I think as we look forward, oil is certainly a tailwind, but we also have currency being a headwind. Overall we continue to look at this volatility in commodity prices and look at what our pricing is going to be for 2015. We are working with retailers due to that recent volatile. With regards to Disney Princess, I think we talked about that before, JT. That\u2019s roughly been a $300 million business over the last several years. It's more than that in 2014 due to the strength of Frozen. And we are really going to be opportunistic to maximize that opportunity in 2015. As we look at 2016, we know Girls and we\u2019re working quite hard on strategies to launch new doll segments to fill that gap.","John Taylor","Great, thank you.","Drew Vollero","There will be a replay of this call available beginning at 11:30 a.m. Eastern Time today.

Mattel does not update forward-looking statements and expressly disclaims any obligation to do so.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Margo.","Mary Margaret Hastings Georgiadis - Mattel, Inc.","Thank you, Whitney. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2017 earnings call.","Our Q3 performance was clearly disappointing. Results in the quarter reflect continued challenges in The Toy Box and certain underperforming brands that exacerbated by the TRU chapter 11 filing. Despite these challenges, we continue to make strong progress against the transformation plan we laid out in June. A critical step in our progress is announcing today a significantly expanded initiative to structurally simplify our business, and right-size our cost structure in alignment with our strategy. This will unlock substantial resources to invest in our transformation plan and enable us to drive towards the growth and profit targets we discussed at Investor Day.","On today's call, I will provide an overview of our performance in the third quarter and related drivers. I will then share the progress we've made implementing our transformation plan and the roadmap to selected near-term milestones. Then our new CFO, Joe Euteneuer, will provide further color on our Q3 results and discuss in detail our action plan to right-size our cost structure and reshape how we run our business. Joe will also discuss the timing of upcoming investments and our broader capital strategy, including how we plan to fund our transformation plan. Richard is also here to discuss operations, brand and marketing strategy during the Q&A portion of the call.","Moving on to our third quarter results. Overall, results were significantly below expectations. In terms of revenue, international was stable, led by continued growth in Asia, however, the North American business was down 22%. We believe this is somewhat of a unique quarter, and we do not believe it reflects the underlying health and growth potential of this company. This decline is also a departure from what we expected when we spoke to you in June. So I will discuss the drivers in detail.","About half of the North American revenue decline was driven by TRU. About a quarter of the decline was driven by tighter retailer inventory management, and the remaining quarter was driven by continued challenges in our Toy Box and certain brands. Fortunately, we believe that a majority of these issues are not long-term in nature and expected to turnaround over time. I'll walk through each of these impacts in more detail.","The TRU chapter 11 filing was a significant drag on both revenue and profits in the quarter as we began to reduce shipping in early September due to significant concerns about the potential for the TRU chapter 11 filing. We then had to reverse certain revenue in connection with our filing, and we were hit disproportionately compared to our peers given the higher proportion of sales we realized through TRU.","As I mentioned a few minutes ago, tighter retail inventory management accounted for about a quarter of the revenue decline in Q3. Although we have worked through the Q4 inventory overhang in the first half of the year, we continued to see divergence between POS and shipping into the third quarter. After in-depth assessment, we have identified two principal drivers of this divergence.","The first driver is key retail partners moving towards tighter working capital management. We believe that we've been hit harder by this trend due to the evergreen profile of our power brands, which allows retailers to predictably forecast in-stock levels and hold less inventory.","The second driver is our decision to transition to lower levels of retail incentive programs in 2017 relative to prior years. At the end of Q3, key retailer weeks on hand for our power brands were approximately 15% to 20% below 2016 levels. Over the last few weeks, we have seen some stabilization in retail partner weeks on hand, however, we will monitor this closely and do expect some ongoing downward weeks on hand pressure due to the continuing shift to e-commerce. The remaining quarter of the revenue decline is due to continued losses from certain underperforming brands. The biggest challenges have been in The Toy Box, in particular, with Monster High, Ever After High and Mega, as well as the fragmented long tail of launches which have more than offset positive gains elsewhere.","In addition, as we shared in June, American Girl and Thomas remain in turnaround. Our action plans are well underway, and we expect to see benefit of this in 2018. In the third quarter, American Girl results were particularly stressed by comping revenue from a large partnership deal in the Middle East.","Turning to margins. The challenges in the quarter, which were largely concentrated in North America, continued to sharply compress margins in Q3. Given the importance of this to our quarterly results, Joe will provide a detailed explanation in a few minutes.","Despite these challenges, we saw several positive trends during the quarter. Barbie is growing POS double-digits globally and accelerated each quarter this year. As we shared at Investor Day, Barbie is the farthest along in developing physical systems of play and experiences, which demonstrates the clear benefits when we execute our strategy. We have continued to innovate our core doll play pattern; diversity is working and driving strong sales improvements for Barbie and Ken.","We also continue to enhance the physical system of play with careers, which is accelerating alongside momentum in campers, horses, houses, travel and more. Our social community development on Instagram and new content programs such as Dolphin Magic on Netflix and Dreamtopia on YouTube Kids are driving excitement for our brand and product. And we still have a lot of runway to go further, with both physical and digital systems of play, consumer products, gaming and a broader content slate.","We also are pleased with the performance of Cars 3. We are executing this well in close partnership with Disney and our retail partners. And despite challenges with TRU, we expect to come close to our original target. This is just one example of the strong partnerships we continue to invest in to build top partnerships with Disney, Warner Bros., Nickelodeon, Universal and WWE.","Enchantimals is another successful launch for us this year, with strong sales performance across our top launch markets driven by compelling content. In its first year, we expect Enchantimals to achieve top quartile performance among doll launches with excellent user engagement in our content and more expansion planned for next year.","Hot Wheels is sustaining solid single-digit growth in POS with double-digit growth in Latin America. We continue to introduce excitement into the core car line as well as to improve our physical play system with higher quality play sets and interconnected track and construction systems. Our strong content Make it Epic on YouTube and hotwheels.com is helping to fuel brand passion and purchase expansion.","Our core Fisher-Price business is generating consistent single-digit POS growth globally, with acceleration in China where we are delivering a strong omni-channel experience for parents. China is one of the largest populations of new babies being born globally, and also is now the second largest market for Fisher-Price. So, we believe there is significant upside potential ahead for this brand.","As we look to Q4, we expect our key power brands and our Cars franchise to perform well. We are well represented on top toy lists across top retail partners, we have strong marketing investments against our top brands, and we have substantially improved our digital execution to ensure we are in step with the shift to online. At the same time, we expect continued drag from some of the issues we saw in Q3, and also intend to make the tough decisions necessary to right-size our portfolio before the end of the year.","As it relates to our full year, we will clearly not achieve the top line expectation we discussed in June due to the factors I discussed earlier. Importantly, we are taking the necessary actions now to reposition for the future, with a priority on ending the year clean on inventories at retail and working through the long tail of previous product launches. We have conviction that this is the best decision for shareholders and enables us to move faster toward the results we expect in the medium term.","In June at our Investor Day, we said that we would come back to you with more detail on our transformation plan, including how we will reshape and streamline our business model and how we will fund the investment plan. We discussed self-funding $150 million to $200 million of our transformation plan investment needs with cost reduction and reallocation. We also reconfirmed our previously announced $240 million gross supply chain anti-inflation program designed to offset the rising costs of labor, resins and packaging, which we expect to achieve through the course of 2018.","Now that I have my new management team assembled, we have a clear view of the right-sized structure we need to execute our strategy. We believe we can reshape our business through portfolio simplification, organization realignment and an optimized number of product launches, which will allow us to eliminate significantly more cost than we articulated at Investor Day.","After reviewing and realigning all lines of our P&L, we plan to eliminate at least $650 million in net costs over the next two years, up from $150 million to $200 million through a structural simplification initiative, including manufacturing, product, SG&A, and marketing to ensure our spending is right-sized to support our path forward.","Our review of the unnecessarily high number of SKUs and product launches from the last few years and benefits from better-aligning incentives across our functions gives us confidence that we can deliver much greater savings and better focus our business on our most attractive opportunities. This more significant cost reduction from structural simplification will help us reposition our business more quickly to deliver on our medium-term transformation targets for revenue growth and margins that we shared in June as well as to fund our planned investments.","We intend to invest approximately a quarter of this savings or $170 million over the next two years as the foundational spending for our transformation plan. Our priority focus will be investing in areas that present the greatest near-term potential to drive revenue and margin improvement. These investments will focus on four areas: omni-channel capabilities, which are critical to capturing e-commerce and revenue growth; emerging markets, where we have a demonstrated track record of accelerated growth; IT to improve line architecture, demand planning and forecasting, which are central to future margin improvements; and content and gaming, which underpin the development of our brands and present meaningful revenue and margin opportunities.","In terms of investment to build out our connected systems of play architecture, we have determined that we can repurpose existing spending to fund this strategy. We believe next-generation connected play systems and technologies can become a meaningful portion of our product mix over time. We estimate this can contribute 15% of revenue with attractive margins and strong customer engagement in the medium term. We will use the most efficient approach to both our own development and partner development in a stage-gated manner.","As discussed at Investor Day, we've already begun to make some investments in our strategic initiatives, which Joe will discuss in a few moments. Joe will also provide more detail on our structural simplification initiative and broader capital funding strategy.","I will now walk through our progress to-date implementing our transformation plan. At our Investor Day, we outlined five strategic pillars: build power brands into connected 360-degree play systems and experiences, accelerate emerging markets, strengthen our innovation pipeline, reshape operations, and reignite culture and team. We have made progress against each of these pillars, and I will describe and discuss near-term milestones for the remainder of 2017 and 2018.","The foundation to accelerating our progress is streamlining our organization and putting in place our new leadership team. We have made a number of key strategic hires, bringing on a new CFO, CTO, CCO and Chief People Officer, plus a new Head of Manufacturing and a new Head of Product Development; all of these leaders with proven track record in organization transformation. We have a world-class management team with full alignment to execute our strategy.","In terms of 360-degree play systems and experiences, we are taking action to unlock growth potential in our power brands. As I shared in Q2, we launched and have completed an in-depth consumer journey and segmentation effort to anchor our brand portfolio and define specific roles and growth priorities for each. We now have detailed maps and action plans for how we will build out our physical and digital play systems and experience with deep focus on our top three power brands. This consumer and competitive segmentation analysis has reconfirmed the headroom for us to grow our power brand. We estimate that Hot Wheels has the potential to grow 2x to 3x, Fisher-Price 2x, and Barbie 1.5x over time.","To accelerate our content efforts, we are in the final stages of regaining control over unexploited content rights for our power brands. This enables us to build a slate of premium content for our power brands and pursue more strategic deal-making across our partners to unlock value from one of the best portfolios of kids and family IP in the world.","Looking ahead to 2018, for Barbie and Hot Wheels, we believe we can gain share across market through continuing to build out physical systems of play. We believe our core Fisher-Price business can regain consistent growth across top markets by re-anchoring on its learning and development heritage as a partner to help parents provide their children the best possible start. This global program will take best practices from China in omni-channel engagement and expand them across top markets.","We expect to stabilize Thomas into next year. We announced recently that our refresh content is now complete. As a result, we are poised to take Thomas global, and will be activating with leading kids content platforms in major networks in the coming months. We expect to stem the decline in American Girl by executing the turnaround actions we have shared previously, and are excited about the opening of the new flagship store in New York City this November.","We are on track to launch two next-generation connected products that are truly interactive and provide a new customer experience. Sproutling, launched this week, is a breakthrough product for parents that collect baby's heart rate, sleeping position and motion to provide insights into baby's sleep patterns. In fall 2018, we plan to launch a next-generation connected Hot Wheels experience.","In terms of gaming, as I laid out in June, we have made great progress on scaling our global publishing, marketing and analytics capabilities, and are on track to launch two AAA new game titles next year in partnership with leading global development partners.","Looking at emerging markets, we remain on track to scale China 3x to 4x as we shared at Investor Day. We are growing strong double-digits and gaining market share in China, led by our leading consumer and digital first approach, as Jeff Wang shared at Investor Day.","Our direct parent engagement and our learning and development benefits are commitment to systems of play, and our strength in e-commerce underpins our success. China is a benchmark for the powerful impact our new strategy can have on our business across products.","Looking to the rest of 2017 and 2018, we believe we will continue to gain market share led by digital partnerships across Babytree, Alibaba and JD.com. Our Fisher-Price led parenting platform, with over 250 pieces of curated parenting content and play tips launched recently to great success on Babytree. It will also launch soon in Alibaba at the 11\/11 major holiday, which will expand our direct reach to millions more moms. This parenting platform effort will expand this fall on Babytree with an assessment tool that enables customized parent recommendations based on the development needs of each child. In addition, our learning center partnership with Fosun is progressing, with our first center scheduled to open in the first half of 2018.","Looking at The Toy Box innovation pipeline, first, we continue to grow our investment in providing best-in-class relationship management for our top licensing partners Disney, Universal, Warner Brothers, Nickelodeon and WWE. Our global retail execution for Cars is exemplary. We continue to focus on superior product design and collaboration with all of our partners. We are passionate about their brands and creating breakthrough product lines to excite kids and collectors.","Our Jurassic World line for 2018 is a great example of this commitment and impact, as we continue to receive rave reviews from retailers across the globe. In addition, we continue to develop co-production opportunities, and expect to announce at least two new co-production deals with top media partners.","Second, we are streamlining our portfolio of smaller brands and new launches. For example, this year, we trimmed the number of brands by 30% from a high point in 2016, to enable us to better focus execution on the most important opportunities. Our success with Enchantimals and Kamigami are good examples of how we can execute better with increased commitment and focus. We plan to trim our launches for 2018 another 20% to enable us to drive greater impact from our investments.","To underpin our successful transformation, we are aggressively reshaping our operations to be leaner, faster and smarter, unlocking the foundation for faster revenue growth and step change margin gain. Here is a quick progress report.","We are on track with the initiatives we shared at Investor Day to reset our commercial operations with a focus on winning share in an omni-channel world. We also have launched our plan to create a streamlined and modernized IT infrastructure across our business, led by our new CTO, Sven Gerjets. Our supply chain continues to gain speed as Peter Gibbons discussed in June. His team is on track to reduce time to market by 50% versus the historic 12 to 18 months. We are already driving multiple products through this new approach with four new products launching recently through our accelerated process, all hitting in three to nine months. This quarter, we launched our new control tower, which, as Peter Gibbons previously mentioned, is designed to radically improve demand and supply chain planning, while lowering inventory and improving service.","We are in the process of implementing a zero-based budgeting process for all areas across the company to better optimize and allocate existing spend to drive our key strategic pillars. We plan to reduce SKUs in double-digit percentages in 2018 and 2019 through brand product line optimization, smarter localization and merchandising differentiation. We are reassessing infrastructure and plan to announce a reshape of our manufacturing footprint in early 2018.","We also are deeply invested in reigniting our culture. We are excited about how our wonder values are being embraced across the company, driving increased focus on creativity and collaboration, which is critical to supporting our transformation. We are reshaping the incentive system to better align with key performance metrics, which Joe will talk more about later.","In summary, we've made substantial progress in restructuring our organization, so that we can operate more effectively in terms of strategy, planning, incentives, resource allocation and organization execution, and in turn, accelerate margin improvement and growth.","The significant structural simplification program now in place, is the foundation for jump starting profit improvement as well as funding our transformation plan. Despite the current challenges, we continue to believe in the future of Mattel. We own some of the most iconic brands in the world, with a demonstrated ability to transform and meet the demands of tomorrow's kids and parents. We're in a growing industry and well positioned in the fastest growing market.","We believe the progress we are making illustrates momentum and will allows to capitalize on our enormous headroom for growth. We are optimistic about the road ahead, but we recognize the need to make the tough decisions to address and resolve current issues and rigorously shape the business to capitalize on the many opportunities before us. We appreciate your support, as we continue to execute on the transformation of Mattel for the future. We are deeply committed to restoring profitability and delivering our transformation plan and maximizing long-term shareholder value.","Now I will turn it over to Joe.","Joseph J. Euteneuer - Mattel, Inc.","Thank you, Margo, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm very pleased to join the call today, my first, as Mattel's CFO.","Let me begin by saying that I'm thrilled to have joined Mattel during such a pivotal time in the company's history. I was drawn to Mattel by its rich heritage, portfolio of iconic brands and impressive partnerships. In addition, the leadership team Margo has assembled truly exemplifies the core values I believe in: partnership, accountability and execution. And I look forward to leveraging my past experiences as we work together to bring Mattel back to historic performance levels, and develop a path for future sustainable, value-creation, growth and industry leadership.","Since Margo has already taken you through our third quarter performance, I'll start with my 30-day evaluation of the factors that have led the business to this point. Next, I will provide some additional detail on the quarter to shed some light on the underlying performance of the company. I'll then discuss how we are building a new foundation for the company through a focus on structural simplification. Finally, I'll provide expectations for our near-term performance as well as important strategic and capital-related initiatives. We will then take your questions.","Let's get started. In trying to better understand our third quarter performance, I quickly realized the need to take a look at the last couple of years. In reviewing Mattel's recent history, it became apparent to me that there had been an emphasis on compensating for the loss of revenue associated with the significant Monster High decline and the loss of the Disney Princess license over the last several years.","While our key power brands were being revitalized in an effort to drive additional revenue growth, we launched many new brands and SKUs, with Toy Box SKUs increasing 64% from 2015 to 2017, representing about half of our total SKUs. The increased number of brands and launches added more complexity to our supply chain and more cost to the system. The resulting fragmentation in The Toy Box continues to weigh on the business today.","Additionally, predicting consumer demand for new product lines and SKUs is particularly challenging, giving our historical production lead times. This combined with the more pronounced tightening of inventory by retailers and SKU proliferation, has led to inefficiencies in our supply chain and the erosion of our gross margin.","As Margo touched on earlier, the gross margin was negatively impacted by a number of significant items in the third quarter. First, we are seeing much greater levels of unfavorable SKU mix. Closeouts and obsolescence as a result of the challenges we just discussed. These challenges represented roughly one-third of the total margin decline year-over-year.","Another item was the TRU net sales reversal since our gross margins included the associated cost of goods sold. This made up approximately one-fifth of total margin decline year-over-year.","Other items impacting gross margins included operational inefficiencies caused by logistics challenges related to opening a new distribution center on the East coast, and the tough comparison to last year's franchise licensing deal to expand American Girl into the Middle East.","Moving forward, we will be taking the coming quarters to streamline our Toy Box innovation pipeline and reduce fragmentation to improve operational efficiencies. Additionally, as Margo has stated before, we will shift our sales philosophy to better match supply with consumer demand, and we'll change the organization's incentives beginning in 2018 to balance revenue growth, gross margins and operating income.","Despite these challenges, I believe our core fundamentals of the business are sound. That said, it's imperative that we recognize that we will be working off of a reset 2017 revenue base going forward. Therefore, we have to reset expectations for ourselves, and make the necessary structural adjustments as we build a new foundation.","As we plan for our future, our first point of action is to right-size our cost structure. While the company has executed a number of gross cost-savings programs over the years, those programs were primarily used to offset inflation and other cost increases. As a result, gross savings programs did not always lead to sustainable growth and profitability. Going forward, we will be making fundamental changes to the way we operate to enable sustainable profit growth in order to maximize shareholder value.","After examining the business with Margo and the leadership team, I am confident that we can structurally simplify the organization and improve our end-to-end processes to achieve at least $650 million of net cost reductions over the next two years with full run rate in 2020. As Margo mentioned, this is an even more significant opportunity to take cost out of the business than the original $150 million to $200 million we announced at Investor Day.","As we looked at the business, it became apparent that the proliferation of SKU count in our historical approach to planning led to operational inefficiencies and added cost to the system. The proliferation of SKUs over the last few years has been driven by our fragmented innovation pipeline in our Toy Box, representing 50% of our total SKUs, inconsistent operational execution across our regions and the lack of a merchandising standardization framework.","SKU proliferation has added cost across the P&L. Examples include: additional tooling costs; stress on plant capacity; excess inventories; higher logistics cost; increased obsolescence expense; and a disproportionate SG&A structure. Our previous approach to planning unintentionally rewarded higher targets and objectives through a greater allocation of resources.","Additionally, achieving targeted production optimization was made difficult as a result of insufficient processes related to our order quantities and frequency of changes. In combination, these shortcomings have resulted in the profit challenges we are confronting in our business today. That said, our structural simplification initiative is aimed at eliminating these drivers of cost inefficiencies from the organization, along with better balancing incentive compensation targets across revenue, gross margin and operating income.","Through our structural simplification initiative, we expect the following improvements to the P&L as we work to return to historical levels of performance. First, we will go after gross margin, which is our largest opportunity. As we simplify by streamlining the number of product lines, SKUs and improving our approach to demand planning, we will be able to significantly reduce our cost by a reduced tooling and logistics expense, and far better optimize manufacturing footprint, both ourselves and vendors with longer runs and better schedules.","The second largest bucket is SG&A, as we rebalance our workforce and address other indirect areas of spend. A significant portion of this reduction will come from simplifying and de-layering our corporate structure by increasing the average span of control from four to six for leadership positions and reducing the number of layers of leadership.","In addition, we will be reducing consultants and temporary labor spend. In total, these restructuring efforts will account for more than half of the SG&A reduction. While this will be a global reduction in head count, we will be careful not to impact customer-facing functions.","We will also continue to invest in core capabilities and support areas of strategic growth, including emerging markets, digital content strategy and creative functions to support innovation. Finally, we plan to optimize our global advertising spend by streamlining our number of product lines, while maintaining our strong support for our investments and partner opportunities.","We have a clear line of sight into 2018, where we expect to achieve one-third of the $650 million net savings through process simplification and the optimization of advertising, SG&A and cost of goods sold. Larger, more structural changes, like our manufacturing footprint and our investments in IT to allow us to further streamline our processes are expected to drive the remaining two-thirds in year two for a run rate savings of $650 million exiting 2019. In the meantime, I will provide you quarterly updates on our progress as we work to make Mattel a leaner, faster, smarter and more profitable business.","Looking ahead to the remainder of 2017, we expect to see revenue stabilization in the fourth quarter in contrast to last year's fourth quarter decline of negative 8% year-over-year and this quarter's decline. This would result in mid-single-digit decline in gross sales for the full year versus 2016, weighed down by recent Toys \"R\" Us chapter 11 filing and our lower-than-expected year-to-date financial performance. We will also be intently focused on managing retail inventories, and continue to make tough decisions to achieve a clean start to 2018.","As expected, capital expenditures were up in the third quarter, as we continue to make investments to grow the business, including increases in automation as well as to build our flagship American Girl store in New York City. As part of our structural simplification, we will be reviewing our capital spend to ensure it's appropriately optimized against our new strategic direction.","With regards to our capital financing plan, in the third quarter, we signed an amendment to our credit facility, establishing new covenant ratios along with a guarantee mechanism to provide continued access to the credit facility in the event of a potential rating agency downgrade during this repositioning phase of our transformation. In addition, we are proactively evaluating alternative forms of financing with our banks, including an ABL facility.","We are also suspending the dividend starting in the fourth quarter in order to increase financial flexibility over time, strengthen our balance sheet, and facilitate strategic investments. Executing on the strategic investments we outlined at our June Investor Day is more imperative now than ever. I am confident when implemented in conjunction with our structural simplification initiative will lead to improved revenue and profit growth.","As we exit 2017, we will have spent approximately $30 million on our strategic investments. We intend to invest $170 million beginning in 2018 over the next two years, as we continue to execute on our transformation plan. These investments will be focused on a number of key areas, including power brands 360-degree play experiences for toys and beyond toys; our emerging market investments, including China partnerships and select investments in other emerging markets; along with reshaping our operations, including the continuation of our IT transformation, mature market turnarounds and omni-channel and e-commerce capabilities.","Overall, we expect the breakdown of these investments to be more weighted toward operating expenses and capital expenditures. We also expect these initiatives to restore operating margins of 15% plus once our new model is fully implemented over the medium term.","While we have undoubtedly had our challenges this year, as I said earlier, I believe the fundamentals of this business remain intact. And during my short time at Mattel so far, it has become abundantly clear that we are in an industry that continues to grow, the opportunity we have, as a company, is substantial and sustainable. Parents will always care about the development of their children and children will always want to play. We are the company that can bring both fun and learning into the play experiences of children and families around the world.","We are well positioned. We continue to be a leader in the industry and have a large consistent revenue base with approximately 60% of our revenue generated by our power brands. We also have the opportunity to supplement this revenue base with the generation of new IP and continued collaborative execution with our licensed entertainment partners. And we have a significant opportunity to restore our margins through actions that are very much within our control.","With these solid fundamentals, a strong and refreshed leadership team and a clear set of strategies on which we've begun to execute, I believe Mattel presents a compelling shareholder value proposition, and I am confident we will deliver on this transformation, creating sustainable growth in the years ahead. While I might be new to Mattel, I am not new to executing transformation. And one thing I want to make very clear from the outset is that this transformation is achievable.","My goal is to improve the accuracy of our financial forecast and build a strong relationship with our investors one quarter at a time. We, as a management team, will hold ourselves accountable for the commitments we make to you. To do that, we will continue to provide you with quarterly updates on the progress of our strategy. On our fourth quarter earnings call, I will provide milestones on our structural simplification and our strategic investments for 2018. I'm glad to be here, and I look forward to partnering with the management team to realize the full potential of the opportunities ahead for Mattel.","I'll now turn it over to the operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian with Citigroup. Your line is open.","Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Did you mention the overall POS trends in the U.S.? And why you think that Hot Wheels, Fisher-Price, Thomas were seeing a little bit of softening trends there in the third quarter as well?","Mary Margaret Hastings Georgiadis - Mattel, Inc.","Richard, you want to take that?","Richard L. Dickson - Mattel, Inc.","Sure. Greg, we're remaining very confident, particularly in our core brand narrative, Barbie, Hot Wheels and Fisher-Price. We've seen the most significant progress, ultimately, on the Barbie brand, and we continue to strengthen that brand and others will, of course, follow. We certainly acknowledge that there's some work to do on American Girl and Thomas. Specifically, as you ask on Thomas, we've got some great powerful key item products. This quarter, with Thomas Super Station where our media is about to really kick in. And we're really looking forward to 2018 with that brand with new content that will hit the marketplace as we introduce a key (42:37), if you will, at MIPCOM that went really very, very favorable.","As we continue to look at the U.S. POS, POS is still better than our shipping levels. We're confident, particularly in our core brand narrative as I suggest. And even in new brands like Cars, we're continuously performing up to what we hope to be a good year for Cars.","Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Are you able to put a number around the U.S. POS or is that possible?","Richard L. Dickson - Mattel, Inc.","Total POS for us was slightly up when we look at our core brand narrative.","Mary Margaret Hastings Georgiadis - Mattel, Inc.","Sorry, Greg, was your question about specific brands? Could you just repeat the question just so we make sure we answer it?","Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","No, I think you did. I think that was helpful. And as you see the retailers reducing inventories for you, and it seems to be more than other manufacturers. When do you think that'll be more normalized, would you say, where shipping and sell-through are pretty similar?","Mary Margaret Hastings Georgiadis - Mattel, Inc.","So, Greg, as I shared earlier in my remarks, the divergence that we've seen between POS and shipping is largely explained by this inventory reduction situation that we articulated earlier. What we have seen is a stabilization of that trend towards the back half of the third quarter. And our sense is that we've largely worked through the biggest chunk of it, that roughly 15% to 20%. And we expect and will obviously closely monitor it going forward. There will always be a little bit of a downward pressure due to e-commerce, that pivot to e-commerce because it's more demand-driven supply chain, but we do believe that we work through the majority of that issue at this point.","Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","So, fourth quarter is going to \u2013 the shipments will reflect more of a POS, right?","Mary Margaret Hastings Georgiadis - Mattel, Inc.","Well, the fourth quarter is obviously a very different quarter because you have the timing of shipment and sales. It can be a little bit different between the two quarters. But, yes, we would expect, over time, the POS and the shipping to align.","Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Right. Okay. Yeah. I mean, fourth quarter is an unusual quarter for that. Good. And then just finally, so the sales slowed in early September for Toys \"R\" Us, so I'm wondering, that's in addition to that $43 million reversal, right? So that's an incremental for the third quarter?","Mary Margaret Hastings Georgiadis - Mattel, Inc.","Correct. As we were aware that they were potentially going to go bankrupt, as you know from public documents, we had a large exposure to Toys \"R\" Us. And not understanding exactly the timing of the bankruptcy, we made the difficult decision to begin to reduce shipments to them until we understood fully what the plan was. And then it took quite some time for us to begin shipping again, because of the timing of their own settlement. In fact, the final settlement only happened a couple of days ago. So, they account for more than half of the decline in North American sales in the quarter.","Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. All right. And just finally, so if you were to look at some of the one-time impact to sales, and you were \u2013 let's say on a go-forward basis, if those were to have been eliminated, so would you be seeing sort of flat or up a little bit shipments? Is that probably because it's similar to POS where you said it was up a little bit? Is that where you would expect kind of a normalized sales growth because there are obviously a lot of one-time impacts this quarter?","Mary Margaret Hastings Georgiadis - Mattel, Inc.","Correct.","Richard L. Dickson - Mattel, Inc.","Yeah, correct. I think your answering is just totally right in the fact that getting this stuff out, you get back to stable and then you start finding your pathway back to growth. So, yeah, I think you hit the nail on the head.","Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","All right. Thank you very much.","Richard L. Dickson - Mattel, Inc.","Yeah.","Mary Margaret Hastings Georgiadis - Mattel, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Linda Bolton Weiser with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.","Linda Bolton Weiser - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Yes, hi. You had mentioned some disruption also on margins due to the opening of a new distribution center on the East Coast. Is there anything like that or similar to that coming up in the coming months or next year that you can envision also causing disruption of that sort?","Richard L. Dickson - Mattel, Inc.","No. No. It's something that we started earlier in the year. We ran into a little bit of an additional cost issue as we were exiting second quarter into third quarter. And that's what caused the blip, but no there's nothing on the horizon. Currently, we haven't finished the 2018 plan, but nothing that I'm aware of that that would cause a similar situation next year.","Linda Bolton Weiser - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Okay. And then just sort of in a kind of broader strategic sense, I guess, more with regard to the brands and the strategies with regard to the brands. Margo, as you've started to examine the business more, are there any actions that were taken in the past that you feel were so misplaced strategically that they actually have to be reversed? I mean, just one example would be, launching of WellieWishers as a sub-line under American Girl. I mean, are there any actions that were in the past that you really feel were damaging to certain brands?","Mary Margaret Hastings Georgiadis - Mattel, Inc.","Now, what I can tell you is that we've been going through each one of the brands against a very specific framework about where and how we want them to compete. What I would say is, one of the biggest opportunities for us is to, overall and then by market, have a much clearer shared understanding across our company about where we're trying to play and win. And so I do think we have significant opportunities in some of our brands to be far more focused about where our biggest opportunities are. We tend to expand age ranges quickly, or go into new categories, not always with as much depth or focus that I think we would benefit from for some of our brands.","In addition, as we shared earlier on the call, one thing we've made very strong progress in resetting the foundation for our power brands, the center of the value propositions for those, putting quality back in those products. There have been a lot of choices made in the previous years to kind of take some costs out of the system. We put the quality back in, so we really command that premium price and experience.","But in addition to try to outrun some of the challenges with Monster High, Ever After High and Disney Princess, we've launched a large number of items over that time period, which, I think, really drove a very high level of complexity, which was something that when I stood in June, I hadn't fully anticipated the scale of that SKU creep and the resulting cost around it. And when you compound that, as Joe was saying, with the relatively high sales targets that we were setting, you really just build up a tremendous amount of issues within our supply chain infrastructure as well as a bloated corporate center. So, I think those things are enormous opportunities for us to streamline, as I said on the structural simplification program, to focus on the things that offer us the biggest opportunity. And so, I think we're really excited about the going-forward plan to be leaner, meaner and faster.","Linda Bolton Weiser - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Okay. Thank you very much.","Mary Margaret Hastings Georgiadis - Mattel, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Gerrick Johnson with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey, thank you. I have two questions. First, just for Joe. Can you explain the $47 million sales reversal? Others are taking a bad debt charge in operating expense. So, accounting wise, what are you doing with the sales reversal, and why? And Margo, I've heard a lot about SKU rationalization process, cost savings, things like that. But not a lot on how you make better toys, cooler toys, more fun toys. And what are some steps you're taking to just make better toys? Thank you.","Joseph J. Euteneuer - Mattel, Inc.","Sure. In regards to your first question on the reversal, in looking at Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, when a situation like this happens, you look at your receivables and stuff on a first-in first-out basis, which means the last stuff you have that is reported in the period of the bankruptcy is actually a reversal of revenue, rather than a bad debt expense. And so, it was something that we reviewed with our auditors. And we're confident in the accounting that we have.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Thank you.","Mary Margaret Hastings Georgiadis - Mattel, Inc.","And then, Gerrick, on your questions on the cooler toys, the more fun toys, completely agree with you that creativity is the hallmark of this company, and something that we absolutely needed to reignite. The wonder values that we'd actually put in place are so much at the foundation of what's important in this company. In fact, just today, we had something we call Creative Con, and we've, under Rich's direction, created a creative counsel that really ties together our distinctive creative leaders and talent from across all of the brands we've been quite solid in the past and bringing them all together, and really enabling us to have really incredible mix fairs and other places where we're really celebrating creativity. We're bringing in external speakers to challenge our thinking and really taking more advantage of the inspiration that we have out there.","In addition, I'm a big believer. If you look at many of the hottest toys that are in the market today, they're really very much driven by insights and the focus groups of the world. It doesn't take much to go online and see all the unboxing videos and see the things that inspire kids in the media today. And we very much need to be more aggressive of taking advantage of those insights, combining them with the latest materials, technology and other things to ensure that we are coming to the market more consistently with some of those breakthrough ideas, both within our existing core iconic brands as well as launching new initiatives.","I'm very excited about certain products that we've launched this year for example such as Kamigami. We brought that to market in less than nine months from beginning to end. It's a really wonderful execution of how do we bring a magical experience with robotics to kids. And it appeals to both boys and girls, and it's a wonderful opportunity for us.","Another great example of breakthrough innovation is our Imaginext, which continues to come out with some of the most creative and breakout toys in the marketplace. The Batbot has been featured as one of the hot toys for the holidays. And that's really a great example of us at our best when we really focus on that inspiration and innovation portion of the company.","And that SKU rationalization initiative, actually, will create enormous opportunity for us to free up the time of our creative organization and our supply chain to focus much more on innovation versus the SKU creep. We have so many different versions for different retailers, the localization process and all those different things were actually making it harder for us to actually focus on the magic. So, we're very excited to get back to that focus in the company.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. Thank you, Margo.","Mary Margaret Hastings Georgiadis - Mattel, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Arpine Kocharyan with UBS. Your line is open.","Arpine Kocharyan - UBS Securities LLC","Hi, thanks. So, the $650 million of cost reduction in your release, it sounds like the incremental is about $450 million to $500 million. Does that mean half of that into next year flows through to your operating margin in terms of the benefit, in other words operating margins will benefit in a magnitude of about $150 million to $200 million? Do we understand that, if you could clarify that?","And then, I understand this comes with some kind of right-sizing of top line. Could you perhaps talk about the extent of that right-sizing for next year? I guess, what I'm trying to understand is, does this resetting includes getting rid of some brands that have been an overhang for you? What are the implications for top line? And I know it's very hard to forecast Q4 here from a base perspective, but, thank you.","Joseph J. Euteneuer - Mattel, Inc.","Sure. So, I think on your first question, yeah, the $650 million, we are assuming that we're going to get a third of it next year and two-thirds in the year after. If you're netting the $170 million of investments against the $650 million, yes, I would look at it in the same way. Take that net number and assume a third of it hits the bottom line next year and two-thirds in the year after.","Arpine Kocharyan - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah.","Mary Margaret Hastings Georgiadis - Mattel, Inc.","Arpine, on the revenue piece, the way I think about it is, the reason why we gave you those dramatic numbers in terms of the SKU creep in the company is that a lot of that actually isn't attached to a lot of revenue, much of that was driven by localization practices. We're a very global business, and our localization didn't have a systematic process. Each one of the markets could request a localized version of almost product on the SKU list. And so, when you launch so many new things, the people could request their own version, that just drove the amount of complexity without a lot of return.","In addition, there's been an increasing demand, which is an industry trend for merchants to want exclusives. Again, that was not a process that was managed centrally. So, for example, the hypermarket in France might have requested an exclusive, in addition to someone in the U.S., in addition to somebody in Australia, et cetera. So, there's not as much issue in terms of revenue losses, you would think, given some of these things are driven by the multiplication factor of a long tail of launches, localization, lack of standardization and merchandising, lack of standardization across market. So that's one of the reasons why we were comfortable announcing a much larger cost-reduction initiative, because by streamlining and simplifying across the board, we can actually take a lot of cost out with a lot of revenue impact.","We are still working our way. And this year, I think was the end of some of those bigger challenges such as the Monster High, Ever After High. We've largely worked our way through those challenges in our Toy Box large brands, where they were in very large decline, in fact \u2013 and I think you and I had even talked about the fact that Monster High and Ever After High, the loss from that was as big this year as it was last year. So, if you think about, we've had many strong performances, for example on Cars, but they've been offset by some of these continued falls. We've largely worked our way through those large numbers this year. So, we look at this as really a reset year for Mattel, and then we'll start to see the benefits of our transformation into 2018 with a lot more focus and a lot leaner approach to how we run the business.","Arpine Kocharyan - UBS Securities LLC","Very helpful thank you.","Mary Margaret Hastings Georgiadis - Mattel, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Michael Ng - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you so much for the question. I have a couple. First, I wanted to dig in a little bit on the manufacturing facility footprint restructuring in 2018. Would you reassess the ownership of some of your manufacturing facilities and consider transitioning to an asset-light model and use third-party manufacturers?","Richard L. Dickson - Mattel, Inc.","Yes.","Michael Ng - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. And did the recent covenant renegotiation that you did, did that contemplate the results that you guys reported today?","Joseph J. Euteneuer - Mattel, Inc.","No. The covenant was done before our results, I mean, it was before I got here. So, I think it was done in September, so it was before \u2013 well, I guess, they were clearly, in putting the amendment together, they were giving themselves the waiver for anything that would happen within the quarter. So, I guess, they anticipated that they didn't want to be caught in this quarter. So, yes, I guess, the answer would be yes.","Michael Ng - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. So, I guess, said differently, do you think the covenant levels for 4Q and then into 2018 are good levels given your current plan? Or do you think there's a risk that you may have to renegotiate those?","Joseph J. Euteneuer - Mattel, Inc.","Yeah. So, look, being new, I'm just getting my head around what we think we're going to do in 2018. And as Margo said, we're going to have the bottoms-up budget. So, we're going to take a look at that as we speak, and adjust that. The other thing I'm doing is, along with touching every line item in the P&L, I'm looking at the capital structure and looking at what alternatives are and trying to find the most cost-effective one that'll serve the needs of the company in the long-term to take care of its needs to continue going. So, I haven't come to any conclusions yet, but we are turning over every stone to take a look at what works for us.","Michael Ng - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks. And then just a comment on the guidance for revenue stabilization in 4Q. Do you think that stabilization holds into 2018? I'm just trying to think about whether or not you're assuming that revenue can grow in 2018.","Joseph J. Euteneuer - Mattel, Inc.","Well, yeah. So, look, I think in regard to 2018, we're in the process of getting it forecasted out. The idea, I think, when we talk about stabilization is, look, we got to get back to have a stable revenue or zero growth to then start re-growing the company. 2018 is four quarters ahead of us. And we would like to think that we're going to see some growth in some of those quarters. How it ends up for the full year, we'll come back to you on the year-end call and give you more detail.","Michael Ng - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Joseph J. Euteneuer - Mattel, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Tim Conder with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Timothy Andrew Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you. And thank you for the color so far. Very much appreciated. And Joe, welcome aboard, sir.","Joseph J. Euteneuer - Mattel, Inc.","Thank you.","Timothy Andrew Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","A couple of things here. Margo, Joe, whoever wants to take this. The inventory clearance sort of that last 25% with The Toy Box and so forth, so it sounds like, and please correct me if my assumption's wrong here, that you've flushed through a lot of that. Many of those brands that you own will go into the vault, and that would be potentially also part of your manufacturing footprint reduction that you're kind of finalizing up. Is there anything I'm missing in that sort of a chain of logic?","Mary Margaret Hastings Georgiadis - Mattel, Inc.","I think that's a very good chain of logic. We're taking a tough look at all the different things that we're trying to put through our supply chain. Not just our own, but 50% is in-sourced today and 50% is outsourced. And so, the combination of the long tail of SKUs many of which have been ordered in quite small quantities, plus the forecasting approach where we started with a very high target and then worked our way down has led to essentially a lot of fragmentation, a lot of challenges in scheduling, as we talked about earlier, that are not optimal.","And so, we are very confident when we're able to set a tighter plan from the beginning of the year, reduce the number of SKUs that we're trying to make that the alignment of those two things alone, gives you such a benefit on your existing and your vendor manufacturing footprint. And then going into the beginning of 2018, we'll also talk about the broader strategic approach to how we want to drive our investments and things like manufacturing going forward.","Timothy Andrew Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. So that would sound like even beyond what you're basically, let's call it, throw it in the vault, there are other footprint reduction considerations that seem potentially very viable.","Mary Margaret Hastings Georgiadis - Mattel, Inc.","Very viable, especially when you think about when you do that many short runs, it's just incredibly inefficient for you and the vendor. You just don't get optimal pricing. And so, we want to make sure that the way we're setting our plans, both the number of SKUs and the way we set our sales target enables our supply chain to be dramatically improved. And I know that our entire company end-to-end is really excited about that opportunity for structural simplification, because we'll be able to do some of the things that we really want to do for also our retail partners, which provide far better in-stock levels for them, which is just sales sitting on the table. And then in addition to that, we'll be able to get our products to market far faster, because there'll be a lot less pressure on our system. So, you can imagine that as we've discovered and got into this much more deeply than I was in June, it's very exciting for us to really put this kind of a program together across the company for how we're going to run this business differently end-to-end and free up that many resources so that we'll be able to actually have a very different profile of business going forward.","Timothy Andrew Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then, Margo, one of the other 25% was at tighter retail management, and maybe you were just alluding to that there. But, is that also a step function adjustment, given \u2013 is that occurring or could we continue to see another maybe one or two step functions, given that you said Mattel tends to have more evergreen brands maybe than others in the industry? How do you see that part?","Mary Margaret Hastings Georgiadis - Mattel, Inc.","As I shared earlier, we saw this as a trend after we worked off that inventory overhang from Q4, we started to see at the end of Q2 a little bit of a trend. We weren't sure if that was driven by e-commerce. And as we got into Q3 and spent more time working with our retail partners, we did assess that it was a more structural resetting of their inventories with us as their new working capital policies were kicking in.","In addition to that, we had, as we shared, higher weeks on hand that perhaps others in the system due to some of the sales incentive practices that we had in the prior years. And therefore, we do think that this was a larger one-time structural adjustment into this year. But then it's starting to stabilize exiting Q3, and we would expect to see always a little bit of downward pressure with the shift to e-commerce, but we're not anticipating another step function decline that would happen rapidly.","Timothy Andrew Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Okay. Helpful. And then lastly, Joe, just to follow up on one of the prior questions. As you see things now looking at year end, I know there's still a lot of variability, do you anticipate that that $450 million leverage covenant will be sufficient?","Joseph J. Euteneuer - Mattel, Inc.","Look, we're only into October. We are anticipating having a pretty good fourth quarter. We are looking at doing things in the quarter to increase our profitability, given what we've come off on the third quarter. So, I don't know that I actually have the answer to that question. And as I said, I am look at the entire capital structure and our alternative is just to make sure I have them.","Timothy Andrew Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you, both. Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steph Wissink with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Stephanie Wissink - Jefferies LLC","Thank you. Two questions from us as well. Margo, if you could talk a little bit about this idea of rationalizing SKUs, does that mean fewer bigger ideas as well as a shorter tail? And how does that play out in your ad spend in some of your gross to net spread? How should we think about the balance of those costs? And then, Joe, for you. Just a question around the $650 million. How does that play into the management incentive models? Is there an incentive structure built around cost savings? Or how do you motivate your team down below to make sure that's focused?","Joseph J. Euteneuer - Mattel, Inc.","That's a great question. Yeah. That's why we both said that we're going to change the incentive plan starting in 2018. You need a balance, right? You need to have \u2013 you keep the eye on the ball and making sure that we achieve these cost takeouts so that we can improve our profitability. But, at the same time, we have to stay focused on the top line. So, we're going to get that balance between the top line, taking the expense out, profitability and then our investments. And I think if we focus that on a holistic basis, we'll be a much better company going forward.","Mary Margaret Hastings Georgiadis - Mattel, Inc.","And to answer your other question on the advertising investment; this was a significant challenge. Again, as I dug in at a much, much more detailed level, what we uncovered as we moved to one brand leader that was one of the big changes we made so that we could really think about managing the portfolio on an integrated basis, so we have Juliana Chugg now looks across all of our brands. That was a key organization decision.","As we then looked at that and really thought about how do we allocate our resources at a much more detailed level, we were uncovering that we were spending as much on a lot of these small long tail launches as we were, disproportionately versus their productivity, even versus our core brand. So, in fact, it's a double benefit for us that we can better optimize the investments in our core brand as well as put more investments, as I was sharing earlier, around the properties that we really believe in. So, this is going to give us, I believe, a significant return on the investments that we're making going forward.","Stephanie Wissink - Jefferies LLC","And then one follow-up, if I could. This is a nomenclature question. But the word stability had been used a lot in the past. And I just want to clarify, does that mean that you don't expect to see further rate decline or that you expect to see flat comparable, whether it's sales, margins? What does the world stability mean overall?","Joseph J. Euteneuer - Mattel, Inc.","Sure. As referring to the fourth quarter?","Stephanie Wissink - Jefferies LLC","Just in general. As you talk about stability, does that mean \u2013 yeah.","Joseph J. Euteneuer - Mattel, Inc.","When you have a company that's been in decline, the first thing you do is get to flat. Right? So, wherever you are, you just want to sort of flatten things out, so you can turn the curve back up to growth. So, stability is just trying to get to flat.","Stephanie Wissink - Jefferies LLC","Thank you. Appreciate it.","Joseph J. Euteneuer - Mattel, Inc.","And by the way, just one other point is, remember, this isn't going to be a V, it's going to be a U. It's sort of like you're going to start flattening out and it's going to take a little bit and then it starts coming back up. So, I just want to point out that when you're going through these things, I'd love to say you just hit a point in time and its one day and boom, you're back up. It does take a little bit of transition at flat to head back up to positivity.","Stephanie Wissink - Jefferies LLC","Thanks, Joe.","Joseph J. Euteneuer - Mattel, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Your line is open.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Thank you very much. Wanted to start with a clarification and I have a few others. Just, Margo, in response to or just in relation to an earlier question, I just want to be more specific. When you think about the top line, you had explained that removing the SKUs wasn't really going to have much of an impact because those just weren't productive. So, we're still looking at a company that would be a $5-ish billion revenue type of company. Is that fair?","Mary Margaret Hastings Georgiadis - Mattel, Inc.","Fair.","Joseph J. Euteneuer - Mattel, Inc.","Yes.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. And then \u2013 and Joe, the net cost savings that you defined is slightly over 30% of operating expenses. I'm also wondering...","Joseph J. Euteneuer - Mattel, Inc.","No.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","No?","Joseph J. Euteneuer - Mattel, Inc.","Well, I think what you have to do is, you got to look at where we've come off historically, right? So, if you think the company was at a $6.5 billion company, and what the expense basically was there versus the drop in revenue. And remember, you need to include the cost of goods sold in this, right? So, it's not just SG&A or advertising, it's really going after the cost of goods sold to drive a much improved gross margin and then in additionally hitting the other line items of the P&L.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. So, can you help...","Mary Margaret Hastings Georgiadis - Mattel, Inc.","Think about it as having your SG&A in alignment with more industry standard level that you would expect, which when we de-scale we're not quite in alignment. Getting our A&P cleaned up, and then getting your COGS back, again, where a more simplified, more focused, lean machine would actually deliver a COGS line.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah. No, it all makes sense and it's quite refreshing to hear. I just think it was helpful to put that all in context. Is there a way you could tell us what the gross number is?","Joseph J. Euteneuer - Mattel, Inc.","That's a great question. I mean, I think the only reason I said net is that it really is the gross number, because we're going to take it right to the bottom line. Other than the fact that we said that of the $650 million, we are going to use about $170 million over the two years for investments. So that's the way to think about it.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then, just stepping back from all of this, and I realize this is a tough question, but you talked about the U, which I think was helpful, but how long do you think it takes for the company to kind of get on the other side of the U? To get to a more productive steady state?","Joseph J. Euteneuer - Mattel, Inc.","Yeah. So, I mean, look, I'll give you a guy who's only been here 30-days opinion. When I look at the top line, we have our five core brands, two of which are great, one is doing really good. You got two others that, when you look at it, there are executional issues that I think we can fix. I mean, I have a lot of confidence in our ability to get this thing turned around, but the issue is, is you need a little runway room because of the cycle time of what happens in here and we're trying \u2013 you heard Margo talk about improvement of the cycle time. I think all those things, as we move out, will help us increase the speed of moving the top line growth, and from a cost perspective, I think the things we need to do is just get a better integration across the line, and obviously, focusing on margins first before we hit the medium-term plan are what we need to do.","So, I think it's very doable. And the thing that I'm trying to work out, and I've only been here 30 days, is the speed of getting it done and how fast can I not only help you on the top line, but get you the bottom line contribution. And the easiest way on the bottom line obviously is expense take out, but without hurting the momentum that we're starting to build on the top line.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Helpful. And then, Margo or Richard or whoever else may be on the call, on American Girl, because of some decisions that were made previously, Toys \"R\" Us is one of your distribution partners there. And when it was presented at the time, it became kind of an important partner along with Kohl's. How do we think about an American Girl reinvigoration as you also have to reduce the exposure of that brand to Toys \"R\" Us?","Richard L. Dickson - Mattel, Inc.","So, I'll start and Margo can step in on this. But, as I mentioned to you, our objective here is to drive a return to the premium brand positioning of American Girl. And it's not something that's going to be, to some extent, a fix overnight, but there are several programs in place, essentially sort of house style (1:15:57) investments, building new consumer relationships, significantly driving new girl engagement with refresh content that we're starting to build, and ultimately ensuring that our products have the premium quality and appeal that they have always had historically.","In messaging as well, we're driving new marketing. We're launching a new program called Character Counts, which essentially is the essence of the American Girl narrative. We're working on customer service aspects of both our store and our call-in. And we are also leveraging data collection. And we'll continue to optimize all of the marketing along the path to purchase in the right place to get this back to premium status.","And, by the way, as I mentioned to you, our New York City store flagship opening later this month, I hope to see many of you out there. We're really excited about new experiences and what that will bring to the franchise.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Richard L. Dickson - Mattel, Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Drew Crum with Stifel. Your line is open.","Andrew Edward Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. So, Joe, I think you identified gross margin as the largest opportunity with respect to cost reduction. If you look at the business, the mix has changed pretty drastically over the last couple of years when dolls was about 45% of gross sales back in 2013, the gross margin peaked at around 54%. Today that's about 30%, 35% of your mix, and obviously gross margin has been under pressure. So, aside from reducing tooling and logistics, do you see mix as an impediment to improving the gross margin profile of this business or maybe it's an opportunity?","Joseph J. Euteneuer - Mattel, Inc.","Yeah. So, the first two things that you said for the cost takeout are totally spot on, but I do think the latter is an opportunity. We should view it as an opportunity. The fact is, when you go back historically and look at what was going on, the company lost Disney Princess and Monster High, and all of a sudden started sprinting at trying to outrun the loss of that revenue. And when you have a 64% increase in your SKUs for half of your non-core brands, that's a big deal, you know? That's just any of this (01:18:20). So, I think there are things we can do there, and I do view it as an opportunity.","Andrew Edward Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And separately, maybe for Margo, you've identified one of key strategic pillars is growing the emerging markets business. Are you willing to size that business and just talk about how you balance growth versus reaching breakeven, because right-sizing the cost structure and realigning the cost structure seems to be thematic on this call. So, just talk about balancing growth versus profitability for emerging markets.","Mary Margaret Hastings Georgiadis - Mattel, Inc.","So, we are very focused on a strong ROI for shareholders in our emerging markets. We actually have multiple of our high-growth emerging markets that are already extremely profitable. And we're very, very disciplined about how we're investing against the absolute size of the opportunity. So, for example, our tolerance for investment would be higher in a place like China, where you've got a 3 to 4x opportunity and the ability for us to establish ourselves as the clear differentiated market leader in a window where literally there is a breakout moment for parents and kids as the baby boomers move into child-bearing age.","And then you've got, on top of that, the two-child policy, and then you've got rising income. So that's just an accelerating opportunity for us. So, we should over-invest. I think in some of the other markets, we're taking a very stepwise approach in thinking about how could we change the game and go into those markets with a more efficient model.","With, in many of those countries, they are very digital first, particularly in Asia, and there's sort of an opportunity for us to leverage partnership such as Alibaba and others so that we can enter and scale more cost effectively into those places. So, we're taking a very disciplined approach to it. And we'll be sharing more with you over the coming quarters given that we do believe this is one of the most exciting opportunities in the industry.","Andrew Edward Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mike Schwartz with SunTrust. Your line is open.","Michael A. Swartz - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Yeah. Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Margo, I just want to touch on something that you had talked about briefly in your prepared remarks. I think you had thrown out some numbers of \u2013 the opportunity for some of the core brands and growth you see longer term. Could you just give us a little more color about how you get there, and what maybe you're anticipating in terms of market growth during that period as well?","Mary Margaret Hastings Georgiadis - Mattel, Inc.","Sure. Are you referring to the Barbie and Fisher-Price examples that I gave in terms of the refresh that we've done? Is that what you mean?","Michael A. Swartz - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Yes.","Mary Margaret Hastings Georgiadis - Mattel, Inc.","So, as we've created the 360-degree play experiences and the systems work, we've systematically laid out both for those brands and across markets where we see the most attractive opportunities for growth. And for example, in the case of Hot Wheels, if you just look at us continuing the strength on the track set side, as well as the diversification of our core iconic car, you add back in terms of driving up your attachment rate, as I talked about.","When I was at Investor Day, and then you have us taking a modest portion of the construction industry, for example, of that segment, in some of our key markets, you pretty quickly get to some of those numbers. So, we've sized these both in terms of looking at our share in existing categories, looking at key adjacencies where we have a right to win, and then looking at how would we layer that by market. So, we've done that for each one of these brands. And that's how we think about that.","We've also looked at, obviously, the market growth rate versus our growth rate, the benchmark for what we think is achievable and what other people have done in similar circumstances. And we do feel pretty confident. And obviously, the profile is slightly different for each one, right? For Hot Wheels, obviously, it's the attachment, right, of the play sets and the track sets, and then obviously, also moving into the construction play pattern.","In the case of Barbie, we've actually been that size in the past. We've been a 20% share player in the doll industry before. So, how you think about that is regaining our footprint and really innovating across more of the doll platform as well as extending some of our experiences.","And on the Fisher-Price side, again, we have been a much bigger player and a much stronger player historically, but for different reasons around margin decisions and other things like that, we'd exit some of the categories. If you thought about us as consistently executing the range of products that a mom wants for her baby from zero to five, and doing that consistently well, plus the enormous opportunity in a place like China, which is now the number two brand for Fisher-Price, again, you can get to these numbers quite easily, and you don't need everything to be perfect.","Michael A. Swartz - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","That's helpful. Thank you. And then, Joe, just with the net cost reductions of $650 million in the next couple years. You gave us the sequencing by year, but I didn't hear it, I apologize if you said it. But how do you think about that by buckets, cost of goods sold, A&P, SG&A?","Joseph J. Euteneuer - Mattel, Inc.","I think, I didn't give any specific guidance on that, but what I would tell you to just look at historically and benchmark the company of where SG&A should be as a percentage sales or gross margin and stuff like that, and I think you can get pretty close to how we're going to attack this thing.","Michael A. Swartz - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.","Joseph J. Euteneuer - Mattel, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Eric Handler with MKM Partners. Your line is open.","Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC","Yes. Thanks for the questions. I want to focus on a couple different brands. First, American Girl doll; as you think about expanding the company gross margin and you think about the current state of retail, does it make sense to maybe shrink the American Girl store presence, or is that something that you think is vital to the brand? And then maybe focus more on the online channel at the expense of bricks and mortar retail?","And then with Thomas, and this predates you guys, but when HIT Entertainment was acquired, the strength of the Thomas brand was probably at an all-time high. And since then, there's been a decay. And meanwhile, with the HIT brands other than Thomas, it seems like a lot of those brands, or pretty much all the brands were nearly shuttered and sort of locked in a vault somewhere. How do you think about what you have with HIT, and why Thomas fell, and maybe how do you get it back?","Mary Margaret Hastings Georgiadis - Mattel, Inc.","So, let me take these in turn. First, American Girl is just a phenomenal franchise. And we have enormous opportunity to regenerate that business and really get back to that direct to consumer excellence that really was the hallmark of that property historically. In terms of the store footprint, we will always be optimizing the returns of those things. It's a very profitable franchise for us. So, it's, in my view, much more about resetting the stage for how do we actually sustain the steady growth of the franchise, and the consumer engagement through CRM and other content-driven initiatives that built passion for the franchise. It's still one of the most beloved product of all times.","In terms of Thomas, I'll take that in two parts. The HIT acquisition, as I've really looked into the incredible IP library that this company has. One of the things I had mentioned on the call was, one of my priorities was to ensure that we had taken back control over the rights of our IP, because we have one of the best portfolios of kids and family IP in the world. And we were not fully taking advantage of the opportunities against that IP in terms of how we thought about content development, which then, I think, dovetails into the opportunity for Thomas.","I think when the company purchased Thomas, they had a strong content development capability. I can't really speak to the past, but I think we did not probably leverage those capabilities as well as we should have, but we still actually have those incredible IP assets. Thomas' challenge is \u2013 again, still a very beloved franchise, but the competitive market, and we were not as quick to the punch as we should have been in terms of updating and refreshing that content. I'm incredibly excited about the new content we just launched. You can search for it online. We just launched it at MIPCOM to rave reviews. And I feel like we're right in the zone of really what matters. We've got three new girl categories. Thomas is getting out of Sodor and he's traveling the world.","And in addition, we have partnered with the UN in having Thomas teach kids about some of the key elements of sustainability, which we know is incredibly important to millennial moms. So, Thomas really just needed to be modernized, but the beloved play pattern and its success is really significant. And if you take a market like China where we're extremely successful with Thomas, and we do a theatrical and that sells out instantly. We localize the engine. We've done a wonderful job of making it part of popular culture. We just actually launched a movie there in September. It was number two in the box office during that period. So, we know when we execute this franchise well, we deliver enormous returns for the company, but we've not done a consistently good job as I talked on Investor Day at supporting these franchises across markets.","So, Richard and I are extremely aligned in how we could think differently, and one of the reasons we flattened out our international structure with things reporting directly to Richard, and are driving a very different kind of an accountability approach to how we develop and manage our franchises across markets.","I don't know Richard if you want to add anything.","Richard L. Dickson - Mattel, Inc.","The only thing I can add is in the context of the HIT portfolio outside of Thomas. We are looking to monetize the IP within that portfolio, and have announced various different deals associated with DHX and 9 Story, particularly for Bob the Builder, Barney, Angelina, brands like Fireman Sam. These are not necessarily key brands in the context of our focus as Mattel, but they are certainly intellectual property within HIT that we're looking to monetize and have some great partners in place to start to reactivate some of those properties.","Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC","Great. Very helpful. And just one other follow-up. At your Analyst Day, or Investor Day, you spoke a lot about the need to go after more licenses. And given your statements today, is that changing at all? What's your view there?","Mary Margaret Hastings Georgiadis - Mattel, Inc.","Our license partnerships are a real focus of our business. In my remarks earlier, I emphasized the fact that partnerships with people like Disney, Warner Brothers, Universal, Disney, WWE are at the cornerstone of leveraging our capabilities of the company, both our creative and innovative designs, as well as the way we can take products to market globally. And I think our success with Cars, despite the initial slow box office in the U.S., and then our ability to take that franchise globally and come close to our initial targets in close, close partnership with Disney really demonstrates our ability to take a franchise and take it to the next level.","The Jurassic line that we put out next year, incredibly excited about that partnership with Universal. We've received rave reviews from retailers across the world about the innovation that's in that product, and how excited they are to carry that at retail. And Richard has been working literally weekly with all those partners, and we're excited about what's ahead, Richard.","Richard L. Dickson - Mattel, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, part of that Toy Box strategy originally was twofold. Of course, one was to reestablish the partnership in the entertainment community, which I believe that we've done a great job and made some great progress, indicative of the brands Margo mentioned. But also noting, as we look to 2018 with some of the new properties from partnerships like Warner Brothers, Justice League, which we haven't mentioned, is launching at the end of this year. So, we'll have a nice new brand in 2018 that has a clean slate. And also at the end of 2018, with Warner Brothers, we also have Aquaman, which we're incredibly also excited about.","So, partnership is a key component of our strategy. And as we mentioned, fewer things, bigger and better that ultimately will benefit these type of partnerships as we look to redeploy the resources that were fragmented across many, many other aspects and look to enhance and reinforce those fewer things in a bigger and better and more pronounced way.","Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And I'm not showing any further questions at this time.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to your host, Drew Vollero. Please go ahead.","Drew Vollero","Thank you, Stephanie. As you know, this morning, we reported Mattel's 2013 second quarter financial results. We've provided you with a slide presentation to help guide our discussions today. The slide presentation and the information required by Regulation G regarding non-GAAP financial measures is available on the Investors and Media section of our corporate website, corporate.mattel.com.","In a few minutes, Bryan Stockton, Mattel's Chairman and CEO; Tim Kilpin, Mattel's Executive Vice President of Global Brands; and Kevin Farr, Mattel's CFO, will provide comments on the results and then the call will be open for your questions.","Certain statements made during the call may include forward-looking statements related to the future performance of our overall business, brands and product lines. These statements are based on currently available information, and they're subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties, which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.","We describe some of these uncertainties in the Risk Factors section of our 2012 annual report on Form 10-K, and our 2013 quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and in other filings we make with the SEC from time-to-time, as well as in other public statements. Mattel does not update forward-looking statements and expressly disclaims any obligation to do so.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bryan.","Bryan G. Stockton","Thank you, Drew, and good day, everyone. Before we get into a discussion on our results for the quarter, I'd like to take a moment to talk about the industry and Mattel in general as we exit the preseason and head into the second half of the year, where we do about 2\/3 of our business.","Overall, the global toy industry came out of the first half of 2013 in pretty good shape. Industry trends were consistent with recent history, with toy categories sales flat to slightly down in the U.S. and Western Europe, and growing in Latin America, Eastern Europe and Asia.","For Mattel specifically, important emerging growth markets such as China, Russia and India, continued to prove to be fertile ground, as all grew by double digits in the second quarter.","According to NPD, when you include American Girl, Mattel gained total toy share in both the U.S. and the Euro 5. At the category level, according to NPD, dolls represent one of the fastest-growing parts of the Toy industry, growing 11% in the U.S. and 4% in Europe through May.","As the #1 player in the doll category, Mattel is well-positioned with the top 4 brands globally, including Barbie, American Girl, Monster High and Disney Princess. As NPD data reflects, we continue to grow our overall doll share as we successfully innovate and diversify our portfolio.","Now turning to Mattel. As I mentioned earlier, we consider the first half of the year our preseason, and we tend not to read too much into the numbers. That said, overall, our underlying performance is consistent with our long-term financial goals for sales, gross margin and EPS growth.","While there are number of puts and takes by brand and country, we finished the first half with revenues up 4%, gross margins up 150 basis points and EPS up 7%. Although ongoing strategic investments impacted the bottom line, we're already seeing strong returns from these investments in places like Russia, China and American Girl stores. We expect these returns to continue into the second half of the year.","We strengthened our position at retail, as our consistent focus on improving the supply chain generated another quarter of reduced retail inventories, and we improved our alignment of promotional spending to support our second half initiatives. Now let's focus on results for the second quarter.","Five key themes remain consistent with our first quarter performance: Our powerhouse Girls portfolio; sustained international growth; strong gross margins; a continued commitment to capital deployment; and strategic investments for future growth.","Let me touch on each briefly. Our Girls portfolio continues to be the engine that's fueling our global growth. The portfolio drives approximately 40% of company revenues, and it grew again 6% in the second quarter. In fact, this is the 15th consecutive quarter of growth for our Girls portfolio. Monster High continues to exceed expectations around the world with double-digit growth, and American Girl continues its successful brand acceleration.","The diversity and strength of this portfolio allowed us to grow share in the doll category in both the U.S. and Euro 5, according to NPD, when you include American Girl results.","Second, Mattel continues to grow internationally. We saw positive growth in Europe, Latin America and Asia in the quarter and for year-to-date. In fact, we have consistently delivered revenue growth internationally in 9 of the past 10 quarters.","Third, our gross margins remained strong, matching last year's record margin of 51.3% and are well-positioned within our near-term outlook.","Fourth, capital deployment remains an important piece of the Mattel story. In the second quarter, we paid $125 million in dividends and deployed another $119 million on share repurchases.","And finally, we continued our commitment to strategic investments and executing the right business decisions necessary for growth. These incremental investments accounted for approximately 1\/3 of the year-over-year increase in SG&A in the second quarter, as we invested in areas like new franchise development, American Girl retail stores, emerging market infrastructure and IT systems.","As a part of our how-to-grow roadmap, we focused on building the right structure to support growth. And as you know, in 2011, we created a new North America division to support better alignment with our customers.","In the second quarter, we continued to strengthen these customer alignment efforts as we further consolidated U.S. operations, bringing teams supporting the North America division together into our Southern California campus.","This alignment effort contributed to the quarter's $8 million severance charge.","All in all, as I look at the second quarter, there are many similarities with the first quarter. I'm happy with our level of consistency in delivering overall sales growth, particularly with our growing Girls portfolio and robust international growth. And I'm happy with our strong gross margins.","That said, as I look to where we were inconsistent in the second quarter, I see 2 primary areas that impacted our performance: The first area is our Polly Pocket brand. As we work to maximize the momentum in our Girls portfolio, we made the decision to reallocate resources and execute a more focused approach to the Polly brand. That said, Polly continues to perform well in several markets, going forward we'll have a more focused program to support momentum in those markets. This resulted in a $14 million asset impairment charge in the quarter.","Second, Barbie experienced declines both in North America and international. There are 2 key underlying factors that contributed to Barbie's second quarter results: First, the shifting of North American promotional programs, traditionally executed in the first half to the second half; and second, increased competition from our own growing portfolio.","Let me comment on each. As I have mentioned before, we're committed to innovation in our Girls portfolio to generate incremental revenue and share of the global market. And as we've also discussed before, we've introduced new franchises that have fueled significant category growth for the industry. The Barbie brand is likely being modestly impacted by their successes.","However, it's important to recognize that while we have grown our overall share of the doll category in both the U.S. and Euro 5 year-to-date per NPD data, Barbie has also continued to hold her own, with revenues greater than 2010 when we launched Monster High. You can see why we still feel pretty good about Barbie's performance in the context of the portfolio that she leads.","For the year, Barbie's global POS and shipping are down mid-single digits. For the second quarter in North America, shipping is down more than POS. This was largely driven by a business decision to ship promotional programs and related shipping that coincide with consumer demand in the all-important back half of the year. This decision accounted for about half of the decline in North America for Barbie in the second quarter. We expect to recapture that volume later in the year.","Now let me turn my comments to the second half of 2013. As always, we know we have to execute well to deliver another successful year, and we have 3 key priorities for the Fall: First, we have to maximize the momentum of our growing Girls portfolio; second, we have to accelerate Fisher-Price POS globally; and third, we need to deliver strong execution on our promising Fall lineup of products, content and retail programs.","There's great news across the Girls portfolio. Looking at the back half of the year, we have new initiatives on every brand, including Barbie, American Girl, Disney Princess and Monster High. And as we've discussed, we have an entirely new franchise entering the market in the second half of the year with Ever After High.","We have a great calendar in the back half of the year for Barbie, where we expect to continue to grow viewership of our very successful Barbie: Life in the Dreamhouse animated series, which is planning to have its own Nickelodeon TV special in the Fall, along with a new line of product.","The Fall will also see greater entertainment content for Barbie with 2 second-half DVD releases, an increased compared to last year, and associated product lines.","Barbie continues to merge the latest trends with technology by focusing on innovation, customization and creative play across the toy line.","Building on the success of last year's Barbie Photo Fashion doll, we're very excited by the second half launch of Barbie's Train and Ride Horse, which features gesture recognition software that reacts to Barbie's commands. The new Barbie digital makeover product that transforms an iPad into a digital mirror for endless creative play with virtual makeup. And the new Barbie Digital Dress Doll that features LED and touchscreen technology, allowing girls to design and customize Barbie's fashions.","In anticipation of the packed calendar and consumer demand, our key retailers will -- have also granted an increase in shelf space for our top 4 retailers for Barbie in the Fall.","As we look to the rest of our Girls portfolio, 2013 is turning out to be a monster year, as we continue to deliver the unexpected and position Monster High as the top-of-mind brand with the older girl. The second half of the year will be our biggest yet with more dolls, franchise activation, digital engagement and our second major DVD tent pole event, 13 Wishes.","Disney Princess has an impressive calendar for the Fall as well. There is strong retailer anticipation for Sofia the First, which is starting to ship now. And Disney will also introduce another Princess into their collection, with the late Fall launch of the theatrical release, Frozen.","American Girl enters the back half of the year with tremendous momentum. Girl of the Year, Saige, is tracking double digits, ahead of last year's highly successful doll, McKenna. Clearly, a little marketing goes along way at American Girl. And we'll open our 16th store in Palo Alto, California, on the heels of our very successful opening in Columbus, Ohio, a few months ago. And of course, we have our new franchise, Ever After High, which Tim will tell you about in a moment.","I hope you're starting to get a sense for why we're so focused on the importance of maximizing execution of our amazing Girls portfolio. We have an impressive lineup, for sure.","Shifting gears to Fisher-Price. We still see a big opportunity for us, particularly internationally. The second quarter was marginally better than the first quarter, but not where we wanted it to be. Clearly, this brand remains a work in progress.","As we've said before, this is the year we plan to grow Fisher-Price. And to do so, we need to accelerate global POS. To achieve this growth, we expect several pieces to come together in the second half of the year. First, we'll have a full rollout of our new packaging, which will enable a consistent and impactful look on the shelf; Second, we'll have increased marketing programs that optimize our Joy of Learning campaign to not only connect with mom, but to more consistently convert mom; Third, we'll have expanded retail executions. For example, we've secured more shelf space with a major U.S. retailer on key baby gear items than in prior years; And fourth, we'll have a strong product line rooted in innovation.","As I've said many times, when we innovate, we grow. And we have several new executions coming online in the Fall, including an extended Laugh & Learn line, our new co-branded and digital extension for Little People Imaginext, and a new Baby Gear toddler feeding line.","In addition to that growth business, Fisher-Price Friends, which accounts for about 1\/3 of the Fisher-Price brand, looks to continue to fire on all cylinders with an impressive second half lineup.","Specifically, we have 3 incremental property launches for the Fall. First, the Nickelodeon property, Bubble Guppies, is just beginning to shift; Second, Mike the Knight, anchored in great traditional play padding [ph] and swords, castles and dragons, is set to ship in the Fall. And third, Thomas Wood, which launched in January, has shown solid early results with the majority of shipping still ahead of us.","We're also seeing great traction around execution of the Thomas & Friends Fall entertainment property, King of the Railway.","Lastly, we must execute against our strong pipeline of new properties coming this Fall. Our products, based on Warner Bros. Man of Steel and Dreamworks Animations' Turbo, are meeting early expectations.","Disney's new property, Planes, looks very toyetic, and we're excited by the opportunities that will take off with this line.","Our new Boys franchise, Max Steel, continues to get strong TV ratings around the world. And we are just beginning the global rollout, which will be supported with additional entertainment in the Fall.","And of course, we're very excited about our new franchise in the Fashion Doll category, Ever After High, a powerful addition to our Girls portfolio that we believe reaches a segment of older girls untapped by Monster High. This entirely new franchise introduces the next-generation of fairytale legends, who are empowered to choose their own storybook fate. It will begin to roll out globally throughout the second half of this year.","Looking at the company in aggregate, we ended our preseason consistent with our launch and our financial goal for sales, gross margins and EPS growth. We continue to manage our business for the long-term and not quarter-to-quarter. We'll continue to invest and make the right business decisions to deliver more consistent growth and superior results to our stockholders in 2013 and beyond.","And now I'd like to introduce Tim Kilpin, Executive Vice President, Mattel Global Brands Team, to give you a little more insight into Ever After High. Tim?","Timothy J. Kilpin","Thank you, Bryan. Good morning. As we go through this, I will call out the slide numbers from the presentation that was posted this morning. And we'll start on Slide 2. As Bryan mentioned, we manage the portfolio of Girls brand. And to do that, we recognize that girls play differently as they grow.","Their interests are different, the way they interact with content is different and types of activity engage in are different. So in Slide 3, we have those portfolio of brands that speaks to those differences.","Barbie speaks to the aspirational roles that we know girls like to play out, while Disney Princess allows girls to play out the magic of Disney's classic fairy tales. We're very proud of the decade of partnership we've enjoyed with Disney, as they've grown this to be a top Girls global franchise.","And we're incredibly pleased with how well Monster High has performed since we launched it in 2010, speaking to an older girl through a great story and a relevant message. American Girl plays a critical hand differentiated role in the portfolio, celebrating girls by delivering on friendship and imaginative play and storytelling.","We take great care to ensure that the brands in our portfolio are complementary in terms of positioning, play pattern, emotional benefit and target age. As a result, we've grow the category and we've grown our share.","So Slide 4, what continues to drive us to look for new opportunities in this space? Because we know that as girls grow, they're always looking forward to what's new and what's next. And as I said, we know that different girls are motivated by different themes and stories. So our ongoing objective is pretty clear. How do we continue to reach tween girls with relevant new themes?","Slide 5, we learned a lot from what worked on Monster High.","On slide 6, you can see, we created a world of wonderful characters. We told great stories. We used multiple marketing platforms to get the message across, we built a broad range of merchandise to drive the franchise. We created a deep engagement with Monster High fans, and it's their passion that continues to drive our sales today.","And Slide 7, you'll see we plan to continue to drive growth in Monster High. In fact, to great new programs in 2013, like the Trip to Scaris this Spring, and the upcoming 13 Wishes DVD and retail program this Fall. Monster High is a $1 billion franchise in worldwide retail sales and is still growing all around the world.","On Slide 8, its success continues to be anchored in that initial insight, about feeling like a freak in high school. Monster High resonates because it speaks to that simple truth, about celebrating your differences and about self-acceptance.","So Slide 9, what would that insight be that could drive our next tween girls opportunity? What could we apply that would be unique from and ultimately incremental to Monster High?","Slide 10, we know that girls at this age want to be empowered, that they want to make their own choices about their friends, their interest, their hobbies, their lives. And that insight led us to our next Girls franchise, Ever After High. Now I'll explain in a minute how we're bringing that insight to life.","On Slide 12, you'll see our pop-culture inspiration came from everything that surrounds us today about fairytales. Film, TV and fashion, we began seeing new twists on a classic form. These were not traditional younger girl approaches, but something more sophisticated.","Slide 13, we married that inspiration to what our insights told us was a really powerful universal truth, the story of your life begins when you make it your own. You are empowered to choose your own destiny.","Slide 14, our target audience is an older girl. She's outgrown traditional fairytales, but she likes humor, she likes a twist on the familiar and she loves pretending to be a teenager in high school.","Slide 15, that led us to our story. And I won't take you through the whole thing, but I do want you to understand this much. Ever After High is a boarding school, where the children of fairytale legends learn to relive their parents' destinies, whether they want to or not. The endings are already written, everything is in stone. Until one day, Raven, daughter of the evil queen, rejected her legacy. She did not want to be evil. Her rebellious act made anything possible. So we've set up a world of royals and rebels. The royals want their happy endings, just like it was planned. Rebels want to rewrite their destiny. So on Slide 16, you'll see the central characters, Raven Queen and Apple White.","They head up the royals and rebels. They're not exactly rivals, but they do see the world differently, and of course, they're roommates.","On Slide 17, the beauty of creating a world like this is its extendibility. We learned from Monster High that girls didn't just want to own 1 or 2 characters, they wanted them all. So far, we've created dolls of nearly 40 Monster High characters. And Ever After High will be no different. Here, just some of the initial characters like Cerise Hood, daughter of Red Riding Hood; and Blondie Lockes, daughter of Goldilocks.","Slide 18. We were really encouraged by our initial research, which told us that girls see these characters as different from Monster High. In fact, girls that didn't like Monster High's theme and aesthetics really loved this concept.","On Slide 19, as we learned from Monster High and as we're now applying with Max Steel, Ever After High will be supported by a full franchise plan.","On Slide 20, you can see the Ever After High Facebook page and YouTube channel page. We launched these about 3 weeks ago and really haven't done anything yet to drive traffic to these locations. We're just getting them up and running. That said, we've already had over 1 million views of the content and product reviews.","Slide 21, as we've talked before about that two-way dialogue with fans on Monster High, we're already seeing that happen on Ever After High. What you see on this current slide here is fan-generated artwork and videos that have already been posted online after only 3 weeks. We've never seen anything like this kind of early engagement with the brand.","On Slide 22, as we did with Monster High, we're starting out by telling a lot of stories between these girls and the world. For Ever After High, we're launching with 110 minutes of animated content this Fall, over a dozen webisodes throughout the season and a TV special that will air around the world later this Fall.","Slide 23, as you may recall, with Monster High, we kicked up with a book series that reached The New York Times Young Adult Bestseller List. For Ever After High, we're excited to be launching this Fall with a series of books by Newbery award-winning author, Shannon Hale. These books will be available both digitally and in print.","Slide 24, also as part of the marketing launch, we will be premiering a live-action music video later this Fall, with a unique twist that's a great fit with the franchise's theme. There will be more to come on the video later, but in the meantime, you can go to our website and hear the theme song.","Slide 25, from a toy standpoint, we will launch with a focused range of fashion doll this Fall starting, of course, with our lead characters.","Slide 26, you'll see we've got a strong program of consumer products for this year, including apparel, accessories, jewelry, stationary and electronics.","And Slide 27, in terms of how it's all coming together at retail, we're just now placing Ever After High as an exclusive retail program in the U.S. with Justice stores. Justice will be the first to get not only fashion dolls, but back-to-school merchandise and accessories as well. Later this Fall, we will make Ever After High available through all of our regular channels.","Slide 28, we'll also begin to roll out Ever After High globally this Fall, starting with 14 countries this year and following with the Rest of the World in 2014.","So Slide 29, we're going to have a lot more to share on Ever After High in the months ahead, but in the meantime, you can see the original webisodes and start to immerse yourselves in the world by going to our website, our Facebook page or our YouTube channel.","So on Slide 30, now you can see how Ever After High fits into the portfolio and how it's differentiated. We know that innovation and deep consumer engagement can grow the doll category, and we look forward to future franchise launches to continue to drive that growth.","Thank you, and now I will turn it over to Kevin Farr.","Kevin M. Farr","Thank you, Jim, and good day, everyone. As Bryan mentioned, we continue to focus on growing the business profitably. And I believe our second quarter and first half results demonstrate our continuing commitment to effectively manage our global portfolio of brands, countries and customers.","For the quarter, global revenues are up 1%, and we ended the first half with revenue up 4%. Our second quarter gross margin equaled our strong margin last year at 51.3%. And gross margin for the first half is up 150 basis points.","And while our ongoing strategic investments impacted the bottom line, operating profit was flat year-to-date, including a 9% impact from the Polly Pocket asset impairment charge.","Overall, our results were consistent with our expectations and with some of those strategic investments coming online in the second half, we're off to good start to deliver another solid year for our shareholders.","Our results also demonstrate our continuing commitment to deploy capital back to our shareholders. We paid a quarterly dividend of $0.36 per share, reflecting an annual dividend of $1.44, a 16% increase over last year. And we repurchased about 2.7 million shares of our stock in the quarter. Solid sales and gross margins give us the opportunity to reinvest in our business. One of our key strategies to grow is to develop new franchises. Franchises are great investments for Mattel because we can research, refine and roll out new brands quickly and efficiently as we leverage our existing talent and infrastructure to launch them globally.","Relative to other industries, new franchises like Monster High, Max Steel and Ever After High only take a few years to incubate and bring to market, and they represent small investments of $10 million to $20 million. In the case of Monster High, the payback has been extraordinary as we leveraged that concept into a global brand that exceeds $1 billion at retail. While not everything could be a Monster High, we're confident that these singles and doubles with our new franchises will drive strong returns.","Now before I start reviewing the slide deck with you, I did want to highlight a couple of key items in the P&L. As I said earlier, our gross margin for the quarter was 51.3%, which is consistent with our goal of delivering gross margins in the low to mid-50% range. For the quarter, favorable mix, O.E. 3.0 savings and our pricing actions were partially offset by increased input costs, the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange and higher royalties. Unfortunately, there recently has been volatility in crude oil prices and foreign exchange. That said, we managed a basket of costs, including input costs, where there's always puts and takes. And we continue to focus on executing manufacturing efficiency programs to fully or partially offset these puts and takes.","And as we begin to enter our peak production, so far, our overall basket of costs, including foreign exchange, has been fairly consistent with our cost assumptions.","With regard to SG&A, excluding the $14 million impact of the Polly impairment charge, our spending is on-plan and consistent with the outlook we gave you on the first quarter call. If you recall, we suggested that the first quarter year-over-year increase of $23 million was a good run rate to estimate our SG&A expenses in the near-term.","Second quarter SG&A expense is up about $41 million, with about 1\/3 of the incremental expense due to the Polly impairment charge. Another 1\/3 of incremental expense is due to our continued investment in strategic growth initiatives, and the final 1\/3 due to higher employee-related costs, including merit increases, higher benefit expenses and severance.","For the full year, we continue to plan SG&A expenses to be higher than last year. That said, we continue to see that the quality of our overall SG&A expenses continue to improve as we shift spending to future drivers of growth.","With respect to the impairment charge for Polly, as Bryan said, given the strong growth in our overall Girls portfolio and Polly's recent performance, we've made the strategic decision to execute a more focused approach to Polly going forward. Our plan is to reallocate resources to other core brands in our doll portfolio.","As a result, the reduction in expectations for future Polly Pocket revenues and profits triggered a $14 million noncash impairment charge in the quarter. Going forward, amortization expenses for the remaining asset are expected to be immaterial to Mattel's results.","Overall, I'm pleased with how we managed the first half. But with that said, there's plenty of work to be done as we focus on executing in the all-important second half of the year.","Now let's turn to the slide deck. Starting on Page 4, you can see that our worldwide gross sales are up 1% for the quarter and 4% year-to-date. Continued strength in our international region, which was up 4% in the quarter, offset performance in the North American region, which was down 2%. Our Girls portfolio led by Monster High and American Girl, along with strong results in Fisher-Price Friends, helped drive the growth. And we grew share in the U.S. and Euro 5 and global shipping, and POS remain in balance.","Turning to Page 5 of the presentation, you can see the brands' perspective on sales. Worldwide sales for Mattel Girls & Boys Brands were up 1% for the quarter and 6% year-to-date. Growth in our Girls portfolio was driven by Monster High, which was partially offset by declines in Barbie. As Bryan mentioned, Barbie sales were down for 2 reasons: First, the shifting of North American promotional programs to the second half; and second, some increased competition from the success of our own growing Girls portfolio.","Hot Wheels was down 1%, with growth internationally and strong results coming from our diecast line. Our entertainment properties, including Warner Bros. Man of Steel, the initial shipments of Disney's Planes and Dreamworks' Turbo, helped offset a strong Batman comparison to last year. Max Steel is just starting to ship around the globe, but very early results in the home market of Latin America are encouraging.","Worldwide sales for Fisher-Price brands were down 3% for the quarter and down 5% year-to-date. The lower sales were primarily the result of declines in several of our Fisher-Price Core brands, partially offset by strong performance of Fisher-Price Friends, including our new Thomas Wood line and the initial shipments of our Mike the Knight brand. And American Girl had another great quarter, with 14% growth in sales.","On Page 6, we highlight the performance of our North American region. Overall, for the -- sales for the region were down 2% in the quarter and up 2% year-to-date. For the quarter, strengths in our Girls portfolio, driven by Monster High and American Girl and our Fisher-Price Friends business, was offset by softness in Barbie and Fisher-Price Core.","Our International business, as seen on Page 7, grew 4% this quarter and 6% year-to-date. For the quarter, all of our regions grew in both U.S. dollars and local currency. And we continue to see strong results in our emerging markets in China, India, Russia and Eastern Europe, as well as Mexico. And Brazil grew for the quarter.","Now let's review the P&L, starting on Page 8 of the slide presentation. I've already talked to you about gross margin performance for the second quarter. Year-to-date, the first half gross margin of 52.7% is up 150 basis points over last year, consistent with our goal of delivering gross margins in the low to mid-50% range over the near-term.","With respect to SG&A expenses, as seen on Page 9, I've already covered the details of the driver of increased expense in the second quarter. For the quarter, SG&A expenses, as a percentage of net sales, was 33.5%, including 120-basis-point increase related to the impairment charge.","Page 10 of the presentation summarizes the company performance of company-wide cost savings initiatives and our continuing efforts on our ongoing Operational Excellence 3.0 program.","For the quarter, we delivered incremental O.E. 3.0 gross savings of $9 million, and we're on-track to deliver our full year target of around $50 million in gross savings.","Turning to Page 11, operating income in the first quarter was $95 million or 8.1% of net sales, down 320 basis points compared with last year's second quarter. The decrease in operating income was driven by higher SG&A expenses, including the $14 million impairment charge, partially offset by slightly higher sales and flat gross margins.","Turning to Page 12, earnings per share for the quarter were $0.21, a decrease of $0.07 compared to the prior year's second quarter. The decrease in EPS was driven by lower operating income, an increase in share count, partially offset by lower non-operating expenses and a favorable tax rate driven by the benefit of discrete period tax items.","The impact of foreign exchange in the quarter was a negative $0.03 per share. For the second quarter, our worldwide effective tax rate reflects discrete period tax benefits related to reassessment of previously accrued taxes based on the current status of foreign and state audits and an [ph] active law changes. We currently expect our worldwide effective tax rate for the year to be 22%.","Slide 13 outlines the HIT integration and amortization costs that Mattel incurred in 2012 and the first half of 2013. For the quarter, integration expenses were $1 million, flat compared to the second quarter of 2012. For the full year, we expect these expenses to be about $10 million compared to $24 million in 2012.","We discuss cash flow on Page 14. Year-to-date, cash flow used for operations was $286 million compared to $62 million last year. The increase was primarily due to higher working capital usage, partially offset by higher net income.","Cash used for investing is significantly lower than last year, when we acquired HIT Entertainment for $685 million. Capital expenditures are up slightly to $115 million. We repurchased 2.9 million shares of stock year-to-date at a total cost of $127 million. And we continue to pay our quarterly dividend of $0.36 per share at a total cost year-to-date of $249 million. As a result, our balance sheet remains strong. Our cash on hand at the end of the period was $823 million, up $451 million from the prior year. And our debt to total capital ratio was 36.7%, down from 38.1% in the prior year.","Today, we announced our third quarter dividend of $0.36 per share, a 16% increase to the prior year. We also announced we increased our share repurchase authorization by $500 million. We remain committed to our capital deployment strategy and expect to end the year with cash and debt levels consistent with our framework.","As you know, effective capital deployment is critical to achieving top third to top quartile total shareholder returns.","Starting this quarter, we also enhanced our level of disclosure in our 10-Q and 10-K filings for consolidated and segment revenues. You will find schedules that outline these enhancements, including the quarterly schedules provided this morning. We have also these posted is schedules on our corporate website in the Investor section, under the subheading, Financial Information.","In summary, excluding the impairment charge, our underlying performance in the first half of the year is consistent with our long-term financial goals for sales and operating profits. As we look ahead, we remain keenly focused on growing our business consistently, growing it profitably and deploying the cash generated in value-enhancing ways to reward our shareholders.","This concludes my review the financial results. Now we'd like to open the call for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Sean McGowan with Needham & Company.","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","I have a couple of questions, if I can. Bryan, remind us of what you've said in the past about the extent to which Barbie is affected by the success of some other Girls products? My impression was that up until now, you thought that it really wasn't affected. Are you seeing something changing there?","Bryan G. Stockton","Not really. What we've said in the past with Barbie is it's very difficult to estimate the impact of other brands on the Barbie brand, simply because the base year, which is 2010, Barbie revenues through the first half of this year are still higher than that base year. So it's very difficult to estimate, if you want to call it cannibalization. It's hard to do. We've said it's highly likely that, that's going on. We've never said it's not going on, it's just difficult to give an exact number. What we believe is likely occurring in the second quarter is for the first time in Monster High history, we've been able to actually keep up with consumer demand. The shelves are full for the first time. We worked very hard in operations to ramp up our production as quickly as we can. Monster High continues to grow at extraordinary double-digit rates globally. Engagement by girls continues to grow. In fact, we've had a 12% increase in the unique visitors to our website. So there's a lot of momentum there, and so what we believe we're seeing is maybe a little bit more impact. But we go back to, if you look at Barbie's performance in the context of the overall portfolio, she's doing quite well relative to competition. Her revenues are still stronger than 2010. And we think we have a very strong second half for Barbie. So I think we're being consistent. We may be seeing a little bit more impact in the second quarter, but we're certainly not troubled.","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Could you comment generally about what you're seeing in point of sale for your products across the retail channels relative to your shipment?","Bryan G. Stockton","Sure. We work really hard to try to balance out POS and shipments and inventory. And I would tell you that, generally, as you look across the brands in countries we're pretty well aligned. POS is down sort of low single digit, and inventories are down sort of low single digit, so we're feeling pretty good about where we are at the moment. I think what's really important is, because we worked so hard on retail inventories and, frankly, getting our own inventories staged for all these second half initiatives, that we think we're in pretty good shape. And the reason that's important, if you think about what's ahead of us in the second half from an entertainment standpoint, we have Planes, Sofia, Frozen, Turbo, the Man of Steel DVD. We've got from our own IP, the new Thomas property, Thomas Wood, Ever After High and Monster High and Max Steel. There's a lot of new stuff that we're trying to get ready for. And so as you look at our inventories at Mattel, they're up slightly as we do a little building in anticipation of that.","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Great. And last question then. Was there meaningful revenue in the second quarter from Max Steel and Superman?","Bryan G. Stockton","Well, Superman, obviously, we were pleased with the results of Superman in the first half. There'll be more action and activity on Superman [ph] for the DVD in the second half but nothing of any consequence. For Max Steel, we began shipping, to some degree, in Latin America where, as you recall, that's $100 million at retail base business. We're encouraged by the shipment and POS response we're seeing. The new content has been in Latin America for the year. So we're excited about what the potential may be for Max Steel, but I would tell you, it's still early.","Kevin M. Farr","Yes, I think, Sean, as I mentioned, when we looked at our shipping for the quarter, more or less Warner Bros.' Man of Steel, initial shipments of Planes and Dreamworks' Turbo helped to offset a strong Batman comparison last year.","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, so -- but Bryan's comments there, do you think you're basically done with Superman, or there could be more in the second half?","Bryan G. Stockton","There's going to be, I would say, the typical kind of second half support for DVD launch, and that's important to Warner Bros., and it's important to us. So we're going to make sure we support it fully.","Kevin M. Farr","Yes, and I think Superman, overall, as we look at it today, is pretty consistent with our expectations.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steph Wissink with Piper Jaffray.","Stephanie S. Wissink - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Just a couple of questions for us. The first one, Bryan, if you could just share with us a little bit around your philosophy on the share repurchase programs. Should we think about that as really offsetting dilution, or more of a dilution plus type of an event?","Bryan G. Stockton","Sure, Steph. Well, first, I want to welcome you to Mattel. We're thrilled to have you on the team, so good morning and welcome. As we think about share repurchase, we really think about it in terms of our overall capital deployment strategy. And as we think about that capital deployment strategy, there's a number of things that we try to do. And if I pick specifically in share repurchase, we really think about how do we want to invest. We can buy another company as we did with HIT, we can reinvest on our own company as we tend to do on an ongoing basis. I would tell you that our share repurchase strategy, in general, tends to be opportunistic. We have a very disciplined approach in terms of how we think about, how and when and why to buy the shares. And we like it a lot, and we think it served us well over the years. And Kevin, you might want to add a little more color to that.","Kevin M. Farr","Yes, I think we've got a capital investment framework that we followed for the last decade and, really, from the perspective of our capital investment framework, first, we try to invest in the business. And this year, we expect to invest about $220 million to $230 million in CapEx. Next priority is to have a top quartile dividend. And as I indicated today, we paid -- we're going to pay a dividend of $0.36 per share, it's up $0.16 versus last year. And we look it to be top quartile from the perspective of both dividend yields and payout ratios. And next, we look at really share repurchases or M&A. And we're very disciplined, opportunistic about share repurchases, just like we are about M&A.","Stephanie S. Wissink - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay, that's really helpful. Just one more for us. Guys, you mentioned the investment spend in the second quarter. Can you just give us some sense of where you think you are on that maybe investment spending horizon curve? And how we should think about the monetization of some of those activities in the second quarter and into the second half?","Kevin M. Farr","Yes, I'd be happy to. Our approach to strategic growth investments is disciplined and case-by-case. We manage strategic investments in the context of the annual basis, but -- and we do that in delivering operating profit growth of 6% to 8% for the full year, consistent with delivering top third to top quartile TSR. And so far, we've had a really good batting average on our investments over the last couple of years, as many of them are already paying off, including the 3 new American Girl stores we opened last year in St. Louis, Houston, Miami, as well as the recently very successful opening of a new store in Columbus. The development launch of new franchises like Max Steel, Ever After High, and infrastructure and headcount in emerging markets including China, India, Russia and Eastern Europe. We're also making strategic IT investment in things like products life cycle management. The implementation of this system has gone live, and it's also important to -- was important consideration as we raised our outlook on gross margins to a mid-50s range from over the near term. In the future, we'll share more of the details of our strategic growth investments keenly focused on delivering more consistent growth. That said, as we look at strategic investments made over the last couple of years, we made about $30 million last year. In the first half, about 1\/3 of our $64 million increase in strategic investments are strategic investments. And as you look forward, I think the information that we provided you on the call about a run rate for future quarters of about 23% is still relevant as you look at the balance of the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Drew Crum with Stifel.","Andrew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So Bryan, I just wanted to get your thoughts on Fisher-Price. Are your expectations for it still grow in 2013? Do you need Core to grow in order to grow Fisher-Price overall? And what is the impact of gross margin? I think going into the second quarter, you guys suggested that gross margin would moderate with Fisher. I guess, the gross margin would moderate as we made our way through the year as Fisher-Price saw an uptick in growth. I just wanted to get an update there.","Bryan G. Stockton","Sure. Let me start with Fisher-Price. We have been working very hard, as you know, on trying to get that brand repositioned with moms and specifically to connect with moms and done a lot of work on the brand positioning and how to connect primarily through digital. We've also spent a lot of time working on the execution of that at retail, both with new packaging that you're seeing rolling out, and with more -- I'd say, more robust retail positioning. We're, I would say, slightly pleased that Fisher-Price seems to be making a bit of a turn in the second quarter. We certainly are not declaring victory on Fisher-Price, but I think as you look at the second half, and I think we've been consistent with this, it's really a second half opportunity as the new packaging comes in, as consumers get more experience with the website, as we get our retail programs better executed, as we really get the digital and brand positioning to evolve from disconnecting to converting with mom. And there's an awful lot of new product innovation in the Fisher-Price Core. So to answer your question, yes, we need to have the Core pick up in POS globally, and that's important to us. The other part of Fisher-Price that we also want to think about is the Fisher-Price Friends portfolio. As you know, that's a really important part of Fisher-Price. It's about 1\/3 of the overall Fisher-Price portfolio, so we spend a lot of time thinking about it. And since we made the investment in HIT Entertainment, we spend even more time thinking about it. As you'll recall now, about half of our portfolio is our own intellectual property. So when we think about the exciting things happening with that, including -- I talked about Thomas Wood and King of the Railway, a movie that's coming out, Bubble Guppies, Mike the Knight, and continued strength at Jake and the Never Land Pirates. We think we're going to see continued momentum on Friends, but we are expecting to see some improvements in Fisher-Price Core. So now as that relates to gross margin, we've been pretty consistent that Fisher-Price gross margins are very attractive relative to competition and then for [ph] preschool. Structurally, that market's a little bit lower than the other segments like Fashion Dolls, for example, so we may see some impact. And Kevin, you may want to make a comment on that.","Kevin M. Farr","Yes, I think our execution in the middle P&L remains solid. And we're pleased to see our gross margin expand 150 basis points to 52.7% in the first half of the year. Our outlook hasn't changed for full year gross margins. And our goal is to deliver gross margins in the low to mid-50s range over the near term.","Andrew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, very good, very helpful. And then moving on to Ever After High, can you talk about your plans for placement at retail? And is there any risk that you cannibalize against some of your other properties? Plans to grow the fashion doll category, or are you get to take share from competitors or yourself?","Bryan G. Stockton","I'm going to ask Tim to comment on this in just a minute. But I think one of the things that is really important is we spent a lot of time over the past few years really thinking hard about how to manage this overall Girls portfolio. And when you think of how we've been able to consistently grow this for 15 quarters, across a portfolio that includes Disney Princess and Barbie at the younger age, and Monster High, American Girl for the older age and now with Ever After High, I think one of the most important things that Tim talked about in his presentation was really this white space that they discovered, because Ever After High is really about girl empowerment to rewrite your story the way that you want your life to come out. That's a different girl, it's a different positioning than Monster High, which is all about celebrating your differences. So that's one of the things we worked very hard across the portfolio is to make sure that each brand has a unique positioning and reason for being. Tim, you want to comment a little bit about the issue of how you think this will play out at retail?","Timothy J. Kilpin","Yes, sure. A couple of things. First of all, as I mentioned earlier, we are in Justice stores now. And one of the reasons we started there was because it was a great opportunity for us to showcase the franchise across multiple categories of product. So toys and consumer products, you could really help kind of tell the larger story in one place at one time. That said, we are rolling out through all of our regular channels throughout the course of the rest of this year both here and the U.S. and around some key countries internationally. And we're very pleased about the retail support we've gotten. Everybody recognizes, to Bryan's point, how this fits into the portfolio, how it's differentiated versus the rest of the portfolio and its reason for being on the shelf. And so we've got very good support, great promotional plans lined up with all of our major accounts.","Kevin M. Farr","Yes. And I think our overarching strategy really is to really innovate in the category and grow the category. And as Bryan said earlier, we've got top 4 brands in the category with Barbie, with American Girl, Monster High and Disney's Princesses. So from an outlook perspective, we want to continue to innovate. And yes, we are competing against ourselves, but we want to grow the category and overall, grow our sales.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Kelter with Goldman Sachs.","Ivan Holman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","This is Ivan, sitting in for Michael. I was hoping to dig in a little bit deeper on gross margins. They looked like they were flat in the quarter, year-over-year. So first quarter and a couple of that they didn't expand. I was just trying to understand, is there anything in the quarter that makes you think that this was just a temporary pause beyond just kind of the cadence of shipping? Or is kind of flat the correct way to think about margins for the balance of the year? As we look at the drivers that you've broken out, some of them are exogenous in terms of growing margins, maybe currency, et cetera, but where do you see the lowest hanging fruit in order to be able to expand margins over the balance of the year?","Kevin M. Farr","Yes, I think just from a -- stepping back a little bit, I think second quarter gross margin of 51.3% was consistent with our expectations. And we don't manage our business to grow gross margin sequentially every quarter. Rather, we manage gross margins on an annual basis, achieve gross margin within the low- to mid-50s range over the near term. There was some impact of ForEx this year on gross margins, but as we look to the future, really, I think our performance is consistent with our goal of delivering gross margins in the low- to mid-50s range.","Ivan Holman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","But just as a follow-up, I noticed the product mix seemed to be a little bit of a benefit to gross margins in 2Q. Is there anything in the way that order books are forming up for the third and fourth quarter, where you think you might be able to see another benefit from product mix? Or is that something that you expect to be net neutral over the balance of the year?","Kevin M. Farr","Yes, there's a lot of moving pieces, but I think product mix has been a tailwind for a while, with the growth of our doll portfolio. As Bryan said, it's grown for 15 consecutive quarters.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gerrick Johnson with BMO Capital.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Bryan, can you talk about the Barbie promotions you were talking about earlier, what it precisely shifted? And then within Barbie, any comments on certain areas of Barbie that might be performing better perhaps Core dolls versus accessories, vice versa?","Bryan G. Stockton","Sure. Well, I think the first thing we have to realize is a number of things are moving around at retail, as retailers' strategies evolve. You can imagine that, and this is, frankly, a global phenomenon, as you look at what's going on with layaway, for example, things are shifting around as retailers try to figure out how they can differentiate themselves. And so as a result, what we've tried to do is we've tried to better align our spending with both our second half initiatives and where retailers are headed. So I think one of the things that's really great about our North American division is they've worked very hard on supply chain, they're now working hard on how do we optimize our promotional spending with our retail partners. And as a result, they decided, along with our customers, that we frankly should shift some spending out of the first half and into the second half, simply, because there's so much activity across the portfolio. And as I mentioned on Barbie, we've got some very strong products, Barbie: Life in the Dreamhouse. So I would say it was a joint decision between us and our customers to, as I would say, not only fish where the fish are, but to fish when the fish are feeding. And that's in the second half and really around the layaway time period and the holiday spending. So I think you'd see that across our promotional spending, not just retail spending but also our consumer spending as we try to support these programs. Now as it relates to Barbie, really, we continue to do well with our core fashion segment and accessories, and we think that should carry through the Fall. And we're very excited in the Fall about Barbie's new dream house, because it's really innovative, it's got 2 elevators in it that we really love, and girls give us positive feedback. So it's really the core fashion segment, and that's good for Barbie.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And Max Steel, you said earlier, returns in Latin America were promising. I have seen it sneak out on the shelves here in the U.S. Can you talk about how it's-- how the early performance is here and elsewhere?","Bryan G. Stockton","Well, it's really way too early. Latin America has 10 years of history with Max and a lot of momentum with Max, so it doesn't surprise us that we're seeing some positive impact there. And the reason I say that is as we develop this property, we spent a lot of time with boys in Latin America, because that was really the core of the franchise and the story played in well, not only in Latin America but in North America and Europe and Asia. So we're pleased with what we're seeing in Latin America. It is way too early on shipments or POS. But what we do know is that the TV ratings are very, very solid. We like it, our TV partners like it. And usually, if you -- if boys are watching it, they begin to pick up on the characters and play pattern, so we're feeling positive, but way too early to make a call.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. Okay, great. One last one, if I could sneak in, in there. Kevin, could you talk about the tax rate? And forgive me if I missed this, but why was that especially low this quarter?","Kevin M. Farr","It related to a reassessment of routine state and tax audits of previously accrued taxes and as a result of our reassessment of those audits, we had a discrete tax benefit that we recognized in the quarter. That said, when you look at the full year rate, we expect the full year rate to be around 22%.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Full year rate to be around 22%, including the low 6.9% this quarter?","Kevin M. Farr","That's correct.","Operator","Our next question comes from Eric Handler with MKM Partners.","Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Actually, 2 questions for you. First, on Ever After High, you're going after girls, the tweens, 9 to 13. You said it's -- maybe you get a little bit of cannibalization off your existing products. But typically, the girls 9 to 13, what are they playing with? What type of products are you competing with outside of your own girl dolls? And then, secondly, just a follow-up to a prior question. You're looking -- if you look at sort of your O.E. 3.0 plan, you're looking $50 million run rate for the full year. You've already done $14 million, so you're looking at $36 million in gross savings in the back half of the year. The severance and investment has sort of negated those gross savings, so, that significant savings has been pretty de minimis for the first half of the year. Will severance and investment subside, so that you can actually get some leverage in the back half of the year off of those gross savings?","Bryan G. Stockton","Great, well, Eric, let me start. I'm going to ask Tim to amplify what -- I talked about them last. Kevin will address the O.E. 3.0 question. Now we're excited about Ever After High again, because it's in a, what we believe, is a unique white space for this older girl segment that Monster High has not yet tapped. And as we build these brands, and we saw this with Monster High, and we're trying to replicate that with Max Steel and again with Ever After High, we're really creating a franchise that's not a doll, it's not a play thing, it's truly a franchise, it's an attitude, it's apparel, it's a whole bunch of things. So we're going to be, I think, well positioned. Tim, would you like to amplify on that?","Timothy J. Kilpin","Yes, I think that is an important thing to understand is that both with Monster High, as we've seen it and as we expect with Ever After High that girls are interacting with this brand, not just with dolls, but with apparel and accessories and stationery and publishing and electronics. That's been one of the strengths of Monster High, and we expect to replicate that. And things like publishing, they're not just ways for us to tell the story, but ways to monetize the brand as well.","Kevin M. Farr","Yes, and I think, finally, on the O.E. 3.0, yes, we have made some investments in the first half of the year. And, generally, those investments have big paybacks quite quickly. So when you look at it for the balance of the year, I think you will see, with regard to the $36 million of gross savings that those will flow through. And as you know, we use gross savings to more or less fund our strategic growth investments.","Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just one thing for follow-up. When you look at -- with regards to Ever After High franchise, when you look at Monster High, and you look at the $1 billion of -- plus of revenues that's generated each year, how much of that is toys, how much is apparel, how much is -- however you want to slice up the pie -- how much -- how does that get divided up?","Bryan G. Stockton","Well, it's such a solid franchise, and it's like Barbie, there's a substantial portion of that, that is consumer products. Toys is still the majority of what consumers are spending money on. But there's a substantial consumer products business, and that's why we always focus on it's a franchise, it's not just a toy brand.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tim Conder with Wells Fargo Securities.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","A couple of questions here, gentlemen. Bryan, you mentioned a couple of times in your preamble that your share year-to-date had grown in the U.S. and Euro 5 when you include American Girl. If you exclude American Girl, can you give us any color on your share, number one? And then second question, Kevin, just to clarify, it's been asked a couple of different ways, but the $23 million year-over-year increase in the operating and other expenses there that you gave in the first quarter call. This year, if you back out the impairment, it was about $27 million. And from the last question, again, the previous, it sounds like maybe the timing, whether that was severance or whatever, that's been a little front-end loaded. And that for the year, that quarterly $23 million year-over-year quarterly run rate is still pretty fair, just to confirm that. Or if you could just give some more color, please?","Kevin M. Farr","Yes, you want me to cover that, first? I think, yes, you have it right. If you look at the quarter, the second quarter, you take out the $14 million impairment charge, you get $27 million. And severance was up about -- around $5 million in the quarter. So that run rate was -- in the second quarter is very consistent with the guidance we gave you in the first quarter. And I think as you look forward to the balance of the year, I would still use that guidance in the third and fourth quarter against 2012 adjusted SG&A.","Bryan G. Stockton","As it relates to our market share, the way that we think about it is we always think about our category share, including American Girl. And it's really for 2 reasons. Number one, it's a $600 million plus brand that is one of the top brands in the world and one of the top brands in the country. So we always think about our category share with that in there. Secondly, there's, frankly, a technical reason to do it. Historically, NPD, when they used their diary panel, covered American Girl, and it was always a part of the share calculation. Now that NPD is using POS data from retailers, American Girl is not included in their coverage, so we have to make an adjustment to come up with a realistic estimate of our share. And by the way, we always get confirmation with NPD that the statement that we're making is factually correct. So we have to adjust it, because it's such a big and important part of our portfolio.","Kevin M. Farr","And Tim, did you have a follow-up question to my answer?","Kevin M. Farr","Yes. Are you implying, Kevin, on the question for you that the severance will likely be lower than what we've seen in the first half of the year, that it will likely be lower in the second half of the year?","Kevin M. Farr","Again, we look at O.E. 3.0 opportunities on a case-by-case basis too. And we would have the flexibility if we've had another good idea, which would generate a quick payback, we would do it. But I think a good part of the savings in O.E. 3.0 for this year is packaging. And there's really no costs associated with optimizing our packaging.","Operator","Our next question comes from Felicia Hendrix with Barclays.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Bryan, first question for you. You definitely seem optimistic about the second half, thank you for laying that roadmap out for us. And then also, your view in the first half was that it was in line with expectations, though it was lower than ours and the Street. So I'm just wondering, as we're now through half of the year, are you seeing anything different or anything that's changed at retail from where you were thinking about it from the beginning of the year? Again, I understand that from the company's perspective internally, you're on plan. But I'm just wondering if you've seen anything change from the industry perspective?","Bryan G. Stockton","No, we're working very closely with our customers globally. I think everybody is still very excited about the Fall\/holiday season. We're not hearing anything that is other than complementary to the toy business. We are working very hard to get the right shelf space and the right merchandising in place. So I think from a customers' standpoint, we're feeling good. And I think when you then take it up to a macro level, people still expect the toy industry to continue to grow. We're seeing growth and -- outside of the U.S., for example, in Western Europe. And so I think everybody is still positive about toys.","Kevin M. Farr","Yes, I think the outlook for the industry really is unchanged with regard to -- its expected to grow on a global basis, about 4% to 6%. And the U.S. is about 30% of that business, global business.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, helpful. And Kevin, just -- you've given some long-term benchmark goals and operating income on -- up 6% to 8% is one of them. So do you -- even though year-to-date you're operating income is flat, do you still expect that to be up 6% to 8% for the year?","Kevin M. Farr","Well, I'm not going to give guidance on bottom line guidance on operating income. I can say, though, that the 6% to 8% is consistent with what we target, and we needed to achieve that to deliver top third to top quartile TSR. And I think as we look at the first half, we have been delivering that consistently.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And while we use this term guidance, just wondering if -- have you guys discussed -- and Bryan, this is for you. Let me put you on the hotspot for a second. Have you guys discussed internally at all about giving guidance? In this quarter, you missed Street estimates by a lot. We, obviously, were all wrong, and misgauged kind of the second quarter. But it also creates a lot of volatility. So I'm just wondering, have you guys talked about that? Bryan, you're still -- you're relatively new to the role, so I'm just wondering if you're looking at that decision differently than you have -- than the company might have the past?","Bryan G. Stockton","It's a great question, and the answer is no, we're not thinking about it differently. And I'll explain why. Number one, as we've said, I think, consistently, from the Bob Eckert era to now the Bryan Stockton era, we don't manage this business quarter by quarter. We really think about it in terms of a preseason and a V season. That's why in my comments and Kevin's comments, when you look at the first half or really third of the year, it's half of the calendar, but third of business year, the revenue's up about 4%, the gross margins are up 150 basis points, the EPS is up. So we like where we are at the turn. And we've all been in this business long enough, and you've covered us long enough to know and others that sometimes, you get hiccups in some quarters that catch us all a little bit by surprise. But overall, when we look at our performance for the year, and that's really what we focus on, delivering performance not only category growth performance but TSR performance for our stockholders. So we're going to continue to give, I'd say, strategic insights as to where we think we'd like to be and leave it at that. But if we start getting into the quarter-by-quarter guidance, it just is -- we don't think particularly helpful in keeping the discussions with you all, really focused on the strategic issues that we're all trying to address.","Kevin M. Farr","And, again, I think, as we look at our performance, we look at it more than just a year, we look at it over the long term. We think about that as over the next 2 to 3 years. And I think if you look at our performance over the 1-year period, the 3-year period, the 5-year period and 10-year period, we have been delivering top third to top quartile performance. So I think we've been focused on the right things to generate share -- long-term shareholder value.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And Kevin, just quickly, why the share count increase? Is that stock option exercise or something else?","Kevin M. Farr","It does relate to stock option exercises, yes, over the last couple of years.","Operator","Our next question comes from James Hardiman with Longbow Research.","James Hardiman - Longbow Research LLC","Most of my questions have been answered. I did have a couple of clarifications. I guess, first, you mentioned that you materially under-shipped Barbie during the first half, but that you want to recapture that in the second half. Does that mean that wholesale is actually going to exceed retail in the second half of the year for Barbie? I guess, more broadly, how should I think about the overall relationship between wholesale versus retail trends in the first half, and whether or not that changes during the back half of the year?","Bryan G. Stockton","Good morning, Jim. Well, I think our hope would be that we want to continue to grow all of our brands. And so POS drives shipments, so we would hope to see POS improve and see the shipments improve. So I'm not going to make a comment about how we think about the consumption of Barbie, but we like to keep our POS and our inventory and our shipments in balance. And we think we've got some strong programs for the second half to do that.","James Hardiman - Longbow Research LLC","Yes, if I may, just on the calendar, there's a whole lot of brands that you guys are bringing to the table this year. Sofia, Ever After High, Max Steel, Mike the Knight, Planes, Frozen, Bubble Guppies. If I just think about all of these different brands, that the toy properties in particular, which of those begin to ship in 2Q? I'm assuming that the vast majority of these will ship, or at least begin to ship in the third quarter. Are there any that are entirely a fourth quarter event? Maybe chronologically, how should I think about when you begin -- brands begin to ship and how they ramp?","Bryan G. Stockton","Well, it's a difficult question to answer because a lot of it depends on the timing of the launch of certain things. I would tell you on internal things, with the exception of Ever After, we should begin to start seeing some shipments on things like Max Steel and more shipments on Thomas Wood and Mike the Knight, sometime during the third quarter, as retailers begin to get ready to set their planograms. That's really what drives those planogram set dates. As I think about Ever After High, as Tim said, we're beginning the global rollout late in the fourth quarter. So we'll see something happen there, but as we launch these brands, we have to be patient. We have to get the brands seated with consumers, let them really engage with it, and then begin shipments. So that's how we think about it internally. And as it relates to the other initiatives with our entertainment partners, it's really driven by the timing of their launches. For example, Frozen launches, it's not a global launch in the fourth quarter, it's late here in the U.S. It's going to be staggered throughout the rest of the world. So it really depends on the date. So I'm not going to give you specific guidance on the quarter, but I would say that's kind of how we think about it. And frankly, we're excited about it, and our retail partners are excited about it. We spent a lot of time planning in this first half to make sure that we execute well in the second half. As I said, that was 1 of our 3 priorities -- is one, we've got to get the Girls portfolio momentum to continue to build; two, make sure that we continue to make progress on Fisher-Price, and three, execute all those great programs that you just highlighted.","Operator","Our final question comes from Mike Swartz with SunTrust.","Michael A. Swartz - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to touch real briefly on costs and input costs, I guess, for the second half of the year. And I think Kevin, you said the current cost basket, how you look at it, is really kind of in line with expectations going in the year. And at least just with the volatility and the rise in crude oil, now that you're in the middle of production, I mean, are there any offsets that give you comfort that it's kind of in line with prior expectations?","Kevin M. Farr","Yes, I think our expectations is that due to the rise in oil and the volatility in foreign exchange that the costs are going to go up. When we look at our overall basket of costs listed earlier, they're pretty consistent with our costs assumptions. And we continue day in and day out to work on incremental manufacturing efficiency programs to kind of offset those puts and takes that we always see in those basket of costs.","Michael A. Swartz - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So there's nothing like labor, transportation, freight that you can point to that's kind of offsetting it, it's just more kind of internal initiatives on efficiency?","Kevin M. Farr","That's correct and our O.E. 3.0 efforts on packaging, too.","Drew Vollero","Thank you. There will be a replay of this call available beginning at 11:30 a.m. Eastern Time.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Martin Gilkes, Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin.","Martin Gilkes","Thank you, operator and good afternoon everyone. Joining me today are Chris Sinclair, Mattel\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Richard Dickson, Mattel\u2019s President and Chief Operating Officer; and Kevin Farr, Mattel\u2019s Chief Financial Officer.","As you know, this afternoon we reported Mattel\u2019s second quarter 2015 financial results. We will begin today\u2019s call with Chris, Richard and Kevin providing commentary on our results and then we will take your questions. To help guide our discussion today, we have provided you with a slide presentation. Both our earnings release and slide presentation, include non-GAAP financial measures. The information required by Regulation G regarding non-GAAP financial measures is included in these materials and both documents are available in the Investors section of our corporate website, corporate.mattel.com.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that certain statements made during the call may include forward-looking statements relating to the future performance of our overall business, brands and product lines. These statements are based on currently available information and they are subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. We describe some of these uncertainties in the Risk Factors section of our 2014 annual report on Form 10-K, our 2015 quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other filings we make with the SEC from time-to-time, as well as in other public statements. Mattel does not update forward-looking statements and expressly disclaims any obligation to do so.","Now I would like to turn the call over to Chris.","Chris Sinclair","Thanks, Martin and good afternoon everyone. I would like to thank you for joining us today. To begin with, I can report that we made some solid progress on our number of strategic and operational fronts in the second quarter. As we continue to move quickly to put the company back on track for growth and improved profitability.","And while it is still early in our turnaround, our overall second quarter results were generally in line with our expectations. In constant currency, world-wide gross sales were up by 1% in the quarter and are up 3% year-to-date. We also saw progress in our operating results where we are managing our margins effectively and we are generating ample liquidity to fund our turnaround efforts and to maintain our $0.38 a share quarterly dividend.","From a strategic perspective, we've continued to drive our cultural change agenda. We have also made some solid progress against our six core priorities. Our emphasis continues to be on rebuilding our culture to embrace brand building, creativity and innovation. And we streamlined our organization and made some incentive changes to incur faster decision making and more personal accountability and early signs here continue to be positive.","We've also continued to make some progress strengthening our core brands with good results on Hot Wheels, Thomas and Ever After High. A solid quarter on American Girl and improvements in restoring in power and momentum on Barbie and Fisher-Price. Further we strengthened our Toy Box unit with some recently announced core licensing deals with Warner Brothers and DreamWorks and an important renewal within our Disney partnership. We also continue to broaden our innovation and invention pipeline.","In addition, we continue to execute better retail and to better align our marketing and merchandizing programs. The progress here can be seen with increased shelf space productivity and improved inventories. Encouragingly our performance was also broadly balanced across geographies and we achieved some good gains in a number of developing and emerging countries despite some difficult macroeconomic issues with some noteworthy growth in China and in Russia.","And finally, we are very encouraged by our cost improvement initiatives where we've made some strong progress in both our global supply chain and our SG&A expenses. We've also began to accelerate several broad initiatives targeting input and packaging costs. As we reported earlier, we remain on track to deliver at the high end of our target cost reduction range of $250 million to $300 million in gross savings by the end of next year.","So on balance as we exit the first half, we\u2019re continuing to move things forward, and to see some real positives. Based on the results today, and our go forward outlook, we do remain on track with our strategic priorities. We also remain on track to fund our turn around initiatives fully, and we continue to be comfortable with our cash position and our commitment to the current dividend.","Having said all of this, I want to assure you that we are not complacent. We recognize that we still have a lot to do to rebuild the business and to successfully navigate through a very competitive second half equally challenging set of economic headwins. Our core brand and Toy Box is still a work in process. Stabilizing modest or high fully rejuvenating Fisher-Price and Barbie and restoring a vibrant licensing business will all take time.","We also still have a lot of retail space to regain and merchandising to improve in the months ahead. Now certainly before access very a drag in many of our important markets, so I do want to maintain an appropriate level of caution and framing where we are in our road to recovery.","I can assure you, we are very much in the game and we\u2019re committed to making progress. We believe we have an effective plan and we\u2019re moving rapidly across a number of fronts to rebuild and as Franklin our ability to compete and grow. I continue to be impressed by the vibrancy of our industry and equally impressed by the resiliency and talent in our company. A company that isn\u2019t bracing change and in my view is very much up to the challenges and opportunities ahead.","Now, I would like to turn it over to Richard, he is going to provide you a little bit more detail on some of the progress that we\u2019ve made today.","Richard Dickson","Thank you, Chris, and good afternoon everyone. We are making headwind, the new metal that we\u2019ve been shaping has begun to emerge. As Chris said, there is still a lot of work to be done but we\u2019re confident that we have the ability and determination to restore the company to a path of sustainable and profitable growth. While, we\u2019ve been retouring the business overall my priorities continue to be centered under vitalizing the iconic global brands which are the heart beat of metal.","And on accelerating the work of our innovative Toy Box, the entrepreneurial business unit we created to drive invention and build the strongest pipeline of hit toys and licensed ventures in the category. Today, I\u2019ll focus on recent progress in those important areas. We continue working to give our brands strategic autonomy and resources they need to compete more effectively. Our new approach to global brand management is beginning to make an impact. And yes, we are making progress with Barbie. Our research shows that the brands relevance and interest among girls has been improving as a result of more effective marketing and more exciting products. In addition to diagnosis which suggest the potential of the direction we are taking the brand Barbie POS is up globally.","We are seeing solid consumer takeaway in the U.S. but we have been able to better leverage the new marketing campaigns and do more extensive program integration with our largest retail partners. The second wave of our Barbie B super brands strategy emphasizing diversity with a new fashion easters line is proving to be a success. A comprehensive marketing program including a music video, blogging, social media, and PR created tremendous buzz and momentum for the recent fashion easters product launch and the effectiveness of this program is inspiring new best practices for the brand. Getting Barbie back on the trajectory we want will take time but we\u2019re working hard to extent our domestic momentum on the brand to all key markets worldwide.","Monster High is a big exiting brand that continues to have great potential and significant challenges. Importantly, the brand concept continues to resonate with girls and we believe we can make it even more on trend and relevant. We\u2019ve been doing a great deal to get brand stabilized and re focused on it\u2019s strengths. We are already seeing some promising early performance from key retailers in the new vital line and large scale dolls we shared with you in the last call. There is much more work ahead here, and there are important developments to come on this brand.","American Girl continues to improve in line with our strategy for refreshing each of the key components of the business. For example in Q1 we launched the truly need personalized line just strengthen brand relevance and it\u2019s doing well and just this month we had a another important milestone in our international growth strategy for American Girl with the successful opening of our first store within in a store in Mexico city and it sales have been exceeding projections.","Our extensive work to restore power and momentum to the Fisher-Price business has two primary strategic priorities. The first is to strengthen the baby business which represents about half of Fisher-Price and has historically been a momentum driver for the entire unit. Here we continued to see solid progress.","In Q2 shipping for Fisher-Price baby was up more than 10% in North America and internationally in constant currency. And we are seeing strong peerless takeaway particularly in the key international markets we have targeted for growth. Second is to reestablish Fisher-Price as the premier brand in early childhood development.","Our focus for achievement oriented, millennial parents worldwide who are the brands primary consumer. We have extensively reorganized Fisher-Price to meet this objective and we are investing in the discovery of breakthrough inside then enable us to capitalize on the significant opportunities we have identified for the brand.","Thomas & Friends had a strong first half consumer takeaway in the international market shipping which validates our strategy to leverage the brands untact global potential, particularly in Brazil, Mexico, Russia and China will be building on this momentum in the second half aided by the international heavy up of Thomas\u2019s 70th anniversary marketing initiatives in Q3 and Q4.","Hot Wheels continues to be a strong performer and we believe it represents a big opportunity in our portfolio not only doesn\u2019t have the great potential to seamlessly integrate physical and digital. It has the strategic opportunity to evolve from simply cars and trucks to a greater system of purposeful play that parents will appreciate as much as kids will love.","These are opportunities we are working very hard to develop and explode, laying the foundation for accelerated brand growth in 2016. Well our core brand portfolio regains its footing and begins to show important progress we are concurrently building formidable capability in the fas paste more entrepreneurial component of our industry which is drive largely by hit to its licensing and partnerships.","We have created our Toy Box unit from the ground up to be a leader in this growing segment and are seeing important signs of progress here as well. One priority of our Toy Box strategy is to build a stronger licensing pipeline into the future by both acquiring and renewing important licenses, I\u2019ll focus on that today.","We are determined to be the best in the business at retaining and growing the important relationships we already have its is why we are particularly prior to announce the renewal of our partnership with Disney on the iconic toy story franchise with the global rights for the blockbuster toy story for film in 2017.","This renewal represents and encouraging new chapter in our partnership for Disney, our relationship we are determined to see become even more valuable to both partners. Our all new DC superhero girls license with Warner Brothers not only represents a game changing new segment girls action figures but also a state of the art content driven property.","The characters DC\u2019s female superhero\u2019s and super villains as teens are at the heart of the girl\u2019s impairment trend something we know a great deal about. Warner brother is putting a large amount of content behind this initiative and our products will be available in stores early 2016.","The latest collaboration in our strong ongoing partnership with Nickelodeon plays in the monster machines is already a breakthrough show. It has quickly risen to the number two ranking on all TV among boy\u2019s two to five and the number one app on the kids and education charts and as a results early toy sales are exceeding projections. In June we announced had another important new license, a partnership with DreamWorks animation and their new on trend mash up series Daimler Trucks content will soon begun to air on Netflix and our product will follow in 2016.","Toy Box is also leveraging entertainment partnerships to drive growth in the key construction segment of our MEGA brands business, we are encouraged to see construction doing well including important gains in the MEGA pre-school business largely attributable to the continued success of our SpongeBob license toys that tie into their big new Minions movie and coming next year Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.","Take it as a whole this represents a lot of solid progress across many important brands and our strategic priorities. Beyond what we are achieving in brand management, product innovation and licensed entertainment, we are continuing to accelerate global development of our brands. There is much upside opportunity for us in emerging and developing markets and we are moving strategically to seize it. We continue to invest ahead of the growth in China and are seeing very strong results there and we are encouraged by POS trends overseas.","We also continue to make progress as Chris noted on strengthening our retail relationships and our inventories in key markets to lay the groundwork for Q4. Overall we are much more dynamic and purposeful Mattel than we were only a year ago and the transformation underway in our strategic priorities and our culture while neither easy nor painless is beginning to shape a much more creative, aligned and nimble organization. We are laser focused on the strategic priorities Chris mentioned, we\u2019re confident in our plans to get Barbie and Fisher-Price back on track, we are encouraged by our recent success in building valuable strategic partnerships and focusing on continuing that success. We are determined to execute flawlessly at retail and we are committed to accelerating growth in emerging markets.","We are confident we will success because there is a renewed passion to lead among our talented people and Mattel is beginning to feel more like the global leader with the heart of a challenger, our founders first envisioned 70 years ago. I look forward to sharing our progress with you in the quarters to come and now I will turn the call over to Kevin Farr, Mattel CFO.","Kevin Farr","Thank you, Richard and good afternoon everyone. As Chris said we continue to make solid progress on our strategic priorities and our overall second quarter results were in line with our expectations. As a reminder to provide better visibility in the underlying business performance while we execute the turnaround, I will be discussing our results in constant currency and referring to adjusted financial measures that has got certain items related to our acquisition of MEGA as well as severance expense.","In constant currency, world-wide sales were up 1% or down 6% as reported as foreign exchange translation continues to have a negative impact on revenues. Year-to-date world-wide sales gross sales were up 3% in constant currency or down 4% as reported and our overall global POS which was up low single digits was aligned with shipping and excluding MEGA in both time periods.","From a brand perspective in constant currency, world-wide sales from Mattel girls and boys brands were down 3% in the quarter and down 1% year-to-date driven by declines in Monster High, certain license entertainment properties in Barbie which is partially offset by growth in Hot Wheels, Disney Princess and Minecraft.","World-wide sales for Fisher-Price brands were up 9% in the quarter and up 7% year-to-date driven by continued strength of our Baby Co business which includes baby, newborn and infant toys and [indiscernible] as well as Thomas was up too, which was partially offset by other Fisher-Price brands properties. American Girl continues to gradually improve up 1% in the quarter and year-to-date driven by the relaunch of Be Forever historical lines late last year as well as the beginning of a refresh for the Truly Me product line.","On a global basis, MEGA shipping was $65 million in the quarter and $103 million year-to-date as reported. The performance of the construction business was in line with our expectations for the first half of 2015. We are building a solid foundation in 2015 to drive growth in the construction industry on a global basis in terms of leveraging our brands, new licensing and our global supply chain as well as our marketing distribution and sales capabilities.","However our RC Craft business was down as we deemphasized non-strategic lower margin product lines. As Chris mentioned, our overall growth is fairly broad based across geographies in constant currency. Sales in the North American region were down 2% in the quarter primarily due to lower sales of Monster High but up 3% year to date reflecting a much improved retail inventory position as we exited 2014.","Sales in our European region were up 4% in the quarter and down 1% year to date, driven by strong growth in Russia in other emerging Europe, which was partially offset by core brand softness and some western European markets. We also made good progress against our European retail inventory over a hang in the quarter, and expect to have cream retail inventories heading into the holidays season.","Sales in our Latin America region were down 3% in the quarter, and up 1% year to date in constant currency with growth in our two largest markets Mexico and Brazil, being offset by several smaller countries that face very difficult macro economic environments. Sales in our Asia Pacific region were up 22% in the quarter, and up 20% year to date in constant currency driven by fairly broad based growth which was lead by China.","Looking at the P&L, we continue to invest in retail promotions and strategic pricing to improve top line momentum, and our adjusted gross margin remains solid at 47.9% in the quarter, up 70 basis points versus 47.2 in 2014. Our adjusted gross margin was 48.3% on year to date basis which was down 60 basis points versus 48.9% in the prior year.","As it relates to the key drivers of gross margin in the quarter and year to date, our price increases and our cost savings initiatives were offset by a higher product related cost. Year-to-date adjusted gross margins were negatively impacted mixed primarily related to the acquisition of Mega. And our overall basket of product league cost is roughly consistent with our forecast as we enter peak production.","Finally the currency impact of the timing of inventory movement and the hedging gains had a positive effect in gross margin rate in the quarter and year-to-date. We continue to anticipate a negative impact in the second half of 2015, related to foreign currency including the year-over-year impact on intercompany sales inventory from the significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar.","Our advertising rate remains higher reflecting our investments to support key core brands throughout the year, including additional spending in China, in Russia, we\u2019re investing ahead of growth in shipments and POS. SG&A was down versus the prior year in absolute dollars on both the reported and their adjusted basis, as we continue to streamline our organizations to facility faster decision making.","Importantly, with [indiscernible] business for two months in 2014, the impact of our cost saving initiatives is becoming more apparent. And we continue to execute aggressively on our funding our future cost savings programs where we delivered $29 million in overall gross savings in the quarter in $48 million year-to-date, which was split roughly even between gross margin and SG&A and other.","We are on track to deliver a $125 million of gross savings in 2015 waited to the second half, and remain committed delivering at the high end of our two year target of $250 million to $300 million. In the quarter, our adjusted operating profit was $23 million and $8 million year to date. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was one set and year to date was a negative $0.07 per share.","Now let\u2019s review our POS and shipping performance by core brand in more detail. Above is my remarks in the first half which we believe provides the best indication of underlying including in both time periods. Overall POS was up low-single digits with international POS was up mid single digits and U.S. POS down slightly. We are very early in the year, we\u2019re encouraged to see continued positive global POS for all of our core brands with the exception of Monster High.","For the first half, Barbie POS was up slightly on a global basis, with double digit gains in the US, partially offset by a mid single digit decline in international markets. Worldwide shipping from Barbie was down 8% in constant currency year to date with North America down 6% and international down 9%. We believe U.S. POS trends are aided by a better retail inventory situation and our ability to integrate our new brand campaigns more quickly in this market.","We are pleased to see the continued improvement in Barbie particularly in the U.S. and we expect to see shipments and POS more closely aligned as the year progresses as retailers buy what is selling. International POS is still impacted by frozen, the slower rollout of our new brand campaign and less clearance activity in 2015 in Latin America. Overall international POS in shipping for Barbie are relatively aligned.","As it relates to our high school franchises, monster high POS in shipping remains challenged as we continued to work to stabilize the business and ever after high continued to gain attraction in most existing international markets with global POS in shipping both up in the quarter in constant currency.","Global POS for total Fisher-Price brands including Thomas was up mid single digits driven by positive POS for the baby biz in the U.S. and importantly double-digit gains in international markets. Global shipping for Fisher-Price brands were up 7% in constant currency with North America 5% and international up 9%. For Thomas we continued to see solid gains for POS and shipments in both the U.S. and international markets in constant currency and we saw similarly strong trends for Hot Wheels.","Turning to the balance sheet our balance sheet continues to be strong, our owned inventory was down about $30 million year-over-year and consistent with our expectations we ended the quarter with about $300 million of cash in our balance sheet as we continued to tightly manage our seasonal working capital needs and reduced our owned inventory levels.","Our second quarter results also reflect our ongoing commitment to discipline capital deployment. As Chris said dividends remain a first priority after reinvesting in the business and the board declared third quarter dividend $0.38 per share which is flat compared to the third quarter of 2014. As we continue to execute aggressive cost reduction initiatives we believe we can make the investments necessary to grow our business will continuing our current dividend, clearly as we done historically will evaluate capital deployment priorities quarterly with the board.","Looking forward we continued to monitor the currency markets and macroeconomic outlook closely especially given the recent economic events in the year also. Overall based upon our year-to-date financial results we continued to believe that 2015 outlook that we provided in last quarter\u2019s investment call remains achievable.","In closing well we recognize we have got lot of work to do we continued to see signs of stabilization of revenues and POS on at underlying basis as well as improving financial performance across the P&L in the first half of 2015. We\u2019re pleased that our turnaround remains untracked.","With that we\u2019ll now open the call to questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mike Swartz of SunTrust. Your line is now open.","Michael Swartz","Hey, good evening everyone.","Chris Sinclair","Hi Mike.","Michael Swartz","Just one of the touch on Barbie real quick in, it sounds like POS is started the turn in, I think Richard had made some commentary just about getting that brand back on track, I mean is there any timeline we should be thinking about is that back half of this year going into \u201916 because I think the lot of what we\u2019ve heard and what\u2019s out there is that the competitive environment in dolls is getting little more difference differ as we go through \u201915?","Richard Dickson","Hey Mike, it\u2019s Richard and I think we\u2019re pleased as I mentioned with the progress that we\u2019re making on the brand. I think most evident with our U.S. performance in the first half POS all indicating great momentum but we are going into a very competitive second half. Now we\u2019re poised in a better place then we been in a while and certainly all the research and indicators that we have in terms of girl consumer interest in the brand is back in the right trajectory.","There is obviously a lot of interest in the programming that we have for the back half. We\u2019re continuing on a daily basis to be - that programming in line with the competitive landscape that we have and we are encouraged with early signs of momentum based on the first half.","We continued to reemphasize internationally all the programs that we have, we were working very hard around the world to continued to execute against the new creative and we will continue to slugged out on a daily basis.","Michael Swartz","Thanks for the color and then if I can just ask one more for Kevin, I think you mentioned in the first half you had a benefit from just the impact I guess timing of inventory from FX is that right and then as we think about the back half of the year, how much of a flip do we see as that turns to the negative?","Kevin Farr","Yes I think as we looked at the first half of the year, we are impacted 4X in absolute dollars but when you look at it at a rate perspective the change in strengthening of the U.S. dollar impacted sales more because if you use the current rates of translation and with regard to inventories we are really seeing inventories flow through from a couple of quarters ago when they repurchased by foreign subsidiaries and those subsidiaries both with respect to the translation that use was not as weak as it is today as well as our hedging related to that was better than the rates today. So we saw a benefit from a rate perspective but as we look forward we do expect that the rate with expect to we have given a forecast of 46% on the top line for the full year due to translation.","We expect that to mitigate as we get to the second half of the year because we are down minus seven at this point in translation for the first half and then with regard to gross margins we expect that impact to be higher because the fact that the translation is going to occur when the dollar already strengthened in the first half of this year as well as our hedging in the back half of the year isn\u2019t at the rates that we were at earlier in the year. So we should see an impact of 30% to 35%, $0.35 per share on EPS in the back half of the year and year-to-date that impact is only about $0.02 a share.","Michael Swartz","Okay, great. Thank you so much for the color.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Eric Handler of MKM Partners. Your line is now open.","Eric Handler","Yes thanks very much for taking the question. When I look at your Fisher-Price business this was the first time since the fourth quarter of 2012 that you actually had an up quarter I believe back then you had the benefit of the acquisition of HIT Entertainment, so do you think we have turned the corner here where you can be - you can shelve several quarters in a row of positive growth at Fisher-Price or is there something that you know specifically help 2Q?","Kevin Farr","Across the board, we are seeing early signs and good positive results from many of the initiatives that we have been working on the Fisher-Price brand for quite some time mainly I would say there has been an incredible amount of innovation in our product New Aesthetics, Baby Gear as well as new marketing campaigns that have been tested and arguably some of most effective work that the brand has done in several years. I think it is a combination of many things as we see product being more embraced, retailers get more excited about the pricing strategies and retail execution that we have had recently and again marketing initiatives that the brand has done are starting to really take shape. So we are encouraged with the momentum that we are building with Fisher-Price but this is a long-term strategy obviously with lots of hurdles ahead but we are encouraged with the early signs in many parts of the brand.","Chris Sinclair","One thing that amplify Eric, when you look at Fisher-Price\u2019s performance a lot of the things Richard talked about clearly driving it but we are also seeing enormous traction in emerging markets and we would certainly expect that to continue and build.","Eric Handler","Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Drew Crum of Stifel. Your line is now open.","Drew Crum","Okay, thanks. Good afternoon everyone. So 26% growth for - the constant currency was there anything there is specific that drove that growth, how much impacted the Marvel and Star Wars on performance and is that something we should expect to continue in second half?","Richard Dickson","Do you want to pick that up on Hot Wheels?","Chris Sinclair","So yes our licensing initiatives with Hot Wheels has really helped drive additional sales in the Hot Wheels brand notably though to recognize that our basic card business is also healthy and growing, so we have leveraged licensing and as we have initiated with our strategic priorities, partnership as the way to infuse relevance, top culture relevance and additional incremental business for the brand, we obviously are very excited about Star Wars and being part of the momentum that that property will have and enjoying some great Hot Wheels momentum in partnership with Star Wars as well as our other licensed initiatives within Hot Wheels is starting to really show the power of strategic partnership when leveraging a big platform brand like Hot Wheels.","Kevin Farr","I think we are also seeing more traction with Hot Wheels in emerging markets like China.","Drew Crum","Got it. Okay and just one more from me guys, I think you would now let some lost shelf space in the fall last year and if your spring line this year, what are your expectations for the second half of this year, any additional detail or color you can provide there would be helpful. Thanks.","Kevin Farr","I\u2019m sorry, we had a hard time hearing you on that Drew, but I guess you were talking about shelf space, right?","Drew Crum","Yes. That\u2019s shelf space, Chris.","Chris Sinclair","Look, I think we\u2019ve talked about this before but now we lost quite a bit of space between last fall, the Spring sets, that\u2019s largely in the numbers we are contenting with, that\u2019s been some other issues on managing inventory and shipments that we\u2019ve been dealing with. We think we probably have a little bit more to go in spots for the fourth quarter. But we put in place a lot of activity to get secondary is to build our promotional inventories and things like that. And our shelf productivity is an retailer profit turns have been excellent over the last few months. So we\u2019re selling hard to make sure we don\u2019t see any more slippage and hopefully we can offset with our secondary\u2019s any remaining space loss, I think we\u2019ll be getting at least [indiscernible] that issue and turn the tide a little bit.","Martin Gilkes","And I think Drew, as I mentioned in the first quarter investor call, we really have reflected in our plan for the year higher sales adjustments than our average rate historically and that was really put in place to combat that short spaced laws by having the ability due at - displays and do more promotions so those are one of the things along with we put more advertising dollars we\u2019ve said that we\u2019re going to be at the high end of the range of advertising so we can advertise and promote more to support that additional space productivity.","Drew Crum","Okay. Got it. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you, and our next question comes from Taposh Bari of Goldmann Sachs. Your line is now open.","Taposh Bari","Hi, good afternoon. I had a question on Mega, surprised by the revenue there, it seems like there is some strategic lower margin cleanup happening there. If you can help kind of size up that part of the business, it looks like Mega was doing about $350 million LTM since you acquired it. How much of that piece is going away as part of the strategic initiative?","Chris Sinclair","I\u2019ll take this one. Mega actually have disaggregated a bit but there is a few things going on. One, there is no doubt we had some integration issues and some delays and startup particularly in Europe for some labor reasons and so forth. So we got off to a little bit of slow start there, we\u2019ve also been focusing heavily on the core construction part of the business and de emphasizing a little bit the arts and crafts piece, which you are really seeing in the results right now is the arts and crafts is what\u2019s been pulling things down a bit and construction is actually performing quite well.","Certainly as we gotten through the integration issues, I would tell you the last six weeks we\u2019ve had very positive momentum on Mega and if you look at the license properties in the activity we have coming forward in the next six months we\u2019re actually feeling very good about that business, lot of optimism going forward. But we\u2019re going to continue to do some clean up on the arts and crafts business.","Kevin Farr","Yes, I think the one of things we are really excited about now is the success of minions movie which is a license that we have and I think also in the back half of the year, [indiscernible] was launching their latest games that we\u2019ve also got that from tail wind in the back half of the year and then obviously we\u2019re very excited about next year trajectory from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. So making good progress, as well as we are launching Monster High on that platform here in the fall.","Taposh Bari","Great. And then just two more, and I\u2019ll pass it along, one Kevin for you. Can you quantify the impact that VFX timing and inventory receipt timing and hedging et cetera had on second quarter gross margins and then the second question, is this related to the Disney revenue piece. First congrats on renewing the license for the Toy Story license but on the actual princess loss next year, you\u2019ve given us some parameters around what that business has done in the past but can you give us some sense on what the margin is related to that or what the incremental margin is on that whatever it is at the revenue piece ultimately this was to help size up the earnings whole?","Kevin Farr","I think as I said for the first half of the year, in absolute dollar terms ForEx was a hit to gross margins as a percentage of the rate, I\u2019m not going to get in the details of that but it was the driver of the increased in the quarter offset by higher royalties and then with regard to the Disney Princess subject - it\u2019s a good margin business, its higher on average then our average overall rate.","Taposh Bari","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the Felicia Hendrix of Barclays Capital. Your line is now open.","Felicia Hendrix","Hi, thank you. Good afternoon. So in your prepared remarks then in the Q&A and you all cost out and the Barbie POS last shipment and balance. I was just wondering if you could talk about any other lines that based similar in balance and where do you standing getting close there?","Chris Sinclair","Yes, there are too many of the other businesses that have quite the same in balance. We still have some issues on the high as which were dropping inventory faster, our shipments I should say faster than POS but lot of that\u2019s related to cleaning up inventory on places like Europe. Barbie is probably been the most pronounced in terms of the mismatch but part of that if I can explain a little is, is related to what we measure in POS and what we actually include in shipments DVD sales and consumer product sales are reflected in shipments those were actually the bigger part of the imbalance the of the core Barbie business which is actually tracking quite well in terms of shipments in POS.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay, thanks and then should we just talk about so American Girl improved sequentially just given that see stores that opened at the end of this year and then you had Nashville open at the end of May, I would have thought, I would have done a little bit better as may be you could talk a bit about what\u2019s happening in American Girl?","Chris Sinclair","We\u2019ve been working obviously that to drive some refreshes that the launch, relaunch of our be forever historical line late last year as well as the newly refreshed truly new line which is the largest piece of the business and all of these are showing signs of improvement, the new retail stores are meeting an exceeding expectations and obviously I\u2019ve mentioned a successful launch and expansion of our first store within in a store in Mexico City.","We recently rebranded My Gline to Truly Me and so that there has been a lot of really great refresh work that were starting to see the results, the new product line in the market is beginning to show improvement and that\u2019s frankly been the objective that were starting to see pronounced, that\u2019s said we have more work to do to reinforce American Girl\u2019s point of differentiation, personalization, even our in store experience and all of that is top of mine worked on by the brand. We\u2019ll have more news to come throughout the year on this one.","Felicia Hendrix","Great, thank you. And then just Kevin from my final question as far as on the balance sheet so in the quarter your cash balance is $300 million and seasonally that in the third quarter that cash typically goes down so I was just wondering if you could talk about your comfort with the cash balances because if you look at recent history, kind of add, the lower end of the range where you\u2019ve been?","Kevin Farr","I think we\u2019re comfortable with the $300 million level that\u2019s actually a little bit better than our plans, so we track me had and we\u2019re also tracking in head on the usage of cash flow. So we\u2019re very comfortable at this point where we stand on cash.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tim Conder of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Timothy Conder","Thank you. Just a couple of clarifications just wanted to make sure, they heard properly from a broad global channel inventory perspective, you continued to expect to have that cleaned up by the end of the third quarter and then would you also if I I\u2019m interrupting your commentary right, we should kind of expect a wholesale trough here in Barbie in the second or third quarter is that correct?","Chris Sinclair","I don\u2019t know if I quite understood your second question Tim, can you try that again on the trough on Barbie?","Timothy Conder","Yes, I mean if we look at the way Barbie is trending with the wholesale trends should we expect that may be still to be negative but on a year-over-year basis but potentially less negative here going forward so maybe we\u2019re seeing the trough that the inflection point at the wholesale level.","Chris Sinclair","Yes, I got it. The answer to that question is yes we do think it\u2019s going to start to align better we should start to see that mitigate as in the first question remind me?","Timothy Conder","Clean up of the broad channel pockets of inventory.","Chris Sinclair","Yes sorry no I think we\u2019re feeling, we\u2019re getting that pretty well under control Tim, Europe still has some issues but I think we\u2019re working through those, so we should be okay I think Latin America has done a pretty good job of cleaning things up.","Timothy Conder","Okay. And then on the funding of future Kevin you\u2019ve given some good guidance here on the growth savings and some historical perspective of that one in a quarter this year largely weighted and you said to the back half and then 250 by the end of 2016, any color or commentary you can say about what we should expect from a net number perspective?","Kevin Farr","Well I think I\u2019m not going to give you an net number perspective but I think you\u2019ve got the couple of components, we\u2019ve laid out in 2014 what the integration and acquisition charges are for MEGA and then I think the other thing we\u2019ve laid out is severance in 2014 and we expect severance last year it was $51 million, it\u2019s likely that severance is going to be above that number next year or this year I\u2019m sorry.","Timothy Conder","In 2015, okay and then expect that to decline in 2016.","Kevin Farr","Yes.","Timothy Conder","Okay. Okay. Lastly you\u2019ve talked about some key hires that you\u2019ve done over the last six months, how do you feel at this point about the team that assembled or you pretty well done having the team set across the organization?","Kevin Farr","Actually Tim, I think we\u2019ve said before we have made some key hires, we\u2019ve obviously reorganized and put people in different positions but we still have a number of active searches going on right now which we\u2019ll probably have more to talk about on the coming months but clearly I think flagged in the past we have some more marketing talent we\u2019re looking at, we\u2019re certainly working on content and e-commerce and a number of other areas, so no we\u2019re not done with recruiting at this point.","Timothy Conder","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Linda Bolt Weiser of B. Riley.","Kevin Farr","Hi Linda.","Linda Bolton Weiser","Hi you gave quite a bit of commentary on Barbie, POS, I think you said it was up double-digit in the U.S. in the first half. Can you give just a little bit more and tell us was it actually better like an acceleration of growth in the second quarter or about the same or a little slower growth in terms of POS in the U.S. for Barbie? Thanks.","Kevin Farr","Yes Linda I think it\u2019s challenging because in 2015 Easter was in the first quarter and in 2014 Easter was in the second quarter, so as we look at POS it\u2019s better to look at it from the perspective particularly in the U.S. on a first half basis and we did see it being dip up double-digits in the first half for Barbie.","Linda Bolton Weiser","Okay. And then just on the gross margin you said input cost were higher or product related cost, can you give a little more color on are you actually experiencing lower resin cost year-over-year and what about other commodity inputs and then also I would expect labor cost are probably up, can you give a little more color on the actual commodities in labor?","Kevin Farr","Yes I think commodities we are seeing lower resin cost but we do see other input cost outside of resins being impacted as the challenge but the biggest issue is labor cost, direct labor cost and that\u2019s going up in double-digits and again that\u2019s why we\u2019re very focused in on our systemic cost savings initiatives particularly with regard to automation to try to take direct labor out and we\u2019re progressing on that I think year-to-date we\u2019ve taken out about 2500 of the 3000 people that we had targeted for this year. So we\u2019re making progress there.","Chris Sinclair","Linda just one clarification on resin it\u2019s worth noting too, that came down lot slower than we would have anticipated and primarily in Asia resin that started to turn finally but we didn\u2019t get a lot of help on resin even coming through the first half that should get little better as we go forward.","Kevin Farr","I think as I stated, I think our overall basket of cost are above what we expect them to be so when you look at the fact we take mid single digit price increase right now we\u2019re pretty comfortable that\u2019s going to be reflective in what our expected costs are in the second half of the year during our peak season.","Linda Bolton Weiser","Thank you.","Chris Sinclair","Operator, we have time for one last call or one last question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jaime Katz with Morningstar. Your line is now open.","Jaime Katz","Thanks for squeezing me in. Just a quick question on speed to market, you guys had mentioned and I\u2019m curious how the organizational changes that you\u2019ve made have impacted that and maybe how you think about where inventory turns go, do they stay the same and you have more frequent product launches or is there room to make significant impacts in that metric.","Chris Sinclair","We\u2019ve been working very closely with the global supply chain and putting sort of stealth efforts into streamlining product development processes, ranking and prioritizing within our brands as well as Toy Box particular products that we want us fast track, there are specific initiatives with names for these initiatives that are now being executed, it\u2019s early days but the results of these initiatives are proving incredibly effective and frankly inspiring the organization overall to believe that we can really change the paradigm of the way that certainly the product development process works overall with additional speed to market that\u2019s frankly, it\u2019s to some extent price of entry today in terms of what consumer expectations are. So we are encouraged with the early signs and we believe that this will only get better and more effective as time moves on.","Kevin Farr","And I\u2019d just to add, I think it\u2019s a huge opportunity for us with regard to our global supply chain. We\u2019re very focused on cutting down on lead times, materials just about every aspect of shortening the time from ideation to get into the store shelves. We\u2019re working on in some form of fashion.","Jaime Katz","Are you guys utilizing the Quirky relationship for that in some way, shipper form that may be is a lot larger than we think.","Chris Sinclair","We are very active on a day to day basis leveraging the Quirky relationship and I think we\u2019ll probably incoming calls have more updates in terms of the results some of which speed to market and product development new ideation and certain challenges that we\u2019ve given the Quirky community. All of which is active and frankly quite exciting and I think we\u2019ll have some news to share as calls come in.","Jaime Katz","Thanks.","Chris Sinclair","Okay. Are we done. Well, listen thank you very much everybody for joining us, I know that Kevin is going to be available for some follow up discussions with some of you and we look forward to following up in the coming months.

Joining me today are Ynon Kreiz, Mattel's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Richard Dickson, Mattel's President and Chief Operating Officer; and Joe Euteneuer, Mattel's Chief Financial Officer.","As you know, this afternoon, we reported Mattel's 2018 full year and fourth quarter financial results. We will begin today's call with Ynon and Joe providing commentary on our results and then we will provide time for Ynon, Richard and Joe to take your questions.","To help guide our discussion today, we have provided you with a slide presentation. Our discussion, slide presentation and earnings release, reference non-GAAP financial measures, including gross sales, adjusted gross profit, and adjusted gross margin, adjusted other selling and administrative expenses, adjusted operating income or loss, adjusted earnings or loss per share, earnings before interest, depreciation and amortization or EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, and constant currency.","Additionally the sales that is referenced on this call will be stated in constant currency. The information required by Regulation G regarding non-GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release and slide presentation and both documents are available in the Investors section of our corporate website, corporate.mattel.com.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that certain statements made during the call may include forward-looking statements relating to the future performance of our business, brands and product lines. These statements are based on currently available information and they are subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.","We describe some of these uncertainties in the Risk Factors section of our 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K, our 2018 Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, our earnings release and the presentation accompanying this call, in other filings we make with the SEC from time to time, as well as in our other public statements. Mattel does not update forward-looking statements and expressly disclaims any obligation to do so, except as required by law.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Ynon.","Ynon Kreiz","Thank you, everyone, for joining our fourth quarter earnings call. We're happy to announce our fourth quarter results, which demonstrate meaningful progress in executing our strategy and significant improvement over last year.","As we described last quarter, we have a two part strategy to drive our transformation to become an IP driven high performing toy company.","In the short to mid-term, our priorities are to restore profitability and regain top line growth by reshaping operations, growing our power brands and expanding our brand portfolio. In the mid to long-term, we will capture the full value of our IP through franchise management and develop our online retail and e-commerce capabilities. Today we can report that this strategy is continuing to demonstrate tangible results.","In terms of restoring profitability, we're tracking ahead with our structural simplification program. Exiting 2018 we achieved $521 million of run rate cost savings. We now expect to exceed our overall cost savings target of $650 million exiting 2019. This helped us achieve a reported gross margin of 46.6% in the quarter and 39.8% for the full year. This is the first time we have delivered a gross margin improvement for the fourth quarter and the full year since 2013.","Our adjusted operating income was a positive $113 million in the quarter, up $276 million compared to a loss of $163 million in the prior year. With that, we achieved the largest year-over-year improvement in operating income for each of the fourth quarter and full year since 2009.","In terms of regaining top line growth Barbie and Hot Wheels continued their momentum throughout the year. We executed well in our two largest regions North America and Europe and maintained our strength in Latin America and global emerging markets excluding China. As a result of this performance, we are proud to say, that we recaptured our leadership position as the number one global toy company in 2018 according to NPD.","In terms of capturing the value of our IP, our newly launched Mattel Films announce several important movie deals with major studios and key talent and we're making progress in other highly accretive business verticals as well. Regarding partner brands, we demonstrated our strength as a licensing partner with Jurassic World having its biggest toy year ever. While we have more work to do, we are very encouraged by our progress to-date.","Taking a more macro view not surprisingly the global toy industry declined 2% in 2018 according to NPD. This was driven primarily by the retail disruption related to Toys \"R\" Us less successful new brand launches compared to 2017 and a lighter entertainment slate.","Despite challenges affecting the retail landscape in 2018 both in the U.S. and Europe we did well this holiday season. Our teams around the world worked tirelessly collaborating with key retailers as they leaned into the toy aisles. This is a testament to our strong brands and ability to execute even in tough market conditions, as well as Mattel's strategic long standing relationships with our retail partners.","As we said last quarter, the toy industry is expected to grow on a global basis through 2022 according to Euromonitor and we intend to accelerate our own pace and increase market share.","Now, I will walk through our brand and regional results. In terms of brand highlights, 2018 was a great year for Barbie, which sustained growth and continued momentum globally. Barbie worldwide gross sales were up 15% both for the quarter and the full year in constant currency. This marked the fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth for the brand and the highest full year gross sales in the last five years. Global POS continue to be strong and was up mid-single digits in the fourth quarter and up double digits for the full year.","The brand delivered sales and POS growth in every region for the full year. With this level of performance, Barbie was the number one global fashion doll property in 2018 according to NPD. We look forward to celebrating her 60th anniversary throughout 2019 with a number of exciting product launches and events.","Hot Wheels worldwide gross sales were up 12% in the quarter and 9% for the year and reach its highest annual sales in its 50 year history. Global POS was up low-single digits in the quarter and up high-single digits for the full year. POS for the full year also grow in every region.","According to NPD, it was the number one property globally in the vehicles super category in 2018. Fisher-Price and Thomas & Friends gross sales were down 15% in the fourth quarter which included a negative 9% impact from Toys \"R\" Us before re absorption. Global POS in the quarter was down similarly. Fisher Price was one of the Mattel brands most heavily impacted by the liquidation of Toys \"R\" Us as well as challenges we have faced in China. As the effects of Toys \"R\" Us moderate and we work through channel inventory in China, the brand will be in a better position to restore growth.","The infant, toddler and preschool category is the single largest category in the toy industry and it is an important space for us. According to NPD, we have been and remain the number one in the category globally and we believe if we are successful in our Fisher-Price turnaround plan there is significant upside potential to be captured.","For Thomas & Friends, we launched new content in 2018, which is resonating in international markets especially in the UK. In the U.S. there has been a longer than expected release time frame for the new content, resulting in limited incremental exposure. We are taking a fresh look at Thomas holistically and looking at other ways to improve the entire consumer experience.","American Girl is in the midst of a multi-year turnaround. We believe in the potential of this beloved franchise and are focused on restoring its premium position through revitalizing brand experiences, both online and in our flagship stores. While it will take time to implement the changes and achieve the desired outcome, this franchise very much remains a valuable and important part of the Mattel portfolio.","In terms of partner IP, we are focused on strengthening the relationships we have with many leading entertainment companies and consumer brands. As mentioned, Jurassic World exceeded all expectations in 2018, delivering the biggest toy year ever for the franchise in partnership with Universal. This is a great example of how we are advancing Mattel as a partner of choice for third party IP owners by leveraging our worldwide reach through innovation and global execution capabilities.","Looking into 2019, we are particularly excited to introduce our highly anticipated Toy Story 4 product line in partnership with Disney. We're also launching a new line based on BTS, the world's leading South Korean boy band, which has become a cultural sensation with global appeal. We look forward to the launch of this multi category collaboration this summer.","Turning to our regional performance, in North America we ended the year as the largest toy company in the region according to NPD. Notably, while we lost some market share, we managed to maintain our position as the number one toy company in the U.S. in 2018, which makes it the 25th consecutive year we held the top spot in the largest toy market in the world.","In the fourth quarter, we made meaningful progress towards stabilizing revenues in the region relative to the prior year even with the impact of Toys \"R\" Us. Gross sales were down 10% in the quarter, including a 17% negative impact from Toys \"R\" Us before reabsorption. Our progress was supported by our strong and deep distribution network of more than 135,000 doors in the U.S. alone. We have worked closely with our retail partners to align on Omni channel strategies to ensure our joint customers are served with the right product in the right stores at the right time.","In Europe, we are seeing tangible signs that our regional transformation plan is starting to show results. Gross sales for the quarter were up 1% despite a negative 5% impact from Toys \"R\" Us before reabsorption and other industry headwinds. POS improved in Europe, with low-single digit decline for the quarter. We have continued to build our European e-commerce capabilities and expanded our presence with value retailers.","As mentioned in our third quarter earnings, Europe represents an important opportunity for us, given the size of the market, the strength of our franchises and the capabilities of our local teams on the grounds.","In Latin America gross sales were flat in the fourth quarter, we maintained our position as the number one toy company in the region in 2018, according to NPD. In global emerging markets gross sales were down 10% including a 15% impact from the slowdown in our China business, partially offset by strong performance in Russia and Turkey.","In China, the team on the ground has made solid progress improving the retail inventory issue we talked about last quarter. We expect to work with the remaining inventory by mid-2019. In total, international gross sales for the quarter were down 2%, including a 4% negative impact from China and 3% negative impact from Toys \"R\" Us before reabsorption.","As we said in our third quarter earnings call, we expect to advance our manufacturing footprint towards a capital-light model during 2019. We continue to believe that this will be advantageous and value accretive in our value adding several scenarios that will be aligned with our business objectives. We expect the transition to help us achieve improvements to gross margin that will be incremental to the value we will capture from our structure simplification savings.","As mentioned before, Mattel is the owner of one of the strongest portfolios of kids and family entertainment IP and franchises in the world. With a creation of Mattel Films in our new global franchise management organization we're targeting opportunities to develop our IP and extend our iconic franchises across several large mainstream business verticals that are adjacent to our core toy business.","These areas include film and television digital gaming, live events, music and consumer product merchandise. We've recently made several announcements for the first ever live action feature films for some of our key franchises, including Barbie with Warner Brothers starring and co-produced by Margo Robbie, Masters of the Universe with Sony, Hot Wheels with Warner Brothers and more to follow.","We also announced that Adam Bonnett formerly Global Head of Original Programming at Disney Channels worldwide has joined us as Executive Producer, Mattel Television. He brings over 20 years of experience in high quality children's television and will lead our global episodic content development and production for live action and animation programming. These are exciting developments for Mattel.","In closing, our mission is to create innovate products and experiences that inspire, entertain and develop kids through play. After 10 months on the job and three consecutive quarters of solid discipline execution, I have grown ever more confident about our ability to become an IP driven high performing toy company and create long-term for our shareholders.","As shown by our fourth quarter results we're making consistent progress towards advancing our strategy to restore profitability and regain top line growth in the short to medium term and are laying the ground work to capture the full value of our IP in the mid to long term. Among all the achievements in 2018, I would like to applaud our team for regaining the number one toy company position globally in a year full of challenges and headwinds.","This is a great moment to celebrate before we go back and continue the hard work of implementing our multi-year turnaround. I look forward to seeing many of you next week at Toy Fair and sharing additional details on our roadmap going forward.","I will now turn the call over to Joe to walk through our fourth quarter and full year financial results in more detail. Thank you.","Joseph Euteneuer","Thank you, Ynon and good afternoon, everyone. Today I'll begin by walking you through our financial results then I'll provide an update on our strategic investments and our continued progress towards structural simplification.","Our fourth quarter demonstrated our ability to consistently execute on a quarter-by-quarter basis. We have strong results in both the fourth quarter and the full year. Our full year results exceeded expectation on both the top and the bottom-line. Starting with the top-line, gross sales in the quarter were down 9% year-over-year in constant currency, driven by a negative 8% impact from","Toys \"R\" Us and a negative 2% impact from the slowdown in our China business.","As expected POS [Technical difficulty] similarly for the quarter has consumers transition from Toys \"R\" Us to other retailers. For the full year, gross sales exceeded expectations, declining 7% year-over-year in constant currency. We finished the year with retail inventory down mid-single digits globally year-over-year at our current customers and are well positioned for 2019.","In the quarter our adjusted gross margin was 46.6% of net sales up from 32% in the fourth quarter of 2017. The significant improvement of 1,460 basis points was primarily driven by a $114 million benefit from structural simplification initiatives, a favorable year-over-year comparison related to significant write-downs of excess owned inventory in Q4, 2017, favorable brand mix and decreased sales adjustments, driven by the timing of expense recognition higher than expected fourth quarter sales and improve trade spend management. These drivers were partially offset by a negative 350 basis point impact from inflation in the cost raw materials and plant labor.","Adjusted gross margin for the full year of 40% of net sales exceeded expectations and was up 230 basis points from 37.7% in 2017. The full year improvement was driven by the same items that drove the fourth quarter's improvement. Our full year advertising rate of 11.7% was consistent with the guidance we provided you on the third quarter call and benefitted from structural simplification savings of $30 million.","In the fourth quarter, our reported SG&A was $394 million, which was $58 million or 13% better on a year-over-year basis. Our fourth quarter adjusted SG&A of $388 million was up $3 million or 1% compared to prior year. This year-over-year increase was primarily driven by incremental incentive compensation of approximately $70 million, partially offset by the cost savings of $66 million from structural simplification.","Our full year adjusted SG&A of $1.4 billion was slightly better than prior year and consistent with the guidance we provided you in the third quarter. This year-over-year improvement was primarily driven by structural simplification savings of $165 million, partially offset by incremental incentive compensation of approximately $70 million and Toys \"R\" Us net bad debt expense of $32 million.","As Ynon mentioned the year-over-year improvement of our reported operating income in the fourth quarter was the largest since 2009. Adjusted operating income in the quarter was $113 million, up $276 million compared to a loss of $163 million in the prior year. This stand out performance was driven by the $210 million of savings realized from structural simplification and gross margin improvement, partially offset by higher incentive compensation and inflation in the cost of raw materials and plant labor.","Our full year adjusted operating loss was $115 million, an improvement of $92 million compared to a loss of $207 million in the prior year. The year-over-year improvement was driven by the $372 million savings realized from structural simplification, partially offset by inflation and lower revenue.","Now let me give you an update on taxes, our 2018 income tax expense was $41 million in the fourth quarter and $112 million for the full year, which was $11 million higher than the guidance we provided you on our third quarter earnings call, as a result of higher sales and profit than previously forecasted.","Our cash taxes paid net of refunds were $65 million. With regards to the tax act, in the fourth quarter, we adjusted our previously recorded provisional tax associated with the deemed repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings from $27 million to $3 million. Additionally as a result of the tax act, we reevaluated and changed our indefinite reinvestment assertion on a portion of our foreign earnings to enhance our access to foreign earnings and record a tax expense of $15 million related to this change.","As we stated in 2018, the overall effective tax rate may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter, due to the level and mix of income or losses in our foreign jurisdictions, and due to the full valuation allowance on our U.S. deferred tax assets, which will also be true in 2019.","Moving to the balance sheet, we ended the year with a cash balance of $594 million. In 2018, our working capital improved year-over-year as a result of accounts receivable decreasing by $159 million or 40% year-over-year, driven by lower sales and improved collections. This improvement resulted in a six day reduction in our day sales outstanding to 57 days. Additionally owned inventory decreased by $58 million or 10% year-over-year as a result of our continued efforts to tightly manage our inventory.","Moving to the statement of cash flows, cash flows used for operating activities were $27 million in 2018, which was in line with the prior year. Cash flows used for investing activities were $161 million, down 32% compared to the prior year. The primary driver of lower cash flows used for investing activities was capital expenditures.","Our capital expenditures were $152 million for the full year, down 49% year-over-year, driven by our structural simplification initiatives, which included reductions in tooling and plant capital expenditures. This was better than the guidance we provided and was achieved without sacrificing the investments needed to advance our strategic initiatives.","Cash flows used for financing activities, and other were approximately $297 million, which included a debt repayment of $250 million in the first quarter of 2018. We continue to actively manage our capital structure and are confident that we have sufficient liquidity to run our business efficiently. We have no debt maturities until October 2020.","In 2018, we remain committed to our investments strategic initiatives spending $63 million in line with our guidance from the third quarter of earnings, which revised our original full year guidance from $85 million to $60 million. This spent supported strategic initiatives related to our IT transformation, brand growth opportunities as well as international strategy. We plan to provide more visibility into our 2019 strategic investments next week at Toy Fair.","Now let me provide an update on our structural simplification cost savings program. As Ynon mentioned, we are on track to exceed our $650 million targeted run rate exiting 2019. Exiting 2018, we already achieved $521 million of run rate cost savings and have four more quarters to go to complete our program. In 2018, we realized approximately $210 million of savings in the quarter and full year savings of approximately $372 million. Our full year severance and restructuring costs related to structural simplification were $110 million.","Please refer to slide 19 in our accompanying slide presentation, which provides further detail on our structural simplification savings to-date. Turning the 2019, we look forward to talking to you more about our expectations for 2019 at Toy Fair next week.","In closing, our key financial metrics, including gross margin, operating income and earnings per share are all moving in the right direction. This reflects the execution of our short to mid-term strategy, which includes a focus on restoring profitability. With our cost savings ahead of schedule entering 2019. Our cost structure is well positioned to further improve profitability as we progress towards regaining top-line growth.","Looking forward, we have ample opportunities to improve our financial performance across the board. As our business strategy continues to gain traction in the marketplace. We look forward to seeing many of you next week at Toy Fair. Thank you for your time today, we will now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Ng","Great, thanks for the question. I have one for, Joe and one for, Ynon, if I could. Joe, I just wanted to better understand how much ahead of schedule on the cost savings you are. It seems like this $521 million run rate savings in the year was significantly better than I think what was originally expected, which was I think the 40% of $650 million, is that the right way to think about it. What went better than expected and also what inning are you in, in total cost savings do you think?","Joseph Euteneuer","So the answer to your question, is yes. It was supposed to be 40%, so yes we are ahead of schedule. Look, there's still a lot more to do, but we're very confident because we now are seeing that we're going to exceed the $650 million.","Michael Ng","Okay, great. Thanks. And then Ynon, I was just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on the content strategy. You're doing a lot of exciting things there, are these content initiatives expected to be kind of profitable in and of themselves. What is success looks like for you there? Thank you.","Ynon Kreiz","Yes sure. So what - the fundamental advantage that we have is that we are the owner of one of the strongest portfolios of children's and family entertainment franchises in the world. And the opportunities that we see are to expand our IP and franchises into a highly accretive business areas in and of themselves. So we do expect incremental transformative upside potential from these initiatives. And of course, at the same time there will be a halo effect on the core toy business. So we would expect to see uplift in the toy space as well.","Michael Ng","Great, thank you, both.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Arpine Kocharyan with UBS Investment Bank.","Arpine Kocharyan","Hi. Thank you. Thanks. Could you give a little bit more detail on global POS for the quarter. I think the fact that Barbie and Hot Wheels were up might not be surprising I think in the channel, both of those properties showed strength in the holiday season. But your shipment rate even in those products seemed to be a bit ahead of retail sell through, which was I think you said mid-single digit for Barbie and low-single for Hot Wheels. I guess, what could you say to eliminate any concern that there is inventory buildup even though we know that retail sales in those franchises were stronger than the industry for sure for the quarter.","Joseph Euteneuer","Yes, why don't I take that I mean we've worked really hard all year to start getting aligned demand and supply and our retail inventories are probably down mid-single digits as a result of that work. So I think that would be the answer to your question.","Arpine Kocharyan","In Q4 global POS all together was down - I'm sorry I couldn't hear you. Down mid-single digit for the portfolio overall.","Joseph Euteneuer","No, I said retail inventory was down mid-single digits. We worked hard to drive retail inventory down along with our own by mid-single digits. So...","Arpine Kocharyan","Right. And in terms of global POS for the quarter, could you quantify how much it was in terms of sell through?","Joseph Euteneuer","Well global POS was down double digits.","Arpine Kocharyan","Great. And I had a quick follow-up and maybe question for Ynon. You've put out several content related updates over the past several weeks related to Barbie and Hot Wheels, but those announcements didn't have specific timeline and economics and I understand why you wouldn't want to disclose some of that in terms of economics. But in terms of just general timing of when you are targeting some of those - some of that content to come. Could you elaborate on that a little bit?","Ynon Kreiz","We haven't been specific because it's too early to share with you the timeline. We did say that we expect to announce more initiatives in the near-term. And I can say and just to dispel a misperception that I read in a couple of places is that while we're not looking to take financial risk, we do expect to have meaningful upside from these opportunities.","And the reason is given the strength of the franchises we're seeing very strong interest from some of the best and strongest partners in the industry to collaborate with us. And we as a result expect to generate meaningful return for Mattel, notwithstanding the fact that we're not taking our own financial risk.","Arpine Kocharyan","That's helpful. So outside of toy sales upside you will participate in economics beyond royalty payouts for your brand. In other words, you will share that economics with a studio at some point because that would be participating economically, right?","Ynon Kreiz","Correct, that's right.","Arpine Kocharyan","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ray Stochel with Consumer Edge Research.","Raymond Stochel","Great, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask how you feel you are in terms of your inventory position when comparing new retailers or new doors that you opened relative to older doors. And then, if you could give a metric as to what percent of your sales this year came from new doors in either the U.S. or globally? And also I'd love an update on SKU count year-over-year. Thanks.","Joseph Euteneuer","Right. So we typically don't give out the retailer-by-retailer information. In regards to inventory, we - I just said that we were down mid-single digits at our retail store level. In regards to new accounts obviously we stayed focused in making sure that demand drove supply to make sure they had adequate inventory. I think the execution demonstrated how we were.","Operator","Okay. Our next question comes from Felicia Hendrix with Barclays.","Felicia Hendrix","Hi, thanks for taking my question. So, Joe, just the balance sheet one for you, first, the cash burn that you had for the year was roughly in line give or take is what we were expecting and in your prepared remarks you kind of laid out some of the drivers of that. For 2019, we're modeling moderate free cash flow generation. And I'm just wondering if that matches with your plans or could 2019 be another year of cash burn?","Joseph Euteneuer","So for 2019 we're going to be at Toy Fair next week and we'll give you all of the plans we have for 2019.","Felicia Hendrix","Not just a little pace now.","Joseph Euteneuer","We want to give you a wholesome picture, so that nothing could be taken out of context.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay. And then - okay I'm kind of reassessing here because I think I might ask you a bunch of things where you are going to say the same answer. But when I look at - when we kind of look at the successes that you guys have had thus far they mainly been in Barbie and Hot Wheels and you guys have talked about the initiatives that you're looking at to drive the other lines. But at least - and you've made it clear what's happening with an American Girl. But with Fisher-Price and Thomas could that grow in 2019?","Richard Dickson","It's Richard. I mean, obviously we're going to share a lot more with you at Toy Fair when we get to New York and we're very confident about our programs in place. The Fisher Price as you know single largest it's in preschool brand in the world. Lot of great progress that we're making there and there's specific focus in 2019 improving price value, reinforcing the digital dialogue with millennial moms. We're working on presenting to you in 2019 you'll see some great new innovation and new products and segments and we're very confident in the brand. And certainly it stay power and future growth.","Thomas as well. Thomas is an incredible brand almost 75 years' rich of heritage. It's a multi-generation franchise for us theme parks, programs, live events, products, consumer products. It is a really important brand and we're taking a holistic approach to it. From a consumer perspective we're going to be spending a lot of time on our retail presence and merchandising assortments. And again, we'll share a lot more with you on our products and programs, when we get to New York.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay. And this might be one more that, we'll have to hit on actually. But just wondering I think it would be helpful for a lot of people on the call just to give us some color or bring us up to speed in terms of where you are in terms of transitioning to manufacturing asset light face. Is that something you can update us on now?","Ynon Kreiz","As I said in the prepared remarks, we are proceeding towards a capital-light model. We have several scenarios that we are evaluating. And we expect that whatever benefit we will generate from this strategy will be incremental to the structural simplification program. On top of the target of $650 million that we also as you know, by now expect to exceed.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay. But there's no more details that you can give us on what you're - on how you're progressing with that?","Ynon Kreiz","Not at the stage.","Felicia Hendrix","All right. I really look forward to asking other questions next week. Thanks.","Ynon Kreiz","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Conder with Wells Fargo Securities.","Timothy Conder","Thank you. Maybe I'll just follow on please question there with the exiting the manufacturing timeline. Ynon or Joe whoever wants to take this, would you say that by 2021 is that a fair that you should be basically purely an asset light organization?","Ynon Kreiz","We don't want to give specific timelines, but there's clearly an opportunity. As you understand we today have 13 manufacturing plants. We employ tens of thousands of people. It's fair to say that these plants are actually doing a great job. These are great factories, But the there's no question that we can achieve significant benefits if we adapt our model to the new economy and leverage other options that we have.","Timothy Conder","Okay. And then gentlemen, again, to what degree you answers we'll see early next week, but just a broader timeframe of Fisher-Price, American Girl stabilization and then collectively then how does that fold into I think you said in a year ago, an intermediate goal of re-achieving a mid-teens margin?","Richard Dickson","It's Richard, I think we talked about fisher price clearly and we'll share a lot more of our growth strategies moving forward, which we're very confident. On American Girl, this is another one of our premium brands. It's a long standing again generational franchise with an incredible fan base. And I would mention like Barbie, another big generational brand that's weathered cycles overtime. And we really believe that American Girl has the ability to make a very strong come back.","That being said, we have said that it's going to take a multi-year approach to implement the changes that need to be made. We've been restoring the brand's premium position, which I will again share with you some of those deals and we get to New York. But this includes revitalizing brand experiences in our store, digital flagship approach online and certainly the content experiences and storytelling that girls and moms love about the American Girl franchise. These are really important aspects that we're continuing to work hard on and we do believe in the franchise long-term and again we'll share more detail with you in New York.","Timothy Conder","Okay. And then that mid-teens margin goal just any update there gentlemen?","Joseph Euteneuer","We haven't come off our goal to achieve mid-teens I mean, it's still something we believe we can get back to. So yes, that hasn't change.","Timothy Conder","Okay. See you next week. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Derek Johnson with BMO Capital Markets.","Derek Johnson","Good evening. First question, DC license. Can you hear your side of the story there? Did you not want to resign it the bid master update you what happened there?","Ynon Kreiz","Well, we can get into specifics, but I can tell you that we do have DC license as through 2019 and actually we have Wonder Woman through 2020. And we do expect to continue to be in partnership with Warner Brothers going forward. As you noted we also already in business with them with two big film franchises and that should give you a reference to the strength of the relationship between us.","Derek Johnson","Okay. And on the cost savings of the $521 million run rate. Are there any cost saving, you'd actually like to have back perhaps certain people or positions where you may not have appreciated their value until they were gone?","Ynon Kreiz","Look I'll give you an answer, but it's a taking a bigger picture, which is when we've developed a structural simplification program within it from the ground up. This was not a mandate from the top to reduce the organization by X percent. This was designed together with leaders across the world, across the entire organization to define and optimize our structure to simplify the organization, to remove layers that were unnecessary and to improve efficiency and performance.","So I can't tell you that we got everything perfect, but we're very happy with where we sit and believe that we can achieve more savings and efficiencies all the way through the end of 2019.","Derek Johnson","Great. One more if I can. So retailer shifted their fulfillment practices putting more pressure on you guys and vendors to hold more inventory to ship just in time. How do you think you perform there? Did you have enough inventory in place? Did you leave any sales on the table? Do you think you maximize yourself in the fourth quarter?","Joseph Euteneuer","Yes, I think first and foremost, I mean, we really worked hard to make sure that demand was driving supply. By not having TRU, and having retailers that hold less inventory, it required us to get our supply chain in place to have more inventory turns. And if you recall, we put in the Pennsylvania distribution facility that we had up and running in the back half of the year that actually contributed to the positive margin and it executed well. So yes, I think we did really well in this fourth quarter.","Did we leave some sales on the table? I don't think there's a quarter that goes by that you don't need some sales for some reason. So - but then we optimize the fourth quarter. I think our execution demonstrated that.","Derek Johnson","Great, thanks a lot, Joe.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Greg Badishkanian with Citi.","Gregory Badishkanian","Great, thank you. You had mentioned that retail inventory levels were down mid-single digit globally. So I'm just wondering how that will impact restocking at the retail level as well as the markdown money on a year-over-year basis in the first quarter?","Joseph Euteneuer","We don't anticipate any issues in regards to the first quarter. We've been very connected with our retailers and making sure that we got the right inventory in there that spinning the right way. So you saw our obsolescence was down obviously dramatically, but even more than a typical year. So I think we're in pretty good shape starting off 2019.","Gregory Badishkanian","So on a year-over-year basis, I'm assuming that it's going to be more favorable it's actually going to be a tailwind for you, right?","Joseph Euteneuer","Yes, I mean look, I don't think it's material I guess is how I would look at it.","Gregory Badishkanian","Okay. All right. And just how do you think retailers will approach the toy category in 2019 versus how they did in 2018, some of the mistakes they made and what do you think they're going to do differently?","Joseph Euteneuer","I mean, from my perspective, I think look with the loss of TRU, it was all about having a plan to gain market share from the lack of TRU. And I think we worked with them a very effectively in doing that. I think we exited the year with, great shelf space. And any game plan you're executing to as you go through, you can always turn the screw one way or the other to refine your process and execution. And we'll make those things as we go through the quarters ahead.","Ynon Kreiz","And I would add that the toys is a strategic category for many retailers. This is not just another product that they sell from the aisles. It drives traffic, engagement and obviously there is a product that have emotional connections with the consumers. So the toy industry is in a good place.","We talked about the different research that we see that are projecting continued growth through 2022, solid growth. The latest research that we are looking at is a Euromonitor research that studied 32 markets that represent about 80% of the industry. And they're talking about 4.7%, CAGR through 2022.","We see demand, we see retailers leaning in, we're seeing consumers looking to continue to be entertained, inspire and play with our product. So we remain very positive about our relationship and collaboration with the different retailers to step in and optimize for the result.","Gregory Badishkanian","Thanks for extra color, Ynon. Take care.","Ynon Kreiz","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Handler with MKM Partners.","Eric Handler","Yes. Thanks for the question. Wonder if we could talk a little bit more about Fisher Price. And this is a segment that's been in perpetual turnaround for a number of years now. But when you look at where you are, maybe you could talk about, since there are so many different businesses within Fisher Price, maybe what are the three areas where you're most optimistic right now? Where are the troubled areas?","And also, maybe you could talk a little bit about Thomas, originally when this was acquired from HIT, there was tremendous optimism and this was a crown jewel within HIT Entertainment. And it seems like the business has tapered off in the last couple years. What's functionally changed with Thomas and what sort of needs to happen to get it back on an upward trend?","Richard Dickson","So I'll start and my friends can chime in as we see fit. There important part of the Fisher Price narrative this year that's of note. The brand was heavily impacted in 2018 by Toys \"R\" Us. The disruption of course Babies \"R\" Us and as we mentioned the challenges that we've had in China, so it clearly has exasperated the results that you're seeing.","The price value equation of the brand has been one that we've been working on for some time. And there have been some mechanical changes this year that have been attempted that have proven effective and we will continue to learn as we go through our tests and some of the execution that we have planned for 2019 should start some of the momentum that we've seen in some of these tests for 2018.","There's a also the reality of the millennial mom and the demand creation model, which we've been practicing more of and testing and learning. As I mentioned, the digital dialogue that we've been having an investing more in demand creation through digital platforms for Fisher Price will increase for 2019 and beyond. And as well least of which is innovation.","The value proposition also must have an important innovative component from a product. And again, as we look forward to seeing you at our galleries in New York, there's some specific new segments that we're going to be introducing that answer consumer insights, trends and innovation.","So as you watch the space again, despite the fact that we've obviously been experiencing challenge with the Fisher Price brand, we do remain the number one in the category. The category is an incredibly important category for the industry, preschool, infant toddlers is the number one category in the space. And we do see opportunities for growth across the board, in particular in the preschool space. So as we share more with you in New York, hopefully we'll get more details for you that will give you the confidence that we have in the franchise.","As it relates to Thomas. Sorry, question\u2026","Eric Handler","No, go ahead. Go ahead.","Richard Dickson","Okay. So on the Thomas front, as you know, we were slow to reinvent if you will or revitalize some of the content. The new content is resonating in international markets, especially in the UK. In the U.S., there has been a bit of a longer than expected release timeframe for the new content. And it has had a result in limited incremental exposure.","We're taking a really fresh look at Thomas from a holistic consumer perspective. Content is incredibly important and is part of the heritage of the brand, but consumer products is also a very important component as well live events. And also as part of that innovation within the toy line, so all of which is being looked at significantly. And again, not punting every question to New York, but we will have more to share with you in New York.","As I mentioned on one previous question earlier, we're working on strengthening our retail presence and merchandising assortment. If you go into a lot of the various different locations where Thomas is featured, the consumer is buying into Thomas in the depth of purchase of the characters. And what we're concentrating on is making sure that the assortment is there to meet the demand. We've got a really strong fan base and great relationships around the world with consumers on this brand. And we're going to be sharing a lot more of what we believe are the mechanics to turn it around in New York.","Eric Handler","Great, thanks, Richard. Just one quick for, Joe, since Richard brought up China, you had a big inventory overhang there, where does that stand now?","Joseph Euteneuer","So we're a good way through it fourth quarter was very helpful. We will still have some to get through in the first half of the year, but feel very good about the position we're in right now.","Eric Handler","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jaime Katz with Morningstar.","Jaime Katz","Thank you for taking my question. I'm curious about the Toy Box. Obviously there are ongoing declines in there and MEGA was called out as a brand that continues to struggle. Could you give us any inside as to where you guys sort of see that stabilizing? And how you feel about MEGA at this point in time it was a very promising business at the time of acquisition. Thanks.","Richard Dickson","MEGA remains a strong number two challenger brand with enormous opportunities ahead of it. We love the construction space. It's a great category and MEGA is a strong challenger brand. We do have exciting new products and propositions for the brand in 2019 and one that we're incredibly excited about is the fantastic partnership that we have with Pok\u00e9mon. As you know the Pikachu movie is coming out in the first half of 2019 and we believe there'll be great excitement over our product line and assortment related to that partnership.","We've got some other new items that we're going to be sharing with you at Toy Fair and some specific retail programs driving a challenger mindset with the MEGA brand. And we believe really strongly in the category, we think it has tremendous upside potential for us and it represents a great opportunity for us for growth around the world.","Jaime Katz","Okay. And then any inside into sort of when maybe the growth would start to level out there in the Toy Box.","Richard Dickson","The question was\u2026","Ynon Kreiz","When will toy box are leveling out.","Richard Dickson","Okay. I think on that again we will have to share with you the overall strategy related to how we're approaching the categories. And within the Toy Box how we're driving growth both in our partnerships business and across the specific categories that we manage.","Jaime Katz","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Ms. Whitney Steininger for any closing remarks.","Whitney Steininger","Thank you operator and thank you everyone for joining the call today.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to hand the conference to your speaker today, David Zbojniewicz, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go-ahead sir.","David Zbojniewicz","Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me today are Ynon Kreiz, Mattel\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Richard Dickson, Mattel\u2019s President and Chief Operating Officer; and Joe Euteneuer, Mattel\u2019s Chief Financial Officer.","As you know, this afternoon, we reported Mattel\u2019s 2019 third quarter financial results. We will begin today\u2019s call with Ynon and Joe providing commentary on our results and then we will provide time for Ynon, Richard, and Joe to take your questions.","To help guide our discussion today, we have provided you with a slide presentation. Our discussion, slide presentation, and earnings release reference non-GAAP financial measures, including gross sales, adjusted gross profit and adjusted gross margin, adjusted other selling and administrative expenses, adjusted operating income and loss, adjusted earnings and loss per share, earnings before interest, depreciation and amortization or EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and constant currency. Please note that the sales figures referenced on this call will be stated in constant currency.","The information required by Regulation G regarding non-GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release and slide presentation and both documents are available in the Investors section of our corporate website, corporate.mattel.com.","Before we begin, I like to remind you that certain statements made during the call may include forward-looking statements relating to the future performance of our business, brands and product lines. These statements are based on currently available information and they are subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.","We describe some of these uncertainties in the Risk Factors section of our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K, our 2019 Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, our earnings release and the presentation accompanying this call, and other filings we make with the SEC from time-to-time, as well as in our other public statements. Mattel does not update forward-looking statements and expressly disclaims any obligation to do so, except as required by law.","Now, I like to turn the call over to Ynon.","Ynon Kreiz","Thank you everyone for joining our third quarter earnings call. We had another strong quarter, as we continue to make consistent progress in our strategy to transform Mattel into an IP-driven, high-performing toy company.","Before we get into further detail on our results for the quarter, I would like to briefly discuss the two other announcements we made today. As you know, in August this year, Mattel was made aware of a whistleblower letter, the letter which have been sent to our external auditors PWC questioned whether there were accounting errors in historical periods and whether PWC was independent.","In response, Mattel\u2019s Audit Committee launched an independent investigation into the allegations. That investigation is now complete and it determined that in terms of financial impact, income tax expense was understated by $109 million in the third quarter of 2017 and over stated by $109 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 with no impact for the full-year. Accordingly, we will amend our 2018 Form 10-K to restate the last two quarters of 2017 and certain related information. Please refer to the press release for more detail.","The error was non-cash, did not affect operating income or EBITDA and had no impact on our full-year financials for 2017 or subsequent periods. As a result of the investigation, the company has also determined that it has certain material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting. The company is taking remedial actions to address these issues as well.","As to the question of PWC\u2019s independence, the Audit Committee concluded that the objectivity and impartiality of PWC has not been impaired, and that PWC can continue as our independent auditor. PWC agrees with that conclusion. We also announced today that our Chief Financial Officer, Joe Euteneuer will be leaving the company after a transition period of up to six months. We are conducting a search for his successor as CFO. We appreciate Joe\u2019s important contributions to the company since he joined two years ago and look forward to continuing to work with him during the transition period.","With that, let me now turn to Mattel\u2019s performance for the quarter. We remain focused on execution and are on track to achieve our goals to restore profitability and regain top line growth in the short to mid-term and to capture the full value of our IP in the mid-to-long term. Some of the more notable financial highlights compared to last year include the following. Gross sales are up 3% as reported and up 4% in constant currency, adjusted gross margin improved 390 basis points, adjusted operating income improved $21 million, adjusted EBITDA improved $50 million, and adjusted EPS improved by $0.08. Year-to-date, operating cash flow has improved by $218 million.","Progress in structural simplification has significantly exceeded our original target. As of the end of the third quarter, we achieved $826 million of run rate savings and expect to exceed $854 million by the end of 2019. This was the fifth consecutive quarter where we achieved year-over-year improvement in profitability across all key metrics. This was also the second quarter in a row where we achieved revenue growth as reported and the third quarter in a row in constant currency.","It is worth noting that the last time we saw back-to-back quarterly revenue growth was in 2013, which was our record revenue year. Based on the performance to date and the momentum exiting the third quarter, we are raising our guidance for the year and now look to deliver adjusted EBITDA in the range of $400 million to $425 million.","Looking at gross sales in constant currency in the quarter, we grew in five out of the six categories where we operate. This includes dolls and vehicles categories where we are global leader, as well as the Action Figures, Building Sets, and Games categories where we are a challenger.","The dolls category was up 7%. Barbie gross sales increased 12% marking eighth consecutive quarters of growth for the brand. There was strong consumer demand globally across the Barbie line with excellent product, marketing, and retail activation. Polly Pocket, which was relaunched in 2018 and competes in the small doll segment also achieved double digit growth.","American Girl launched several growth initiatives at the end of the third quarter and while sales for the quarter were down 14%, this is a significant reduction in the rate of decline, compared to the first half of the year, and we continue to leverage our creative and innovative capabilities with the introduction of two new lines, the BTS and Creatable World dolls.","The BTS partnership is a great example of how Mattel can identify cultural trends and rapidly bring them to market around the world. Creatable World has had an overwhelmingly positive response demonstrating once again Mattel\u2019s thought leadership, ground-breaking creativity, and societal impact.","Our infant, toddler, and pre-school category was down 10%, largely due to expected revenue declines in Fisher-Price Friends. Sales in Fisher Price core, the largest component of the category continued to improve and were down less than 1%, including the 3% impact of the inclined sleeper recall. This is compared to last year\u2019s decline of 6%.","We achieved positive sales growth internationally and are confident about the continued improvement and progress in Fisher Price core. Fisher-Price Friends was down as we continue to right-size our third-party licensing portfolio. Power Wheels was also lower due to the declines in certain licensed products.","Thomas & Friends declined as we\u2019re simplifying the product range and look to turn the business around in 2020 when we celebrate the brand\u2019s 75th anniversary. Our vehicles category grew 15%, driven by a 27% increase in Hot Wheels. The growth was partially offset by the decline of Disney\u2019s CARS and Universal\u2019s Jurassic World vehicles post the movie launch years.","Hot Wheels continued to remain the industry leader and is on pace for record sales this year. Hot Wheels Monster Trucks are performing exceptionally well. This is a new segment of the brand and the consumer response to the product line as well as live events has been very strong. And we have expanded distribution of our innovative Hot Wheels ID line through target following its second quarter launch at Apple stores and itd debut on Amazon during Prime Day.","This is a great example of our ability to innovate classic product lines and provide unique experiences combining physical and digital play. Action Figures, Building Sets, and Games together grew 13% marking the third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth for this challenger categories.","Action figures was driven by Toy Story 4, which continues to do very well following the movie's release. MEGA had another positive quarter in the Building Sets category, providing innovative product offerings and competitive pricing, while expanding its global retail distribution. Our Games category grew across all regions, driven by card games with UNO and Face 10.","We are confident about the trajectory of our performance in this area. And while not in the quarter, we have seen a very positive response to the launch of UNO Braille in partnership with the National Federation of the Blind, reflecting our values of inclusivity and our ongoing commitment to purposeful play.","Looking at gross sales in constant currency by geography, we saw growth in three out of four regions. Overall, growth has been broad based across channels, customers, and brands. North America was down less than 1%, including the 1% impact of the inclined sleeper recall. The international segment was up 13%. EMEA grew 15% versus a decline of 8% in the same quarter last year. This is despite the industry being down in the region this year.","While European retail in general continues to face several challenges, we are gaining share through successful partnerships, execution of our channel strategies, and improved omnichannel capabilities. Latin America continued its strong growth and maintained its leadership position with sales increasing 10%, driven by the region's largest markets Mexico and Brazil, and Asia Pacific was up 15% versus last year's decline of 38%. This was achieved through growth across our top three countries, Australia, China, and Japan, as well as through strong results in Southeast Asia.","Tariffs have had a de minimis impact on our results and are not expected to have a material impact for the rest of this year. We have worked very closely with our retail partners to prepare for the potential implications of tariffs in the short-to-mid-term. We continue to monitor trade negotiations and assess the potential effects on the industry retailers and consumers. ","As we approach this holiday season, we believe we are well positioned across all our categories and regions with innovation throughout the entire portfolio. We have increased our presence on many of this year\u2019s holiday top toy list and have several new products, brand launches, and marketing campaigns to amplify retail executions. ","We have also continued to make strong progress in our mid-to-long-term strategy to capture the full value of our IP with three key developments on this front. We announced a live action film with Paramount and multiple academy awards winners, actor Tom Hanks and screenwriter Akiva Goldsman to develop a feature film based on Major Matt Mason. ","We also announced a partnership with Academy Award Nominee Daniel Kaluuya and production companies 59% in Valparaiso to coproduce a live-action film based on Barney, Mattel's iconic purple dinosaur. This is the eighth theatrical movie project that Mattel films has announced.","Additionally, we reached an agreement with Netflix for the production and distribution of a Masters of the Universe Animated Series to be produced by actor and filmmaker Kevin Smith.","In closing, our third quarter performance demonstrates the continued momentum of our multi-year turnaround and consistent progress in transforming Mattel into an IP driven high performing toy company. We are executing very well on our strategy to restore profitability, delivering the fifth consecutive quarter where we achieved improvements in reported operating income, EBITDA, gross margin and EPS.","We are starting to see positive revenue trends with growth for the second quarter in a row as reported and for the third straight quarter in constant currency. And we continue to make meaningful progress in laying the groundwork to capture the full value of our IP. We are encouraged by this momentum as we remain focused on execution and the creation of long-term shareholder value.","Now, I would like to turn the call over to Joe who will cover the financials in more detail and give you updated guidance based on our recent performance.","Joe Euteneuer","Thank you, Ynon and good afternoon everyone. I like to provide you more detail on our third quarter results and updates to our 2019 full-year guidance. As Ynon shared, gross sales were up 3% year-over-year as reported, and up 4% in constant currency. We also drove meaningful growth this quarter in five of our six categories and increased sales in three of our four regions.","Our 3% growth in the quarter included a 1% to 2% benefit from increased direct import sales. While this benefit effectively shifted sales from the fourth quarter into the third quarter, we still had growth, even absent this shift. As always, we work closely with our retail partners throughout the calendar year and make adjustments based on market conditions.","We believe growth in direct imports reflects retailer's confidence in our product innovation and service level, as well as their improved visibility into the retail environment post Toys \"R\" Us. Reported gross margin was 46.3% of net sales, up 370 basis points from the 42.6% in the third quarter of 2018. ","Adjusted gross margin was 46.9% of net sales, up 390 basis points from the 43% in the third quarter of 2018. The significant improvement in adjusted gross margin was primarily driven by structural simplification savings. Advertising as a percent of net sales was 11.5%, which was flat year-over-year. We continue to apply a disciplined approach to advertising focusing on greater utilization of digital platforms and content.","Reported SG&A was $366 million, an increase of $40 million or 12% year-over-year. While we realized incremental structural simplification savings of $23 million, and incurred lower severance and restructuring expenses versus Q3 2018 these benefits were more than offset by several factors. There was $47 million increase in incentive compensation, due to improved business performance year-to-date.","Accordingly, we are recognizing our full-year incentive accrual expense more evenly between the third quarter and fourth quarter relative to 2018. Additionally, Q3 2019 did not have the benefit of the $13 million of Toys \"R\" Us bad debt recovery that we booked in Q3 2018. And we booked $3 million of additional fulfilment and legal fees this quarter associated with the inclined sleeper product recalls.","Year-to-date, we have expensed $8 million of SG&A related to the recalls. Year-to-date, across the P&L in total we have expensed $34 million related to the recalls before taking into consideration the $30 million to $35 million in revenue reduction. To the extent there are additional recall related costs in the future, we will provide updates accordingly.","Adjusted SG&A was $351 million, an increase of $51 million or 17%. The year-over-year increase in adjusted SG&A was due to the incentive compensation accrual timing and the absence of the 2018 TRU bad debt recovery, partially offset by the $23 million of incremental realized savings from structural simplification.","Adjusted operating income was $174 million, an improvement of $21 million or 14%, compared to prior year. Year-to-date adjusted operating income has improved $272 million over last year's adjusted operating loss of $225 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $248 million, an improvement of $15 million, compared to the $232 million in the prior year. Year-to-date, adjusted EBITDA has improved $252 million over last year's $16 million.","The improvement in both adjusted operating income and adjusted EBITDA year-to-date was driven by revenue growth and structural simplification savings, which improved both margin and SG&A. Before moving on to the balance sheet, I'd like to note that separate from the whistleblower matters we also elected to revise 2019 in prior periods for certain unrelated immaterial, out of period adjustments which do not require us to amend previous filings. ","Nonetheless, these adjustments will be reflected in the 2019 third quarter Form 10-Q and the amended 2018 Form 10-K, as well as the financial history page on our investor relations website. ","Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the third quarter with a cash balance of $218 million and our cash position net of short-term borrowings improved by $54 million versus 2018. We ended the third quarter with $230 million of short-term borrowings under our ABL credit facility.","Accounts receivables decreased 2%, despite higher sales in the quarter and resulted in a four-day reduction in days sales outstanding to 78 days. Owned inventory decreased 3%. We continue to tightly manage our inventory and partner with our retailers to ensure that they also have the right inventory levels. We believe our owned inventory and our retailer inventory levels are well-positioned for the remainder of the year.","Moving on to cash flows. Year-to-date, cash flows used for operations improved by $218 million to $514 million, primarily driven by our lower net loss, excluding the impact of our non-cash charges. Year-to-date, capital expenditures are $76 million, compared to $111 million last year.","As Ynon said, at the end of the third quarter we have already achieved $826 million of structural simplification and run rate savings, exceeding our target of $650 million, well ahead of schedule. And we expect to achieve more than $854 million of run rate savings by the end of 2019. Some of the savings we previously expected to realize in 2020 will now be accelerated into the 2019 P&L.","As a result, we expect to benefit from $303 million of realized structural simplification savings this year of which $272 million will benefit adjusted EBITDA. We are also continuing to implement our capital light model, which includes not only to the optimization of our manufacturing footprint, but our entire supply chain. We will share key developments as they are executed subject to competitive and confidentiality considerations.","In the third quarter, Capital Light resulted in $16 million of severance and restructuring expenses. We expect additional implementation costs to impact the P&L in Q4 with benefits beginning in 2020. We continue to make strategic investments to grow the business and improve profitability.","In the third quarter, we spent $23 million on strategic investments, compared to $9 million in the prior year. Investments classified as operating expenses were $18 million, a $9 million increase over the prior year. These were primarily related to our IT transformation and brand growth opportunities.","Year-to-date, we have spent $50 million on strategic investments, compared to $27 million in the prior year. Year-to-date investments classified as operating expenses were $36 million, a $9 million increase over the prior year. Clearly, the year-to-date results demonstrate meaningful progress across all of our financial metrics.","With that in mind, let me provide you with our improved guidance for 2019. Starting with gross sales, for the fourth quarter, we expect gross sales to be down slightly, due to continued foreign exchange headwinds, fewer holiday shopping days, compared to last year, a more competitive marketplace and the timing impact of direct-to-import sales in Q3.","For the full-year, given our positive revenue performance year-to-date, we are raising our original guidance and now expect full-year gross sales in constant currency to be up slightly versus the prior year. Given the low single digit negative impact from foreign exchange, we expect full-year gross sales as reported to generally be flat versus the prior year. Achieving this will be a major accomplishment and an important milestone in the turnaround after five consecutive years of revenue decline.","Sales adjustments are not expected to change significantly and will continue to be in-line with the prior year as a percentage of sales. We expect adjusted gross margin for the full-year to improve by approximately 100 basis points above our year-to-date margin of 42.9%. This is driven by additional realized savings from structural simplification and lower anticipated inflation.","Advertising expenses for 2019 will increase year-over-year and are now expected to be roughly 12% to 13% of net sales. In the fourth quarter, we expect a significant increase in the dollar amount and percentage of spend, driven by the timing of strategic investments related to digital content.","Adjusted SG&A is still expected to be down both on a dollar and a percentage of net sales basis. The expected savings from structural simplification and the benefit of $32 million of Toys \"R\" Us net bad debt expense recognized in 2018 will be partially offset by our annual merit increase and general inflation.","In addition, we anticipate incurring higher incentive and equity compensation, driven by improved business performance. As a result of these factors, we expect the total adjusted SG&A for 2019 to be just over $1.3 billion, a $75 million to $100 million reduction from last year.","Given the positive factors I just discussed, we are raising our adjusted EBITDA guidance to $400 million to $425 million. This would more than double 2018\u2019s adjusted EBITDA. The increase in adjusted EBITDA guidance is driven by structural simplification savings, which improve gross margin and SG&A, as well as increase revenue. Relative to our regional structural simplification target, the program is delivering both greater savings in total and more realized savings in the 2019 P&L.","Additionally, while we are experiencing product cost inflation, we expect it to be lower than our original guidance. These benefits to adjusted EBITDA will be partially offset by higher advertising expenses, as well as additional SG&A, primarily driven by higher incentive compensation. Adjusted operating income for the full-year is now expected to be positive at year-end.","Looking beyond operating income, interest expense is still expected to come in marginally higher than in 2018. And as it relates to taxes, the guidance we discussed earlier this year has not changed. We still expect income tax expense of approximately $75 million to $100 million.","Turning to the balance sheet and cash flows. As we restore profitability, we continue to expect to achieve positive cash flow from operations this year for the first time in three years. We still expect the change in net working capital to be approximately neutral. Capital expenditures are expected to be in-line with 2018.","We remain confident in our capital structure, which includes the ABL credit facility and that we have sufficient liquidity to both run the business efficiently and to make strategic investments to grow. At the appropriate time, subject to market conditions we plan to return to the debt market to refinance the $250 million of senior notes maturing in October 2020.","Turning to strategic investments, we still plan to spend approximately $100 million as originally guided with roughly 70% now expected to be operating expenses. In closing, the company's great performance in the third quarter and year-to-date along with our ongoing consistent execution will allow us to continue to drive value on a going forward basis.","Ynon Kreiz","Thank you, Joe. Before we begin Q&A, I want to point out that we will not be addressing detailed accounting questions related to the whistleblower investigation at this time. We will file an amended 2018 10-K addressing these accounting matters, as well as the 2019 Q3 10-Q on or before the November 12 filing deadline for the 10-Q. As Ynon mentioned, information regarding the accounting matters can be found in the press release made available today. We will schedule a call to answer any questions you may have addressing the amended 10-K after its filing. We will now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Greg Badishkanian with Citi. Your line is now open.","Fred Wightman","Hi, guys, it's actually Fred Wightman on for Greg. I was just hoping you could dig into the direct import business in the quarter? I think you called out a 1% to 2% benefit. Can you talk about why you might be seeing such different trends in the direct business versus some of your peers in the market?","Ynon Kreiz","Hi. We are focused on our own execution in our own numbers, and we did see a strong performance in direct imports. As we said in the prepared remarks, we always work closely with our retailers throughout the calendar year and made adjustment based on the changing \u2013 on the market conditions.","We do believe that growth in direct imports reflects retailers confidence in our product, in our innovation and service levels. Also, they had improved visibility into the retail landscape post the Toys \u201cR\u201d Us situation. So, all in all, we did see an increase and believe we are suited to continue to support this part of the business.","Fred Wightman","Okay, thanks. And then I understand that you're starting to lap some tougher compares and you did talk about some of the pull-forward into 3Q, but if we just look at the implied guide for 4Q, is there anything in the market that's giving you some caution, or just seems to imply some pretty significant declines?","Joe Euteneuer","So, you\u2019ve got to remember, from an industry perspective, all of us are facing the fact that there are going to be fewer shopping days this year. From us, as a company, remember, we're in the midst of turning around American Girl, so we We feel the slight negative pressure in regards to our overall numbers because of American Girl.","And then from a fourth quarter perspective, we did see that 1 to 2 percentage \u2013 100 basis point shift from fourth quarter to third quarter on DI, and then finally you just have the impact of foreign exchange.","Fred Wightman","Perfect, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Felicia Hendrix of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Felicia Hendrix","Hi, there. Thanks so much. Just wondering, I didn't \u2013 I don't think I heard you guys go through any POS data or detail. So, maybe you can kind of walk us through that by segment would be helpful?","Ynon Kreiz","Sure. I could start. Joe, you can chime in. Yes, I mean, in general, we were really pleased with our POS. We particularly were very excited with our strength in the Doll portfolio. POS was up high-single digits in that category, clearly led by the success of Barbie which has been really terrific.","On the balance of the portfolio, also within vehicles, we had very strong performance in Hot Wheels, which was up, as we said, 27%, and the overall category up 4%. But see, as we continue to move through the quarter on our POS, the combined Action Figures, Building Sets, Games, our POS was up high-single digits, which was also really exciting in the context of our challenging categories.","And I think in the context of our challenge category, which is infant, toddler, and preschool, while we were down, we really feel very good about the Fisher Price core business, which outside of the recall was a good performer, in fact, would have been up-single digits without the recall. So, all in all \u2013 yes.","Felicia Hendrix","No, I was just wondering is that global or is that domestic? All of this POS data?","Ynon Kreiz","Yes, that's all global. That's all global.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay. So just \u2013 it looks like a lot of your growth came more from international in the quarter than domestic same as last quarter. But just kind of trying to understand more the domestic picture, and then also Hot Wheels you didn't give us the POS there?","Ynon Kreiz","Sure. Let me cover on the Hot Wheels piece of our business. Hot Wheels was very, very strong, globally up at 15% in sales, and POS was up high-single digits. And for the quarter, our North American business was down less than 1%, which also included the impact of the Fisher Price recall.","Felicia Hendrix","Right. But that\u2019s so in POS?","Ynon Kreiz","POS in North America was down low-single digits as a whole.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay, thanks.","Ynon Kreiz","And in\u2026","Felicia Hendrix","I'm sorry.","Ynon Kreiz","Yes, yes, actually, this is very in line with our expectation.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay, great. And then Ynon just getting back to the DI, can you just help us understand typically in your third quarter, what percentage of your business is DI versus what it was this year in the third quarter?","Joe Euteneuer","We don't provide this information specifically, but I can tell you there was no surprise and no disruption. This was in line with expectation and as we \u2013 as really, we were planning for, for the quarter.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay. Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Conder with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Timothy Conder","Thank you. Yes, just a couple gentlemen. I want to follow-on on the DI here. Ynon or Joe, whoever wants to take this, the shift was it all driven by U.S. year-over-year the increase in DI? Can you say that? And then any quantification that you can give us as the impact to gross margins from that?","Joe Euteneuer","Well, so there was no sort of regional basis on the DI. It was basically up just basically 100 to 200 basis points. It's a shift from fourth quarter to third quarter. The impact on the margin is pretty immaterial on it from a gross margin basis. Remember, this comes from the detailed planning that goes on by the commercial organization with all of our retail customers to understand whether they want direct or whether they \u2013 direct imports or whether they want to go trade. And everybody understands the difference that, when you go direct, you're taking on the inventory risk, but you're getting a slightly higher margin on it.","So, we work closely with our retailers to maximize the profitability and growth, and we had no unusual trends and pretty consistent on a year-over-year basis. And so, we feel pretty good about where we are at.","Timothy Conder","Okay.","Ynon Kreiz","I would also just want to add. Sorry, Tim, just one quick comment that the shift of 1% to 2% in the quarter from the fourth quarter to the third quarter, obviously, helped grow sales, but we would have gone anyway without it, because our growth, as you know, as reported, is 3% and 4% in constant currency. So, this is not in itself the reason that we showed growth in the quarter.","Timothy Conder","Okay. Okay. And then a couple of housekeeping, if I may, gentlemen. Richard, just wanted to double check in response to Felicia\u2019s question. The infant toddler preschool, can you repeat that POS number on a global basis?","Richard Dickson","Sure. The \u2013 let's see infant toddler preschool POS, sorry, POS, we were down low double digits worldwide.","Timothy Conder","Okay. And then, just a couple more housekeeping gentlemen. Anything you can tell us about the contributions to Dolls of the [KTF] and then Hot Wheels, anything similar there to the Star Wars contribution in the quarter?","Richard Dickson","Sure. We continue to show strength in the doll portfolio, as indicated certainly by the high single-digit growth for the category, and of course, largely led by the momentum that we have on Barbie. Our current trend has been really phenomenal. We're in our eighth quarter of consecutive growth year-over-year. By the way, seven of those quarters have been double-digit, and largely led by product and positioning, which we're really very, very pleased with linking Barbie to pop culture.","The continued growth that we have across the product portfolio extends in every segment, the family segment estate, fashion dolls, even our collector business has been very, very strong. Overall, in the other Dolls category, as Ynon mentioned. We\u2019re very pleased with creatable world, which was a phenomenal launch.","In fact, over the first few days of the launch, we had matching impressions to that of Barbie\u2019s 60th celebration. So, real valid indicator of not only our ability to launch new brands and garner great PR, but ultimately lead through innovative new brands. Polly Pocket continues to be one of our fastest-growing Doll brands.","It's actually the third fastest-growing Doll brand per global NPD. And BTS, as we mentioned as well, is really an exciting new part of our portfolio. The band is back on the road actually and has been touring in its third leg. We just released the Mini Vinyl collection. It's doing very well at retail and exceeding our expectations in that particular category.","A real quick mention, obviously, you asked about Hot Wheels. We're incredibly proud of the momentum that we continue to have on Hot Wheels, as we reported gross sales of 27%. It\u2019s a really impressive stat when you consider that we're up against the 50th anniversary from 2018. So, real indication that we're growing from strength to strength and it's really on a global basis.","So, very, very pleased. The marketing on that brand has been phenomenal. One of the key events called the Legends Tour continues to be incredibly successful in its second year and awesome new product line, probably the one of the most exciting sets new Colossal Crash, Downhill Race & Go, also and Monster Trucks as part of the drivers for this year. So, all in all, really powerful momentum on our most powerful brands.","Timothy Conder","Okay. No, no, thank you. I appreciate that. But just any, again, you guys are doing a great job. So, congrats there. But again, the BTS is new and then Star Wars had to be on shelf by October 4. So, on the die cast of vehicles there, any color you can give us on those two properties, in particular?","Richard Dickson","No, we'll go into the detail at that level. But as I mentioned, we're very excited about the products and the marketing across our portfolio and, in particular, in the Doll and vehicle category.","Timothy Conder","Okay. Okay, gentlemen, thank you very much.","Ynon Kreiz","Thank you, Tim.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from William Reuter with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","William Reuter","Good afternoon. My first question is, you mentioned that you didn't expect much impact from the tariffs. I'm wondering whether this was just due to the timing of when for A, and for B, you came in, or whether this was due to negotiations with both your retail partners and your manufacturers?","Richard Dickson","Well, so we have a combination of things going on. So, remember, list three \u2013 through list three, it's been de minimis for us. We've really had nothing to \u2013 any impact from it. In regards to going forward, we're not sure where it's ultimately going to end up and whether the December dates still going to hold, but we have done a lot of work with our retail partners to figure out ways to potentially mitigate the tariff if it does come into place.","So, we feel very good about the proactive reaching out to our retail partners and how to figure out how to minimize this to the extent possible. So, we feel as good as we can going into something that's still an unknown and can constantly shift. But to date through this three, which impacts us is basically de minimis.","William Reuter","Okay. And then just one follow-up. I \u2013 you guys have obviously done a great job cutting costs all over your P&L. As you guys think about what the gross impact of tariffs if they continue to go on as they are now currently sitting? I mean, based upon your conversations, do you have some sort of a big ballpark guess on what you think you could mitigate through actions?","Joe Euteneuer","We've not given that number out. It's just because it's such a moving target. And like you said, you can carve out those things and stuff. So, rather than get into the specifics of the actions we would take to help mitigate the impact, we just would wait and see sort of what the ultimate rule if it does come out, and then we can address it at that time.","William Reuter","Alright. Great.","Ynon Kreiz","I would add \u2013 I would just add that, that what Joe said that, we believe we are in a relatively better position than the overall industry average. With less than two-thirds of our toys that are sold in the U.S. imported from China versus an industry average of around 85%. We have developed contingency plans and have worked closely with the retailers to ensure that we\u2019re aligned on our approach to mitigate tariffs.","As you know, we are in the thick of designing an organization that this will become more flexible and can respond to exogenous changes, whether it's about China, or tariffs or any other parameters to change in our landscape. And as it relates to tariff, we do have several mitigating factors that will \u2013 or actions that we can take, such as price increases, working with alternative suppliers, working with our product development and procurement teams to optimize our product mix and sourcing options and also transition to different manufacturing structure, as I said, to give us the flexibility and mobility to optimize the outcome for us.","William Reuter","Yes. No, I asked, because the tone of your commentary is much more positive than others in the industry and it sounds good. Alright, thanks for taking the questions.","Joe Euteneuer","Thank you.","Ynon Kreiz","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Swartz of SunTrust. Your line is now open.","Michael Swartz","Hi, guys, good afternoon. Just wanted to ask a question quickly or as it relates to your guidance, it looks like EBITDA coming up \u2013 big part of that was a shift in realized savings, some of that stuff from 2020 coming into 2019. It looks like it's about $30 million to $35 million versus what you'd expected prior, maybe give us a little color on, I guess, what's behind that shift? And why \u2013 I guess, why it accelerated faster than you had anticipated?","Joe Euteneuer","I mean, the shift is really totally focused to execution. I mean, we meet on structural simplification savings every week. And our sole goal is to look at each one of these work streams and figuring out how to accelerate it sooner rather than later and what's standing in its way. I mean, it is a discipline that and Ynon and I have partnered on since we started this program. And we feel very good about where it's ending up and the execution we've gotten done to date.","Michael Swartz","Great.","Richard Dickson","And I would say, sorry, Michael, just to say that this is a project that has a lot of support and ownership by every constituent in the company. And as you know, after we exit 2019, there would be more savings coming from our Capital Light model. So, we're not done optimizing and driving efficiencies in the operations.","Michael Swartz","Maybe for Ynon. On just with regards to the Masters of the Universe Series for Netflix that you announced. Could you give us maybe a little bit of color on timing of that project and maybe how the economics work?","Ynon Kreiz","Yes. I can't get into the specifics on this one show. But in general, as you know, this is part of our mid to long-term strategy. And it's exciting to see the progress and the momentum we have in all of those deals, but it is meant to be a more mid to long-term.","With that said, the way these deals work is that, we do not take any financial risk. For the most part, we would be in profit as we enter any of these shows or projects. We typically control and have creative control or negative control. In other words, our partner cannot do anything or any material \u2013 take any material decision or make any material change to the creative framework of the property.","Our approach is to partner with the best creators out there for project by genre, and also with the best distributor for project by genre. And in the case of films or television, we typically would get a license fee that is tied into the property itself. We have producers\u2019 fees and there's also different forms of upside participation economically in the event of success with escalators.","So, all in all, we believe we have a very balanced model in terms of risk and rewards. And this is before you even get into the benefit we can drive from other \u2013 from lifting toy sales and consumer product sales. And you will see, as we said before, you will see more projects coming, both on the film side, as well as episodic content.","Michael Swartz","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Linda Bolton-Weiser with D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open.","Linda Bolton-Weiser","Yes, thanks. Just two questions. First of all, I think, when you were talking about your outlook for the fourth quarter, you did mention in your list of items like competitive environment. So, can you just give a little more color, I don't know if I caught exactly what you were referring to there? And then secondly, Ynon, you've done a lot. So far, you've done the cost savings, you started the process of turning around American Girl, you've set the stage for these movies, et cetera. What's the next phase so to speak? Is it pursuing Toy categories or not in? Is it doing more on the entertainment media side? Can you just talk about kind of what basic things are in your mind kind of going forward?","Richard Dickson","Okay. I\u2019ll let Joe answer the first \u2013 actually, Richard will answer the first question. I\u2019ll answer, I\u2019m sorry, anyway you can chime in. Linda, as always, this is a highly competitive category of business and the industry is always launching new innovation and ideas. As we approach the holiday season, we really do believe in our trends of suggesting that we are well-positioned to cross our categories and regions with a great degree of innovation driving the success so far across the portfolio.","We've increased our presence on many of the holiday toy list, which drive consumer interest and retailer credibility. We've got great \u2013 new products within brands and new launches, marketing campaigns and amplified digital dialogues to ultimately, amplify our demand creation model and retail executions. Most importantly, we work really closely around the world with our retail partners.","Our sales organization and retailer partnership is by our best-in-class, optimizing the various different demand creation and new product lovers to drive the business. And while we obviously compete in a more competitive industry in category, the new entrants to date, the digital dialogue that we have and the credibility that we have going into the fourth quarter is encouraging. So, we're bullish as we head into the last lap here and hopefully consumers will be as excited as we are about our portfolio.","Ynon Kreiz","And Linda, as it relates to your second question, as you know, we laid out a very clear and very focused strategy that has two phases, short to mid-term and mid to long-term. In the short to mid-term, our priorities were to restore profitability and drive top line growth. And I think it's fair to say, after five consecutive quarters of improving profitability and now three consecutive quarters of driving top line growth in constant currency, Toy as reported, things are working, the turnaround is working, and we are able to now show consistent, methodical progress quarter-after-quarter-after-quarter. And that remains our focus to continue to drive performance across these two priorities. At the same time, as you know, we are positioning the company to be able to capture value from our incredible catalog of franchises.","I think there\u2019s obviously a lot of momentum there, even though it's meant to be more long-term or mid to long-term. There is a lot of interest wearable to enter big projects with some of the world's most creative talent in each of the genres where we operate. So, it is exciting. There's a lot going on. There's a lot that going on behind the scenes. There's a lot going on that we haven't been able to share with you, but our focus is to remain very diligent and execute to the strategy quarter-after-quarter-after-quarter.","We're not celebrating victory. We have still an important quarter ahead of us. We want to do well for the year. And after that \u2013 after the end of the fourth quarter, we\u2019ll enter another year. But I think it's fair to say that we are now in a much, much better position than we were just a few quarters ago. Every day that goes by, we\u2019re improving our cash position.","As we said, we're going to be free \u2013 cash flow positive from operations this year, and we're not far from being free cash flow positive, as a whole. And when that happens, this will be an important juncture to mark the turnaround. But we are confident about where we are and remain focused on execution.","Linda Bolton-Weiser","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jamie Katz with Morningstar. Your line is now open.","Jamie Katz","Good afternoon. I wanted to hear a little bit about on the infant and toddler category. I know it was mentioned that there you're looking for a turnaround in that business in 2020. And I was wondering if there was some insight into efforts you might be taking now to help give us a little bit of confidence that this segment might improve and whether there might be some benchmarks, we can sort of look forward to follow the progress? Thanks.","Joe Euteneuer","Sure. Look, it is a tough category. You could look at the MPD data, and it's certainly the biggest category out there. But it's also one of the toughest categories out there. On Fisher Price, which is the largest brand within the category, you can see the improvement and the conversations that we've had start to formulate in proof points. We are on track for the stabilization of Fisher Price. And we're really starting to see some part of it \u2013 positive signs for the brand globally.","As I mentioned, if you exclude the recall, we actually would be up single digits in Fisher Price, which would have been a great report. But unfortunately, we obviously have had that recall, but we continue to strive and make some progress. If I tell you that there's a lot of indications, but what I would look at is product performance.","We're seeing great traction on some of the new product innovation launches that we've had, Linkimals, in particular, is off to a really strong start in the third quarter, and it's responding incredibly well to retail promotions in most major markets. We have a variety of other segments that we launched this year that are getting traction.","And as we head towards the fourth quarter, our new brand platform that we recently launched, Let's Be Kids in the U.S., which started at the end of September has gotten great traction to [Hero Brand] film with seven different product spots. We've gotten some really terrific retail partnership and activations that will continue around this campaign. Terrific retail payment events happening at Walmart, and certainly Target and great programs at Amazon, as well as our partnerships throughout the world.","Within the infant preschool category, our challenging brand is Thomas, which we talked about actively working to improve the product portfolio. One of the indications of this is, we're rolling out a singular core system of play, which combines both push along a motorized play on a single-track system. It's a lot of detail and I recognize that in the answer, but truth be told, we had various different tracks systems for Thomas, and we believe ultimately, actually, distracted the consumer from the actual system of play.","So, we're working very hard at strengthening the product portfolio, as well as continuing to build up our retail presence in merchandising, and new content. As Ynon mentioned, 2020 marks Thomas\u2019 75th anniversary. So, you can look for redefining content, new product and some great reveals that we\u2019ll share as time suggests. But ultimately, we believe in the category Fisher Price is a leading brand within the category and we will certainly report at the end of the year how our products and our portfolio performed.","Jamie Katz","Thank you. And then do you have any projection for where you expect our owned inventory to be towards the year-end? I know it was down sort of mid-single-digit rate this quarter year-over-year. Do you expect that to be down similarly at year-end?","Joe Euteneuer","Yes. I mean, right now we're looking at inventory to be possibly flat on a year-over-year basis. It's hard to predict exactly, because as you start closing out the year, you start positioning yourself for the first quarter. And so, we want to make sure that our retailers have the optimal inventory they need to kick off the New Year, along with the optimal inventory to close out this year strong.","So, it's a balancing act. But we are something that, as you see over the last couple of quarters, have really been focused on managing inventory, not only at our own locations, but at our retail locations and feel very, very good about our positioning for the back quarter of the year.","Jamie Katz","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from Arpine Kocharian with UBS. Your line is now open.","Arpine Kocharian","Alright. Thank you. It seems on clean comp basis, you still grew about 2% in Q3, excluding sales pull forward. I'm trying to understand what\u2019s corresponding global constant currency POS? I don't think I heard overall constant currency global POS number, apologies if I missed? And then I have a quick follow-up.","Richard Dickson","Yes. We did not give that number. We gave the global POS numbers, but not anything in constant currency.","Arpine Kocharian","So, what is\u2026","Richard Dickson","I think\u2026","Arpine Kocharian","\u2026global POS on overall portfolio, yes?","Ynon Kreiz","I would answer, Richard. Overall, our global POS in the third quarter was down low single digits worldwide. We had a mix of performance Dolls high single digits, as we mentioned, vehicles, mid low single-digit, action figures were up high single-digit, and by the way, those are constant currency my correction. Yes, so the POS numbers are in constant currency. Yes.","Arpine Kocharian","Okay.","Richard Dickson","Yes.","Arpine Kocharian","Okay.","Joe Euteneuer","And Richard is right.","Arpine Kocharian","\u2026and then\u2026","Joe Euteneuer","Okay.","Arpine Kocharian","Yes. Go ahead, sorry.","Joe Euteneuer","No, no, go ahead.","Arpine Kocharian","And I have a quick question for Ynon. I mean, given the potential tariffs enactment, is there any change to your asset late manufacturing strategy? I guess, what I'm trying to understand is, does it still make sense now to not own manufacturing in places like Mexico?","Ynon Kreiz","So, we are taking a comprehensive look without being prescriptive about certain actions. We did say before that in some cases, it would make sense to retain ownership of some factories. One obvious example is, Hot Wheels. For the simple fact that there is no one else in the world that can create \u2013 manufacture 550 million die cast cars a year at our level of quality and price.","So, we are taking a holistic approach. The objective is to have a modular, flexible model that will allow us to respond to changing conditions. And as I said, it's not \u2013 this is not just about tariffs or about China. This is generally to be able to respond and create an agile, competitive, dynamic organization that can optimize different scenarios. We have an excellent world-class supply chain team right now in place.","We feel very confident about the direction we are heading with our \u2013 within supply chain. We see supply chain not just as an opportunity to reduce cost, but also to drive top line. And we are hearing \u2013 we're getting accolades from our retail partners about the improvement in service levels and quality of performance that people that have been here before me said, \u201cWe haven't delivered in years.\u201d","So, we feel that this is now becoming a competitive advantage. Not that long ago, we used to be criticized that we're too big, we\u2019re too bureaucratic, too slow, too costly. We believe that size and scale is an opportunity, is an advantage and shouldn't be a distraction. And obviously, it's about the way you manage and leverage your scale and capabilities. And we believe we're heading in the right direction. We're not done. There's more work to do, but we're clearly heading in the right direction.","Arpine Kocharian","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Thank you. This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Ynon Kreiz for any further remarks.","Ynon Kreiz","Thank you, operator. And before we conclude the call, I just want to say a few additional words. We provided today quite a lot of information for you to digest between a very strong quarter, the conclusion of the whistleblower investigation and the announcement of a CFO transition.","I want to take this opportunity to thank, Joe, again for his important contributions to the company. And I look forward to continuing to work with him during the transition period. I also want to emphasize that the entire Mattel team remains focused on our strategies to restore profitability, regain top line growth and ultimately, capture the full value of our IP.","Our improved 2019 guidance demonstrates our confidence in the business and continued momentum that we are driving. We are encouraged by this progress and remain focus on execution within the creation of long-term shareholder value.","And with that, thank you all, and I\u2019ll transfer it over to Dave.","David Zbojniewicz","Thank you, Ynon, and thank you everyone for joining the call today.

We\u2019ll begin today\u2019s call with Chris, Richard, and Kevin providing commentary on our results, and then we\u2019ll take your questions.","To help guide our discussion today, we have provided you with a slide presentation. Our discussion and our slide presentation will reference non-GAAP financial measures, such as gross sales, adjusted selling and administrative expense, adjusted operating income, adjusted earnings loss per share and constant currency. Our earnings release also includes non-GAAP financial measures. The information required by regulation G regarding non-GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release and slide presentation. And both documents are available on the Investors section of our corporate website, corporate.mattel.com.","Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind you that certain statements made during the call may include forward-looking statements relating to the future performance of our overall business, brands and product lines. These statements are based on currently available information and they are subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.","We describe some of these uncertainties in the Risk Factors section of our 2015 annual report on Form 10-K, our 2016 quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and other filings we make with the SEC from time-to-time, as well as in our other public statements. Mattel does not update forward-looking statements and expressly disclaims any obligation to do so.","Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Chris.","Chris Sinclair","Thanks, Martin, and welcome everyone. I would like to thank you for joining us. Today I\u2019m going to lead things off with a brief perspective on the quarter and the full year, and then Richard and Kevin will each provide some additional details. And as usual, as Martin indicated, we will open things up at the end for any questions that you might have.","So let me begin by saying that overall we\u2019re very encouraged by the quarter, which reflected some continuing progress on our turnaround, and importantly kept us on track to deliver on our challenging 2016 topline objectives. We also made good progress against our cost reduction goals, both in cost of goods and in SG&A.","As you know, our biggest executional challenge this year is the offset the loss of Disney Princess. And despite continuing foreign exchange headwinds, our Q2 and first half results show that we have made great strides in this area. We continue to see positive and improving trends globally in our consumer takeaway. And our shipping is aligning with this favorable trend.","Encouragingly, we\u2019re also seeing some very solid performance in some of our key programs, with a strong uptick in Barbie and continuing strength in Fisher-Price and Hot wheels. We are also gaining some excellent traction in our Toy Box with our games and entertainment properties and with megabrands.","Now supporting these favorable trends, our focus on strengthening our brands with more effective positionings, advertising, and more competitive pricing and our rapid push in emerging markets is proving successful. We\u2019re also executing well and we\u2019re doing so broadly across much of our customer base.","In addition, we are quite gratified by the continued strengthening of our licensing partnerships, exemplified by our recent announcements with Universal on Fast And Furious and the Jurassic World franchise, both of which will give us some excellent opportunities to accelerate growth in 2017 and beyond.","Now as for the middle of the P&L, we also made good progress this quarter and we do remain on track to deliver on our cost targets. Our work to streamline and prioritize SG&A spending is progressing well. We\u2019re also capturing some significant supply chain efficiencies and cost savings. The offsets of course continue to be negative foreign exchange and unfavorable shifts in our brand mix, which are pressuring our gross margins. We expect these factors to remain a challenge as we navigate through the balance for the year. Kevin is going to provide some more perspective on both of these subjects shortly. So to sum up the quarter, it's a very good progress and on many fronts, and particularly against the difficult backdrop, and some strong external headwinds.","Looking ahead, the picture for the year is largely the same as what we\u2019ve previously outlined, with perhaps a few moderate puts can takes, and our momentum is setting up extremely well for the future. We expect the year-to-date positive trends in POS and shipping to continue. And we expect to see improving flow through on many of our cost savings initiatives. We also expect foreign exchange impacts will begin to moderate somewhat, offset partially of course by mix, which will remain a challenge. So overall, our strategies are gaining traction and are helping us to drive the topline to right size our cost structure and to fund investments in brand building, commercial excellence and emerging market expansions. We\u2019re also managing our balance sheet well and we\u2019re continuing to fund our dividend.","So in summary, I remain optimistic about the year. But with the bulk of the year still in front of us, I do want to urge a little bit a caution as we still have a lot of work to do. With that as the setup, let me turn things over to Richard, who is going to highlight some of our topline progress and our core initiatives. Richard?","Richard Dickson","Thank you, Chris. So as Chris mentioned, this year we have both the challenge of overcoming a significant revenue gap, and the opportunity to position Mattel for growth in 2017. The Q2 results and the effectiveness of our execution throughout the first half of the year are demonstrating our ability to do both, excluding the year-over-year impact of Disney Princess. Global POS is up mid-single digits for the quarter and year-to-date, with solid results across the majority of our brands and comparable sales in constant currency are up high-single digits for the quarter and year-to-date.","We have almost completely offset the year-to-date Disney Princess shortfall, reflecting strength across a number of brands, licenses and geographies. This performance is significant in many ways, indicative of our ability and potential to further build momentum into the second half of the year.","So let me briefly touch on some specifics, starting with our core brands. We are pleased with Barbie\u2019s reassurance with global sales and constant currency up 24% in the quarter and up 11% year-to-date. This is the result of a return to the fundamentals that make this brand continuously relevant, including a clear and motivating positioning that is inspiring to girls worldwide, very effective execution throughout the organization and growing momentum, fueled by increasing cultural significance.","Consumer confidence in the brand is increasing. This is evidenced by continued enthusiasm for the new fashionista line, the I Can Be Content Marketing, the success of our new younger girls\u2019 segment Dreamtopia, stronger brand equity scores, and a sharp uptick in pop culture references to Barbie. Retailer confidence is also up, demonstrated by increased shelf space. And licensor confidence is building as we renewed our Barbie content distribution agreement with Universal in the quarter.","The entire Mattel organization took on the challenge to reset the story brand and has made tremendous strides in a very short period of time. And with the Barbie team now set up in running, we are obviously gaining traction. In the back half of the year, you\u2019ll see us build on Barbie\u2019s success across the Board, as well as deepen the brands connection with moms worldwide. ","Fisher-Price, with a renewed emphasis on the early childhood development, continues to grow, with global sales in constant currency up 6% in the quarter and 7% year to date. Brand progress is largely the result of a concerted effort to build strong valuable relationships with parents worldwide, rooted in great product and motivated brand values. We\u2019re building on the momentum of the largest Fisher-Price Segment Baby, by engaging with moms in innovative and meaningful ways in the digital space. The brand\u2019s very successful Film By You campaign will be enhanced by our new gold medal moments initiative in the fall. ","In product, we continue to emphasis innovation, creating developmentally forward ideas like our hit Code-a-Pillar for a vast and growing segment of parents who are eager to expose stem learning early on. We\u2019re building fresh momentum in our Fisher-Price friends line, driven in part by new Nickelodeon licenses. Hot Wheels. Hot Wheels POS and shipping trends continue to be very strong with global POS up double digits year-to-date and sales in constant currency up 9% year to date. We expect to build on this in the second half of the year, with new and exciting products, some of which, we\u2019re previewing this week at Comic Con. And while we continue to build a strong component of the business with our DC Comic, Marvel and Star Wars license, the success of our basic car and playsets should more than offset challenging comps going into the fall. ","Thomas POS also continues to be strong, with global POS also up double digits in the quarter and year-to-date. Brand strength, particularly in key emerging markets should continue as we introduce twelve new charters later this year. This impressive new line up of culturally diverse characters is the most significant evolution of the brand in quite some time and will create excitement, global relevance, enhance collectability and numerous other opportunities for the brand.","Monster High, as you know has persistent challenges. Nevertheless, Monster High remains the number two doll brand worldwide and a brand with strong consumer engagement. We\u2019re seeing some success with new product offerings and scales that are expanding play times; shelf space challenges unfortunately offsetting new gains but we\u2019re working hard to capture those spaces. We\u2019re looking to reboot this brand in the second half with new entertainment and product offerings that emphasize the core characters and the origin story.","With American Girl, we have strategic plans in place to rejuvenate the brand and achieve its full potential. With these plans focused on the second half, we\u2019ve not been surprised by the brand\u2019s year-to-date performance, where reduced promotions and a shift in spending to the second half negatively impacted sales as we expect a better return on the spending in the second half. ","The first of these new major American Girl brand initiatives is our recent introduction of WellieWishers. We are encouraged with the results so far. While WellieWishers provide an opportunity to expand the American Girl experience to a younger girl, we remain committed to older girls and will launch our latest historical character Melody, this August. Look forward to a lot more news regarding American Girl and will be coming out this quarter and next and we're excited about the strategies in place to provide new ways for girls and their families to engage with the brand.","Now moving on to Toy Box. Licensing is demonstrating continued strength, particularly our Warner Brothers partnership which will benefit from this week's release of Batman versus Superman DVD, as well as expanded distribution of our successful DC Superhero Girl line. As Chris mentioned, Mattel is now a key licensing partner with NBC Universal for their Fast and Furious and Jurassic World franchises, which will begin to roll out next year. These are exciting wins for us and we believe that this is only the beginning of a much bigger partnership with Universal going forward. ","A major focus of our Toy Box capability is developing innovative and insightful category expertise to accelerate brand growth, and we are thrilled with the growth Toy Box is driving for our construction brand MEGA, as it gains scale globally. MEGA sales in constant currency are up 22% in the quarter and up 42% year to date. MEGA has proven to be a strategic driver of organic growth, expanding play patterns for many of our brands, notably Monster High and American Girl, and we will continue to mine the great potential in MEGA going forward.","Invention and brand creation are our other key priorities at Toy Box, and these are areas emphasized in the last year. Our latest invention is a new brand called My Mini Mixie Q's; a highly differentiated execution into the growing mini collector figure market that demonstrates our new speed to market capability and our expertise in girl play. We're pleased with the strong early reads and I look forward to updating you on future calls.","Now as we move toward the most significant part of the year, I'm encouraged with our progress, the growing traction for our brands, and our significant wins in licensed partnerships. Significant challenges remain but we are meeting these head on while we create major new opportunities for growth. We said our success this year will largely be a function of Mattel's ability to overcome a unique and significant revenue gap. We're increasingly confident that we have the momentum to do just that, given the alignment of a very talented organization and the continued strong performance of key core brands, Toy Box and emerging markets. We will continue to look to stabilize our business this year and create a solid foundation for growth in 2017 and beyond.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Farr. Kevin.","Kevin Farr","Thank you Richard and good afternoon everyone. As Chris and Richard said, despite the impact of foreign exchange, we continue to execute well on our topline, and we made significant progress on our cost savings programs, which help offset some of the ForEx headwinds in the middle of the P&L. As a result, our overall performance is in line with our expectations for the quarter and the first half.","Before going into some of the details, I\u2019d like to remind everyone that unless otherwise noted, I'll be referring to gross sales in constant currency in order to provide better visibility into the underlying topline trends. And in order to provide more transparency into the fundamentals of the business, I will also reference some adjusted financial results that exclude certain non-recurring items related to the acquisitions of MEGA, Fuhu and Sproutling as well as severance related to business transformation and cost saving initiatives. As always, reconciliation to GAAP numbers are provided in our press release and the slide deck. I also want to take a moment to discuss the impact of Brexit on our business. Since it occurred so late in the quarter, Brexit has a minimal impact on Q2 results, and assuming the continued uncertainly doesn\u2019t further impact financial markets or the consumer economic outlook, Brexit will only have a modest impact on our full year results. Based upon current trends, we believe the negative impact from foreign exchange will be roughly $0.02 to $0.05 of EPS for the year related to Brexit. ","Now moving to the highlights and topline trends; gross sales were down just 1% in the quarter in constant currency and down 4% as reported. On a year-to-date basis, gross sales were 1% down in constant currency, and down 5% as reported. Gross sales were up in North America and Asia Pacific with Latin America down 7% and Europe down slightly at 2%. ","Finally, on a year-to-date basis, we continue to see strong growth in key emerging markets like China and Russia, and as Richard mentioned the underlying trends look even more favorable when we exclude Disney Princess, and we remain quite confident that we\u2019ll achieve our full year goal of relatively flat net sales in constant currency.","Moving to the rest of the P&L, while we continue to invest in the retail promotions and work more closely with the retail consumers in support of our ongoing turnaround efforts, sales adjustments were 9.1% in the quarter, versus 9.8% in the prior period. Year-to-date sales adjustments for 9.3% versus 9.7% as we continue to see positive POS trends in our core brands and Toy Box. ","Our reported gross margins in the second quarter were 45.3%, with ForEx once again the major driver of the decline. If the year-over-year impact of foreign exchange is excluded, our gross margin rate was relatively flat to Q2 2015. The other key driver declining gross margin rate in the quarter was mix with a strong growth and profitable with lower margin brands like MEGA and Fisher-Price and a shift away from our higher margin doll business. Overall, the negative impact of foreign exchange and mix was partially offset by our cost savings initiatives and the strategic pricing of our 2016 product line. ","Moving beyond gross margin, advertising was lower as we continue to move closer to 12% for the full year, coupled with the benefit from foreign exchange. We also remained disciplined in S&A with adjusted SG&A being down by approximately $17 million or 5% in the quarter and down by $43 million or 6% year-to-date. These results were due in part to cost saving initiatives which more than offset expected wage inflation. As described in this slide deck and Company's earnings release, please note that we now include MEGA acquisition related amortization expenses, and in our adjusted SG&A numbers.","Importantly, we are still on track to deliver at the high end of the $250 million to $300 million range for our two year funding the future cost savings program. We delivered approximately $31 million in gross savings in Q2 and $77 million year-to-date. Finally, adjusted EPS for the second quarter was a negative $0.02 per share or negative $0.06 per share as reported. As it relates to our balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the first half of the year with $318 million of cash. This was in line with our expectations and reflects solid performance as we continue to tightly manage working capital. Not surprisingly, owned inventory and balance sheet was up year-over-year as we positioned the business to deliver in the second half.","Finally, we continue to reward our shareholders by deploying capital in a disciplined manner and maintaining dividend. As we\u2019ve said, dividends remain our first priority after re-investing in the business, and the Board declared a third quarter dividend of $0.38 per share, which is flat compared to third quarter of 2015. As many of you know, we have some debt coming due this year. Given current rates, we have planned to refinance the $300 million of senior unsecured debt that is maturing in November of 2016. So overall our balance sheet remains strong and we expect to end the year with cash of $800 million to $1 billion.","One final note regarding foreign exchange. Given the significant volatility in the foreign exchange rates over the past 18 months, we recently conducted a thorough review of our approach to quantifying the impact at each element of our P&L. As result of these efforts, we reclassified some forecasted foreign exchange benefits that were previously embedded in product cost. Importantly, this reclassification does not change our total gross margin expectations for the year or funding our future cost savings targets. However, it does result in the moderately lower ForEx impact on margins and earnings. For the full year we now expect the negative impact of foreign exchange and net sales would be 2% to 4% and EPS will be at the below end of our original $0.30 to $0.40 per share outlook when you include the impact of recent events like Brit Exit.","Looking forward, and summarizing our current 2016 outlook, we\u2019re still targeting relatively flat net sales in constant currency for the year. Similar to last year, we expect second half sales to be more weighted to Q4, due to the timing of our promotional efforts and our marketing spend, the timing of new product and distribution initiatives and how retailers are likely to tightly manage the inventory leading up to the holiday season.","And as Chris mentioned, while we expect the negative impact to currency to lessen in the back half for the year, we see additional challenges, primarily mix continuing. While these challenges will partially offset by strategic pricing, supply chain efficiencies, and cost savings initiatives, we recognize we\u2019ll likely come up a bit short to our 2016 gross margin outlook. At this point, we believe gross margins for the full year will be around 48.5% with ForEx headwinds and mix driving a majority of the decline. However, with additional sales volume, improved mix and more cost savings dropped in the bottom line, we expect gross margins will improve sequentially in the second half of the year. That means the second half gross margin of about 50%, which is roughly equivalent to what we achieved in the second half of 2015.","More specifically, for the third quarter we expect the step up in margin versus the second quarter to be similar to our historical averages around 300 basis points, driven by the seasonal scale our revenues relative to second quarter, less headwind from foreign exchange, slightly better mix and incremental supply chain and other cost savings initiatives. We expect the fourth quarter gross margin to be in line with our historical averages. The expected improvement over Q3 will be driven by our girls\u2019 properties gaining momentum, less impact of Disney Princess and we get incremental flow through due from our supply chain and other cost savings initiatives.","Finally, it's important to mention that our long term objective remains to achieve about 50% gross margins in the future. Shifting to SG&A, while the impact of including MEGA amortization adjusted SG&A increases the 2015 SG&A base to 1.465 billion, we continue to target adjusted SG&A to be down $55 million to $65 million versus last year\u2019s $1.448 billion adjusted SG&A baseline. The year-over-year impact of adding the MEGA amortization back into adjusted SG&A is $9 million. This target reflects the full absorption overhead related to Q1 acquisition of few Fuhu and Sproutling, where we are aggressively pursuing cost savings opportunities across the Company to absorb the bulk of overhead from those acquisitions. This change in the treatment of MEGA amortization does not impact reported SG&A.","Finally, looking beyond this year of transition, in addition to the ongoing brand momentum and new initiatives that Richard covered, we expect 2017 to benefit as we leverage Fuhu and Sproutling technology platforms across our portfolio and expand our market opportunities. We also have a tailwind on the topline revenues from Cars 3 movie and continued traction in China, Russia and other emerging markets. Further, we have a strong revenue pipeline for growth in 2018 with our entertainment lineup of Toy Story 4 and Jurassic World. As we previously stated, we continue to see an ability to approach more normal operating margins in 2017 and beyond. Overall, we view the second quarter results positively and continue to focus on the turnaround and setting up the business for sales and profit growth in 2017 and beyond. We look forward to updating you on the progress throughout the rest of the year.","We will now open the call up for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instruction] We will be taking our first question on line of Drew Crum from Stifel. Your line is open.","Drew Crum","I wonder if you could quantify point of sales for Barbie. During the quarter you mentioned that shipments were up 24% ex-currency. What was the consumer takeaway for that brand?","Richard Dickson","Hi, Drew. It\u2019s Richard. We have seen great consistency in the U.S. with our POS up double digits in the U.S. for the second quarter, and up single digits in international. Globally we\u2019re really obviously pleased with the performance. It was some licensing revenue realized in the second quarter with our partnership with Universal. That being said, we still have strong shipping numbers and the POS is certainly commensurate with that. Lastly, as I mentioned in my remarks, we\u2019ve had some great space increases in the second half, which we have obviously started to ship into as part of the Barbie sales play.","Drew Crum","Okay. And Richard, could you comment on the competitive dynamics you are seeing in the doll category generally? Has that changed from what you saw last year and are you anticipating any change as you get into the second half of this year?","Richard Dickson","You know the fashion doll category always in back half has certainly strong elements at competition. There could always be a surprise here there. This year I think really in particular that the shocking [ph] brands has been very successful. It continues to be a trend particularly in the small doll category that is capturing girls\u2019 attention. Clearly, we\u2019re competing now with the Disney Princess franchise. But in particular I would say the strength of the Barbie brand and it's renewed positioning, the additional marketing and merchandising and execution that we\u2019ve done to get that brand to be more culturally relevant has seen a resurgence and we\u2019re feeling confident with our plans on that brand in particular. As I mentioned, of course Monster High, we have a lot programs in place in the back half. It still remains, as I mentioned again, the second largest fashion doll business in the world. I continue to be bullish on the brand as intellectual property as engagement remains consistent and in fact increasing. As we get more pronounced in digital apps and storytelling, our websites and entertainment continue to attract girls.","And last but not least, we\u2019re really pleased with My Mini Mixie Q's as an early start, going after if you will, the small doll collectable space. That is obviously a trend in the market. So overall feeling confident of our positioning in the portfolio, and as we continue to expand the DC Super Hero Girls line to the mass markets, we think that we\u2019ve got a great lineup for the back half. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line Felicia Hendrix from Barclays. Your line is open. ","Felicia Hendrix ","Kevin, you gave us some nice color on your outlook and particularly at growth margins. I just -- if we could just, revisit your gross margin forecast, which seems to be revised; can you just expand upon your prepared remarks regarding the rationale for that change?","Kevin Farr","Yes. I think the rationale for the change is it\u2019s difficult to predict but at this point we believe that mix will be a bit more challenging to the full year. That said, we expect to see incremental, sequential improvement in gross margin in the second half. As I said in my prepared remarks that to achieve that we need a 50% gross margin for the balance of the year. That\u2019s consistent with what we delivered in 2015 and you look at what\u2019s going drive it, I think sequentially in the third quarter, we\u2019re going to see a step up consistent with our historical averages of about 300 basis points, and the biggest driver of that is really the scale of our business.","The third quarter is twice the size in general of the first quarter, first and second quarter separately. And then I think also we, as we talked about and Chris mentioned, we see less of a headwind in Forex. We see mix getting slightly better in the third quarter, and then also we see the cost savings flow through in the third quarter that we achieved in manufacturing in the second quarter. There\u2019s about one quarter lag in production and the time we sell it. And also our other cost savings initiatives that impact gross margins.","And then in the fourth quarter we see getting back to the historical levels, and the biggest driver of that incrementally is better mix as result of -- as Richard just said we see in the holiday season, our doll portfolio performing better, Barbie, DC Super Hero\u2019s and American Girl, and that\u2019s going to be the biggest driver to increase sequentially gross margins in the fourth quarter. Along, again, we\u2019ll see more flow through of supply chain savings and other cost savings initiatives around the Company.","Felicia Hendrix ","Okay that\u2019s helpful. ","Chris Sinclair","Felicia, it\u2019s Chris. If I can just add just a parenthetical here; look, if you stand back from it all, I think the broad stroke is, we\u2019re very close to where we thought we were tracking. I think foreign exchange is about what we were expecting. If anything though, we\u2019ve been struggling a little bit more on the mix side, and the good news is the revenue has been strong. But the mix has been a little off. So we\u2019re trying to flag a little prudence here for you. I think that\u2019s that biggest shift we\u2019re seeing as we forecast the balance on margin. ","Felicia Hendrix ","When you say struggling on the mix, does that just mean that some things are more fluid than you had expected before, because like last quarter you had attributed the mix headwinds to boys and infant pre-school and this quarter you\u2019re talking about MEGA and Fisher-Price. So it sounds like mix is a bit fluid.","Chris Sinclair","I think that's fair. I think those are the elements that are driving strong, and we've been a little soft on the doll business, which is obviously higher margin. So some of that will probably continue through, even if it improves the balance of the year.","Felicia Hendrix ","Okay, helpful. Richard, can you just walk us through your decision to pick up the Jurassic World franchise. Hasbro didn\u2019t speak very favorably about that. It's a franchise that seems to drop off precipitously in a year following a movie. So just wondering, I'm sure you guys have plans to make it more of a sustainable brand, if you could talk about some of your thoughts there.","Richard Dickson","Yes, we are thrilled to win the Jurassic license, and believe there's significant opportunity to grow this business; certainly, given our global scale and expertise. But the storytelling themselves, obviously the penetration of the property, and frankly dinosaurs in general are a proven play pattern for a very long time. Our license includes multi-categories and obviously a great lineup for 2018 and beyond, and it emphasizes obviously our continued partnership with Universal. As we mentioned, Fast and Furious is also an announcement that we made that we're pretty excited about. I think in general it adds a perfect new brand to our portfolio. We're very excited about the partnership with NBC Universal. It's a great team operating there that we're incredibly synergistic with, and I think certainly as the teams get started on creative development we're truly excited about what the opportunities lay ahead for 2018 and beyond.","Chris Sinclair","Let me just add Felicia, this is one -- this is clearly the flagship franchise for Universal and it was a highly competitive process. It was one that was highly sought after. I think we feel excellent about the fact that we were awarded this, and given the opportunity we see huge upside to it. So I just would want to make sure this doesn't get characterized as a difficult franchise or one that was maybe there for the picking up. This was a highly, highly competitive process and one where it was highly sought after. So we're ecstatic about it to be honest with you.","Felicia Hendrix ","Well that's great and congratulations. And then just housekeeping. On Cars 3, just are you still expecting that to generate $350 million in revenues next year.","Richard Dickson","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Arpine Kocharian from UBS Investment Bank. Your line is open.","Arpine Kocharian","So ex-Disney mid-single digit POS is pretty encouraging for the quarter. But I wanted to address for a second the sustainability of it into the second half. As you look into the second half of the year and sort of compare shelf space gained or not gained, both in core brands and Toy Box related products, could you give an indication where Mattel is in terms of what retailers are indexing for the back half. Because you saw a step up change perhaps in Q4 of last year right. So in terms of retailers\u2019 willingness to take in more, you've talked about better shelf space this year versus last. Could you just talk about general retail setups as you look into the second half? Overall, great quarter. Thanks.","Richard Dickson","Sure, I'll start, and then maybe Chris can add some color to it. Space ebbs and flows with POS performance, and certainly if you take a look at our core brand performance overall, we've had really consistent delivery of consumer takeaway, particularly with core brands like Barbie as we mentioned, which has had a really strong resurgence and certainly performance this quarter and POS continues to obviously get retailers more confident, and us more confident in the opportunities for that brand. But across our core brand portfolio we've been quite pleased with the continued space increases along with POS. ","In addition to that, in the fourth quarter, particularly during the holiday period, a lot of the space increments are out of aisle placements, and those are obviously highly competitive spots, but we are aggressively pursuing those with our retail partners with great promotional programs and added marketing that justifies getting that space, and I think we are commensurate if not equal to last year, and in some cases ahead of last year. We've have a terrific commercial organization that executes around the world, around space in increments and they've done a terrific job lining up the fourth quarter promotionally programming wise to get that space. ","Arpine Kocharian","That's great. And then I have a follow-up on Barbie. Richard, is it possible to breakdown whether Barbie would still up double-digits if you were to exclude the licensing revenue or perhaps you could just give us the licensing revenue?","Richard Dickson","Barbie would be up double-digits, excluding the licensing revenue. As I mentioned, we had a very strong quarter in Barbie, in general both in shipping and POS, and yes it would be up double-digits excluding the licensing revenue.","Arpine Kocharian","And would you say that strength is driven by core dolls versus Fashionista? How would you sort of breakdown that double digit gain?","Richard Dickson","Sure. Actually Fashionista it is core dolls. Fashionista is within the line architecture of Barbie, the fashion dolls segment that we have renewed obviously with body types as well as ethnic diversity. Good news is we\u2019re seeing that piece of the business grow tremendously, in fact just basic core dolls with the Fashionista cultural noise and new introductions has gained enormous traction. In addition to that, which we kind of classified more as the fashion segment of our business, as you know, we introduced a new segment to the younger girl called Dreamtopia, which has a lineup of both doll and accessory along with content and various other forms of IP extensions, that has resonated incredibly well. In fact, the younger girl segment of our business is growing exponentially much faster than we had anticipated. We we're really pleased with Dreamtopia\u2019s connectivity and we believe it's a segment that's going to continue for quite some time. Last but not least, the estate strategy within Barbie is always a really key component of our back half strategy, with Dream House and Campers and various different other accessories that out of lot of volume and certainly marketing ability for the brand. So we are lined up well for the back half and Fashionista is certainly gaining more and more traction around the world.","Arpine Kocharian","Fantastic, and just one more to squeeze in. Regarding DC Super Hero Girls, if you could just address, you obviously rolled it out globally, starting from July and end of June exclusivity with target ended. If you were to sort of look full year potential from that property, would you say you are incrementally more positive or right about in line what you were thinking that property could do for the full year, because that also dollar-to-dollar offsets Disney Princess margin still?","Richard Dickson","We had -- as you know, we've been working on this project for quite some time. We had high expectations for it and they continue to meet our expectations. We're getting more and more excited about not only the product lineup and the connectivity that we\u2019re seeing consumers have with the brand, certainly indicated by POS, but the cultural message ultimately have grown and the franchise if you will under DC Superhero with girl characters that could be extended for years, represents a really significant new branded piece of our girl portfolio that we are extremely excited about.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tim Conder from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Tim Conder","Thank you. Gentlemen, I wanted to circle back on the gross margin and mix has just been slightly weaker in the dolls than you anticipated many days ago. Is that -- can you characterize that as being due to within a doll brand, or are we talking about among the doll brands? So against the ladder it would be maybe Monster High, maybe your expectations got lowered a little bit there, or is it something maybe mix within the like Barbie brand itself, the sub brands within that? A little more color on that please?","Richard Dickson","Yes, it's probably more related to Monster High and I was contracting year-to-date. That\u2019s impacted that gross margin outlook on the doll princess.","Tim Conder","Okay, and then I think Chris, you said that from an FX perspective, that it come in pretty much as we anticipated 90 days ago?","Chris Sinclair","I think that\u2019s right. Kevin alluded to Brexit. We really don\u2019t know. At this point that looks pretty de-minimis. So we\u2019re probably tracking pretty close to where we were on overall ForEx. I think he indicated some of the adjustments we have made in allocation, but the impact is still basically the same.","Tim Conder","Okay. And then Kevin, in your announcements of the geographic areas, and this is nothing new. Brazil for a lot of industries has been a problem child area, but when from your perspective in Mattel\u2019s business -- are we getting close to that bottoming and this would seem the only area where there might be just a hair of inventor mentioned on the slide that -- how do you see that timeline unfolding in Brazil? There is an impact to Latin America is a whole?","Chris Sinclair","I'll take that Tim. Look; Brazil is obviously the continued soft spot. I\u2019d throw Venezuela in there but it's kind of down to a rounding this point, but I think Brazil has probably got a few or couple of more quarters to get through from our perspective. The good news is currency is stabilizing. I think some of the retail problems we had with credit and so forth hopefully are bottoming out. So I would expect as we get through this year Brazil will become hopefully not as much of a factor if you will. The good news is other parts of South America are doing quite well, Mexico is holding up and part of the South Carolina. So that\u2019s probably our biggest soft spot at this point.","Tim Conder","Okay. And then gentlemen, just from a definitional perspective, we get this from clients a lot, when you say relatively flat, any type of range or parameters you can put on that plus or minus, are we talking like 50 bps or whatever? And thank you again for the color on the gross margins in the preamble and in the answers here.","Chris Sinclair","Nobody here seems to be stepping up to this one. But look what we try to say, we want to kind of hold it flat in constant currency. That\u2019s still our objective and I think we\u2019ve been close. We\u2019re getting more confidence in it. So I think that\u2019s still a fair target for all of you.","Operator","Thank you our next question comes from the line of Linda Bolton-Weiser from B. Riley and Company. Your line is open.","Linda Bolton-Weiser","Can you give us some color on whether the DC Hero Girls distribution beyond target, how materially in the quarter or is that shipment into the channel more happening starting in the third quarter?","Richard Dickson","Hi Linda, its Richard. No, I wouldn\u2019t say materially helping the quarter. It does add more shipping in the third quarter.","Linda Bolton-Weiser","Okay. And then sort of getting back to the mix question, since that seems to be but everybody is interested in here. I guess I wouldn\u2019t have started out the year thinking Barbie sales would be up 20% or so. So that piece is clearly maybe even better than you expected. So when you put together the Barbie and the Monster High -- we all knew Monster High would be challenging. Are you saying that this kind of two things put together net-net is still coming in kind of a little below what you would have expected? Is that kind of -- and then therefore that\u2019s effecting the mix for the whole Company?","Chris Sinclair","I think Linda, it's a combination of things, but it's largely that Barbie is doing extremely well. I think as we look at the full year probably, hopefully a little better than we would have expected. Conversely, Monster High is softer than we had hoped at this point. I think it probably more than offsets the uptick on that side. Obviously we\u2019re building on American girls. So that\u2019s been a bit of an issue as well. So when you aggregate it, it's not a huge differential, but enough that we at least have been struggling through it the last quarter, so and we just want to make sure that we don\u2019t get out ahead of ourselves. If we keep driving success with some of these girls\u2019 properties, we would hope that becomes maybe less of an issue. But at least we thought we would flag it.","Richard Dickson","Yes, I think also the other thing -- the positive thing, we're seeing greater growth out of MEGA than we anticipated, as well as in Fisher-Price. So more of this also relates to that fact that we\u2019re seeing good growth there and somewhat a little bit less in dolls, but overall it's going to have a slight impact to the year on gross margins of 48.5%.","Linda Bolton-Weiser","Right. And then again not be the debt horse here, but on the Monster High, would you say that relative to your expectations, is the short-term more on the shelf space situation or the POS?","Richard Dickson","Well, generally the two go hand-in-hand. In many cases that the brand presence also defined by space can help promote POS. Much of the retail decision consumers make is actually in the aisle. That being said, as you know, we took a strategic direction to edit the character assortment that we had in Monster High, which was a strategic intent at the same time that we are losing some shelf space. We are also seeing some traction in a concentrated effort on the core characters. Our new mini collectibles are obviously gaining traction as I mentioned and there are some other products in there that are giving us great encouragement to believe that actually as the brand resets itself with new product offerings, that POS will be commensurate. Again, we are putting a lot on the back half ultimately with the reboot of the content strategy, which sort of talks to the origins of the brand again. We are introducing the brand to the whole new generation of girls, frankly, which is an opportunity that we have in our business that's particularly unique, and we are pretty confident that our -- the brand is resonating with consumer engagement and connectivity. We just need to get that connectivity back to merchandizing. And certainly once we get that POS back on track, you could be sure that, we will aggressively pursue commensurate space. ","Linda Bolton-Weiser","Okay, and just Kevin on the SG&A, I didn\u2019t quite catch the $55 million to $65 million reduction year-over-year is off what base now for 2015?","Kevin Farr","It\u2019s off the adjusted base before the change that we made with respect to the treatment of MEGA related intangible amortization. So I guess, what -- the headline here is, look our target remains the same, to reduce our SG&A, adjusted SG&A by $55 million to $65 million, based upon using the original base of $1.448 billion. And then I think with regard to that calculation, you then would have to add back $9 million to your estimate because we\u2019re going to include MEGA intangible amortization in SG&A. And that\u2019s really to comply with SEC guidelines about non-GAAP reporting. We consider this to be less non-recurring, because we do have amortization expense. But if you look at this change in amortization expense for MEGA, overall reported SG&A will not increase. ","Linda Bolton-Weiser","Okay, and sorry if I missed it, but on the Jurassic license, did you say there actually would be some shipments in sales in second half \u201917 or not till 2018?","Kevin Farr","I wouldn\u2019t count on that. The movie comes out in 2018.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gerrick Johnson from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Gerrick Johnson","On MEGA, what\u2019s left in international distribution? Is it flowing fully through the Mattel infrastructure at this point or do you still have some distributor agreements to switch over?","Chris Sinclair","I think we\u2019re pretty well in a heavy rollout everywhere at this point, Gerrick. And a lot of the growth we\u2019re saying is driving through some of the international expansion. ","Gerrick Johnson","Right, okay. And then American Girl WellieWishers, what level of concern might you have there that that sub-brand could affect the pricing you have with the core doll?","Richard Dickson","Gerrick, it\u2019s Richard. There\u2019s a lot of differences between our core brands, particularly in historical segment in the context of sort of how it compares to WellieWishers. WellieWishers is designed to appeal to a younger girl, very specifically. The content itself, books and episodic animated series are geared towards younger girls, characteristics of friendship, empathy, kindness and so forth. It is positioned very differently than the core brand and so we believe that these can sit complementary to each other. Almost as an entry price point, an introduction to the American Girl franchise. ","Chris Sinclair","We\u2019re tracking it very carefully and it\u2019s clearly two weeks into it, but early reads are very good and incrementality looks very high. So we\u2019ll have more to report but, early signs are very positive. ","Gerrick Johnson","Okay great and just quickly, have you run the Barbie You Can Be Anything advertising internationally yet? Or when does that occur? Thanks. ","Richard Dickson","We have started to do that. The bulk of that programming is going to be happen in the second half, in addition to which you\u2019ll start to see different takes of that program in the U.S., with some great media marketing planned for the back half as well. So that will continue, not only growing out, but also taking new cues and creativity, particularly in the U.S. ","Martin Gilkes","Operator, I think we have time for one last question.","Operator","Okay, our last question for the day will come from the line of Jim Chartier from Monness Crespi Hardt. It wasn't long enough. Your line is open.","Jim Chartier","I noticed the funding of future initiatives, you increased the cost savings by $15 million this year versus last quarter. Is that able to offset any of the incremental SG&A from the MEGA amortization.","Chris Sinclair","Yes, Jim, that's what we've been working on. I think Kevin's reporting on a couple different initiatives here. One is the Funding The Future, where we are at the top end and I think he's reporting some of the -- the positive numbers there. We've been driving well beyond that though to get more cost out of the system, and that's the area where we're looking to cover some of the incrementality of our acquisitions.","Jim Chartier","Okay. And then, recently you guys mentioned you thought you could approach the low end of the 15 to 20% long term operating margin target next year. Given kind of the gross margin reduction in expectation this year, do you still think that's possible?","Richard Dickson","Yes, I think so. I think the first thing that's going to drive that is scale, and I think the addition of Cars 3, and that incremental $350 million is going to help us, because that's going to leverage our scale in both gross margin as well as you know I think as we look at 2017, we want to make progress in moving gross margins higher and I think we'll do that with better brand statements and better leverage. And then again we're continuing to lean into cost both in the supply chain and across the back office. So I think with regard to my comments, I indicated that we do expect in 2017 to deliver more normalative profitability and that means moving towards that 15% to 20% operating profit as a percentage of sales.","Chris Sinclair","Keep in mind Jim, to get any stability which we seem to be getting on foreign exchange, it becomes a lot easier for us to kind of manage the cost and pricing equation than it has been. So that's another plus as we look to next year.","Jim Chartier","Great. And then my last question, you mentioned some drivers of sales for 2018, Toy Story, Jurassic World and some core initiatives. Is Toy Story, is that big enough to offset an expected Cars decline from '17.","Richard Dickson","Yes, Toy Story is a huge toy franchise, and in particular historically been very significant. So the lineup actually is perfect in the context of sort of looking at lapping volume, but we're really excited about the potential of Toy Story, and as we know it early on, we'll be able to build an even more robust program.","Kevin Farr","And I think you add Jurassic World on top of that, and I think history would say that Cars in the second year usually does fairly well. So I don't think you'll see the decline in Cars as much as we do other movies in 2018.","Richard Dickson","And to add to it for one second, just because we haven\u2019t really talked about it enough, but our partnership with Warner Brothers is significant and laps again in 2017. We have Wonder Woman and Justice League and we extend that into 2018 with additional DC major theatrical releases, which are gaining incredible traction. So we are as we\u2019ve said positioning ourselves for great long term growth.","Martin Gilkes","Great, there will be a replay of this call available beginning at 8 p.m. Eastern Time today. The number to call for the replay is 404-537-3406 and the pass code is 35334734.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode, later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference; Mr. Martin Gilkes, Head of Investor Relations. Mr. Gilkes, you may begin.","Martin Gilkes","Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me today are Chris Sinclair, Mattel's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Richard Dickson, Mattel's President and Chief Operating Officer; and Kevin Farr, Mattel's Chief Financial Officer. As you know, this afternoon we reported Mattel's 2016 full year and fourth quarter financial results. We'll begin today's call with Chris, Richard, and Kevin providing commentary on our results, and then we'll take your questions.","To help guide our discussion today, we have provided you with a slide presentation. Our discussion and our slide presentation will reference non-GAAP financial measures, such as gross sales, adjusted gross margin and adjusted gross profit, adjusted selling and administrative expense, adjusted operating income and loss and adjusted earnings and loss per share as well as constant currency. Our earnings release also includes non-GAAP financial measures. The information required by Regulation G regarding non-GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release and slide presentation, and both documents are available on the Investors section of our Web site, corporate.mattel.com.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that certain statements made during the call may include forward-looking statements relating to the future performance of our overall business, brands and product lines. These statements are based on currently available information and they are subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.","We describe some of these uncertainties in the Risk Factors section of our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, our 2016 Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and other filings we make with the SEC from time-to-time, as well as in our other public statements. Mattel does not update forward-looking statements and expressly disclaims any obligation to do so.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Chris.","Chris Sinclair","Thank you, Martin and welcome everyone. I want to thank you for joining us on short notice. We decided to accelerate the earnings release because of our commitment to transparency which we know is important to all of you and because of the uncertainty coming out of the holiday season. And today as usual I'll lead things off with a perspective on both the full year and the quarter and then Richard and Kevin will each provide additional details. And as customary we'll open things up at the end for any questions that you may have. Okay, so let's begin.","It\u2019s fair to say that this was a very difficult quarter, characterized by a significant category slowdown led by the United States and by increased foreign exchange headwinds. The key holiday period saw a significant decline in industry sales growth and while the trend of the consumer coming out later isn't surprising, the pattern this year was much more dramatic.","The result of this slowdown and shift in sales led to a significant increase in retail discounting and pressured shipments, particularly in December. Now in this difficult environment I think we've performed pretty well in some areas, but we're clearly disappointed in others. On a positive front, we did overcome a significant revenue challenge for the year.","We continue to see very solid growth with our key core brands in the quarter. We also continue to perform well in our priority emerging markets and here it's important to note that excluding Disney Princess in the quarter, our POS growth was very much in line with the industry. We also continued to manage our overhead cost very tightly.","On the down side our gross margins were significantly impacted by an elevated sales adjustment and by heavier discounting in some markets as we responded to the evolving conditions. We were also impacted by foreign exchange headwinds and by the fact that we fell a bit short of our own internal shipping expectations. Not surprisingly the poor margin results did impact cash from operations, which Kevin is going to address in his remarks in a few minutes. So in summer, as we look at the full quarter -- the full year and the quarter, we see a continuation of good performance against our key brand, market and cost priorities, but a very difficult result on gross margin.","Now shifting to 2017, we continue to feel that we're still well positioned for a good year of performance. With the late December pickup in POS our inventories are moderately elevated, but within a manageable range and we're in good position on programming and support with our key retail partners to move it through the channel. We also have a very strong line up of entertainment properties, continued momentum on our key core brands and an excellent set of initiatives kicking in in our priority emerging market China.","We'll also continue to drive strong cost and productivity initiatives to support our growth and to help rebuild margins and we anticipate capturing a bit more in pricing as well. And finally, at this point we remain comfortable with our cash outlook for the year and the board has authorized the continued funding of the quarterly dividend.","Now before I hand the call over to Richard and Kevin I would like to welcome Margo Georgiadis to the Mattel organization. While the industry slowdown did not allow us to end the year on a most positive note, we have made some excellent progress on the strategic priorities that the board and I have laid out as part of our transformation.","I firmly believe we've established a much stronger foundation with the right strategies, resources and capabilities in place for Margo to hit the ground running and continue the work. Her proven leadership and strengths [ph] make her an ideal candidate to lead Mattel going forward and she inherits a very capable leadership team including Richard, who will remain as President and Chief Operating Office, Kevin who remains as CFO. Of course, I'll continue to have an active role was Executive Chairman and will be supporting Margo and the rest of the team. As they drive the transformation. I'm very excite about this change and look forward to introducing you to Margo, as soon as she comes on board.","With that, let me now turn things over to Richard to highlight some of our top line progress and core initiatives. Richard?","Richard Dickson","Thank you, Chris. Well we knew going in that 2016 would be a very challenging year for us. In the midst of significant organizational change, we focused on the basics, prioritizing our core brands, leveraging license partnerships, and accelerating growth in emerging markets. And while recognizing the fourth quarter with financial results are below expectations, the progress that we made and what we achieved in 2016 is not just top line success, but a multitude of accomplishments which ultimately set us up well for the opportunity to grow in 2017. And I'll touch upon the few with these as we go through the results.","For 2016, full year growth sales were flat in constant currency and are down only 3% as reported. This does mean we covered the Disney Princess gap [ph] and offset the continued softness in Monster High. As we entered 2017, our Global POS, excluding the impact at Disney Princess remains solid, highlighted by very strong momentum in a number of our key core brands.","So let's start by taking a deeper dive into what happened to the industry in the fourth quarter, using the U.S. industry trends published by NPD. As Chris pointed out, while the overall toy categories started the year incredibly strong and ended the year up 5%, the pace of sales slowed and shifted in the critical holiday period, with the quarter finishing up only 3%. More importantly as the pace slowed in December the retail environment became much more cautious and we saw increased promotional activity and heavy discounting in the marketplace, which unexpectedly lead to delayed and reduced shipping. You can get a feel for how this unfolded when you look into the monthly NPD details. ","Industry sales in October were positive, but slower, compared to an earlier in the year. And November sales, which included the U.S. election, were positive with the slow start in the first two weeks, offset by a strong Thanks Giving and Black Friday. Then came December, where roughly a third of the entire years POS historically takes place, and as many of you know the first three weeks of December saw some of the steepest category declines of the year, which was likely the trigger for increased retail promotions and discounting that's slowed the need for additional shipping. ","So while the consumer did come out to the last two weeks of December aided by additional shopping days, it simply was not enough to offset the overall unfavorable holiday trends. This U.S. category slowdown has also been validated by recent retail reports and we feel it is a reasonable proxy for what happened in the global market.","So how did this category slowdown impact Mattel. Mattel's POS, excluding Disney Princess, was positive in October and November and very consistent with the category results. But as we moved into early December, we saw the dramatic drop in category sales and faced a very concerned retailer-customer base, as well as heavy promotional activity. As a result, we decided to proactively work with our retail partners to maximize the opportunity while the consumers were still in the store.","These efforts resulted in elevated sales adjustments as we supported additional discounting in some markets, new promotional programs and created additional shipping opportunities to leverage our strong POS trends. And while it is difficult to access the overall impact of these type of efforts in the moment, given the volume and pace of sales, we do believe they helped us to navigate this very challenging period. Because of the very short time frame we had to activate and execute these programs, we didn't know the financial impact until after yearend and ultimately as you could see in our results the category slowdown significantly impacted gross margin and our overall financial results.","Retail inventory was another area that was impacted by this. While the strong finish to the year helped some, our retail inventories are moderately higher in the U.S. and Western Europe. Fortunately, it is of good quality and composed of brands that continue to have positive POS momentum and we're working diligently with our retail partners to manage it down.","So let me take the remaining few minutes to provide a little more detail on the top line and POS. Now as I mentioned earlier full year gross sales were flat in constant currency and down 3% as reported which is consistent with year-to-date POS of roughly -1%. But excluding Disney Princess provides a much clearer window into the health of the underlying business and a view into why we are confident about 2017.","Here we see both global POS and worldwide gross sales in constant currency are aligned and up mid-single digits for both the year and the quarter and on a reported basis full year worldwide gross sales are up mid-single digits and flat in Q4. And finally, we did see positive and improving sales in constant currency in all three international regions in the quarter.","Let's take a look at sales performance from a brand perspective. Now as you know we began restructuring the organization in 2015 to focus on two separate, but related, business models, core brands and the Toy Box. We did this recognizing that core brands which are the essence of Mattel require a different level of expertise to connect marketing, content and product and bring it all to life, while Toy Box gives us the opportunity to return to our roots as the best partner for entertainment brands and to increase spend to market -- speed to market and promote invention as we make and market the greatest toys.","And while we still have work to do, our results in 2016 reflects incredible progress in both areas and that inspires me to believe that we are poised for a successful 2017 and beyond. As you know we spent significant time repositioning our core brands like Barbie, Hot Wheels and Fisher Price back to their roots as purposeful brands, new marketing, refreshed product and excellent execution led to one of the best years these brands have had in many years.","Barbie POS continued to be very strong, up double digits for the year, the quarter and the last six weeks, and despite a very challenging year over year comp where Barbie was up 8% in the quarter last year and the impacted category slowdowns, fourth quarter sales were still up 1% in constant currency with POS trending well above that. For the first time in three years, full year gross sales in constant currency were positive with 2016 ending up a very strong 9%, clearly Barbie is on the right track.","Fisher-Price continues to see strong results, with gross sales in constant currency up 6% for the year and up 2% in the quarter. Our emphasis on child development helped to deliver strong results in our key infant and baby gear [ph] lines and we saw a good performance with our Nickelodeon licenses, including the successful launch of Shimmer & Shine.","Global POS remains positive and very strong consumer takeaway internationally. Hot Wheels also continued to build strong POS and shipping momentum. Despite being up against a very challenging Star Wars comp, the core of the business basic cars and track sets continue to resonate. POS ended-up double digits for the year and in the high single digits for the quarter in the last six weeks, and shipping and constant currency was very strong. With sales for the year up 9% and an amazing 16% in the quarter. As we have consistently said Hot Wheels represents an enormous global opportunity and the work being done with this brand is really starting to show up in the financial results.","American Girl showed improvement with sales in constant currency up 4% in the quarter and ending the full year flat. Our new WellieWishers line continue to build momentum and everyone is pleased with the results from our new store partnerships. But while that was also moving in the right direction they are still below the expectations and highlight to need to refresh the product lines, improve the content and continue to explore distribution options. There will be more to come with this promising brand opportunity.","Thomas also grew with sales in constant currency up 3% for the year and 1% for the quarter, and we continue to see strong POS and shipping results in the international markets, where Thomas has tremendous potential. Unfortunately, we didn\u2019t see the improvement expected from Monster High. Full year sales were down over 41% in constant currency aligned with POS and we didn\u2019t see any significant change in momentum in the fourth quarter. But annual sales around the 190 million, it obviously has a following and we will continue to look at ways to stabilize the brand and prioritize our resources appropriately, there will be more to come at Toy Fair.","Now briefly looking at Toy Box, as you all know, this is where the Disney Princess brand resided [ph] and as a result represented our biggest challenge in 2016. We made up considerable ground with our Warner Brothers DC Universe executions as evidenced by our DC Superhero Girls and continuing strong demand for our Batman versus Superman products. We also did well with licenses from Microsoft, Universal and Sony, and also grew our own games business and launched the number of smaller brands in the year. ","MEGA held up pretty well against tremendous competitive pressure in the fourth quarter, with sales up 1% in constant currency and finishing the year up 15%. Full year sales were driven by the introduction of new properties and expanded global distribution, which remains a key strategy to the brand and as we continue to unlock it's potential. Shipping and POS grew significantly internationally, while performance domestically was also lightly impacted by tough collector comps in the quarter.","Before I hand it over to Kevin, I wanted to remind you that we believe success in 2016 would largely be a function of Mattel's ability to overcome a unique and significant revenue gap. As you recall we have consistently stated that our key 2016 objective was to fill a significant portion of the Disney Princess gap and offset continued softness in Monster High, and what we were asking the company to do was essentially replace about 600 million or 10% of total company sales in one year. In the midst of an ongoing transformation, reestablishing retail and licensing partnerships, punctuated by political and economic uncertainty, a category slowed down, foreign exchange headwind, and a cultural reset, we achieved that goal.","We essentially created a Top 10 toy company in one year's time. It's an achievement, I hope it doesn't get lost in today's news and despite a truly disappointing finish which is largely attributed to macro industry trend, I am proud of the entire Mattel organization and its enormous efforts right coursing this company and setting it up for a great year and a chapter of growth ahead. We now enter 2017 with an industry that is still growing, with our key core brands back on track and arguably with the strongest licensed entertainment slate that we've had in years. I hope to see you at Toy Fair in a few weeks and continue the discussion around a 2017 opportunities and beyond.","And now I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Farr.","Kevin Farr","Thank you, Richard, and good afternoon everyone as Chris and Richard said, while we achieved our full year goal of filling the Disney Princess revenue gap we fell short of aggressive expectations for the fourth quarter and unfortunately the impact of the category slowdown required us to take action which impacted margins and cash flow of the year. Despite this we continue to be disciplined in our management of the P&L by balancing our response to the category slowdown, increased Forex headwinds and slight mix changes with our cost savings initiatives. We successfully delivered at the high end of our two-year cost savings target with total gross savings of 295 million.","Today I'll walk you through our 2016 performance and then outline some broad expectations for 2017, but before going any further I want to remind you that unless otherwise noted, I'll be referring to gross sales in constant currency in order to provide better visibility into the underlying top line trends. And in order to provide more transparency into the fundamentals of the business I'll also reference some adjusted financial results that exclude certain non-recurring items related the acquisition of MEGA, Fuhu and Sproutling as well as severance related to our business transformation and cost savings initiatives. As always reconciliation to GAAP numbers are provided in our press release and the slide deck.","Since Richard walked you through a summary of the 2016 performance of our top line, I'll begin by focusing on other P&L drivers. Sales adjustments were 12% this quarter versus 8.5% in the prior year. The increase was driven by additional promotional activities in response to the toy category slowdown in the holiday season. Naturally, this type of investment is intended to lift sales, but ultimately, we do not know the impact of our efforts until after year end.","Our reported gross margins for the fourth quarter came in at lower than expected at 47% resulting in a full year gross margin of 46.8%. Elevated sales adjustments continued Forex [ph] headwinds and a slightly unfavorable shift in mix directly impacted the fourth quarter gross margin. Also, the gross margin was lower since we fell a bit short of our strong internal shipping expectations. We continue to partially offset these headwinds with strategic pricing and our successful cost savings programs.","As planned advertising with lower in both absolute dollars and as the percentage of net sales in the fourth quarter and full year, which was consistent with our expectation of 11% to 13% for the full year. We also remained disciplined with SG&A, as we continue to aggressively reduce cost, while balancing strategic investments. For the quarter adjusted SG&A was down approximately 58 million or 14% year-over-year. For the year, our adjusted SG&A of 1.4 billion was down a 106.2 million or 7%. The majority of the year-over-year SG&A savings came from our continuation of our cost saving programs. The balance of this savings relates to our successful efforts to tightly manage our overhead spending.","In addition, SG&A was lower due to lower incentive accrual as we are a pay-for-performance company. As a reminder, we set aggressive targets at the beginning of the year, including the full absorption of incremental overheads from our first quarter acquisitions of Fuhu and Sproutling, which were not contemplated when we set our original savings targets. As I said earlier, we achieved savings at the high-end of the 250 million to 300 million growth for our two year Funding the Future cost savings program. We delivered approximately 34 million of gross savings in Q4 and 142 million for the full year. ","Our tax rate for the full year was 22.4% including discreet items. The tax rate was slightly higher than we projected at Analyst Day. The tax rate increase is primarily due to a change in the geographical mix of profits and since we felt short of our strong profit expectations. Finally, adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter was $0.52 and $1.06 per share for the year compared to the prior year of $0.65 and $1.27 respectively. Currency had a negative impact of $0.10 per share in the quarter and $0.31 for the year.","Now turning to our balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the year with 680 million of net cash which was below our expectations, primarily due to higher working capital and lower operating margin results. We also continue to deploy capital in a disciplined manner to manage the business and reward shareholders. As expected capital expenditures were up slightly due to investments in tooling, plant automation and the expansion of our [indiscernible] capacity. Dividends also remained our first priority after reinvesting in the business, with the Board declaring a first quarter dividend of $0.38 per share, which is flat compared to the first quarter of 2016.","Obviously, our 2016, results would require us to reset expectations. We'll provide greater details to you on the key top line and P&L drivers at Toy Fair. What I can't say is, we still expect to see significant revenue momentum to be generated from a variety of areas. With continuing core brand momentum and incremental growth from our entertainment portfolio, which would be one of the strongest slates [ph] in the years and includes Disney Cars III which we expect to generate incremental revenues of about 300 million plus. ","Additionally, we should see some top line benefit from the strategic accelerators Chris discussed at the Analyst Day. However, the moderately higher level of yearend retail inventories will likely reduce our revenues in the first quarter and less than 2% impact for the full year 2017. We also looked to improve margins in 2017. We expect to see lower year-over-year sales adjustments. We look to expand gross margins by leveraging strategic pricing and a new supply chain cost savings initiatives. We will continue to leverage advertising especially given a higher concentration of licensed entertainment and we will continue to tightly manage SG&A.","As discussed on our November Analyst Day, the path to our 15% to 20% operating margin target will not be achieved within year. Clearly our 2016 results have created additional challenges and while we expect rebuild margins in 2017, it is likely that we'll get back to our operating margin target range in a couple of years.","In terms of cash flow, we expect topline growth and margin expansion as well as disciplined working capital management to generate significant cash flow in 2017. We'll deploy the cash to invest in the business to support the dividend which continues to be the priority going forward. In addition, we will continue to evaluate strategic partnerships and M&A opportunities that will improve our growth projection.","As we look ahead we remain committed to both the Company's long term financial objectives, disciplined capital deployment priorities and will use them as guides to manage the business going forward.","With that we'll now open the call to questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instruction] Our first question comes from Arpine Kocharian of UBS Investment Bank.","Arpine Kocharian","Chris, Richard, Kevin, a little bit surprising today that most important what I am having a hard time to understanding is the disconnect between very strong POS, your Q4 POS is above expectation, yet very disappointing bottom line results. If you could perhaps -- and I appreciate your detailed explanation on the cadence of sort of what happen in the quarter, but if you could just give a little bit of more detail, helping investors understand strong POS versus, such as sort of panic promotional activity that happened, industry wide, in the last sort of initially in December. Was it just driven by not seeing the traction you are expecting to see in the first two, three weeks of December and then it came out to be more than you expected or the holiday season overall, given that you are up mid-single digit on very tough comps year-over-year which is even slightly ahead of industry, what happened there? If you could just explain it a little bit more.","Chris Sinclair","Yes, Arpine it's Chris. Let me take a crack at it. I think Richard sort of give you a little bit of the perspective, but if you stand back and look at what happened in the industry in Q4, it's slowed fairly significantly and it's showed growth [ph] from a little under 3% when it had been running over 6% as we led into the quarter.","October and November were moderate growth months, but little below expectations, I think which is what started to create some stress at retail. Then as we rolled into the first three weeks of December the category actually went down precipitously and it was down about 7% for those three weeks. And I think that\u2019s when the retail environment became extremely turbulent.","We had enormous pressure put back on shipping expectations and forecast and I think we were faced with, do you react and try to get shipping in and protect that and get your product in for the consumers or do you take it on the chin. And we went through a fairly careful diagnosis of where we're better off and concluded we needed to get product on the shelves and protect the POS momentum.","And that's sort of what happened and it actually wasn't just the U.S. The trends in Europe and some of the other developed markets were very, very similar if you go to NPD you'll find they tracked actually quite close to what we tracked here. So it's a fairly broad based sort of circumstances that we're confronting. The market rebounded dramatically on Christmas week and actually sold about 20% of the quarter sales on that week alone which is well above what even the historic late sales have been.","And that's what basically saved the trends in terms of POS overall. But frankly by then it was too late, for the retailers and for all of us. And the good news is that it helped absorb some of the inventory, but the bad news is it came too late to truly affect any further shipments and also the discounting had already been sort of heavily under way.","Unfortunately, it's a fairly ugly end to the year, but as we exit I think the message was, we felt pretty good about protecting our POS, we feel pretty good about where our inventories are broadly and now we just have to kind of move back on and get focused on sort of the '17 agenda.","Arpine Kocharian","Thank you, I appreciate that. Is there a way to sort of give investors a little bit more clarity on how much of the strong sort of POS was driven by that discounting versus sort of underlying trends and a consumer that dramatically shifted towards the end of the holiday season which was again very dramatic when you look at the industry data? And then I have a quick follow up question actually.","Chris Sinclair","I can give you sort of my broad sense of it is that if you looked at the discounting trends for the industry in that period of time, they were pretty precipitous across the board. So, it wasn't a case of us being out their sort of a solo discounter and propping up our position, it was basically trying to be competitive in that environment and if anything, our level of discounting year-on-year was not as precipitous as the rest of the industry. Certainly, in the US numbers where we have visibility. So it clearly was a category issue that was occurring and I think, in that context I think we were as competitive as we could be, but certainly not out of line with what was going on.","Arpine Kocharian","No, that's very helpful thank you. And then in terms of looking into '17 you guys have previously given mid-single digit top line guidance, obviously, you'll update Toy Fair probably in a little bit more detail, but do you have any updates to that guidance?","Chris Sinclair","I think we're still in that Box Car [ph], So obviously, you're resetting the base to you on a lot of dimensions, but that's what we're working through right now and we'll share with you at Toy Fair. But we still feel very good about sort of the fundamentals underneath in the entertainment properties that we talked about and certainly our emerging market focus on China should be quite positive this year. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Conder of Wells Fargo Securities. ","Tim Conder ","Just a follow on, a little bit on the prior question here. I think you had said previously regarding 2017 top line outlook and granted Chris, what you just said that the base bars have been lowered here. But I think previously you had said somewhere up between mid and high single digits. And then Kevin in your comments you said you see 2017 being impacted less than 2% for a full year.","So, was that reference point up mid-to-high single digits for year-over-year growth and now you're saying that range comes off less than 2%, is that the proper way we should hear what you are saying?","Chris Sinclair","I think that's probably a fair way to look at it Tim. I mean we're still confident that we're somewhere in the mid to the up-middle range of growth, but we do have to work off a little bit of inventory in some pockets. That's probably more of the first quarter issue, but obviously, it effects full year.","Tim Conder","Right, and I think yourselves in the industry, yourselves and a major competitor have pretty good sell through last year in Q4 and then you refilled the shelves in Q1, so you got the kind of the combination of difficult Q1 compared paired with now you got to pull down some inventory in that, so Q1 won't look all that great, but in the whole scheme of things, it's obviously not that important to the full year. Is it fair? ","Chris Sinclair","Yes, it's probably fair. And I would point out, we have a fairly big portion Q2 with Cars [ph], so hopefully that gets trajectories back where they should be.","Tim Conder","Perfect, segway into the next question. So, Kevin you said over 300 million on an incremental basis. One, I think previously you guys have thrown out 350, so just to clarify that and then the incremental again just as to make sure that we're all on the same understanding here. That's incremental above what's you already did in Cars this year or is that 300 million selective in Cars or 350 million year-over-year?","Kevin Farr","Yes, it's off to base currently of 2016, so it's bigger than just 300 million. And the 350 million to 300 million really is Forex, as we convert it from the standard to U.S. dollars and it changes in foreign exchange rates post-election that turns into 300 million plus.","Tim Conder","Okay, and then on the operating margin commentary I think you -- and the goal was to get to the -- approach the low end, I think was the language you use, so about 15% to 20% in '17 and now you're saying a couple of years. Should we say that's maybe been pushed out a year, should we look to '18 directionally, is that reasonable?","Kevin Farr","Well, I think what I said in my comments and my prepared comments, was a couple of years. So, I think prior to that we would say it was 2018, but I think it's more like 2019.","Tim Conder","Okay, and last question I know this is a little bit of the elephant in the room, was the recent announcement, so I'll put it out there. Should we anticipate that the current management on this call and the new CEO who has been named, that that now constitutes the go forward, nothing is permanent forever, but for the foreseeable future management team outlook?","Chris Sinclair","Yes, I think I touched on that, Tim. That\u2019s the team and we have a -- I think you've seen a bunch of them at Analyst Day, we have a very strong team underneath. So, all of that is tracking and Richard, Kevin are still in Mattel [ph], I will be somewhat involved.","Tim Conder","Okay. Seems like good complimentary, simply as a talent. Okay, well thank you gentlemen appreciated.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Greg Badishkanian from Citi.","Greg Badishkanian","So, do you think you'll end Q1 with normalized inventory levels, and then how much you think the accelerated sales adjustments in Q1 and will that -- how much will that impact Q1 if it allows [ph] to go back, do you think that will continue into second quarter, assuming you have too high inventories entering into the second quarter, so when will this kind of discontinue in terms of the promotions, discounts, et cetera?","Chris Sinclair","Yes, I think -- I would expect, we've been pretty decent shape on inventory as we get through the first quarter. And it's really in pocket, so this is not a horrendous issue at this point. But as far as the allowances and discount, I think we expect that to kind of be back to normalized levels at this point. And remember a lot of that is actually being used not for fewer discounting, it was to help accelerate some shipments. And I think that's sort of a balance with the major retailers. I'd say most of them are fairly comfortable with where they are at right now, the exit deals certainly helped everybody.","Kevin Farr","Yes, and I would just like to add, sales were below expectations, but our owned inventory is good quality, we've got mostly good brand POS momentum, exciting the year and we'll work through the extra inventory quickly and I don\u2019t think we have to discounted it.","Greg Badishkanian","Okay. All right. And which of those categories were the cleanest versus the heavy, I think I know, but maybe you can just state that for me? In inventory, heaviest inventory --.","Chris Sinclair","I think look I think our core brands are really in pretty decent shape. Barbie looks solid, obviously as expected. I think HotWheels is in good position. I think Construction was a little bit challenged and that\u2019s probably were some of the inventory is. Frankly that was probably the most competitive categories we went into December. So there were a little bit long, but I think we've got good program in place.","Greg Badishkanian","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Felicia Hendrix of Barclays.","Felicia Hendrix","First, I just kind of have been confused throughout -- I was confused throughout December kind of watching the NPD data comment and I understand there was a shift with Hanukah, which kind of -- through things, but globally that might not have been as much as an impact, so I'm just wondering if you could discuss why you think the Train [ph] issue was weaker than expected in December? And then also how can we be confident that there isn\u2019t broader toy industry issue here, and how can be confident that things can recover in 2017?","Chris Sinclair","Yes. Good question Felicia, let me take a crack and Richard can jump on it if he'd like. Some of this is -- a lot of this is empirical, some of it\u2019s a little bit anecdotal, but clearly Star Wars and the overlap of Star Wars was a huge factor in the slowdown as we got into the quarter. And it showed up dramatically on Star Wars related products. I think anecdotally, and we can't actually get this data, but we think a lot of foot traffic was brought in, in the prior year through things like Star Wars. We also had a lot of strong industry drivers in '15, I don't think the slate was nearly as strong in '16. So that contributed to it, you know things like Shopkins and Minions and so forth last year.","If you look at the core drivers this year there weren't many big ones that were drawing in traffic, so part of the interpretation is that and I think just the continued trend of shifting later into the December month has been an ongoing [indiscernible]. But hard to say why it was so dramatic this year, and on the two extra days of selling, Christmas may have had something to do with it. Clearly that's where it showed up in POS and we think the shifts in e-commerce strength was another factor. I don\u2019t -- our view is it\u2019s -- there's not something fundamental going on because if you sort of look at where we exited non-POS for the year, 5% growth for the toy industry is still pretty robust, so we're going to continue to dig and look at that and obviously it\u2019s something we need to get smarter about, but I think that's probably about the best we can articulate at this point. You know Hanukah was a factor here certainly, but not everywhere.","Richard Dickson","I would just add to Chris's comments that, complementing the industry that we're in, it continues to reinvent itself and put you know very good scores on the board in terms of growth. I think there were several years where you know the question of traditional toys was in play based on the evolution of technology and I think what you've seen in certainly our efforts of using technology to enable innovation through play and toy is taking shape.","There were some incredible hits in the industry, certainly we had some, but overall the industry had some great hits, complemented by real new innovation. I think even in our portfolio you know entertainment driven properties despite the fact that people might be critical of a Superman vs Batman Box Office, we did spectacular with action figures and certainly introducing a new girls' brand with DC super hero girls was well received by the market, and last but not least, you know and I can't say it enough we have these incredible core assets that across generations and have been with us for many-many years. And to see Barbie, HotWheels and Fisher-Price all post the kind of resurgence in growth that they did this year leads us to believe in great spades that we are in a good industry and certainly innovation prevails.","Felicia Hendrix","Thanks, and then just for the e-commerce how much did you guys distribute through e-commerce this holiday period versus last holiday period?","Chris Sinclair","I don't think we have publish that number. But it was up substantially for us and it\u2019s probably -- I guess I can say probably in the high teens, was a percentage of our mix.","Felicia Hendrix","Do you know what it is for the industry overall?","Chris Sinclair","I think our performance we feel was probably a little bit stronger on the -- certainly in the U.S. But I can't you give on measures on some of the other markets.","Richard Dickson","We saw a pretty -- it was pretty sort of low digit growth throughout the year with the real spike obviously towards the end there in the last several days. But not necessarily disproportion from its historical trend.","Felicia Hendrix","And this year why was there a big change do you think?","Richard Dickson","In the e-commerce, we did think it shifted positively, the ecommerce definitely. But again, it's offset based, it's not enough offset what was happening at brick and mortar.","Felicia Hendrix","And then the high teens, the increase that you had this year was that off of like a really easy comp for '15 over --.","Chris Sinclair","No, actually I was giving a percentage of the mix of that number. We probably did a little better than that Felicia, and we were camping up big number last year in terms of growth.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay, and then in earlier of your comments you said that the issue was industry wide, but your level of discounting wasn\u2019t as bad as the industry overall, I just want to make sure I heard that right.","Chris Sinclair","I would say, I don\u2019t want to cast too much on the competition. But it was clear that the full industry was discounting quite heavily and maybe a little more precipitously in some cases.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay, and then can we just -- I'm getting all of these incoming questions about, your salvage [ph] estimates were up, there was discounting which was clear, you explained that, I think everybody gets that, but the confusion is talking about the POS. Right, so if you're discounting and it's promotions would that benefit to your POS, so how do we think about it in a clean way?","Chris Sinclair","I think that's what I was trying to articulate earlier. Clearly, discounting whether it's what we're supporting or through retail, whatever, would have an impact on POS. All I would point to is, in this environment where it was so pervasive [ph] everywhere, I think it's probably more a case of holding your own would be the way I would phrase it.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay, that's helpful. Final question just on the dividend, Mattel has definitely going through harder times and maintained its dividends and came out of that fine. But just wondering how that board stays comfortable with this current level over the dividend when the chances of covering the dividend has just been potentially pushed out?","Chris Sinclair","We've taken a pretty hard look at 2017 and with the expectation of growth from the business and a lot tougher management on working capital inventory and things like that, I think we feel at this point reasonably comfortable, Felicia, we're okay there and we always reevaluate, but at this point, I think we're quite comfortable.","Richard Dickson","Yes, I think the other thing that we've taken into consideration is due to timing of Cars III shipments, we project higher customer collections in the second half of the year which should result in improved cash flow and as Chris said we are going to actively managed inventories. They're higher than our average for five years and we think we've got an opportunity really due to investments in IT systems to really manage that down in 2017.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Gerrick Johnson of BMO Capital Markets. ","Gerrick Johnson ","Gift cards, they seem to be a bigger portion of holiday sales each year. Can you talk about POS in January and of the shift, say the gift cards have pulled some POS into the first quarter from the fourth?","Chris Sinclair","I'm not sure I would have that data right now, Gerrick.","Kevin Farr","Yes, I think you could say the last week of December was very strong, so I assume some of that related to using gift cards and whether that went into January, we don\u2019t have that information at this point in time.","Gerrick Johnson","All right, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Linda Bolton-Weiser of B. Riley.","Linda Bolton-Weiser ","So, I had a question on Barbie first, it seems that when you talk about the strong POS of like HotWheels and Barbie, the shipments in of Wheels, the numbers that you are showing seem to better match the POS numbers that you are quoting. But Barbie there seems to be a bigger disconnect. So is there something that about the POS data that you are not -- would Barbie POS be positive and as strong you're saying in every period, or you said in the last month and the last six weeks, but maybe in the last two weeks of the year Barbie POS faltered or I mean, is there anything to help us understand better, why Barbie seems to be a little bit more of a disconnect?","Richard Dickson","Sure Linda, its Richard. First of important to note that as we close the year in 2016, Barbie POS globally is up double digits and shipping commensurate with that, high single digit. So clearly a successful year for Barbie. Again, it remains number one global girl's property in the world, number three overall and when you look at it its POS is aligned with shipping.","What you do see is and you'll recall Barbie had a very strong first three quarters and impact in the third quarter. Shipping actually was higher than POS and while it was part of the progress as the consistent growth that Barbie had, it did fill the shelves, retailers were excited about it and we benefitted from that.","Unfortunately, as the industry slowed and retailers delayed the overall additional shipments that included Barbie. And so, to some extend she was the victim of the same thing that we are talking about in relation to the category. And the volatility that's happened at retail increased proportional efforts and ultimately delayed shipping.","I can tell you, the growth of the brand overall has been broad based. Between the younger girl introduction of Dreamtopia which was a segment that we went after to reignite the fashion piece of the business with Fashionistas with different ethnicities and scale and ultimately the prominent, I Can Be segment, which is ultimately the marketing platform, all performed really up to and in some cases beyond our expectations.","Space has been commentate without POS growth and we saw additional space this year and we see additional space coming up for 2017. And we are frankly very confident in our plans for Barbie in '17 and beyond maximizing the momentum that we currently have.","Chris Sinclair","Yes, in guess I\u2019d just step back and say if you look at the full year POS and shipping are aligned and its high single digits.","Linda Bolton-Weiser","Okay thank you, that\u2019s helpful. And then just getting back to the questioning on online sales, I recently read in a British Publication that 36% of toy sales in the UK were online, so that\u2019s quite a bit higher than what we we're seeing in the U.S. So first of all, can you explain why that is? And secondly, as the U.S. switches more or shifts even more towards online, how do you think about that sharing responsibility with the retailer.","So if the retailer needs to work harder to be more effective in bricks and mortar. How do you share their cost for them? So in other words, this holiday season you decided to help them, but how do you think about that in the future. I mean it\u2019s not your responsibility, you're not the retailer, you're the supplier, so maybe you could just kind of talk about that as a longer-term issue.","Richard Dickson","It's Richard. You know I can't speak to the UK stat that you mentioned. But what we can tell you is and I think it\u2019s fairly well known we continue to see the shift into online activity and in particularly as we mentioned to have a positive trend the whole year with a specific spike in the last few weeks, and even more specific few days. What we also do very closely is work with our retailers on their own sites as well as their stores and align the strategies, the product, the pricing and the promotion to complement.","And so, and that will just simply continue and we will continue to not only align around them, but specifically build programs and marketing that go after that opportunity while honestly driving experiential activity and reasons to essentially drive traffic into stores. So we are you know traveling down two lanes and frankly both are opportunities, we need to enhance retailer experiences and create a reason to go to stores and we also need to continue to build robust programs and marketing that drives the continued trend of people shopping online.","Linda Bolton-Weiser","Okay, thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you, our next question comes from Steph Wissink of Piper Jaffray.","Steph Wissink","Hi, good evening everyone, just a follow up question on Margo's appointment, Chris if you could talk a little bit more about how you expect to leverage her tech background, kind of some the enthusiasm around some of her experience. And as it relates to the dividend, I'm curious around some of the capital commitment and how you're thinking about capital flexibility, particularly if you do expect to you know be a little bit more into tech and how to fund some of that innovation.","Chris Sinclair","Look, we'll have more time I guess, Steph, when we see you back at Toy Fair and Margo will be joining us actually on the Analyst Day that we have, so you'll get a better read on Margo's strengths. But first and foremost, she is an enormously talented leader and a good strategic leader which was one of the things we were quite interested in.","Secondly, obviously her capabilities in the digital world and technology world are extremely important to some of the things that we started to talk about, whether it\u2019s connected toys, or CRM our partnerships with some of the online players around the world. I think she'll be pretty instrumental on that and as you know we've made some investments in technology, we\u2019re kind of working our way into it, but I think she can help us prioritize, streamline and accelerate those. So I think she'll have a huge impact there, but I think she's a keen strategist and brand builder and so forth so, I think we'll see benefits on a lot fronts.","Steph Wissink","Okay then just one follow up if I could, it hasn\u2019t been asked and I am curious about the border tax, has there been any contingency planning behind the scenes. If you can give us an update on internal discussions around what might be your options if that does go into effect.","Kevin Farr","Yes, I think the discussions have been pretty high level. So far with regard to that that particular tax so it's little early to speculate. My thought processed, it looks to me that it would be more appropriate to raise or increase import duties which currently in the U.S. there aren\u2019t any.","So from the short-term perspective I don\u2019t think there is much we can do, because all of our manufacturing facilities are outside the U.S. But I think longer term we're looking at those factories and we've been doing it a lot with regard to automation to take cost out and take people out and I think overtime if in fact there is a big total charge to get into the U.S. with imported products, then we have to relook at our manufacturing base and adjust accordingly.","But short term, 90% of the toys are manufactured in China and it's going to impact the entire industry, so I think there is a shorter term above that longer term, I think we would react to it.","Steph Wissink","Final one for us is just regarding pricing. I think you have an advantage in 2016 and it sounds like in 2017 you expect a bit of an advantage as well. Would you talk a little bit about what categories are you expecting to take some price and if we should look for our overall pricing to lift on some of your core businesses?","Chris Sinclair","Yes, I don\u2019t think we would probably comment on that, Steph. But we carefully look at it every year and right now we're taking a renewed hard look at it, so we will be probably finding areas to price strategically, but it would be about all I say.","Kevin Farr","Yes, I guess strategically I think we look to make sure we price per value and that's what we would look at if we are taking a price increase to make sure we keep the consumer value equation correct. So, we will be looking that on a SKU by SKU basis.","Steph Wissink","Thanks guys very helpful.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from Drew Crum of Stifel.","Drew Crum ","Wondering if you guys would be willing to comment on the quarterly cadence of improvement you are anticipating for gross margins as you go through 2017 given the access to inventory that you are dealing with at the beginning of the year. And any comments you have on the outlook for input costs going into 2017?","Chris Sinclair","Yes, I don\u2019t think we're in a position where we'd giving any cadence on margins throughput, maybe we'll have more to talk about when we see you in a couple of weeks. I would say on the input cost side there is little bit of stress right now on resin and packaging and things like that which we've been dealing with, and I think -- have game plans to offset. On the good news side, there is currency devaluating that's affecting labor, so I think on balance we're still pretty comfortable with where we are on our manufacturing converging front.","Drew Crum ","Got it, and then just one last question. You made a comment that you felt like you had one of the strongest line up of entertainment properties in years and obviously, you have Cars III, aside from that, what else are you excite about as you think about the portfolio of entertainment IP [ph] that you have this year.","Richard Dickson","Our continued partnership with Warner Brothers is one to really compliment. We had a spectacular year with them, not only with Batman vs Superman, but also DC Superhero Girl, those brands continue into the next several years with theatricals, Wonder Women is actually going to be this spring, Justice League is on the docket as well, which is in our portfolio. Cars III, of course we talk about it, we will continue to talk about it, but we're incredibly excited about that business in 2017.","There are a multitude of other really exciting properties as well, Fast and Furious from Universal is coming at us and Nickelodeon continues to have great success in some of their pre-school brands. Without getting into the list that I'm excited to take you through a Toy Fair, what's also really important to notice that we have great pipeline for 2018 as well. Toy story is on the docked as well as Jurassic, which is an incredible franchise that we are anticipating a great degree of excitement and innovation.","So, I\u2019ll share more details around our pipeline for '17, '18 and even further down the road, but we are quite confident that this line up is one of the best ones that we've had in many, many years.","Kevin Farr","Yes, and just to go back to input cost, we are seeing inflation in things like resins and as Chris said paper, as well as a labor in China. So those things are headwinds. We're trying to work very hard on supply chain initiatives to offset as much of that as we can.","Drew Crum","And Kevin the pricing increase you anticipate taking the share, that\u2019s an [ph] offset some of those inflationary pressures?","Kevin Farr","Yes.","Drew Crum","Okay. Thanks guys.","Chris Sinclair","Thank you all for joining us today. There will be a replay of this call available beginning at 9:00 PM Eastern time.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Drew Vollero, Senior Vice President of Corporate Strategy and Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Drew Vollero","Thanks, operator. As you know, this morning, we reported Mattel's fourth quarter and full year financial results. We provided you with a slide presentation to help guide our discussion today. The slide presentation and the information required by Regulation G, regarding non-GAAP financial measures is available on the Investors & Media section of our corporate website, mattel.com. ","In a few minutes, Bryan Stockton, Mattel's CEO; and Kevin Farr, Mattel's CFO, will provide comments on the results, and then the call will be opened for your questions.","Certain statements made during the call may include forward-looking statements related to the future performance of our overall business. These statements are based on currently available information, and they are subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties, which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.","We describe some of these uncertainties in the Risk Factors section of our 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K, in our 2011 quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and in other filings we make with the SEC from time to time. Mattel does not update forward-looking statements and expressly disclaims any obligation to do so. ","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bryan.","Bryan G. Stockton","Thank you, Drew, and good morning. While I've been a part of this early-morning call for the last year, I am thrilled and excited to be leading this morning's call as Mattel's sixth CEO. I look forward to seeing many of you soon for our Analyst Meeting, scheduled during New York Toy Fair, where Kevin and I will take you through a preview of what's to come in 2012. But this morning, I'd like to focus on a review of our 2011 performance.","As we look back on 2011, several important factors played out throughout the year. We maintained momentum in our core brands, such as Barbie, Hot Wheels, American Girl and our new brand franchise, Monster High, as well as with key entertainment properties, such as Disney Princess and Cars 2. 2011 proved to be a transition year for Fisher-Price, due to the expiration of the Sesame Street license combined with these strategic repositioning of the brand.","The retail environment continued to be cautious throughout 2011, due to retailers' concerns about consumer spending in the uncertain global economic environment. We managed our business accordingly as these events played out during the year. As a result, 2011 was another strong year for Mattel.","For the fourth quarter, sales grew 1% and operating income increased by 16%, driven by strong gross margins and tight cost controls. For the year, we grew revenues by 7% and operating income by 15%. ","Throughout the year and particularly in the fourth quarter, we worked closely with our retail partners to ensure that shipping, POS and retail inventories were aligned across our portfolio of brands. This proved to be important as overall holiday sales were consistent with our expectations, but were concentrated later in the all-important fourth quarter than in prior years.","With the success of this effort in 2011, we enter 2012 pleased with the current state of both our inventories and those of our retail partners. In fact, 2011 marks our third consecutive year of solid performance, which I'm especially pleased about given the soft global economic backdrop and the highly promotional environment, particularly in the U.S. ","Our portfolio of brands performed across the globe. Our POS grew nicely, and we gained a category share according to NPD's most recent data. In fact, 4 of the top 5 properties for the 2011 holiday season came from Mattel.","With strong operating results throughout the year, Mattel's business model generated strong cash flow, which we continue to deploy to shareholders. As you already saw on today's press release, we have raised our quarterly dividend by 35%, reflecting an annualized dividend of $1.24. Dividends remained an all-important component in our deployment strategy, a key driver of our TSR and an effective way for us to share the value we are creating with our shareholders.","We also continue to repurchase shares, buying back a total of $536 million for the year and almost $1 billion over the last 2 years. In 2011, we executed against these strategic priorities that we laid out for you in the beginning of the year, which were to deliver consistent growth through continued momentum in core brands, the building of new franchises, optimization of our entertainment partnerships and continued expansion of our international footprint.","Let's start with the core brands. We were very pleased with performance of the Barbie brand as it continued to reign as the #1 property in the toy industry for the holiday season for the fifth consecutive year. Barbie's fall entertainment, Princess Charm School, performed very well versus last year, driven by a well-coordinated marketing efforts around the world across toys, DVDs and consumer products. This year, we also released the third DVD in November entitled, Barbie: A Perfect Christmas with the associated product, which was incremental to last year. And the newly launched, I Can Be campaign, targeting both girls and moms was a success.","Hot Wheels delivered innovation for the holiday driven by the success of our key fall items, particularly Wall Tracks, which was a complete sellout and proved to be one of the industries break-out products of the year. The business also benefited from the Team Hot Wheels product launch, with a range of products playing out the Team Hot Wheels storyline that was established in the second quarter of the year. Overall, given the stiff competition in the vehicle aisle earlier in the year, we're pleased with Hot Wheels' performance for the holiday and the year.","American Girl reached the brand milestone this year, hitting the $0.5 billion sales mark, as it concluded its 25th anniversary year. This year was driven by solid performance of the 2011 Girl of the Year, Kanani, which was completely sold out in mid-December as well as 2 new store openings in Seattle and Washington, D.C.","In 2011, we shared with you that Fisher-Price would be challenged due to the expiration of our license agreement with Sesame Street. In addition, we also shared that the Fisher-Price brand needed to undertake a strategic review to reposition the brand for sustainable growth on a global basis. We've made really good progress in 2011 on this strategic vision for the brand. And we were pleased to see sales essentially flat, excluding Sesame Street, and encouraged to see improving POS trends for Fisher-Price Core in the back half of the year as we focused on our new messaging and retail execution. We expect to make progress on Fisher-Price in 2012 and believe we have the right properties and strategic vision to take advantage of the global opportunity for the Fisher-Price brand.","While the U.S. gains industry continued to be soft year-over-year, we focused underwriting innovation through one of the best-known brands in our portfolio, UNO, which was the top seller in the games category this past holiday season. Additionally, Fijit and Rovio's Angry Birds were also a must haves during the holidays.","And we certainly delivered on the goal of building new franchises. Monster High continues to delight and excite girls around the world. In the U.S., not only was it the fastest-growing fashion doll brand, but it ended 2011 as the #2 brand in the category according to NPD. In international markets, Monster High was the tremendous success in 2011. And to date, we have launched the brand in more than 35 countries. But it wasn't just about the toys. Our integrated worldwide licensing program continued to drive sales of consumer products throughout the fourth quarter. As per publishing, Monster High books are now helping to build brand awareness in 18 languages and in more than 20 countries.","Our third goal is to optimize our entertainment partnerships by partnering with the best and being the best partner. In the entertainment category, Disney Princess had another strong year driven by our continuous innovation to the core Princess line and the continued success of the hit movie, Tangled, as it rolled out around the world. ","The Cars property had the single biggest year in the history of the brand. For the year, Cars was also the #2 vehicle brand at retail behind only Hot Wheels.","We also delivered against our fourth goal to continue expanding our international footprint. In Europe, we experienced growth in the quarter due to strength in Monster High, Barbie and Cars 2. Our Latin American business hit a major milestone, representing almost $1 billion of revenue after growing an impressive 14% in 2011. We estimate that our Latin American business was a standalone toy company. It would be the fifth largest toy company in the world.","In addition, Asia had another solid year performance. We are particularly pleased with the development of our businesses in China and India. Both countries represent examples of patient and disciplined investments in both brands and infrastructure to create a strong foundation for future growth. While 2011 certainly had its challenges, it was a year we are proud of.","In 2012, we will continue to work to deliver consistent growth and financial performance by executing against our existing Mattel strategic priorities through continued momentum in core brands, finalizing the acquisition of HIT Entertainment, home of the premier preschool property, Thomas & Friends, and capitalizing on the global opportunity for Fisher-Price. We will continue our work on creating new franchises and optimizing our entertainment partnerships, which for 2012 will include Brave and Batman, as well as the Evergreen Cars property. And we will also continue our focus on expanding our international footprint. ","I am excited and humbled by the opportunity presented to me by Bob Eckert and the Mattel Board of Directors. Mattel is truly a great company, comprised of great people, leading great brands. My personal mantra is happy, but never satisfied. And I found that many at Mattel share that same belief. That hunger to improve on all we do is what will propel us to excel in the future. I'm excited about that journey and look forward to sharing more with you at the Analyst Meeting in February.","Now I will ask Kevin Farr, Mattel's Chief Financial Officer, to take you through a financial review of the quarter and the year. Kevin?","Kevin M. Farr","Thank you, Bryan, and good morning, everyone. As Bryan noted, we executed well against our strategic priorities in 2011. In the midst of some strong global economic headwinds, we made sound progress on the 3 overarching global strategic priorities we set last year as we outlined the vision of Mattel's sustainable future success.","In 2011, we delivered consistent growth by continuing the momentum in our core brands, by optimizing entertainment partnerships, building new franchises and working to expand and leverage our international footprint.","In 2011, we continued to make progress in improving our operating margins by sustaining gross margins and delivering another round at cost savings. And in 2011, we generated significant cash flow and continued our disciplined, opportunistic and value-enhancing capital deployment.","Looking at our 2011 results, our second year of high single-digit sales growth, combined with our third year of 50% gross margins and our continued focus on cost reductions, resulted in record operating profit of $1.04 billion. Consistent with our long-term goals, we made headway on our operating margin expectations of 15% to 20%, improving by 120 basis points in the prior year to 16.6% of net sales in 2011. We also continue to deploy cash generated from our solid operating results in a disciplined an opportunistic way through dividends, share repurchases and strategic acquisitions.","In 2011, we reported our shareholders with dividend payments of $317 million and share repurchases of $536 million. Dividends remain a key priority of our capital deployment strategy. And as part of our earnings release today, we announced a substantial increase in our dividend from $0.23 a quarter to $0.31 a quarter, a 35% increase. ","And tomorrow, we expect to close the acquisition at HIT Entertainment and its portfolio of globally recognized leading preschool brands like Thomas & Friends, Barney, Bob the Builder, Fireman Sam and Angelina Ballerina. Our disciplined approach to capital deployment has allowed us to maintain single A credit metrics, leaving us with the opportunity to continue to focus on driving consistent value creation to our shareholders.","Okay. Let's move on to Page 5 of our slide deck. You can see that our worldwide gross sales are up 1% for the quarter and up 7% for the year. Based on our data, we continue to see good momentum in our POS domestically, as well as internationally. And based on the latest NPD U.S. data, we gained category share in both the fourth quarter and the full year. The Euro 5 NPD data also shows Mattel's market share gains outpacing the positive overall toy industry growth seen in the region. Retailers continued to manage their inventories throughout 2011 due to concerns about consumer spending in light of the uncertain global economy.","As expected, we saw this trend continue in the key holiday season, particularly in the U.S., Canada and Southern Europe. As Bryan said, we work closely with our retail partners to ensure that shipping, consumer takeaway and retail inventories were aligned across our portfolio of brands. With the success of this effort in 2011, we enter 2012 pleased with the current state of both our inventories and those of our retail partners.","Let's turn to Page 6 and 7 of the slide presentation to see the business perspective on sales. Worldwide sales for Mattel Girls & Boys brands were up 7% for the quarter and 13% for the year. Barbie sales grew for the second consecutive year, and Monster High continued to exceed all expectations globally. Another premier Evergreen brand, Disney Princesses, delivered a very solid quarter given that it was up against last year's theatrical release, Tangled. We were very pleased with Hot Wheels, which had a solid fourth quarter both domestically and internationally, led by its new innovative Wall Tracks line. And we continue to deliver good growth in our entertainment and games business driven by Cars 2, Fijit and UNO.","Worldwide sales for Fisher-Price brands were down 10% for the quarter and down 3% for the year. Excluding the impact of expiration last year of our license with Sesame Street, Fisher-Price brands were essentially flat for the full year of 2011. Overall, we were able to grow Fisher-Price Core revenue modestly, both domestically and internationally in full year 2011. As Bryan said, we were encouraged to see improving consumer takeaways trends in Fisher-Price Core in the back half of the year, as we focused on our new messaging and improved retail execution.","American Girl continues to deliver strong results with sales in the fourth quarter up 4%, and sales up 5% for the year. Sales results were buoyed by continued momentum with MyAG, the early sell-out Girl of the Year, Kanani and the new store openings in Seattle and Washington, D.C.","Despite some foreign exchange headwinds in the back half of the year, our international business, as seen on Page 8, showed strong growth across all regions for the quarter and the year. We were very proud of the fact that our Latin American business continues to gain momentum as we generated almost $1 billion of sales in that region per year. And we continue to be encouraged with the strength in Europe despite the challenging economic environment there. And finally, we're pleased with the growth trends that we continue to see in the Asia-Pacific region.","Now let's review the P&L starting on Page 9 of the slide presentation. You can see that Mattel reached its full year goal of achieving 50% gross margins for the third year in a row, driven by a strong performance in the quarter.","For the fourth quarter of 2011, the key drivers and improvements in gross margin were price increases, the positive impact of foreign exchange, mix and savings from our Operational Excellence 2.0 initiatives, partially offset by rising input costs. Foreign exchange was a positive for us in the fourth quarter of 2011 unlike the third quarter where we were negatively impacted by the rapid appreciation of the U.S. dollar in late September of 2011. In fact, the final settlements of our intercompany receivables at the beginning of the fourth quarter resulted in us calling back some of the third quarter currency losses.","In the fourth quarter of 2011, the year-over-year currency benefit was about 80 basis points, a little less than half of the 180 basis point negative impact that we experienced in the third quarter of 2011.","For the year, gross margins was 50.2%, slightly below last year's 50.5%, due to higher input costs, royalties and unfavorable foreign exchange, partially offset by price increases and savings from our OE 2.0 initiatives. For the full year, gross margins were negatively impacted by a foreign exchange by only 20 basis points.","As seen on Page 10 of the slide presentation, we continue to leverage selling, general and administrative spending. For the fourth quarter of 2011, SG&A expense improved by 110 basis points to 18.6% of net sales versus last year. For the full year, SG&A expense improved by 160 basis points to 22.4% of net sales.","For the fourth quarter and full year 2011, the favorability is primarily due to reduced legal spending, reduced equity-incentive compensation expense and savings from our OE 2.0 initiatives, partially offset by increased employee-related expenses, investment in strategic growth initiatives and acquisition-related costs.","With respect to strategic growth initiatives, we continue to invest in American Girl retail expansion and new IT platforms to provide multi-channel capabilities to American Girl and to streamline and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our product design, development and manufacturing processes.","Acquisition-related expenses in the fourth quarter were $8 million and about $10 million for full year 2011. As I said earlier, we expect to close the acquisition of HIT tomorrow. For your reference, we included a historical trend summary of our incremental legal and settlement-related costs in the Appendix of the slide presentation.","Page 11 of the presentation summarizes the performance of our 2-year global cost leadership initiative and a summary of our progress in our new initiative, Operational Excellence 2.0. We continue to make good progress on this new initiative.","For the fourth quarter 2011, we recognized Operational Excellence 2.0 gross savings of $46 million, including $22 million of structural savings and approximately $24 million in legal savings. In the quarter, we invested approximately $6 million, resulted in net savings of $40 million. For the fourth quarter of 2011, approximately $25 million of the net savings are in the SG&A line, $5 million of savings are included in gross margin and $10 million of savings are in advertising.","For full year 2011, we recognized OE 2.0 gross savings of $94 million, including $53 million of structural savings and approximately $41 million in legal savings. For the full year, we invested approximately $23 million, resulting in net savings of $71 million.","For the full year of 2011, approximately $44 million of the net savings are in the SG&A line, $15 million in savings are included in gross margin and $12 million in net savings are in advertising.","We remain on track to realize $150 million in sustainable accumulative savings by the end of 2012. We continue to expect that the primary drivers of these savings will be generated from a reduction of $75 million of legal spending and $75 million of structural savings executed through a handful of important continuous improvement initiatives.","Turning to Page 12. For the fourth quarter, operating income was $497.5 million or 23.1% of net sales, up 290 basis points from last year. For the full year 2011, we delivered record operating income of $1.04 billion, and we improved full year operating margins by 120 basis points to 16.6% of net sales.","By delivering more consistent revenue growth, sustaining our gross margins of 50% and leveraging our SG&A, we continue to show good progress against our long-term operating margin targets of 15% to 20%.","Turning to Page 13, for the fourth quarter, earnings per share were $1.07, which was up $0.18 or 20% versus the prior year. Earnings per share for full year 2011 was $2.18, which was up $0.32 or 17% driven primarily by increased operating income due to higher sales and operating margins, partially offset by higher interest expense and a slightly higher tax rate.","Our worldwide effective income tax rate for the full year 2011 was approximately 21%. Looking forward to 2012, we expected our income tax rate would be approximately 22% to 23%.","Now let's turn to cash flow on Page 14 of this slide presentation. Cash flow from operations for the year was $665 million, an increase of $137 million compared with $528 million in 2010. The increase is primarily driven by improved earnings growth and a decision not to factor domestic receivables in 2010, partially offset by an increase in working capital usage.","In 2011, we continued to execute our capital deployment framework, improving shareholder returns by increasing the dividend and repurchasing stock. In 2011, we also issued $600 million of senior unsecured notes for general corporate purposes and to partially prefund the pending HIT acquisition.","Net proceeds for the offering were partially offset by the repayment of $250 million of long-term debt that matured in 2011. We continue to have a strong balance sheet in a business that generates strong cash flow, which we continue to deploy to enhance shareholder value.","Turning to Page 15. Two key components of our capital deployment investment framework are dividends and share repurchases. In 2011, Mattel returned over $850 million to shareholders using these levers. A key aspect of our framework has always been dividends. Historically, dividends are proven driver of total shareholder returns for both the overall market and Mattel. For us, dividends have been a key value driver for Mattel's total TSR and an important reason why our TSR continues to stand out versus the S&P. We continue to target top quartile dividend payout ratios of 50% to 60% of EPS. The company announced today that Mattel's Board of Directors raised the quarterly dividend from $0.23 to $0.31 per share, reflecting an annualized dividend of $1.24, a 35% increase over last year. ","The increase in our dividend in 2012 reflects 2 key drivers. First, as Bryan said, we continue to believe that dividends have proven to be an effective way to return funds and drive total shareholder returns. And second, this increase better aligns recent EPS and dividend growth. Both EPS and dividends now have grown over 20% since 2009. The annualized dividend of $1.24 per share is slightly above the midpoint of our targeted payout ratio.","Looking forward, we expect that our dividend would generally increase with our growth and earnings and within our targeted payout ratio of 50% to 60%, resulting in a dividend yield consistent with top quartile yields of best-in-class consumer goods companies.","Another important component of our capital deployment framework is share repurchases. In 2011, we repurchased over 20 million shares at an average price of $26.32, reducing share count by about 7% over the last 2 years. Looking forward, we will continue to repurchase shares opportunistically. The company will continue to deploy excess cash consistent with its long-standing capital investment framework, which includes investing in our business, paying a top quartile dividend, repurchasing shares and executing targeted mergers and acquisitions.","Consistent with our framework, the company intends to maintain a strong balance sheet with targeted yearend cash of $800 million to $1 billion and maintain single A credit metrics.","So to summarize, we achieved our 2011 objectives and continued to make good progress across all of our businesses. In this very challenging economic environment, we achieved record net sales of $6.3 billion in 2011, topping a very solid 2010 of performance with strength in both domestic and international markets.","We achieved the third consecutive year of gross margins slightly above our long-term targets of 50%. We delivered record operating profit over $1 billion to the bottom line, improving our operating margin for this third straight year. And we continue to execute our disciplined approach to capital deployment, increasing our dividend, buying back shares and signing a deal that acquired HIT Entertainment, which we have the opportunity to build brands with great franchises like Thomas & Friends on a global basis in both toys and consumer goods.","We believe we are well positioned as we enter 2012. We will continue to create shareholder value by executing our overarching global strategic priorities: first to deliver consistent growth; second to build on the progress we made on improving our operating margins; and third, to generate significant cash flow and continue our disciplined, opportunistic and value-enhancing deployment of that cash.","That concludes my review of the financial results. Now, we'd like to open the call to questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Robert Carroll with UBS.","Robert W. Carroll - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","One quick thing, I was hoping in kind of 2 parts to look at gross margin a little bit closer just to see if you guys could get a little more granular, whether in terms of what some of the other benefits were that we might not be thinking of? And then secondly, as you look towards 2012 with where input costs are, in order to protect that 50% level going into 2012, what sort of pricing you think might be needed?","Kevin M. Farr","Yes. I think -- let me talk about gross margin, the benefits. Overall, we were pleased to see gross margins to improve in the fourth quarter resulting full year gross margin of 50.2%, which was the third consecutive year of delivering full year gross margins of about 50%. Historically, our gross margins are usually highest in the fourth quarter given the later timing of our shipments of key TV drivers, which generally have higher price points. For the full year our gross margin rate of 50.2% was essentially flat as compared to the prior year rate of 50.5%. The 30 basis point decline in gross margin was primarily due to increased product cost and higher royalties related to increased sales and licensed entertainment properties, which were offset by our -- a price increase and cost savings from manufacturing efficiency programs and our Operational Excellence 2.0 initiatives. For the full year, the impact of gross margins related to foreign currency was minimal, about a negative 20 basis points. So those are the things that really drove gross margins for the year. As we look to the 2012, and we believe that we're operating in a global environment, where input costs and labor costs and transportation costs will continue to rise. We continue to see tremendous volatility in crude oil prices and packing resins and transportation spending. If you look at last year, oil has moved from about $112 per barrel last May. It dropped to $88 per barrel in September and has settled in at about $100 per barrel over last few months. We're also seeing in 2012, the government of China recently announced the 13.6% minimum wage increase in Shenzhen. Effective 1\/1\/2012, we also expect that other Southern China provinces will raise the minimum wage by 13% to 18%, probably effective March 1st of 2012. So we are seeing input costs increase across the board in things like resins and packaging and transportation. So 2012, we'll continue to develop our product line appropriately, deliver good value to our consumers, good margin to our customers and a good margin for Mattel. And as we look at our outlook for 2012, we make detailed cost assumptions or input costs. And our goal is to offset as much of the increases in product-related costs as we can through continued focus on manufacturing efficiency in OE 2.0 cost savings programs. The full year partially offset any expected cost headwinds. When we look at 2012 though, we believe that our efficiency and cost savings initiatives will only get us part of the way towards offsetting the expected increase in input cost, Rob. So as a result, we've instituted a mid single-digit price increase, effective on January 1 with the goal of continuing to sustain our gross margins at around 50%, which we've achieve through the last 3 consecutive years.","Robert W. Carroll - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I mean, given that's already taken hold now, I mean how -- obviously, retailers will be reluctant to meet that? But obviously, they understand what's going on. I mean what's the initial reception been?","Bryan G. Stockton","Rob, it's Bryan. Talking about the price increases with our retail partners is one of the more difficult things that we have to talk about because nobody likes to take prices up. Having said that, we're all seeing the same kind of commodity increases, whether it's in transportation costs, labor, et cetera. So I think generally, there's an understanding of the situation across the board. As Kevin said, we work very hard to do 2 things. Number one is offset as much of these commodity increases as we can with other efficiencies throughout the organization. The other thing we do, and I think we've done a particularly good job of it in the last year, is make sure we're delivering brand value and play value in all that we do. And in doing that, that helps create value for the consumer. As Kevin said, we went through it last year. Our share grew by almost 1 point in the category, which is great. Our POS was up, and so we have some brand momentum that we built up this year that we expect to continue into next year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sean McGowan with Needham & Company.","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","A couple of questions. One, I was hoping at this point with HIT about to close for tomorrow, if you could help us out with some details on what we can expect the impact to be on the P&L? I'm not looking for dollar amounts, but is it a generally accretive to gross margin? Is it dilutive to some other income lines? Help us out with -- what do you expect the interest expense to be? We're all going to be redoing models. It would be nice to take care of that in one shot.","Kevin M. Farr","Yes, I think overall for 2012, we expect the transaction not to have a material impact on 2012 earnings, as profits will be offset by deal costs, restructuring costs and higher interest expense. But looking forward, I think it will be increasingly accretive as a benefit of owning these brands are reflected in Mattel's results, including the addition of Thomas wood business in 2013, cost synergies and the retention of Thomas plastic and die-cast business from 2015 onwards. Then Sean, they have a different business model than ours. Theirs is a licensing model. So they generated, I think, last year about $180 million of revenues, 2\/3 of which related to Thomas & Friends. They do have higher gross margins as a result of that, so there's good flow-through. They do have higher SG&A though, due to the fact that the SG&A base is on that royalty income or licensing income. And overall, they have good EBIT margins as we've told you before, EBITDA margins and EBIT margins.","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Very good. And 2 other quickies. One, can you comment on how you feel about point of sale inventory at this stage going into 2012? There's been a lot of flip flopping in the last few years. And then a final question for Bryan, might as well ask it now. Are you expecting any kind of change in your philosophy towards guidance, that word?","Bryan G. Stockton","I don't think we're going to use the G word, Sean. No, we're not going to change our strategy in terms of guidance. We're going to continue what we have in the past. So let me spend a minute talking about POS and inventories. The toy industry is a dynamic industry as you well know. We knew going into 2011 that it was going to be a year where given the economic situation and some of the carryover issues that the industry faced at the end of the 2010 season, it was very likely that our retail partners would take a cautious approach to the holidays. Because of that, we, too, took a cautious approach to our inventories internally, and we took a cautious approach with our retailers as well. So when you look at POS, our POS overall grew in the fourth quarter. Our share grew by about 1 point overall in the fourth quarter, which we're very pleased with. And as a result, our inventory situation at retail, we think, is in pretty good shape. It looks like on a dollar basis, it's up maybe 1 or 2 percentage points. And we believe on a unit basis, it's relatively flat. Given the momentum we have in POS and brand share, we're feeling like we're in pretty good shape at retail.","Operator","Our next question comes from Linda Bolton-Weiser with Caris.","Linda Bolton-Weiser - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","Bryan, I imagine that you and Bob working so closely together for so many years were pretty much on the same page with regard to most strategic and philosophical things. But is there anything subtle that maybe you deviated a little from Bob's viewpoint, or something that you would like to do a little more within the company versus say, Bob?","Bryan G. Stockton","Well, we're going to spend a little time in February talking more specifically about what our plans are, and so I won't get into a lot of detail here. But I'll give you 2 headlines. One is we do want to continue the  momentum and the continuity of delivering consistent performance in both our top line and bottom line financial performance. I think we've done a pretty good job of that over Bob's 11-year run, and that's something we're proud of and that we expect to continue going in the future. And we also know that this is a dynamic industry. And that as we look forward, we need to deliver consistent growth. So you hear us talk a little bit more about some of the new growth initiatives that we might be thinking about in a couple of weeks.","Linda Bolton-Weiser - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","Great. And can I just ask a little, on the cash flow, how much -- what's the quantification of how much the factoring comparison boosted the operating cash flow for 2011? What was that amount?","Kevin M. Farr","It was about $35 million.","Linda Bolton-Weiser - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And can I just ask about mix? It seemed like mix had a greater effect on the positive gross margin this quarter than last quarter. Is that just like Fisher-Price being down more, and that's a relatively lower margin area? Or is there some subtleties on the mix that you can give us a little more color on?","Kevin M. Farr","Yes. I think mix was a slight positive for the fourth quarter of 2011. For the full year, mix had a minimal impact either way. For the fourth quarter 2011, there was a slight benefit from mix. It was due to primarily to higher shipments of Barbie and Monster High fashion dolls, as well as what you've indicated, the lower relative sales of Fisher-Price brands.","Operator","Our next question comes from Eric Handler with MKM Partners.","Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","As you enter sort of your third year now with Monster High, can you maybe give a little perspective on when you have a successful line like this, is this the year when the absolute revenue dollars increase substantially? Or how should we think about Monster High as a property now as it sort of gets this mature -- more mature type of level?","Bryan G. Stockton","Eric, we don't give specific guidance on any particular brands. But what I can tell you is that Monster High exited 2011 with a lot of positive momentum. If you look at retail, there's not a lot of inventory there. We had a lot of very popular product out there, including the Hydration Station which was one of my favorite toys in the line. So as we look to 2012, we expect that momentum to continue. We've got a lot of exciting ideas for Monster High. So I think we continue to expect to see this grow.","Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then as a follow-up with regard to HIT, am I understanding it correct that from an operating margin perspective that, that should be neutral to the operating margin as well?","Bryan G. Stockton","I mean I think overall because of the restructuring expenses and deal cost, it should not be impacting margins. It may go up slightly, but not much materially this year. The future will have more of an impact on expanding margins as we don't have deal costs and restructuring costs.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Kelter with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to follow-up on the inventory questions. I guess it sounds like you guys, on your own books and for your retail partners, are all on good shape, but some of your competitors aren't. And so I'm curious if you could talk about how you're impacted when some primary toy competitors have excess inventory in the channel and how retail ordering impacts Mattel?","Bryan G. Stockton","Michael, I'm not going to comment on the situation that others in the industry may or may not have. What I will comment is on what we did. And we worked again very hard with our retail partners to make sure that we had the right balance of POS, shipments in inventory for the year. We expect, given the momentum that we have with our brands that we'll continue to see a -- our brands be on the shelf and get the spring line out there and launch what we need to get launched for the spring. So we're not anticipating any big bumps in the road as it relates to that because of the momentum we have.","Kevin M. Farr","Because I think generally, retailers when they're in that situation, they focus in on the brands that have momentum. And they basically buy what's selling through, and that's what we saw with our brands in 2011.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then turning to Europe where it looks like they may be slipping into a recession. Have you seen any impact from consumers or retailers, either to the industry at large or to your own business at this point?","Bryan G. Stockton","Good question, Michael. Actually when we look at the toy industry in Europe, for the year, it actually grew around 2% to 3%, so we view that as quite healthy. Despite all the press and things that you read about what's going on in Europe, the toy industry continues to be resilient. I've been in this industry for 11 years now, and it is amazing to me that if you look at the toy industry today versus when the economic crisis started, the industry is about 5% larger. And that's despite commodity costs that we all experienced being up about 30%. So we're continuing to deliver value as Mattel to consumers, we know consumers in Europe want to buy our toys. Our share was up in Europe. Our POS was up in Europe. And we worked with our -- very hard with our retail partners to make sure that we were well represented.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then Fisher-Price, you have the turnaround, which you presented last time we all got together. Can you maybe talk about any indication of early success with the repositioning or whether it's too early? And what a timeline for a turnaround for Fisher-Price might look like if it is successful?","Bryan G. Stockton","Well, it is too early. Recall the Joy of Learning advertising campaign and repositioning just launched in late October, just in time for the peak of the holiday selling season. So it is early, but despite having said that, I think we told you we were going to focus on our messaging and retail execution on Fisher-Price. So we were encouraged on Fisher-Price Core to see our POS improve throughout the year and see consumers really have a positive response to the messaging. So 2012 is likely to be another transition year for Fisher-Price because there's a lot of work to do. But we're pleased with the progress we've made and look forward to sharing more details about that with you in a couple of weeks.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then lastly on -- I wanted to ask about the price increase, which is not obviously the first one in the last several years, everyone's been forced to take price. What have you learned about elasticity in the last couple of years? Which product lines or categories or things are more exposed to  consumer changes in demand and which are more staple like? And how do we think about elasticity of your business at this point?","Bryan G. Stockton","Well, I'm going to go back to the comment that I made earlier because we have such a broad portfolio of brands and countries that we were doing business in. If you go back and look, the toy industry is roughly 5% larger than it was at the beginning of the economic crisis. The commodity costs are up about 30%. When you look at that, let me tell you that the toy industry is pretty resilient to some of these economic crises and issues. The other thing that we think we do particularly well is we need to innovate. This is all about play value and brand value. And despite whatever is happening with costs, our job here is to make sure we're delivering brand value and play value. Monster High is a great example of creating a new brand with content and excitement, targeted to an older girl with some really innovative product. And it's selling quite well despite an economic crisis. So I'm not going to get into details beyond that, but overall I think when you look at the portfolio brands and countries, we're feeling relatively positive about what we've had to go through over the past 4 or 5 years.","Kevin M. Farr","Yes, I think, Bryan, your point earlier about cost being up about 30%, the industry's still up from 2007, talks about there is -- toys hold up well in tough economic times. And I think the elasticity is pretty tight from that perspective as consumers want to buy toys for their kids for their birthdays, for their friends' birthdays and for the holidays.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gerrick Johnson with BMO Capital Markets.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","You guys mentioned labor cost increases in China, but half your production is elsewhere. Can you talk about the labor situation in places like Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia?","Bryan G. Stockton","I won't get into specifics on individual countries, but there is labor pressure just about everywhere. I would say that the pressure in China is probably slightly higher than in other countries. But we're seeing it globally as economies continue to evolve and grow and mature. Labor rates go up. And one of the strengths that we have is your point, which is we do manufacture in a variety of countries. So we're not as tied to Chinese labor rate increases as perhaps some others may be. But that's something that we're always looking at and trying to innovate. So as we're creating toys, we know how to mitigate whether it's commodity costs or labor costs or other things.","Kevin M. Farr","What I could tell you though, Gerrick, is China's been growing high double digits. I think in some of the other countries, they're more like mid-single digits to high-single digits. So it's not the rate that is growing in China.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","And Kevin, on interest expense, were there any onetime costs for the prepayment of debt in there?","Kevin M. Farr","That was not the repayment of the $250 million of debt, that was scheduled maturities. So there was no cost associated with that other than paying it off.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","And lastly, where you guys satisfied with your customer service levels in the fourth quarter, i.e., do you feel you left any sales on the table?","Bryan G. Stockton","Well again, we work very hard with our customers to make sure that we lined up POS, so we would all end up in a good inventory situation. Recall that in 2010, we were chasing demand because of some issues that we have had. And as we think about really the top 40 toys, we're always trying to hit those exactly right. You never quite hit those just exactly right. But we're pleased with the performance we had, and I think our retail partners were as well.","Kevin M. Farr","Yes. I think we sold out on things, like Fijits and American Girl, like Girl of the Year. But that's typical. As you know, Gerrick, every year, you've got some hot products that you can't anticipate demand perfectly. And we had some great products, which has been great. We had 4 of the top 5 products, according to NPD or properties. So we had good momentum obviously during the holiday season.","Operator","Our next question comes from Margaret Whitfield with Sterne Agee.","Margaret B. Whitfield - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Bryan, as we look out to 2012, we probably will continue to have tight retail inventory management and a soft global economy. And Mattel has tough comparisons against the Cars 2 launch. I wondered if you could give us some thoughts on how we should think about 2012. I know you're waiting until Toy Fair to tell us about all the new products, but any additional thoughts would be helpful.","Bryan G. Stockton","Margaret, as we look at 2012, we think it's going to be another year where both consumers are going to be a little cautious and retailers are going to be a little cautious because we've got economic concerns out there. We have an election here in the United States. So there's a lot of reason, I think, for the macro environment in 2012 to be not that different than the macro environment in 2011. As we look at 2012, we're really looking at the momentum we've been building on our core brands, whether it be on Barbie and Hot Wheels. We're, as I mentioned, transitioning on Fisher-Price. We've got some great entertainment partnerships with Disney Princess and Batman and Brave next year. So when you look at the brand side, I think we've got momentum. Then when you look at our country portfolio, we have a lot of parts of the world that are not as stressed as Western Europe and the United States. Latin America, for example, is continuing to do pretty well economically. And as I mentioned, our business is not only growing, but it's got scale at about $1 billion. So we think there's more growth opportunity there and more growth opportunity in Asia. So it's going to be a year filled with challenges as every year is. One thing we do know is that Christmas will come in 2012. And our hope is that there are more Mattel toys under the tree in 2012 than there were in 2011.","Margaret B. Whitfield - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","On games, you mentioned earlier that the category was soft. Do you see this as a secular trend? Or how is Mattel viewing the games as a category go forward?","Bryan G. Stockton","Well, we felt good about our performance in the games category. I'd start with UNO. UNO was a great global brand for us. It's actually the #3 brand in terms of games overall. It did very well in the U.S. this year being #1 in the category. And we basically grew it through innovation. So we look at our core brands, we try and come up with innovative ideas. Rovio Angry Birds, as I think I mentioned last time we were together, there were a number of people who thought we were probably barking at the wrong tree by trying to make a plastic toy out of this digital game. And it turned out to be a massively popular game and sold out. So like other parts of the toy business, we think innovation is key and understanding how to play in digital and understand how to, as we did in the case of Angry Birds, take advantage of digital to create innovation and excitement in the games category.","Margaret B. Whitfield - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","And finally when will we have some entertainment support for Monster High? Any movie deals on the horizon?","Bryan G. Stockton","Well, one of the great things about Monster High is it's been a fantastic success. And as I said, #2 brand in the U.S. without any kind of entertainment support. We are continuing to do episodes and support it with books and things of that nature. We always have -- I shouldn't say always, but the last couple of years we've had a Halloween special on Nickelodeon, and they continue to be a great partner with us on that. So if something happens with Monster High from a theatrical standpoint, that's great. But the brand has been a success without it. And we're going to continue to build that brand using the building blocks that we have so far.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Taylor with Arcadia Investment Corporation.","John Taylor","I've got a couple of questions too, if I can. When -- following up on Monster High, so -- and Barbie. So both Barbie and Monster High have been growth drivers for the last couple of years. I wonder if you can give us any sense as to the impact of licensing income on the P&L at this point? You mentioned mix was favorable, so I'm wondering if some of that might be coming there and maybe when do you generally get your royalty checks for Q4? Are those booked or accrued in the fourth quarter? Are those going to hit the first quarter?","Bryan G. Stockton","JT, it's Bryan. Let me start, and I'll have Kevin give you some of the details on it. We don't really divulge any details on brand specifics, including what's consumer products and what's not. But as we always said, for example, with Barbie, depending on the country, the consumer product sales are anywhere between 40% and 60% of our brand sales. And Barbie is always -- we've always talked about being a brand. It's not a toy, it's a brand. Monster High, we launched it as a brand, not a toy. So obviously, consumer products is a very important part of it. And as you know, it's a very attractive business for us, in terms of not just building the brand, but also from a margin standpoint. So I'll let Kevin give you a few more details, but we like them both because their brands, and that's what we like to do at Mattel is build brands.","Kevin M. Farr","I think overall the license income was not a huge driver of our gross margin improvement with regard to the mix. There really was the underlying fashion dolls, the toys both from Barbie and Monster High. So the license income did help, but the major driver was more fashion dolls.","John Taylor","Okay, great. And then following up on Margaret's question, maybe a little bit on the timing of revenue. So last year, if you could maybe help us think through the arc of the year, last year, you had the entertainment properties hitting maybe a little bit in Q1, a lot in Q2. And then I'm wondering if the price increase effective January 1 drove any revenue in the fourth quarter, which might take it a little bit away from the first quarter? So it seems like you're set up for weighting, that's way more second half heavy in 2012 than it was 2011, any thoughts on that?","Bryan G. Stockton","Well, let me start with we're not going to get into quarter-by-quarter, what's going to happen for 2012. What I would tell you is that the pricing increase for this year is essentially almost by default on spring and fall items for this year. So we're not aware of any significant impact on shipments for 2011. What I would tell you is that we're going to concentrate on brand momentum. We talked a lot about POS and brand share this morning. And we're going to continue to concentrate on creating positive POS for our brands because that's what ultimately drives our shipments.","Kevin M. Farr","So I think with regard to year end 2011 and the price increase, retailers are tightly managing inventory. So I don't think they really bought ahead due to the price increase. I do think, as you mentioned about first half, second half, I do think since we shipped a lot of Cars in the second quarter in 2011, we'll have tough comps in the second quarter. So it probably will be more of a back half versus first half due to the fact that Cars will continue to do well this year. It's never been properties, it's done well over the last 5 years. But we won't see that big lift in the second quarter as retailers were really focusing on Cars as a tent-pole event and really getting their shelf space up to drive that brand through the summer season.","John Taylor","And then last question on HIT. So you've already had the big chunk of the toy license, which is in your revenue base now. What do you expect the primary revenue driver on HIT to be in 2012? Is it going to come from international? Is it going to come from licensing income because the wood stuff doesn't come on  until 2013, right? So I wonder what you're looking at as the, specifically, the driver for that property this year?","Kevin M. Farr","Yes, I think it is growing the business in the licensing area and growing its global reach. What we saw, at least in the business that we have, the license business this year with regard to die cast and plastic toys, we saw a good growth of Thomas outside the U.S. in our second year of that license.","Bryan G. Stockton","And JT, one of the things that we love about the Thomas brand is that it's a great brand, and it still has, we think, lots of global potential. So you'll continue to hear us talk about the opportunity to grow Thomas out of its current core markets and broaden its participation markets like Latin America, for example.","Operator","Our last question comes from Tim Conder with Wells Fargo Securities.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Bryan, a couple of quick ones here to wrap it up. On HIT, I just wanted to revisit, I think you'd said before that it's going to take you about 2 years to get everything fully integrated, bring in the plastic and the die cast and your own factories and so forth. So post-acquisition, integration costs and everything, do you anticipate as you see things at this point that 40% EBITDA margin getting back to that level once you get everything all input? That's the first question and then similarly on Fisher-Price, I think you mentioned that maybe it's going to be a 2- to 3-year turnaround process in the past and you just put in some new management there early during 2011 midpoint. So just maybe an update on that timetable.","Kevin M. Farr","Yes, on the first one, yes. I think once we get HIT integrated, we continue to grow the business globally. I would expect that our margins would be as good or better than they delivered previously.","Bryan G. Stockton","And Tim, on Fisher-Price, we're -- like I just mentioned in the remarks, we're very happy with the progress that we've made on the Fisher-Price brand relaunch. The Joy of Learning campaign just kicked off in October. As I think we mentioned, we're going to be working more on digital communication with the new moms. And it's a huge global opportunity. So we'll talk a little bit more about what our plans are for 2012 when we get together with you again in a few weeks. But it is going to be another transition year for Fisher-Price. There's a lot of things that we want to do to get this right. We're going to be patient and get it done the right way. So that we have a brand that will continue to be very prosperous into the future.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then lastly just a little bit on legal, sort of where everything stands. You've given some guidance on the cost side, but the appeal of the original $310 million judgment, where does that stand? And then anything that you can say, the MGA's been talking about antitrust in the U.S. I think they filed a fourth itineration of the same thing and then talking about the EU potential also. So any -- just on those 3 topics, as it relates to legal?","Bryan G. Stockton","Well, I'm not going to spend a lot of time commenting on it, because this is litigation that's ongoing. But I will make a -- 2 comments about timing. Number one, on our appeal, we expect to file our opening appeal brief by the end of February, February 27, so that is underway. As it relates to the antitrust case here in the U.S., we filed a motion to dismiss that complaint, and we expect the motion will be heard about February 13. So those are the 2 things that I can't comment on as it relates to MGA.","Kevin M. Farr","Thanks to everybody.","Drew Vollero","Thank you. There will be a replay of this call available beginning at 11:30 a.m. Eastern time today. The number to call in for the replay is area code (404) 537-3406, and the passcode is 40640038.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct the question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Dave Zbojniewicz, Head of Investor Relations. Mr. Zbojniewicz, you may begin. ","Dave Zbojniewicz","Thank you, operator. And good afternoon, everyone. Joining me today are Ynon Kreiz, Mattel\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Richard Dickson, Mattel\u2019s President and Chief Operating Officer; and Joe Euteneuer, Mattel\u2019s Chief Financial Officer.","As you know, this afternoon, we reported Mattel\u2019s 2019 first quarter financial results. We will begin today\u2019s call with Ynon and Joe providing commentary on our results and then we will provide time for Ynon, Richard and Joe to take your questions.","To help guide our discussion today, we have provided you with a slide presentation. Our discussion, slide presentation and earnings release reference non-GAAP financial measures, including gross sales, adjusted gross profit and adjusted gross margin, adjusted other selling and administrative expenses, adjusted operating income or loss, adjusted earnings or loss per share, earnings before interest depreciation and amortization or EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and constant currency. Please note, that the sales figures referenced on this call will be stated in constant currency.","In the first quarter of 2019, we modified our gross sales reporting structure and present revenues by categories and reorganized our international sales regional reporting structure. In addition, we have provided supplemental gross sales disclosures by brand.","Further detail regarding the brands that are included in each category, as well as the changes made to the international sales regional structure, can be found in the exhibits to the earnings release and Note 23 to Mattel's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2019. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.","The information required by Regulation G regarding non-GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release and slide presentation and both documents are available in the Investors section of our corporate website, corporate.mattel.com.","Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind you that certain statements made during the call may include forward-looking statements relating to the future performance of our business, brands and product lines. These statements are based on currently available information and they are subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.","We describe some of these uncertainties in the Risk Factors section of our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K, our 2018 Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, our earnings release and the presentation accompanying this call, in other filings we make with the SEC from time-to-time, as well as in our other public statements. Mattel does not update forward-looking statements and expressly disclaims any obligation to do so, except as required by law.","Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Ynon.","Ynon Kreiz","Thank you everyone for joining our first quarter earnings call. It was another strong quarter, demonstrating meaningful progress in the execution of our strategy, a significant improvement in profitability and a solid performance in our top line. The positive momentum exiting 2018 has continued and is reflected in our operating results.","While this is a multi-year turnaround and there is still a lot of work to do, I continue to be inspired by the commitment, resilience and capabilities of our organization ,as we transform Mattel into an IP-driven high-performing toy company.","Our first quarter results set a solid foundation for the year and we remain on track to achieve our goals to restore profitability and regain top line growth in the short to mid-term and capture the full value from our IP in the mid to long-term.","While the first quarter may be small seasonally in terms of revenues, we did well in the face of a number of adverse comparisons including the timing of Easter and foreign exchange as well as the evolving retail environment due to the Toys \u201cR\u201d Us liquidation.","Our first quarter results exceeded expectations with significant improvement across the P&L. Some of the more notable financial highlights in the first quarter compared to the last year include; gross revenues were up 2% in constant currency, adjusted gross margin was 38% up 670 basis points, adjusted operating income improved by $147 million, adjusted EBITDA improved by $136 million, and our operating cash flows improved by $81 million.","Moving on to our gross sales by category. Our doll category gross sales grew 3% in constant currency driven primarily by Barbie, which was up 13% as it kicked off its global 60th anniversary celebration and continued momentum in Polly Pocket partially offset by declines in American Girl. As it relates to American Girl, we are confident about the potential of the brand.","This summer some of the work on our plan will be revealed with a much broader merchandising and quantum strategy launching this fall. This will include new product introductions, in line architecture, the launch of additional experience in our New York and Chicago flagship stores and a completely new digital consumer engagement platform. All this, will be supported by a comprehensive marketing plans and YouTube content with influencers. We will share more with you as we get closer to the launch dates.","Our vehicles category grew 2% in constant currency with Hot Wheels up 9% and Matchbox up 13%. The strong performance was partially offset by the expected decline of Cars. Hot Wheels finished its biggest first quarter in history and the brand continues to expand its consumer engagement beyond the toy aisle becoming the number one boy\u2019s toys channel on YouTube. Our infant toddler and preschool category was down 11% in constant currency with Fisher-Price and Thomas & Friends revenues down 5%. The category was further impacted by the expected lower sales for some of our partner brands.","As you know, Fisher-Price announced a voluntary recall of its Rock 'n Play Sleeper working in partnership with the Consumer Product Safety Commission. I want to emphasize that Mattel has always held the safety of children as its highest priority and we take these matters very seriously. Fisher-Price has a long proud heritage of prioritizing safety as its mission and we are certainly continuing that tradition. Joe will walk through details related to the financial impact of the voluntary recall.","Notwithstanding the recall impact, we feel confident about the trust consumers have in the brand the direction of the franchise and its growth potential. At the recent New York Toy Fair, Fisher-Price won two Toy Industry Associations, Toy of the Year awards. We are excited to introduce our new product offerings, which include three new lines and the reintroduction of Rescue Heroes one of our classic properties.","Action figures, building sets and games together grew 22% in constant currency benefiting from the shipping of our Toy Story four product line in advance of the second quarter movie release, continued strength with Jurassic World and UNO as well as growth in MEGA. Jurassic World continues to resonate on the shelf and we were also honored to win another Toy of The Year award in the action figure category, benefiting from a very successful partnership with Universal.","From a regional perspective, our performance was encouraging with growth in both North America and international including a notable improvement in Asia-Pacific. Gross sales in North America grew 6% in constant currency. This was another solid quarter for the region across multiple categories with most customers performing above expectations. Our team and retail partners have collaborated very effectively in planning and executing the business absent Toys 'R' Us.","International gross sales grew 4% with EMEA up 4%, Latin America up 9% and Asia-Pacific down 3%. Although the European toy market is also experiencing significant disruption at retail, we continue to see growth in several key European markets. Our regional teams have proactively adjusted our channel strategy and further developed our omnichannel capabilities.","We also maintained our strength in Latin America, focusing our efforts and growing in the region's two biggest markets, Mexico and Brazil. Our focus on China is also seeing progress and we continued to expect to work through the remaining excess retail inventory by mid-year. It is worth mentioning that our worldwide gross sales increased 2% in constant currency net of a 3% negative impact from American Girl. This speaks to the positive topline momentum of our overall portfolio especially considering the adverse comparisons in the quarter.","While it is still very early in the year, we're off to a positive start. As you know, our Structural Simplification program has been a key driver towards reshaping our operations and restoring profitability. We continued to track well and ended the quarter with $610 million of run rate savings. The progress we're making is clearly reflected in our operating results. And we reiterate our expectation that we will exceed our goal of $650 million run rate savings exiting 2019.","We have also begun to execute on our capital light model. As mentioned before, this is a multiyear comprehensive effort which encompasses optimizing our manufacturing footprint, increasing productivity in our plant infrastructure and achieving efficiencies across the entire supply chain.","As part of this, we are selling or consolidating some of our owned and operated manufacturing facilities while retaining those where we have a significant market advantage on cost, quality and service. In addition, we are rebalancing our global third-party manufacturing network. Given the time line of this effort, we expect to start realizing incremental savings from our capital light model in 2020.","I want to emphasize that while we have been making significant cost improvements, we've been very mindful of protecting and enhancing the commercial and creative capabilities of the company. It is evident that our strategy to become an IP-driven high-performing toy company is demonstrating tangible results.","We are making a meaningful progress on our short to mid-term priorities to restore profitability and regain top line growth, and have been laying the groundwork to capture the full value of our IP in the mid- to long-term.","Mattel Films continues to build momentum. In the quarter, we announced the first ever live-action feature films for American Girl and View-Master, each in partnership with MGM. To date, we have announced a total of five film projects with more to come.","In February, Mattel Television announced a slate of 22 television programs that we're taking to market. The animated and live-action television programs in development are based on our iconic and globally recognized characters and franchises as well as new IP and will be made for multiplatform distribution.","Our franchise management team is executing on several fronts via strategic partnerships, digital engagement, and consumer product opportunities. For example, in January, we launched UNO!, our first mobile game collaboration with NetEase to players globally on iOS and Android with the free app available through the App Store and Google Play.","2019 started well with a solid performance in our top line and significant improvement in the bottom line. This is the third consecutive quarter achieving our immediate priority of restoring profitability, with gross margin, operating income, EBITDA and EPS, all moving meaningfully in the right direction.","The organization is also coming together, as we are building a winning culture that is performance-driven and results-oriented with creativity and innovation at its core. Our mission is to create innovative products and experiences that inspire, entertain and develop children through play. And our focus remains on methodical execution and creating long-term value for our shareholders.","Now, I would like to turn the call over to Joe, who will cover the financials in more detail and reaffirm our full year guidance.","Joe Euteneuer","Thank you, Ynon, and good afternoon, everyone. Our operating results in the first quarter reflected strong performance and significant improvement across key financial metrics. In addition to gross margin, operating income, EBITDA and earnings per share, which Ynon just mentioned, we also improved our working capital and operating cash flow. Importantly, we are demonstrating our ability to consistently execute on a quarter-by-quarter basis.","Looking at our first quarter results, gross sales were down 2% as reported and up 2% year-over-year in constant currency. The increase in gross sales in constant currency was driven by dolls, vehicles, and action figures, building sets and games. Partially offset by a decline in infant toddler preschool.","As expected, because of the shift in Easter, POS from Mattel was down low-single-digits in the quarter, excluding the impact of Toys \u201cR\u201d Us. As Ynon mentioned, Fisher-Price recently announced a voluntary recall of the Rock 'n Play Sleeper, which was conducted in partnership with the Consumer Product Safety Commission.","The estimated total impact of the voluntary recall on our operating income in the quarter was $27 million. This consisted of a negative impact to cost of sales of $22 million based on the impairment of our owned inventory and estimated consumer return rates and a $5 million net sales reduction related to returns from retailers.","Separate from the loss of future Rock 'n Play product sales, which I will discuss more in a few minutes there may be additional recall related expenses in the year, but we do not expect them to be material.","Our reported gross margin was 34.8% of net sales, up 390 basis points from the 30.9% in the first quarter of 2018. This included a negative impact of the $27 million in estimated cost related to the voluntary recall and the benefit from the absence of the 2018 Toys \u201cR\u201d Us net sales reversal of $30 million.","Excluding the cost of sales impact of the voluntary recall, our adjusted gross margin was 38% of net sales, up from 31.3% in the first quarter of 2018. The significant improvement of the 670 basis points was primarily driven by approximately 450 basis points of realized savings from Structural Simplification and 300 basis points from the benefit of the absence of the 2018 Toys \u201cR\u201d Us net sales reversal. This was partially offset by 150 basis points of product cost inflation.","Advertising as a percent of net sales was 10.1%, which was flat year-over-year. Reported SG&A was $301 million, which improved by $123 million or 29% year-over-year. Adjusted SG&A was $293 million, an improvement of $106 million or 27%. This year-over-year improvement was primarily driven by the benefit of the absence of the Q1 2018 Toys \u201cR\u201d Us bad debt expense of $57 million and $35 million of realized savings from Structural Simplification.","Adjusted operating loss was $100 million, an improvement of $147 million, compared to a loss of $247 million in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA was a negative $26 million, an improvement of $136 million, compared to a negative $161 million in the prior year.","This substantial improvement in both adjusted operating loss and adjusted EBITDA were driven by Structural Simplification savings and the benefit from the absence of the Q1 2018 Toys \u201cR\u201d Us sales reversal as well as the related bad debt expense. Our income tax expense was $6 million in the first quarter and includes a number of discrete tax items.","Moving to the balance sheet. Due to the adoption of the new lease accounting standards in 2019, we now include assets and liabilities related to leases on the balance sheet. We ended the first quarter with a cash balance of $380 million.","In the quarter, our working capital improved slightly year-over-year as a result of accounts receivable decreasing 8% driven by improved collections. This improvement resulted in a four-day reduction in our days sales outstanding to 82 days. Additionally owned inventory decreased 9% as a result of our continued efforts to tightly manage our inventory.","Moving to cash flows. Our operating cash flow usage improved $81 million to $193 million, primarily driven by lower net loss, excluding noncash charges and lower working capital usage. We continue to feel good about our capital structure and are confident that we have sufficient liquidity to both run our business efficiently as well as make strategic investments to grow the topline.","We have no debt maturities until October 2020. Structural Simplification has been the primary driver of our significant improvement in profitability over the last three quarters. And as Ynon said, to-date, we have achieved $610 million of run rate savings and expect to exceed our goal of $650 million exiting 2019.","Turning to our capital-light model, we have concluded an extensive review of our supply chain including the analysis of our 13 manufacturing plants and multiple distribution centers as well as an evaluation of our global third-party manufacturing network.","We have begun implementation and are moving quickly, but continue to pace our progress thoughtfully without sacrificing safety and quality. We will share key developments as we progress subject to competitive and confidentiality considerations.","Given the timeline of this effort, we expect to start realizing incremental savings from our capital-light model in 2020, which you should see reflected in additional gross margin improvement. We will incorporate expected savings from our capital-light model in our future guidance.","In the first quarter, we spent $11 million on strategic investments of which $7 million was part of our operating expenses. These investments were primarily related to our IT transformation and brand growth opportunities.","Now, I'd like to review our full year 2019 guidance. Starting with the topline, we continue to expect 2019 gross sales to be flat year-over-year in constant currency, which we assume will be partially offset by a 1% to 3% negative impact from foreign exchange.","While we achieved higher than expected revenue and improved top line momentum in the first quarter, we are not changing our full year outlook given the vast majority of the year is still ahead of us and taking into account the estimated loss of Rock 'n Play sales of $30 million to $35 million from Q2 through Q4.","We continue to expect our adjusted gross margin to increase year-over-year to the low 40s. We still anticipate adjusted SG&A will be down year-over-year on a dollar and percentage of sales basis as we continue to benefit from the positive impact of Structural Simplification. We still expect the approximately $115 million of Structural Simplification savings related to actions taken in 2018 and 2019 to materialize in our 2019 SG&A expense.","We will also benefit from the absence of full year Toys \"R\" Us net bad debt expense of $32 million recognized in 2018. These positive contributions to SG&A will be partially offset by general inflation, mirrored increases, and our strategic investments. More specifically, we expect about $40 million in strategic investments to impact SG&A.","Overall, we still expect full year adjusted operating income to be slightly positive. We continue to expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $350 million to $400 million. This significant year-over-year improvement is driven by stronger operating metrics, partially offset by approximately $90 million of input cost inflation and $90 million of strategic investments.","I wanted to update you on our full year outlook on taxes. Recognizing the difficulty in estimating our full year tax expense given the changes in the U.S. and global tax laws and taking into consideration the continuing impact of the valuation allowance primarily against U. S. deferred tax assets we booked in 2017.","Forecasting our tax as quarterly is even more challenging, because our tax expense may be either positively impacted or negatively impacted by discrete tax items which are difficult to predict from both a timing and an outcome perspective. ","When calculating our tax expense discrete tax items must be individually determined and recognized in the period in which they occur. For example, they may relate to a reassessment of prior year tax liabilities because of a tax audit or newly enacted tax law. In addition, the quarterly tax rate may also vary because of the level and mix of income or losses in our foreign jurisdictions.","As I have said the 2017 U.S. valuation allowance impacts the way we record taxes in two ways. During periods of U.S. taxable loss we don't record an income tax benefit. And during periods of U.S. taxable income, we don't record an income tax expense because a valuation allowance is released to cover the related expense. And because of the valuation allowance we do not believe that we will be able to record any benefit for U. S. losses in the foreseeable future.","The income tax expense recorded in our P&L primarily reflects income tax expense in international jurisdictions where we are not in a pre-tax loss position. And this is why you will see as we did in 2018 a tax expense recorded even though we had a worldwide pre-tax loss.","Having said all this, based on our current outlook, we anticipate our income tax expense to be approximately $75 million to $100 million. And as I mentioned earlier this outlook may be impacted by discrete tax items from a tax audit or unplanned changes in the tax law.","Going forward, due to the seasonal nature of our operating results and the potential outsized impact that discrete tax items may have on any individual quarter, we will continue to provide a general full year tax outlook and update you accordingly.","In closing, we are proud of our performance in the quarter, with the resulting benefits clearly materializing across the P&L. We are particularly encouraged that we are showing the third consecutive quarter of improvement in our key profitability metrics. Going forward, we remain focused on consistent progress, methodical execution and the creation of long-term shareholder value.","Thanks for your time today and we will now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Eric Handler with MKM Partners.","Eric Handler","Thank you very much. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about how the profitability of the North America market was versus Europe. And where are you seeing improvements in Europe, and your outlook for that region?","A \u2013Joe Euteneuer","Yeah. So, I mean, North America has benefited from the partnerships that exited with in the fourth quarter with Walmart, Target, et cetera. The growth in profitability really comes from a result across the globe Structural Simplification. We have used that as the driving force to really increase profitability. And as you look at the benefit of an exiting run rate of $610 million right now really comes from an expense take out through gross margin advertising SG&A across the globe.","Ynon Kreiz","I want to add a couple of comments on Europe which is currently in its turnaround. And the team is doing a tremendous job to show a growth of 4% in constant currency in the phase of challenging conditions. And the marketplace is nothing short of a great tribute to their performance. And we remain very confident that they will continue to execute well for the year remainder of the year.","Eric Handler","Great. Just as a follow-up. Can you talk about may be specific countries? Do you expect this to be still in the U.K. problematic throughout the year? How are other areas doing?","Richard Dickson","Yes. We haven't really given that specific information on a country by country basis. But overall, the turnaround plan is really performing good in most of the countries that we have.","Eric Handler","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Gerrick Johnson with BMO Capital Markets.","Gerrick Johnson","Hey good afternoon. Thank you. Thanks for the POS data, but do you have a number for year-to-date including Easter over Easter?","JoeEuteneuer","So in regards to Easter, Easter probably -- the year-over-year comparison probably had a negative 3% to 4% impact on POS for the quarter.","Gerrick Johnson","Okay. So... ","Joe Euteneuer","So think about it this way. POS excluding TRU was down low single digits had a 3% to 4% impact as a result of Easter. So basically for the quarter you were up low single digits.","Gerrick Johnson","Okay, great. And then also regarding Rock 'n Play, do you anticipate legal cost or legal reserve associated with that?","Joe Euteneuer","So right now, we are not commenting on anything. You're talking about litigation, so we really don't comment on outstanding litigation. But right now we've provided for all of the returns et cetera. And any other costs that miscellaneous related to legal or customer service is something we believe is immaterial for the year.","Gerrick Johnson","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Arpine Kocharian with UBS.","Arpine Kocharian","Hi, thank you very much. I wanted to clarify a comment you had in slides where you say tracking to exceed $200 million in realized savings for 2019 before investment. I think a comparable comment a few months back was about $129 million of run rate savings. And it seems like your EBITDA guidance is unchanged. Excluding -- offsetting I guess the Fisher-Price about 27-plus or call it $40 million, it seems like you're expecting incremental $30 million, $40 million. Why isn't EBITDA guidance going up if you're tracking ahead of your cost savings flow-through?","Joe Euteneuer","So I think you have to let me give you an update on your cost savings flow-through. So first of all, there's $149 million of actions that happened in 2018 that were part of the exiting run rate. In regards to the $129 million for the full year, we've said that $50 million to $75 million would be in-period P&L savings of which for the quarter we had $68 million of in-period P&L savings of which probably three quarters of that is a result of the exiting run rate from 2018. In regards to our overall EBITDA, we ended up EBITDA on an adjusted basis of negative $26 million and have guidance to get to $350 million to $400 million. I think that will be a pretty good effort for the last few quarters of the year.","Arpine Kocharian","Okay. Maybe I can follow-up after the call because I still can't reconcile those numbers. In terms of -- I was surprised to see Toy Story shipments this early. In fact in your prior guidance at Toy Fair, you had Toy Story specifically falling in Q2. I usually think of this entertainment shipment being six to eight weeks prior to when the entertainment theaters. Did it ship a little bit earlier than you expected, or was there any initiatives that you took on earlier on?","Richard Dickson","Arpin\u00e9, it's Richard. Nothing unusual. We ship to plan, and we are executing against the plan that we set forth.","Arpine Kocharian","So you expect it to ship Toy Story in Q1 and Q2?","Richard Dickson","Yes, yes. We will ship in both Q1 and Q2. But yes, we ship to plan for in Q1.","Arpine Kocharian","Okay. And then, any way to give some indication of the extent of capital light model cost savings that you guys are looking at beyond 2019 into 2020? I guess which product lines would you outsource? What would the savings look like? I know it's still early on. You probably don't want to share most of that detail. But in terms of sort of giving an initial sizing of what those plans look like would be helpful. Thank you.","Ynon Kreiz","Hi. Arpin\u00e9. We just completed several months of work, of diligent work in putting this plan together. And as we've said before, it is a multi-year plan across the entire supply chain end-to-end. But we look to optimize the manufacturing footprint. But this is more than that, because it's not just about the factories.","It's also about the way we run the entire system from demand planning all the way to putting product on the shelves with the retailers. At this stage, we are not sharing specific details because of some confidential or competitive market information. But we will update you as we go forward. But we are saying today that we have started that process. We do expect savings to flow through starting 2020 that will be incremental to the Structural Simplification plan.","Arpine Kocharian","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Drew Crum with Stifel. ","Drew Crum","Okay. Thanks. It actually number one. Just a point of clarification to start. Joe, I think you said there will be $30 million to $35 million of sales were gone from the Rock 'n Play Sleeper. Is that product specific or is that Fisher-Price as a whole? And if it's not, why not any impact on the brand as a whole?","Joe Euteneuer","So we said $30 million to $35 million is product specific.","Drew Crum","Okay.","Joe Euteneuer","As far as \u2013 yes, so it's product specific.","Drew Crum","Okay. And no anticipation of any spill over to the brand?","Ynon Kreiz","Hi, Drew. The answer is that Fisher-Price has a long heritage of safety and quality going back almost 90 years. It is beloved by children, and has the confidence of the parents. We always said that we worked very hard to earn this trust, and we will continue to work hard every day to maintain it. So while we will -- there maybe some short-term impact.","We believe that long-term the Fisher-Price brand will remain strong and continue to be trusted by parents all over the world. Obviously we didn't plan for this. We didn't expect this challenge, and we didn't build it into our 2019 plan. But we are confident in the brand leadership, in the strategy, in the product offering, and in the rollout of the new segments later in the year.","Drew Crum","Okay. And then maybe for Richard, can you talk about the benefit you saw for the 60th anniversary promo for Barbie? Does that continue through the year? Can you talk about some of the other puts and takes for the brand that needs to be addressed through 2019?","Richard Dickson","Sure. I mean, Barbie's momentum continued certainly into the first quarter. The sales at 13% plus in constant currency is a great reflection of the consistency that we've had in fact six consecutive quarters of year-over-year growth. The 60th anniversary is off to a great start. Role Model, Dream Gap Project, we had a great event in New York got incredible accolades all over the world. In fact landmarks all over the world were lit pink including the Empire State Building, Tokyo Sky Tree, Mexico City's, History Museums, Jakarta's History Museums, Toronto's CN Tower, Sydney's Bondi Beach. I mean, I can go on and on. But we garnered over six billion media impressions, which is truly spectacular for any brand let alone world event. So we are really excited. We continue the success. The programs will continue to rollout. Our segment specifically on careers is really driving the business. But we've got lots of new product and lots of new items throughout the year and are confident in the Barbie program.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Linda Bolton-Weiser with D.A. Davidson.","Linda Bolton-Weiser","Hi. So your cash flow improvement in the quarter was pretty good. And I guess just in terms of my projections based on your comments about working capital I think you said being neutral-ish for the year in your CapEx guide et cetera. I had projected a small free cash flow for the year. But now I'm thinking maybe it can be bigger more substantial. So can we just assume that that's going to be used for debt production? Or can you just give some thoughts on use of cash now that maybe you'll start to actually generate more substantial amount?","Joe Euteneuer","So at this point we are not going to give any future guidance on how we are going to use the cash. But obviously, we will look at it at that point in time and use it most effectively for our shareholders.","Linda Bolton-Weiser","Okay. And then, can you give a little bit of color on how your performance at retail is going in terms of new shelf space or additional new retailers that you've garnered to kind of build that Toys 'R' Us haul. Are consumers becoming accustomed to shopping for your brands in those places? And can you also comment on what your e-commerce growth was in the quarter and your market share positioning there as well? Thanks.","Ynon Kreiz","Well, first of all, as you know the Toys 'R' Us situation is largely in the U.S. and the U.K. The rest of the world is currently under new ownership. And as it relates to the U.S., we are benefiting from a very strong relationship \u2013 I should say relationships we have across the board with our core customers and the distribution network built over many years of work. We sometimes need to remind ourselves that we have a distribution network of more than 140,000 doors in North America out of 375,000 doors worldwide. So it's pretty vast and global. Following last year, we kept on working closely with all of our partners and are seeing growth in-store and online with the majority of our customers and have specific plans for the remainder of the year. We also are seeing growth with other type of retail such as grocery stores, drug stores, department stores, value chains, and specialty channels and so forth.","So we do see that the market has moved on. And the fact that we are up in North America 6% with the adverse comp to last year of Toys \u201cR\u201d Us without Toys \u201cR\u201d Us is a strong indication for performance in the quarter for life without Toys \u201cR\u201d Us. So we moved on.","","Linda Bolton-Weiser","How was your e-commerce growth in the quarter?","Ynon Kreiz","We are not providing specific breakdown. But it is up and we are satisfied with the direction it's heading.","Linda Bolton-Weiser","Okay. Thanks.","Ynon Kreiz","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Ng with Goldman Sachs.","Mike Ng","Hi. Thank you very much for the question. I might just have a few if I could. The first is just on Asia Pac and China. I think originally you were expecting a low single digit headwind from China in the first quarter and I think also in the second quarter. It seems like the Asia Pac numbers were pretty good. Did that low single digit headwind come through and could you just comment on the health of the China inventory? Do you still expect it to be clean by mid-2019?","Ynon Kreiz","Hi, Michael. Yes, we are making good progress in Asia in general and in China specifically. I actually just came back from a trip. We spent time with the team. We went to multiple cities, sat down with our partners and we\u2019re definitely seeing progress. We\u2019re still down for the quarter. And as you said we will also be down next quarter. But we do expect to make meaningful progress in the year. As it happens this week is where we -- is when a new Head of China, a new General Manager in China just started. So we also have a new strong team in place and we feel much better about where we are now relative to just a few quarters ago. So, obviously, it's still to be delivered. But directionally we are in a good place.","Mike Ng","Great, thank you. And I just have two housekeeping questions. The first back is could you make a comment about the health of the channel inventory? And the second is, do you still expect Fisher-Price stabilization at the end of the year? Thank you very much","Joe Euteneuer","So in regards to your first question, I mean we've worked hard over the last couple of quarters to make sure our supply was meeting demand, and not the other way around. So we feel very good that we've worked very hard with our retail partners across the globe to maintain the right inventory levels and their locations along with balancing it at ours.","And in regards to Fisher-Price, I think the way to look at it is that the $30 million to $35 million of sales impact going forward for the next three quarters on a $1 billion business is roughly a couple of low percentage points. We've not changed our guidance overall. Fisher-Price has a little more work to do. And remember we were confident that the back half of the year is when the new products are coming. And so we stand pact in regards to our belief in Fisher-Price. And again it's so early in the year it's too early to break any changes at this point.","Mike Ng","Great. Thank you both.","Joe Euteneuer","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Conder with Wells Fargo Securities.","Tim Conder","Thank you. Joe just may be there's a lot of question that was alluded to earlier. Can you may be just walk us through the bridge again from where your EBITDA -- adjusted EBITDA ended to the $350 million to $400 million is one.","And then if you would have any color on may be by the breakdown of the geographic areas or a couple of the major brands in POS either for the quarter itself or through year-to-date through Easter any additional color they will be appreciated. Thank you.","Joe Euteneuer","Sure. So, in regards to the POS, overall, we talked about excluding TRU. Overall, the company was down low single digits. Dolls overall for the globe was up double-digits. Vehicles was down. Hot Wheels was down low single-digits. So, that's some color.","If you're looking for regional basis, you see low single-digits down in North America excluding TRU, same thing internationally. So, excluding TRU, we are just down low single-digits from a POS standpoint.","Richard Dickson","Yes, and I can just add a little bit of sentiment here as well. When you look at particularly in Barbie and Hot Wheels, the consistency that we're experiencing is really encouraging for the balance of the year. Obviously, core brands like that up significantly. Barbie up double-digit. Hot Wheels also trending really well.","So, also important to note on Hot Wheels we are up against the 50th anniversary last year. So, we are expecting to have someone of a little bit of a challenge out there. But really experiencing great connectivity with our consumers, our Legends Tour which we built last year is multiplying multiple cities with Walmart this year. It's one of the key drivers of POS.","We've introduced also the Monster Truck Show -- live shows that are also driving POS. And as we also mentioned on our partnership brands, particularly with Jurassic, it's had a great start to its second year bucking the trends of what would be movie year two. So, we are quite confident in that line as well.","So, overall as we exit the first quarter which while it's small is a good indication of how the year's going we are feeling quite good about where we are.","Joe Euteneuer","Yes. So, in regards to--","Tim Conder","Okay Joe and then on the -- just to revisit that bridge from 2018, EBIT down the $350 million to $400 million again?","Joe Euteneuer","Yes. Sure Tim. We had a good quarter and I think the things you had to think about in regards to Structural Simplification and comparing 2018 to 2019 is that if you remember in the back half of 2018 is when we really started to materialize savings from Structural Simplification versus the first half.","And so we have a sort of easier comparison in the first half of the year and a more comparable comparison in the back half of the year. So that's one of the things. In regards to investments, if you saw the investments we reported in the quarter, investments will be more backend loaded so in the back half of the year. And the other comparables we had is remember TRU that we were talking about. And then also remember the PA distribution warehouse that happened last year. That was first half expenses and the benefit in the back half. So, I think it's more of a comparability of timing than actual anything else.","Tim Conder","Okay, great. Thank you.","Joe Euteneuer","Thanks Tim.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Chartier with Monness Crespi.","Jim Chartier","Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to talk about the strategic investments you're making at advertising this year. It looks like the advertising will be 50% of the total $90 million of investments in OpEx this year seems like a big number. So curious what kind of sales lift you're expecting from those investments? And if you could talk about may be some of the bigger initiatives either by brand or however you want to talk about it? And then, what kind of gives you confidence to make such an investment in advertising this year? Thanks.","Joe Euteneuer","Sure. One of the things that we have been doing is really evaluating the effectiveness of our advertising so that we could over the last few quarters, so that we could target our money more effectively. So when you think about that spend in regards to advertising, you're talking about online content, which includes like animated series, influencer programs, product-related videos all of those things that the new consumers are really watching and trying to make their decision on what to buy. And so when we think about that this effort is going around across the company. It's helping Europe with this turnaround. It's helping North America with this. And obviously in Asia a good portion of what gets sold there is online. So we think we are just moving to where the consumer is going and try to be as effective as we can with our spend.","Jim Chartier","And then are you assuming any material sales lift from that advertising investment or is this more of across this later on?","Ynon Kreiz","Yes. When you talk about sales lift, what we are trying to do is to get to flat for this year and stop the negative losses we've had over the past five years. So I think that's really what's happening, it's allowing us to finally get to flat and then look to turn up going forward.","Jim Chartier","Great. Thank you.","Ynon Kreiz","Thanks, Jim.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from William Reuter with Bank of America.","William Reuter","Hi, guys. With regard to the investments you're going to be making this year are those permanent or should we expect that those are one-time-ish in nature and then you will be kind of like I guess thinking about it again freshly in 2020?","Joe Euteneuer","Right. Our investment program that we talked about in 2018 and 2019 has really been individual items that we've made investment at that point in time and that's it. So yes, we would have -- we would not give any guidance in 2020, but yes, it's not an ongoing investment. It's a one-time investment.","William Reuter","Okay. And then just as a follow-up with regard to some of these facilities that you're leaving as a result of the capital light, are you going to be receiving some proceeds? And is there anyway to give us any sort of I guess expectations for how large those proceeds could be?","Joe Euteneuer","So we are not providing any guidance on that currently just because of the sensitivity and confidentiality of the information. Dealing in foreign jurisdictions and the local governments and the workforce, we want to make sure that we are not triggering anything ahead of time that would cause us an adverse condition.","Ynon Kreiz","We've -- and just to say while there might be some benefits in terms of proceeds, this is mostly about efficiency and improving cost structure and gross margin. That's where the focus is, okay?","William Reuter","Thank you.","Ynon Kreiz","Thanks, Bill.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Greg Badishkanian with Citigroup.","Greg Badishkanian","Great. Thank you. At the TTPM Toy Fair today you had a pretty sizable new toy line up for Toy Story. So how big of an opportunity could that be for 2019? And then if we think about entertainment overall for 2019, should we expect at least some modest growth year-over-year given some of the properties you are tied to?","Richard Dickson","Hey, Greg, it's Richard. We are very obviously excited about the Toy Story product line up. As our retailers and as the line gets out there, we are anticipating consumers will as well. Early reads although it's just hitting the floor are pretty good. We don't normally size these partner relationships. But I can tell you that we're extremely bullish on Toy Story 4 both from a product and story perspective.","We are also well teamed up with Disney around the world in our execution plans. Retailers are supporting the property with significant space and retail marketing. And we really believe that coupled with what will be another very good Jurassic year will be a powerful entertainment year particularly in action figures for Mattel and ultimately the industry as these properties drive excitement into the aisle and drive connectivity to the toy spaces all over the world. So we are very excited about Toy Story. But in general, the action figure business for us is a category that we are excited about 2019.","Greg Badishkanian","Great. Also just the line of the BTS dolls as well at the Toy Fair. Is that something that could -- that you sense could still be pretty sizable and incremental this year?","Richard Dickson","Yeah. Look as you saw and as we all see BTS is a phenomenon. It's a great anticipated bet that Mattel has made. We quickly reacted to a trend and executed against product that is taking shape. We've introduced this product through a really innovative social media strategy.","As we've been revealing the dolls and characters, we are garnering incredible traffic associated with what they called the BTS Army, who are the fans that ultimately are the ones that we're attracting to at least on the forefront buy the dolls. Retailers are getting more and more excited about it. We've got some great commitment from a space perspective. And we hope and anticipate that it will be a really fun and lucrative new line for us.","Greg Badishkanian","Great. Thank you very much.","Richard Dickson","Thanks, Greg.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Felicia Hendrix with Barclays.","Felicia Hendrix","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So Richard, well, the whole team you guys did better than everyone anticipated in the quarter. But Richard I was hoping you could lay out for us what the biggest surprises were in the quarter for you?","Richard Dickson","Felicia, I would be honest and tell you that there were no real surprises. I think we had some big expectations on some brands and some small expectations on others and overall on balance. We met exactly what we thought we were going to do.","It is a small quarter as you know. A lot of it obviously takes place in the back half. But it's a good indication of where we are headed. Retailers are just setting up, a lot of their lines, the floors get set, we get early reads on some of our product lines, and so far so good.","I will tell you, of course, we are most pleased with the performance of the Barbie brand. As you know, it's been a real work in progress in the last several years and the consistency that we've seen consumer takeaway, retailer support, and frankly the press reaction to the programs has been terrific.","So, overall, I would tell you that we've got a great portfolio coming together. And I think our partnership brands with Toy Story 4 that's going to be a great one for us. Jurassic year 2. In our games business, I'm really pleased with UNO. I think you're going to see in the back half a lot more strength in the games category coming from Mattel with some terrific new items. So, in general, I would say, I'm pleased and I would say we are poised for a good year with execution in mind.","Felicia Hendrix","So that's helpful. And then just flipping just around and I know you guys are trying to kind of transition from prior patterns in terms of giving guidance, but it just seems like with all the momentum so strong -- and Joe you said in the beginning of the call, you just \u2013 there's a lot of year left in the year. So you don't want to get ahead of yourselves with the guidance. But when you think about the rest of the year, what are you cautious on then? ","Joe Euteneuer","Well \u2013 and, I mean, when you think about the first quarter for ourselves internally, I know the numbers look good to you externally. To us, we're performing to our plan. So when I look at BTS and some of these other things that look like they're going to be great in the marketplace, we've already built those into what we have going forward. Now is there upside? Potentially. But there's still so much of the year left. We don't want to get ahead of ourselves before we really sort of have an idea of where things are going to go.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay. Understood. And Joe, while I have you, just a balance sheet question, just with the high-yield market. It's at near recent heights and your 2020 \u2013 I'm sorry, 2025 are back over par, would you consider paying off the 2020 with available liquidity or terming them out as bonds?","Joe Euteneuer","You know what, we are looking at that. We haven't made any decisions yet. So we will come back to you on that. ","Felicia Hendrix","Okay. And then just with the...","Ynon Kreiz","And, Felicia\u2026","Felicia Hendrix","Okay.","Ynon Kreiz","Sorry, go ahead. ","Felicia Hendrix","I want to say, welcome to Dave Z. Welcome back. I wanted to say that.","Ynon Kreiz","All right. Great.","Felicia Hendrix","All right. Thanks. ","Ynon Kreiz","Thanks, Felicia. I just want to tag on Joe's comment on the rest of the year. Our job is to do the best we can and we clearly are very focused on execution and are very proud of the fact that we are able to do that consistently now and improve numbers, especially profitability for three quarters in a row.","This quarter was performed better than expectations, but it is a small quarter. And as you said, with a lot of the year to go, it's just too early to make any changes. Notwithstanding that, we are doing what we have to do and just keep at it and keep performing.","But there's a long -- there's a lot \u2013 if we do perform per the guidance, I just want to remind everyone, it will mean that we will achieve flat revenues up to five years of consecutive decline. And if we hit the top end of our range, i.e., $400 million adjusted EBITDA, it will mean that we double EBITDA year-on-year, adjusted EBITDA year-on-year.","And if these things happen, it will be the highest improvement in operating income in 10 years. So this is not an easy task and we appreciate the confidence and the recognition, the momentum. But we want to do things in the right cadence, in the right order and recognize that this is a multi-year turnaround and things will take time. Next questions. No more?","Operator","I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to management for any closing remarks.","Ynon Kreiz","Thank you operator and thank you everyone for joining the call today.

Sir, you may begin.","Drew Vollero","Thank you, Latoya. As you know, this morning, we reported Mattel's 2014 first quarter financial results. We've provided you with a slide presentation to help guide our discussion today. The slide presentation and the information required by Regulation G regarding non-GAAP financial measures is available on the Investors and Media Section of our corporate Web site, corporate.mattel.com.","In a few minutes, Bryan Stockton, Mattel's Chairman and CEO and Kevin Farr, Mattel's CFO, will provide comments and the results, and then the call will be open for your questions.","Certain statements made during the call may include forward-looking statements relating to the future performance of our overall business, brands and product lines. These statements are based on currently available information, and they're subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties, which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. We described some of these uncertainties in the Risk Factor section of our 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K and our 2013 quarterly reports on Forms 10-Q and in other filings we make with the SEC from time to time, as well as in other public statements. Mattel does not update forward-looking statements and expressly disclaims any obligation to do so.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bryan.","Bryan G. Stockton","Thank you Drew and good day everyone. When we spoke with you in February, we said the key to success in 2014 will be to improve POS, and to do that we needed to introduce more product and brand innovation, improve the execution of our promotion and marketing spending and to leverage some of the tailwinds we had coming out of 2013. We also said we needed to work through inventory both owned and at retail in the first half of the year as well as manage the cost structure to align with more realistic revenue assumptions.","Overall, we made progress in the quarter on a number of these areas. However, it is the preseason the time we use to make adjustments for the fall, and we recognize we have a lot of work to do as we continue to prepare for the all important holiday season.","Let me briefly outline the results for the quarter. As expected, revenues were down slightly as we worked our way through pockets of retail inventory, managed our owned inventory and shifted trade spend and advertising to the back half of the year. Gross margins were lower than prior year and down a little more than expected reflecting the progress made on managing inventories. That said, we continue to manage gross margins for the full year and remain committed to our near-term outlook of low to mid 50% gross margins.","Advertising expenses were low in the quarter both in dollars and by percentage as we shift spending to later in the year. SG&A was up slightly consistent with the outlook we shared with you in February including incremental severance expenses of $16 million tied to our ongoing OE 3.0 initiatives. And we remained committed to sound capital deployment in the quarter. We raised our dividend, 6% announced our plans to acquire MEGA Brands and continue to buyback our owned stock.","In regards to POS, we did see some improvement in the quarter versus the 2013 policies, but there is more work to be done here. Excluding the timing impact of Easter week which comes later this year our global POS was down low single digits in the quarter, but recently was improving to essentially flat over the last few weeks. Domestically we saw improving trends during the quarter although POS still ended down high single-digits. And in International, POS showed improving performance ending the quarter up mid-single digits.","As I said, one of the keys to driving improved POS is to introduce more product and brand innovation and I feel we made good progress here. In the quarter we launched BOOMco., our differentiated entry into the NPD Blaster category. We also expanded the distribution of our new franchise ever after high from a handful of markets to essentially a global launch.","At Fisher-Price, we saw a strong and positive consumer reaction to our new innovative offerings in the baby care business. And we continue to invest in digital content launching new and improved websites for both Barbie and Hot Wheels as well as providing new content for a number of our core brands.","Another key to driving POS is to improve the execution of our marketing and promotional spending. As I\u2019ve mentioned before the consumer path to purchase is expanding and becoming much more complex. And with our over $1 billion in trade spend and advertising yet to be committed, we have the opportunity to adjust our spending and make it more effective and efficient.","In the quarter, we began applying more science and analytics to how, where and when we should spend this money and began to develop programs with our retail partners. You can see we\u2019ve reduced spending in the quarter, so we can shift spending later where it will be much more impactful. This will give us the flexibility and funds to execute the strategies that are coming out of our marketing mix modeling study.","We plan to continue to shift spending to the back half of the year. And like last year, these actions are likely to impact Q2 revenue performance slightly that we believe they will allow us to align our spending to drive POS and top line revenues in the all important holiday season.","We also made progress in the quarter managing inventory both owned and retail. But again, we have more work to do. First, we reduced the year-over-year impact that Mattel owned inventory by about 50% or about $50 million in the quarter. And second, we made progress against retail inventories. As expected, domestic retail inventories are up slightly given the later timing of Easter this year. And in International markets, we worked through pockets of carryover inventory in select markets, but still have work to do in key regions like Latin America.","Another area we discussed with you was managing our cost structure. We made a lot of progress in the quarter aligning the companies cost structure through our operational excellence 3.0 program, which achieved $16 million in gross savings in the quarter. We did make some tough decisions in regards to the organization, which is reflected in the additional severance charges taken in the quarter.","And while we always approach decisions like this with great sensitivity, we do believe the actions we are undertaking are necessary to better position Mattel to grow its business globally. Actions like these will allow us to continue to fund expansion into strategic geographies like Russia, China and allow us to continue to make strategic investments in new categories and franchises.","Now, while we made progress on our 2014 action plan, the toy industry continued to be pretty steady. According to NPD results through February showed the U.S. flat and Euro 5 up moderately. The results to-date are encouraging but we recognize it that it\u2019s early and they are a number of factors that impact these results. Specifically, retailers are shifting this spring planograms and continue to tightly manage retail inventories and buy only what is selling.","And the timing of Easter always complicates the yearly results in markets like the U.S. where Easter is an important toy holiday. And as we see every year we anticipate all these factors to settle up and normalize later in the second quarter.","Looking into the quarter in a little more detail, we see the Girls portfolio results as mixed with overall POS positive but shifting down slightly. American Girl continues to grow and show strength despite comping 32% growth in the prior year quarter, which also included Easter Week.","Our new Girl of the Year, Isabelle, is off to a great start and we are continuing to see good consumer takeaway across our doll lines and channels. We\u2019re continuing to see high consumer demand for Disney Princess product, driven by the success of Frozen as well as Sofia. Barbie shipping was down 14% in the quarter. In the U.S. consumer takeaway continues to be down and in International where Barbie POS was positive, shipping was impacted by retail inventory headwinds.","Our focus here remains to improve POS for the year and we shifted some advertising to later in the year where we feel it will be more impactful. While we see improvement, we clearly have more work to do here. Monster High is now a well-established property in the industry and remains a key component of a much larger Mattel Girls portfolio. In the quarter, Monster High toy shipping was down in domestic and international markets as they faced a challenging quarter one comp. However, toy sales continued to grow in emerging markets like Russia. And Monster High consumer products businesses continued to grow across all regions.","And while it\u2019s still early, our latest franchise, Ever After High, looks to be a solid single at this point. In markets where we had an earlier launch, we have good retail support, strong consumer engagement and we're seeing good shipping and sell through patterns. It was good to see Hot Wheels grow in the quarter, both domestically and internationally driven by demand for our basic cars. We saw increased traffic to our relaunched Hot Wheels website and successfully launched our new Team Hot Wheels animated content.","As for Fisher-Price, we continue to make progress on the four key strategies we highlighted in February, launching a new marketing campaign, bringing more innovative product to market, growing the business globally and leveraging new licenses. In the quarter, we began to roll out our new digital campaign, love every moment targeting the Millennium mark.","We saw positive consumer response to our new innovative BabyGear products. We began to roll out localized marketing and region specific products to our international markets including our emerging consumer line that specifically targets the growing middle class with a popular product at a good price point.","We continue to develop product for Julius Jr. as well as product to support the new Dora and Friends: Into the City! series from Nickelodeon coming out in August. Our Friends business was down as it too had a very challenging comparison to prior year, which included the successful launch of our Thomas Wood line as well as strong momentum from Jake and the Never Land Pirates and Dora\u2019s 10th Anniversary. We were happy to see our strategic efforts for Thomas & Friends to improve execution, expand content placement and build brand awareness begin to pay off in strategic markets like Latin America and Asia-Pacific.","Mattel sales were down across its International Regions reflecting the performance of our Girls Portfolio and Fisher-Price, as well as the impact with inventory headwinds in select markets. In the quarter Europe was down slightly with declines in quarter, partially offset by continued strong growth in Russia as well as strength in other Eastern European countries. Latin America was down as we continue to manage through pockets of inventory in Brazil and Mexico. And Asia was down as softness in Australia offset double-digit growth in China and strengthened North and Southeast Asia.","Overall I feel we made progress in the first quarter, but we clearly have work to do. And as I said upfront the key to success will be our ability to drive POS. We can already point to progress on product and brand innovation and by managing our spending. We now have more flexibility in our promotional marketing spend to incorporate strategies coming out of our marketing mix initiative.","I also said we\u2019ll drive POS leveraging some of the tailwinds we had coming under 2013. Some of these tailwinds include new innovative product and content across the entire gross portfolio, including American Girl which will continue to expand its retail footprint in the U.S and moving to Canada later this year. American Girl will also begin to leverage its new omni-channel system and enhanced digital marketing capabilities across its entire distribution network. We will also continue to benefit from the global launch of Ever After High as well as the continued success of Disney\u2019s Frozen. And we will continue to roll out new characters and content for Monster High.","We will see new innovation in the Boys portfolio, including our new team Hot Wheels content, the launch of our Marvel and Star Wars Die Cast licenses. And new Disney Planes theatrical release and the continued launch of BOOMco. with the U.S launch set for this summer.","We\u2019ll see new innovation at Fisher-Price including the roll out of our Laugh & Learn, Smart Stages product line. The launch of our Julius Jr. product line as well as support for the new Nickelodeon series Dora and Friends: Into the City!","And here and improved Thomas TrackMaster product and additional content including a new fall DVD release Tale of the Brave. And of course we\u2019ll benefit from the planned acquisition of MEGA Brands. This acquisition advances our strategy to grow by acquiring new brands and to extend our existing brands into other toy categories. It gives us meaningful exposure to the fastest growing categories, construction and arts and crafts.","We continue to believe this is a great opportunity to combine MEGA Brands licenses and expertise with our brands in global scale to create an even stronger and more profitable number two player. We are working on business development plans in anticipation of closing this deal this quarter and we look forward to working with our newest member of the Mattel family.","So in summary, we continue to believe in the toy industry and in our ability to execute given our strong portfolio brands, countries and customers. We will continue to focus on our strategies to drive POS, reduce inventories and align our cost structure as we work towards delivering another profitable year consistent with our one third to top quartile total shareholder return aspiration.","Thank you for your time today and your continued interest in Mattel. And now I would like to introduce Kevin Farr, our Chief Financial Officer. Kevin?","Kevin M. Farr","Thank you Bryan and good morning everyone. As Bryan said, we made good progress in the quarter on a number of areas as we work to deliver top third to top quartile total shareholder returns in the near term. First, we made good progress. We\u2019ve gone to addressing higher retail Mattel-owned inventories. We reduced the year-over-year impact of our owned inventory by about 50% or $50 million and after normalizing for Easter we believe retail inventories are in much better shape from where we were at the beginning of the year.","Second, we aligned our infrastructure with realistic revenue assumptions, which puts us in a better position for 2014 and beyond. We lean into our OE 3.0 cost savings program and made some top strategic decisions in the quarter, including a reduction in force. The savings related to this action will help us to achieve the programs $175 million of gross sustainable savings targeted by year end. We also continue to see savings in gross margin related to our OE 3.0 programs such as our packaging initiative.","Third, we make progress in global POS by leveraging our North American organization and international subsidiaries by working closely with our retail partners. These gains represent a good step forward from our 2013 holiday season, but there is more work to be done.","And finally, as we said given the evolving consumer path to purchase we are working our ways to get a higher return on our advertising spending by bringing better signs and analytics through our advertising and trade spending programs, so spending can work harder and go further. In this regard we make considerable progress on developing a sophisticated marketing mix model which allows us to measure the sales contribution of each of our advertising and trade spending program levels.","As a result we began developing action plans with retailers to implement the findings to leverage our $1 billion of advertising and trade spending in 2014 to drive both global POS and our top line revenues. And although we made good progress execute in the first quarter, our financial results show we still have a lot of work to do.","You can clearly see this when you look at the financial results, total gross revenues $1 billion were down 4% versus the prior year primarily the result of working through pockets of inventory retail, softness in POS, managing our owned inventory and shifting trade in advertising to the back half of the year. The progress we made in the inventory had an obvious effect on first quarter gross margins. We\u2019ve aggressively execute initiatives to reduce Mattel-owned inventories. As a result our gross margin was 50.9% or 330 basis points lower than the prior year.","As we will talk about in a minute with the slide deck, the year-over-year declines in gross margin were really driven by three factors; first, roughly half of the 330 basis point decline in gross margins is due to efforts to reduce Mattel-owned inventories. Second, we did see an increase in royalties for the quarter due to the strength of entertainment properties including Frozen, Planes and Sofia. And third, the remainder of the variance is primarily result of coping against our record margin last year.","The good news with respect to gross margins is that the overall our assumptions around our basket of product cost inline with both with our pricing assumptions and our efficiency programs including OE 3.0.","As we said in February, well we don\u2019t expect the Mattel-owned inventory headwinds to have a material impact in gross margins for the full year, but they will continue to modestly impact the business in the second quarter. There are a lot of factors that impact gross margins and while we don\u2019t manage margins quarter-to-quarter remain committed to our near-term guidance of targeting low to mid 50s gross margins.","Our advertising spending was down both in dollars and percentages as we look to return to levels inline with our 11% historical average and leverage and shift spending to later in the year. And our SG&A was up slightly, upward 4% and consistent with the outlet we gave you earlier, excluding severance SG&A was flat year-over-year. Moving forward strategic growth investments remain high priorities as we continue to balance growth and cost management.","We continue to look for opportunities, invest back in the business to drive future revenues and profits. Right now we are targeting flat spending in absolute dollars on strategic growth initiatives which are already in our cost basis, but that should be ample to fund the right ideas to drive growth in 2014 and beyond.","Our SG&A goal for the year remains consistent with what we have discussed at Toy Fair, which is a modest increase in SG&A in absolute dollars which includes OE 3.0 severance charges and strategic growth investments. We remain committed to achieving our goal delivering operating profit growth of 6% to 8% over the near-term. The planned MEGA Brands\u2019 acquisition is preceding well and we anticipate closing the deal this quarter. The opening balance sheet will be finalized after the acquisition is completed and we should have more information about the financial impact of the deal for you on our second quarter conference call. We still expect the deal to be dilutive in 2014 when you consider deal cost, integration and restructuring cost and the non-cash amortization impacts like the write-up of inventory and amortization related to tangible assets on the opening balance sheet.","Executing these costs, the underlying business should be slightly accretive to operating income in 2014 since we expect to have positive EBITDA. So to summarize, overall we made solid progress in the quarter on a number of fronts, but recognized we have a lot of work to do to deliver top third to top quartile TSR.","Now let\u2019s review our first quarter results starting on page 4 of the slide deck. As you can see our world-wide growth sales were down 4% for the quarter, were sales down 2% in North American region, which includes our North American division and American grow operations and down 7% in international. As I previously said at Toy Fair, New York, we\u2019re seeing a moderate impact in shipping in the first quarter due to retail inventory headwinds and continued softness in POS.","Turning to page 5 of the presentation, you can see the brand perspective and sales. World-wide sales for Mattel Girls and Boys Brands were down 5% for the quarter. We continue to see strong demand for Disney Sofia increased interest in Disney\u2019s hit movie Frozen. We have the benefit of the global launch of Ever After High.","As Bryan noted Monster High toy shipments were down in the quarter. Similarly Barbie sales were also down primarily due to continued soft consumer takeaway domestically and inventory overhang in some international markets. And while we saw a growth in our Hot Wheels business as well as the Disney Planes, it was offset by declines of certain other entertainment properties.","World-wide sales for Fisher-price brands were down 6% for the quarter. The lower sales were primarily a result of the declines in several of our Fisher-Price core brands partially offset by growth in our Laugh and Learn line, an improving trend in our Baby Gear line where sales were flat as the new innovative products began to resonate with consumers.","Our Fisher-Price Friends line was down for the quarter given the top comparisons, the last year\u2019s Jake and the Never Land Pirates and Nickelodeon\u2019s Dora Properties. And Thomas & Friends was up against last year\u2019s successful launch of its wood line, but still perform relatively well as we are encouraged to see Thomas grow internationally in the quarter particularly in Latin America. American Girl had another great quarter with sales up 5% despite a very tough comparison to last year and the shift of Easter from the first quarter to the second quarter.","On page 6, we highlight the performance of our North American region. Overall sales for the region were down 2%. Our International business is seen on page 7 was down 7% this quarter with Latin America down 21% including 7 points of unfavorable impact from currency. And we continue to be encouraged by the strength in emerging markets in Russian and China and recognize that we have pockets of inventory to work through in certain other international markets.","Now let\u2019s review the P&L starting on page 8 of the slide presentation. For the quarter, gross margin was 50.9%, down 330 basis points from last year\u2019s record of 54.2%. As I said, half of the decline is the result of continuing efforts to aggressively execute initiatives to reduce Mattel-owned inventory position as we get ready for the second half of the year.","For the most part, the increase in our product cost will be consistent with our expectations and we continue to expect to offset inflationary pressures with our pricing actions that were effective January 1 in savings from our OE 3.0 program. That said, we remain committed to our new-term target for gross margins of low-to-mid 50s range, but we do expect some modest first quarter headwinds to continue in the second quarter relating to our ongoing efforts to reduce Mattel-owned inventories.","As seen on Page 9, selling, general and administrative expense for the quarter increased approximately $15 million to $385 million. This is primarily attributable to severance cost associated with ongoing OE 3.0 initiatives and a slight increase to strategic growth initiatives, offset by reduced incentive and equity compensation.","Page 10 of the presentation summarize the performance of our ongoing Operational Excellence 3.0 program. For the quarter, we delivered incremental operational excellence 3.0 gross savings of $16 million. And we\u2019re on track to deliver a full year target of around $150 million in gross savings and our two-year cumulative target of gross sustainable savings of $175 million.","Turning to Page 11, operating income in the first quarter was $6.2 million. The decrease in operating income was driven by lower sales and lower gross margins as we continue to work on our inventory situation and a higher SG&A due to the impact to severance, partially offset by reduced spending and advertising as we work to align our full year historical averages and shift spending to later quarters.","Tuning to Page 12, our net loss for the quarter was $0.03, a decrease of $0.14 compared to the prior year first quarter. The decrease in EPS was driven by lower operating income, partially offset by lower non-operating expenses, lower tax expense and a reduction in share count. For the full year, excluding discrete tax items, we expect that our income tax rate will be approximately 21% to 22% assuming no changes to current tax laws.","We discussed cash flow on Page 13. Cash flow from operations in quarter was $61 million compared to cash flow used for operations of $62 million in the first quarter last year. The impact is primarily due to lower working capital usage, partially offset by lower net income. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $44 million, down slightly from last year first quarter. We still anticipate spending about $230 million to $240 million in CapEx in 2014.","We do not have any major refinancing in the first quarter, but we continue to look to issue $500 million of additional debt in 2014, which is consistent with achieving our targeted long-term debt to total capital ratio of around 35%. In addition, we repurchased 736,000 shares of stock in the first quarter at a total cost of $28 million. While we continue to look opportunistically at stock repurchases, we\u2019re out of the market most of the quarter due to the pending acquisition of MEGA brands. We anticipate being more active in the remainder of the year, consistent with our historical capital investment framework.","In March we paid out a quarterly dividend of $0.38 per share at a total cost of $129 million. And our cash on hand of the end of the quarter was $897 million, down from the prior year first quarter $1.26 billion.","Moving forward, we\u2019ll continue to grow our business consistently, grow it profitably and deploy the cash generated in value enhancing ways to reward to our shareholders.","This concludes my review of the financial results. Now we\u2019d like to open the call to questions. Latoya?","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Jaime Katz of Morningstar. Your line is open.","Jaime M. Katz \u2013 Morningstar Research","Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking my questions. Can we start off by talking about the other growth category and the slowing cadence? Obviously you\u2019re lapping some difficult numbers, but was there anything else in that category that we should know about?","Bryan G. Stockton","Hi, Jaime. Good morning. It\u2019s Bryan. We\u2019re pleased with where we are. I think at this point, as I mentioned, overall with our Girls portfolio POS was positive for the quarter. Shipping was down a little bit and that was due to us trying to work through some pockets of inventory at retail.","If you think about what\u2019s in the other Girls, Ever After High, I think I mentioned in my comments, if you look at where that is today with the retail support and consumer takeaway that looks it\u2019s going to be at least the solid single. Monster High, we\u2019re very keen. I know it\u2019s a huge, huge business for us now. It\u2019s a brand that we think is ingrained with Girls. It\u2019s still the number two doll brand. It\u2019s the number three property in the toys according to NPD for the U.S. We know consumers are still very engaged with the brand. If you look at the minutes girls are spending on a website it\u2019s unchanged. What\u2019s impressive is if you look at the total video views of Monster High sequentially from quarter four to quarter one it\u2019s up 14%.","So we know Girls store engage with this brand. We\u2019re going to continue to support this brand with a lot of things. As I mentioned, we\u2019re going to support it with 16 new characters and new segments like the pets, new accessories. I think you may have seen the Monster Maker at Toy Fair. That we think is a huge breakthrough, innovative product and we\u2019re going to continue with web results. So we still like Monster High.","Then you start looking at Disney and with Disney we\u2019re very pleased. Frozen is doing quite well as is Sofia, and with the growth in the box office in that movie we\u2019ve been ramping up our ability to support the demand. It\u2019s being created by that. So we like that a lot too.","So if you look what\u2019s in there, Disney likes good. Monster High, we had a bit of a bump in the first quarter, but we continue to believe that that\u2019s the important part of our portfolio and we\u2019re going to continue to invest in it ever after High is off to a pretty good start and we\u2019ll see how it goes.","Jaime M. Katz \u2013 Morningstar Research","Okay. And then, there was a comment in your slide saying that there is this continued shift to e-commerce from brick and mortar. And I think at Toy Fair it was indicated that it\u2019s still something like 80% to 85% of people shop for toys in the brick and mortar channel. So can you talk a little bit about how you guys are adapting to that shift and where you think you can sort of make some strides there?","Bryan G. Stockton","Sure. The statistics that, I think we shared, were that purchases of toys were about 85% still in brick and mortar. When we use the word shopping we\u2019re careful how we use that, because shopping is really a variety of exercises. It\u2019s exploring, it\u2019s evaluating, it\u2019s reading all the various reviews of products out there. So what we said is the consumer path to purchase is becoming very complex, a lot of touch points. But ultimately when the purchase is made, last year about 15% was made online and about 85% was done in store.","So what we\u2019re doing is a couple of things. Number one, we\u2019re going to continue to invest in the e-commerce channel. We\u2019ve invested in this channel for a number of years. I\u2019ve always bored everyone with the same example of grocery drug that we invested in years ago. But we continue to over index in terms of share in that channel and then the second thing we are doing as we\u2019ve talked about this marketing mix modeling, where we are using pretty sophisticated techniques and the analytics to understand the impact of how we spend our money. And we are able to get a better understanding of how things are impacted online for example, things like Paid Search. So we are really anxious to start to apply those lessons learned to the e-commerce channel as well as to brick and mortar and throughout the entire path to purchase.","Kevin M. Farr","","Yes, I think, I just like to add to the path of purchase I think also starts online we are seeing more people look online to really look at what they want to purchase. And as you said, 80% to 85% of those purchases are still done in stores, so we are really working on first, maximizing our business online and getting all the logistics together to be a good e-retailer. So we are getting product reviews in place, we are getting digital assets where they need to be and obviously, our investment in launch pattern our ability really to connect with consumers with regard to our brands, because it\u2019s a good opportunity to highlight our brands online.","And then we are also putting dedicated resources on being a good e-tailer as well as having our brands be prominent online so that as we look at our marketing mix model and do more paid searches that they can really review our products in their expiration to the path of purchase and then covert in online or in brick and mortars.","Jaime M. Katz \u2013 Morningstar Research","","Okay, and then lastly, the gross margin assumptions that guys have for the year the low 50% range, does that include sort of where you think you can go with MEGA, or should we expect any changes once that acquisition is closed?","Kevin M. Farr","","Yes, I think with regard to the acquisition, if we look at it without MEGA, again I think we are focused over the near-term we\u2019re delivering margins in the low to mid 50s range. When you add MEGA Brands, it has a gross margin which has a near-term negative impact about 100 basis points, but we see an opportunity to improve this materially overtime.","So I see in the near-term there is a negative impact longer-term I think there is an opportunity to grow gross margins for MEGA because when you look at the category in total, the gross margin profile of the category is very comparable to what it is in to our doll portfolio. And we look at opportunities as we put our brands on their platform to increase gross margins for MEGA Brands and that should also help our gross margins over the long-term.","","Jaime M. Katz \u2013 Morningstar Research","","Thank you.","Operator","","Thank you. And the next question is from Mike Swartz of SunTrust. Your line is open.","Michael A. Swartz \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","","Hey, good morning guys. Could you maybe talk about the emerging markets maybe in a little more color and kind of the trends you are seeing there understanding that there were some pockets of inventory, you should point it out, but maybe just boiling it down to what inventories look like there overall. And maybe just POS as you are seeing coming out of emerging markets right now?","Bryan G. Stockton","","Good morning Mike, it\u2019s Bryan. So I would say if you think about emerging markets and I\u2019ll sort of lump a number of them together if you think about Latin America, Eastern-Europe, China, Russia for example. They are all quite strong we think long-term the economy should be growing and household formation is particularly in the middle-class, we think argues well for continued growth in the toy industry. Retail continue to modernize in each of those countries which also argues well for the toy category and for Mattel.","So from a long-term standpoint we like these markets, a lot of them we are going to continue to invest in these markets a lot. If you think about performance Asia led particularly by China is quite strong. It was offset by Australia which is I think we probably mentioned before is going through some adjustments and how they dealt with their catalogue in Christmas businesses and that\u2019s a say country in retailer comment not a Mattel\u2019s specific comment.","The business in Russia continues to grow very substantially. We are very pleased with that business as we are with the rest of the Eastern Europe. Latin America, we\u2019ve been there a long time, we think Latin America has a lot of potential left in itself for household formation and toy industry growth. We\u2019ve been there a long time and it\u2019s a very profitable business, toys it\u2019s a large business.","But as you know the economy slowed down in Latin America that in turn had in impact on the toy industry. Our assessment of the Latin American toy industry right now is in the first quarter sort of flattish. So when you plan for growth and then the category doesn\u2019t grow, we wind up with some pockets of inventory in Latin America and you see us working through that.","The good news is as the POS is up substantially in Latin America as we work through that. There is more work to be done in inventories in Latin America, but overall I would tell you long-term we are very keen on investing in all of these emerging and developing markets.","Michael A. Swartz \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Okay, that was helpful. And then just in terms of OE 3.0 and maybe thinking about how the cadence of those savings that are planned kind of roll throughout the year, I mean can you just help us with a little more color there?","Bryan G. Stockton","Yes, I think there will be a little bit incremental over the next few quarters, but the majority of those savings are going to come in the second half of the year, and principally that the biggest driver of the OE 3.0 savings this year is really our initiatives that you are going to see in gross margin and particularly package and savings. So we saw that come online and increase in the first quarter, incrementally that should continue to increase, but most of it will be in the back half of the year.","Michael A. Swartz \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Okay, thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is from Eric Handler of MKM Partners. Your line is open.","Eric O. Handler \u2013 MKM Partners LLC","Thanks a lot. Just two quick things, first, when you look at the gross savings versus net savings for the OE 3.0 program for this year, where do you think the net savings finish out relative to the gross savings. And then if I\u2019m hearing you correctly, it seems like inventories in the U.S. now are pretty clean and the issues are pretty much just all international.","Bryan G. Stockton","Okay, so I think with regard to OE 3.0 savings, we expect to deliver the gross savings of $115 million this year, and as we said in February, we intend to lean into OE 3.0 cost savings programs in 2014. As we look at the first quarter our reduction in workforce was a strategic to streamline our workforce as part of our OE 3.0 initiatives to drive efficiencies across the organization in order to reallocate funds, investing growth and to improve our profitability. And we are going to continue look at additional opportunities improve the effectiveness and efficiency of Mattel across brands, geographies and functions including our global supply chain.","So I think there will be additional investments as we go through the year to drive OE 3.0 savings, but at this point we are not going to give detailed assessment of that, but we do expect overall OE 3.0 programs to have net savings for the year after investments.","Kevin M. Farr","With respect to inventories we have done a pretty good job with regard to managing retail inventories that were slightly up at year-end, so it\u2019s not been the issue. Really when we look at pockets of inventory really it varies by brand, but overall we are in pretty good shape with regard to retail inventories but there isn\u2019t we said more work to do with retail inventories in select markets and particularly in Latin America.","Eric O. Handler \u2013 MKM Partners LLC","","Okay, thank you.","Operator","","Thank you. And the next question is from Linda Bolton Weiser of B. Riley. Your line is open.","Linda Bolton Weiser \u2013 B. Riley & Co. LLC","","Just one clarification on Monster High, I didn\u2019t quite heard if you had said that POS in the U.S. was actually up in the quarter. Could you clarify that? Thanks.","Bryan G. Stockton","Hi, Linda. It\u2019s Bryan. I\u2019m not going to get into brand detail on POS on Monster High. What I would tell you is that our consumer products business is we look at that did grow both in the U.S. and outside of the U.S. and the consumer products businesses things like apparel and hair accessories and supporting goods, so I did mention that.","Linda Bolton Weiser \u2013 B. Riley & Co. LLC","Okay and then just another question on the cost savings. I guess I\u2019m a little confused about the headcount reductions and severance charges in the first quarter. Were those things that were planned to be in addition to OE 3.0 programs or are they just they were all just kind of planned as part of the OE 3.0 program, so should we think about\u2026","Kevin M. Farr","","No, they were part of the OE 3.0 initiatives.","Linda Bolton-Weiser \u2013 B. Riley & Co. LLC","","Okay, great. That\u2019s all I had, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is from Tim Conder of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Timothy A. Conder \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC","","Thank you. Good morning gentlemen. A couple of things here, I guess on the inventories again, you\u2019ve talked quite a bit about you\u2019re fairly happy at retail, more work to go especially in Latin America, at the retail level. But at the company level, I\u2019m a little confused because you\u2019re up $50 million year-over-year in the quarter, and up $80 million since year-end. Can you give us a little bit more color on that, I know BOOMco. is coming and the shift in Easter on that. Just maybe a little bit more how much those components are driving that versus anything else?","Kevin M. Farr","Yes, I think going back to the inventory, I think where we ended the year in 2013, we are up year-over-year by about $104 million. And as we close the first quarter, we were up by about $50 million. So we\u2019ve made significant progress on Mattel owned inventories in the quarter in reducing them. We\u2019ve got more to go, but we feel like we\u2019ve made good progress in the first quarter. And as I said the initiative to sell Mattel owned inventories result about half of the declining gross margin versus last year or about 160 basis points or so. The other key factors in margin where royalties and a record comp in the prior year.","And in the first quarter, we executed on the initiatives reduced the Mattel owned inventories and we said it\u2019s down by $50 million. And the aggressive disposition of our owned inventories was a local management decision made market by market to convert inventory into cash and be better positioned as we move throughout the year. That cost of that disposition is around $50 million in the quarter versus the prior year, which given the size of Mattel, is a relatively small impact in our full year results, and did cause swing in the quarter. But as we look at the full year and we look at our cost assumptions that from the perspective of the good news in gross margins are cost assumptions aligned with our pricing actions and our OE 3.0 expectations. And as we look at the near-term, we are focused in are delivering under target margins of low to mid 50s range.","Timothy A. Conder \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Kevin and along that line from a good news standpoint, the weakening of the Chinese currency, here 2.5%, 3% since mid-February in particular. Will that potentially have any benefit by fourth quarter? I know you contract and you have costs set several quarters in advance, but when assuming nothing changes from here, could that potentially show some incremental benefit to gross margin?","Kevin M. Farr","I think as we look at our basket of cost, there\u2019s always a bunch of moving pieces. So, yes, I think when we look at the Chinese currency, that could be a positive, but we really look at this from a perspective of managing gross margins and achieving that near-term goal of the low to mid-50s that there is a basket of cost and we try to estimate those baskets of costs and there's always ups and downs.","The good news over the last couple of years is they have been low volatility input cost. I include forex as one of those input costs and assuming that mix holds up well and that we have low volatility in input costs, I think what we're saying right now is the good news, is that aligns with our pricing and OE 3.0 expectations to keep us on track to deliver in the near-term low to mid 50s gross margins.","Timothy A. Conder \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC","","Okay. And then on the innovation side, Bryan, your commentary that you or Kevin made in the preamble regarding Fisher-Price Core, some of the products there and the price points, that would seem somewhat critical to accelerate in that penetration of the Fisher-Price Core on the international side. Can you expand on that? And then maybe a little bit more expansion on how you're taking and looking at the ability to gather and enhance consumer insights and to then tailor your R&D for innovation.","Bryan G. Stockton","Sure, Tim. Let me first comment on Fisher-Price and innovation. We\u2019re pleased, for example, with our BabyGear line, BabyGear POS is positive, and that's driven by the innovation that we shared with you at New York Toy Fair. We shared some of the Smart Stages technology, where you take a toy and then you basically are able to age grade it up as your child grows. We think that's pretty innovative and moms tell it is. So we\u2019re hoping the response for that is as positive as it is to BabyGear. So we're excited about that. And as we said on Fisher-Price, we're sort of fine-tuning the marketing and really dialing at the energy behind innovation.","As it relates to what we're doing in international and Fisher-Price, you're probably tired of me talking about the Soothe & Sleep Seahorse in China, but that\u2019s an example of the kinds of things we\u2019re trying to do in some of the countries with scale like in Brazil or Mexico. I mentioned the emerging consumer line. That\u2019s basically really working. The consumers in those markets to understand but some of the key benefits are and some of the key features, trying to design the net and offer a toy that may not be as attractive in the U.S., but is very appealing to someone who has just joined the middle class in one of these emerging countries. So we're spending a lot of time doing that.","And then finally, as it relates to insights, we\u2019re investing heavily in that both in terms of people and in terms of technology. I\u2019ve mentioned and Kevin has mentioned to the marketing mix modeling. We're very pleased with the early reads on that and have began to really try to translate some of those findings into how we want to change our spending in the second half. We\u2019ve been sharing that with our retail partners and are beginning to reshape plans for the fall. ","So I think that's a good example, better execution and as we add more capabilities and more human resources into insights, we\u2019ll be able to extend that into more regions of the world. So, I\u2019m pleased with that progress but I think our team this morning is \u2013 we\u2019re happy but not satisfied, there is more work to do. I\u2019m happy but there is more work to do on the insights.","Timothy A. Conder \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay great. Thank you, gentlemen.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is from Sean McGowan of Needham & Company your line is open.","","Sean P. McGowan \u2013 Needham & Co. LLC","","Good morning guys, I have a couple of questions to, I\u2019m talking about the toy sales of Monster High. Taking a little dip in the first quarter, but having now Ever After, which was there a year ago. Would the increments of Ever After have offset whatever decline is on the toy sales of Monster High?","Bryan G. Stockton","Hi Sean, good morning I\u2019m not going to give into the detail of what offsets what. We\u2019ve tried to run our Girls business as a portfolio, and in that portfolio we have a number of brands as we look at each really kind of makeup that portfolio with Disney Princess sort of on the lower end of the age range in Monster High and Ever After on the upper-end. So as I said Monster High, all the signs are there that it\u2019s a large brand, it\u2019s a brand that\u2019s becoming evergreen and there is lots of things that we are doing on in terms of investing in it. It\u2019s a huge business force as you know. Now on Ever After high, I think the last time we got together, I said it was too early. I\u2019ll tell you it\u2019s still too early but the data that we\u2019ve seen between our last call and this call would suggest that it\u2019s at least a solid single, again looking at retail support and consumer takeaway and brand engagement.","Kevin M. Farr","Yes it\u2019s still early yet, but I think we\u2019re excited about as we do in the global launch of Ever After High and that we think as Bryan said it has good potential on a global basis. Right now we think it\u2019s at least a single and hopefully with the engagement, we\u2019re seeing that it will be better than at least a single.","Sean P. McGowan \u2013 Needham & Co. LLC","Okay thanks. Couple of others, when you talk about the impact of the efforts to clean out Mattel\u2019s owned inventory and you have been pretty clear about what the impact is that and, but surely there are efforts that the retailers are taking as well to clear out the inventories that at the store level. To what degree is your gross margin being affected by whatever cost their incurring on their end to clear out their inventories and they desire to pass some of that back to you. In other words, the marked down money get ratchet it up in the first quarter?","Kevin M. Farr","Yes, they are consistent with what I said in New York that retail inventories, we\u2019ve accrued most of that in the year-end accounts. So when you look at retail inventories impact programs around that in the first quarter results, it had an insignificant impact in gross margins. It was shown about 20 basis points.","Sean P. McGowan \u2013 Needham & Co. LLC","","Okay, I mean the reason I ask you is Toys \"R\" Us are fairly extensive and long running clearance campaign, it\u2019s getting ratchet it up and they addressed investors recently saying they are taking some aggressive steps and didn\u2019t know they would pass some of that back on to you. One of the things they also said was that they were going to be kind of deemphasizing this move to side by sides and I have for years been viewing that move up to the side by side stores as a plus for sellers of BabyGear as a great amount of their square footage is dedicated to babies, would that be emphasis. Do you think that\u2019s going to put forward the pressure on Fisher-Price?","Bryan G. Stockton","Hi Sean, I\u2019m not going to comment on Toys \"R\" Us store strategy. They certainly know their business well and our trying to execute with their new leadership in this strategy. As we think about our opportunity on Fisher-Price, it is in the U.S. but frankly achieved more so outside of the U.S. We recall out that Barbie for example is about one third U.S., two thirds International, Fisher-Price you just sort of flip those numbers around, and that\u2019s why we are going through all those effort to be reposition the brand and get the innovation right and develop the emerging consumer lines on Fisher-Price, digitally connecting with the moms around the world. And so we are going to continue to push that Toys \u201cR\u201d Us clearly is an important customer to us outside the U.S.","But we just think with all the things going on whether it\u2019s online purchasing or baby stores, there is a lot of opportunities for us to grow Fisher-Price. But Toys \u201cR\u201d Us is the good retail partner for us and we\u2019ll work with them no matter what their strategy.","Kevin M. Farr","","Yes, I think it\u2019s about innovation and then I think also as Bryan said particularly with things like Fisher-Price where there the mom purchases and there are also big bulky products, we think online is a great opportunity for us on a global basis including places like China. So retail will continue to evolve, but I think having innovation in our brands having the right marketing message really focusing on solving consumer issues and providing benefits to them are going to drive that brand in the future.","Sean P. McGowan \u2013 Needham & Co. LLC","","Okay, and then my last question is, I knew I was asking a couple of questions which you probably wouldn\u2019t comment on but maybe this will have more luck with, retail toy manufactures faced a couple of challenges and shipping in the first quarter, one toys maybe in your case retailer overhang of some of your owned product, second was overall category sluggishness in the fourth quarter.","But in addition you have retailer across the board but every category most retailers having a pretty tough first quarter for a variety of reasons economic, weather whatever, to what extend do you think that larger non-toy, non-Mattel sort of general retail weakness affected you. And do you think that\u2019s cleared out now, I mean not just whether wise, but do you think retailers are feeling generally better about their overall open device.","Bryan G. Stockton","","Yes, Sean, I guess the way I will think about that question is, as you know every year at this time, it is always difficult to determine exactly where we are and I\u2019ll use the [VS] (ph) in the toy category in this case. Easter timing is quite late this year and that\u2019s a very important toy gift holiday here in the United States, and a couple of countries outside the U.S.","So it\u2019s really hard I think to assess where are we in terms of consumer purchasing particularly in toys until we sort of get to mid-May. One thing, I think we are encouraged by as retailers did do a little bit better March based on some of the reports on the last week or so. If I look at our POS across Mattel and on brands like Barbie for example, we did a much better in March than we did earlier in the quarter. And so there is probably some upside to retail in March we\u2019ll wait and see and we\u2019ll have to wait and see what the NPD category tells us for March and also for Easter as well. So I\u2019d say, we are cautiously optimistic and that\u2019s driven by the recent trends in our POS.","Sean P. McGowan \u2013 Needham & Co. LLC","As George Harrison said, It's Been a Long Cold Lonely Winter, so let\u2019s bring on the spring, thanks.","Kevin M. Farr","","Thanks Sean."," Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Gerrick Johnson of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Gerrick L. Johnson \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","","Hey good morning guys. I just want to be clear about POS because earlier on you mentioned that you do some adjustments for that late Easter. I was hoping to get maybe gives us both a clean unadjusted number for POS in North America and International and perhaps an adjusted number, how much you think Easter did impact POS?","Kevin M. Farr","","Gerrick, I\u2019m not going to get into detail on POS the issue we have this year in looking at the analytics is Easter was a March 31, last year so the POS for that holiday again particularly here in the U.S. would have been in the prior week the POS for Easter is happening now in the middle of April for this year. And so it\u2019s really hard to look at that. We\u2019ve tried to take a look at the potential impact of that and we like where we are. Easter is worth we think probably a couple of points of category growth historically to the category in a Mattel. So again we have to sort of as we always say every year wait till the middle of May to sort to so through where we are.","Having said that, if I look at sort of the momentum of Mattel\u2019s brands in the fourth quarter in kind of the back half of the fourth quarter versus the back half of the first quarter we\u2019ve made I think a solid improvement particularly on Barbie.","Gerrick L. Johnson \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Okay. And then on margins, can you quantify an impact on mix that\u2019s one that you didn\u2019t talked about in the run down on things return back in gross margin? Thanks.","Kevin M. Farr","Yes, Gary, we had a small negative impact in gross margin in the quarter. And it was not a significant driver of gross margins in the first quarter.","Gerrick L. Johnson \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Okay. Thank you.","Kevin M. Farr","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","","Thank you. The next question is from Drew Crum of Stifel. Your line is open.","Andrew E. Crum \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yes, thanks. Good morning everyone. So just a follow-up on Gerrick\u2019s question on mix. What are you assuming in terms of gross margin or the impact on gross margin from Barbie and Monster High obviously both were down in the first quarter? I wondered, if you could comment on that. And then separately on fashion dolls. Bryan, can you remind us what the cadence on shipments were for Frozen, if I\u2019d recall it was predominantly domestic in the fourth quarter and then International in the first quarter? So you just update us there? Thanks.","Bryan G. Stockton","Hi Drew, I\u2019ll start with the Disney and Frozen it was primarily a U.S. launch. There are a couple of other markets there in the fourth quarter, and it did expand in International. And it\u2019s a huge success as I mentioned in our comments. We\u2019re ramping up our production to meet the ever growing demand on this. So this is a great Disney property and we\u2019re pleased to be a partner with them.","Kevin M. Farr","And again with regard to mix, you have to look at it from doll portfolio perspective. Dolls are a high margins, we\u2019re vertically integrated. The category is a great margin category and when we have strength in the portfolio like we do it\u2019s good to our margins. And as we look out assuming the doll portfolio remains relatively stable and our mix is relatively stable. And we see low volatility in costs, we expect to in the near term deliver low to mid 50s range.","Andrew E. Crum \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Got it, thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is from Greg Badishkanian of Citigroup. Your line is open.","Gregory R. Badishkanian \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Yes, great. I was wondering, just I know you mentioned the layouts were part of the OE 3.0, but it sounds like the last were a little bit greater then maybe you\u2019d initially expected last year when you\u2019re planning for OE 3.0. Is that the case or is it in line?","Bryan G. Stockton","Again Greg, I think it\u2019s in line with what we expected as we looked at October of last year, we looked at again, it was strategic. We\u2019ve basically looked at last year, we had a strategic opportunity to streamline our organization by scaling it. And as a result of that, we increased our OE 3.0 goal from $150 million to $175 million. And as we\u2019ve looked at the first quarter, we made those strategic cuts to streamline organization. And what we\u2019re trying to do is really look across the organization, across Mattel brands, markets, functions to really look at opportunities to reallocate resources, to take those resources and those funds either to invest in growth markets like Russia and China or drop some of it to the bottom line to improve our profitability. So it\u2019s very consistent with our thoughts that we shared with you in October.","Gregory R. Badishkanian \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Okay, all right. And then, just thinking about the second quarter, there\u2019s a few impacts just maybe so we can kind of model for that. A little bit of excess inventory primarily in Latin America, a shift in advertising which may impact sales a little bit in the second quarter, but will benefit the second half. If you look at the different factors, how much is the second quarter going to be impacted?","Bryan G. Stockton","Again, we don\u2019t give guidance on 90-day increments. I think the one thing we\u2019d say is with regard to the MEGA acquisition, we expect that to close in the second quarter and we\u2019ll provide you more about the relevant financial metrics in our disclosures, which are consistent with acquisitions, but we\u2019ll do that on the second quarter call. I think the one thing you should think about in the meantime is that MEGA will be in our results in the second quarter. It\u2019s a public company. I\u2019d point you to their public company filings to look at their revenues and their profitability in the second quarter. And then you have to consider that those won\u2019t include acquisition accounting type things like riding up their inventory or opening balance sheet issues. But that\u2019s about the only guidance I\u2019m going to give you on the second quarter.","We do, I think, in our call though mentioned that when we look at Mattel along the inventories and we look at our advertising, I think you have those two right that those will impact results in the second quarter, but that\u2019s about the guidance we\u2019re going to give you.","Gregory R. Badishkanian \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Okay. And then just finally, in terms of the improvement over the last few weeks in POS that\u2019s really good to hear. And how does that compare to the industry to the extent that you can maybe talk to other retailers or, I don\u2019t know, if your POS would interact that and I don\u2019t think MPD is out for that period, but how do you think the industry is doing during that time and why do you think your POS improved?","Bryan G. Stockton","Well, I think what we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re spending a lot of time focusing on sharpening our execution. We talked about that a lot. We\u2019ve got some interesting new products. I mentioned the Fisher-Price, BabyGear POS as positive. So we\u2019re working a lot on just sharper execution. How it relates to the rest of the industry we\u2019ll find out when MPD issues their report on March.","Gregory R. Badishkanian \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Good.","","Kevin M. Farr","I think from the industry perspective in the first quarter, I think it\u2019s relatively flat based upon the information we have. I think the categories we\u2019re in aren\u2019t growing, other categories are. So overall it\u2019s flattish and that\u2019s about all we could tell you at this point.","Bryan G. Stockton","","And we have to get through Easter (indiscernible) for the U.S. are pretty significant gift giving occasion for toys.","Gregory R. Badishkanian \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Drew Vollero","Operator, we have time for one more question.","Operator","","Okay. The final question is from Felicia Hendrix of Barclays. Your line is open.","Felicia Hendrix \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","","Hi, good morning. Thank you. If we could just step back for a second and just \u2013 very big picture. Given the many initiatives that you have added on the call and gave us color on, do you think that you can grow earnings this year maybe exclusive of the noise that may come from the MEGA acquisition and also excluding share repurchase?","Kevin M. Farr","Again, I think you know this Felicia, but we don\u2019t give guidance on an annual basis. I think that said, we\u2019re focused on balancing all of our key P&L levers including sales growth, gross margin, advertising, SG&A and strategic growth initiatives. And in 2014, I think as I said at Toy Fair, we\u2019re basing our business this year on realistic revenue assumptions and we\u2019re focused on making the middle of P&L work harder, which includes delivering strong gross margins. I\u2019ve also said we\u2019re looking to lean into OE 3.0 programs to work that middle of the P&L harder and our goal is to deliver top third to top quartile TSR in the near-term.","Felicia Hendrix \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","","Okay. And then just on Ever After High, Bryan you said many times on the call that it\u2019s a solid single. I\u2019m just wondering did you intended to be a single solid? I mean, is it turning out to be kind of what you planned it to be?","Bryan G. Stockton","","Well, Felicia, what we\u2019ve always talked about is that Monster High is a grand grand slam home run. It\u2019s huge. It\u2019s over $1.5 billion at retail. It\u2019s the number two doll brand, number three toy property and trying to replicate that would be quite a challenge. And as we talked about, creating new properties, whether it's Max Steel or Ever After High, for example, we\u2019ve always said we\u2019re perfectly happy with singles and doubles. The amount of investment that we make in these properties is not that high. If it's a single, we make money. We like that. So we\u2019re perfectly happy with the series of singles and doubles.","So I would say at the moment we're pleased with what we see. It's still early. We have to see how it plays out, but the connection with Girls is great. Initial conversion is to purchase, looks pretty good. We just have to see how that unfolds over the next quarter or two.","Kevin M. Farr","Yes, and we're excited about the global launch and also we\u2019re excited that this is a franchise launch, which includes both toy products and consumer good products.","Felicia Hendrix \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And just finally on MEGA. I know you're going to integrate it in the second quarter, and maybe this question is a little bit premature. But I'm just wondering of everything that MEGA does what product lines are you going to be most focused on and where do you think you can get the most growth out of that acquisition?","Bryan G. Stockton","Well, they've got a great product line across a number of segments and one of the reasons we bought this is because we felt that the license that they have, the technical capabilities they have, when you marry that with our global scale and the strength of our brands, we think we can do a great job of, number one, growing them globally because we have this massive North American and international distribution marketing organization that does so well. And by extending our brands like Barbie and Hot Wheels, they did a terrific job of sort of the initial parry end of the category with that and when this thing comes into the Mattel family and we\u2019ll work even harder with them to do that. So there is a lot of opportunities with them, both in terms of global distribution gains and extending our brands.","Kevin M. Farr","Yes. And really with the platform, we're really, really, really excited about is the construction platform because that category is a growing category and that the margin profile of that category is fantastic. It's like fashion dolls. And we think our brands on that platform will drive results on a global basis. So we're very excited about that and they do have a nice arts & crafts business that we think in the future that we can leverage that platform because it is a growing category and it is something that we can do globally by putting our brands again on that arts & crafts platform and grow that on a global basis, but that's really secondary. Our initial focus really is on the construction.","Felicia Hendrix \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","","Okay. And did the results in the fourth quarter surprised you or you were aware of that or is it totally irrelevant?","","Bryan G. Stockton","It was as expected, so it was not a surprise to us. Obviously as we do deep due diligence, we do get into their actual results as well as we look forward in our valuation model. It is right thing at the right time and the right price. And as we look at the right price, we are discounting cash flow, people here and we look at realistic revenue assumptions and we look at realistic profit assumptions with regard to cost synergies and we feel like we are going to create a lot of value for our shareholders by making this a stronger Number 2 player in the construction category.","And we do see opportunities which we didn\u2019t put much of the value on with regard to the arts and crafts. We do see opportunities again to put our brands on their platform and grow on a global basis through arts and crafts business.","Felicia Hendrix \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","","Okay that\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Drew Vollero","Thank you. There will be a replay of this call available beginning 11:30 AM Eastern Time today. The number to call for the replay is area code (404) 537-3406, and the passcode is 16668211.

[Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Drew Vollero, Senior Vice President. Sir, you may begin.","Drew Vollero","Thank you, Shannon. As you know, this morning we reported Mattel's 2014 third-quarter financial results. We've provide you with a slide presentation to help guide our discussion today. The slide presentation and the information required by Regulation G regarding non-GAAP financial measures is available on the Investors section of our corporate website, corporate.Mattel.com.","In a few minutes Bryan Stockton, Mattel's Chairman and CEO, and Kevin Farr, Mattel's CFO, will provide comments on the results and then the call will be open for your questions.","Certain statements made during the call may include forward-looking statements relating to the future performance of our overall business, brands and product lines. These statements are based on currently available information and are subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties which may cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.","We describe some of these uncertainties in the risk factors section of our 2013 annual report on Form 10-K and our 2014 quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and in other filings we make with the SEC from time to time, as well as in other public statements. Mattel does not update forward-looking statements and expressly disclaims any obligation to do so. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bryan.","Bryan Stockton","Thank you, Drew, and good day, everyone. While our third-quarter results continue to reflect headwinds carried over from the 2013 holiday season, I'm encouraged with the progress made on our 2014 priorities to end the year with POS momentum and lower retail in Mattel owned inventories.","While still not where it needs to be, global POS is far better than shipments and continues to improve. In the quarter our global POS was up low-single-digits with international POS up high-single-digits and domestic POS down slightly. We made substantial progress on retail inventories across the globe and particularly in North America where we ended the quarter with inventory down high teens.","International retail inventories were also down with only a few pockets of higher inventory remaining. And excluding the impact of MEGA Brands, our owned inventories were also down about $50 million from prior year, a substantial improvement from where we started the year.","We accomplished all of this as we shifted significant advertising and promotional spending from the first 3 quarters of the year to the fourth quarter to maximize its effectiveness. North America reflects the biggest shift where we look to spend 40% more in media spending in the all-important holiday season.","So we are making progress and I feel we have put ourselves in a better position to deliver on our 2014 priorities and enter 2015 with positive momentum. But that said, I fully recognize this progress is not reflected in our third-quarter results and as we continue to have a significant gap between our shipping trends and our improving POS.","There are a number of reasons why we continue to face revenue headwinds in the quarter.","First, while core brand POS improved for many of our brands it still remains below expectations.","Second, as a part of our strategy to shift spending to maximize the fourth quarter, we significantly reduced our support in many third-quarter retail promotion programs this year.","Third, shipments in our Girls portfolio declined in the quarter as brands like Monster High continue to sell well, but shipments declined as it faced steep comparisons to prior year.","Fourth, we saw some of our North American retail customers tighten their inventory management strategies.","And finally, in select international markets many customers continue to work down pockets of higher inventory levels as well.","So while our shipments were clearly challenged, our third-quarter results did reflect our commitment to financial discipline as we manage 2014 to realistic revenues and look to optimize the middle of the P&L.","Specifically, gross margins, while down in the quarter, moved back above 50%. This improvement came despite the unfavorable impact of our MEGA Brands acquisition and our continued efforts to clean up inventory, both of which should have a smaller impact going forward.","Our Operational Excellence 3.0 cost savings program delivered significant savings in the quarter and is on target to deliver on its 2-year goal of $175 million in gross sustainable savings. And in light of our current performance we tightly managed our SG&A spending down in the quarter.","Let me walk through the quarter in a little more detail. Overall our Girls portfolio is down for the quarter. Global POS for the portfolio remains positive in the mid-teens and is significantly outpacing shipping. Disney's Frozen and our own Ever After High franchise drove incremental sales in the quarter, but it wasn't enough to offset declines in other brands.","Barbie global POS continues to improve and be well above shipping. In the third quarter Barbie POS was down low-single-digits, Barbie shipping is down significantly in the quarter, largely as a result of the reasons I highlighted earlier.","Monster High remains a strong global property. While we are seeing good results with our new fall product, we continue to work through some inventory pockets particularly in international markets. And Ever After High continues to do well as the number 5 fashion doll property in the US per NPD and looks to be building into a very strong doll brand.","Unfortunately American Girl did not grow in the quarter. We think much of this can be explained given the success we had last year in the third quarter where American Girl grew 20%. Last year's growth was driven by 2 important events in the quarter \u2013 the successful opening of our retail store in Columbus, Ohio and a significant sales increase as we retired Molly, a very popular historical doll.","This year in the third quarter we did not open any new stores and, while we're encouraged with early results, we didn't re-launch our new BeForever historical doll line until late September. As we look into the fourth quarter for American Girl, our international expansion continues to do well in Canada and we just opened our third shop-in-shop with Indigo Stores in Ottawa, Canada.","And we have 2 new retail stores slated to open in the fourth quarter. The first store had a successful opening just last weekend in Charlotte, North Carolina. And the second store in Orlando, Florida will open later this quarter in November.","And rounding out the Girls portfolio is Disney Princess which saw significant growth in the quarter driven entirely by the success of Disney's hit movie Frozen. We're happy to see the demand for this property extend beyond its movie launch and we're excited to have the opportunity to maximize Frozen for the next 2 holiday seasons.","And while we're disappointed to lose the license in 2016 after so many years, we remain a major entertainment partner with Disney on a number of Boys and infant preschool properties.","While higher this year because of Frozen, the Disney Princess business has averaged a little less than $300 million a year since we received the European rights in 2010. As a result we are working on plans to fill this 2016 revenue gap. We know girls love the Princess play pattern, we have deep experience with it and we've had great success with it ourselves in the past.","Barbie alone has had a number of Princess themed executions with product, licensed merchandised and DVDs over the last decade. So we have some time and a number of ideas to fill this 2016 revenue gap and we will share these ideas with you as we get closer to their execution.","Our overall Fisher-Price results are disappointing and show that we have more work to do. While we found some success in parts of our product and marketing execution, we will likely continue to face headwinds into the near future. Global POS for the brand is down slightly and, like many of our brands, POS is outpacing shipping.","At a high level we continue to see pockets of strength in BabyGear and Laugh & Learn, but they're more than offset by our preschool results. We're seeing positive POS results internationally, which is a strategic priority for us. However, our results in the US are hampered by pockets of high inventory, a lack of POS momentum and softness in key brands like Little People and Imaginext.","That said we are pleased with the strong results of Thomas & Friends, particularly in international markets. But the overall Friends business is down due to tough comps for some our licensed properties.","We are encouraged with the POS and shipping strength in Hot Wheels, which is doing particularly well in international markets. Our basic car and track segments, which highlight the core play pattern for this brand, continue to show strength.","We also like what we see with BOOMco, our differentiated entry in the blaster category. The consumer reviews are great, digital marketing and promotional plans are meeting expectations and we'll support the line with more product offerings in 2015.","And finally, our MEGA Brands integration is doing well. We will talk more about this in a few weeks, but overall our new management has been on the ground since April and is making solid progress on a number of fronts. The construction category globally is growing and I our [indiscernible] is positive and improving.","Shipping continues to be less than POS due to some pre-acquisition inventory carryover from 2013 as well as transition from third-party distributors to our own sales, marketing and distribution network in international markets. We will formally take over most of the international distribution globally on January 1, 2015.","From a regional perspective, our North American business is down in the third quarter, partially the result of our decision to shift advertising and retail support to the fourth quarter, as well as evolving customer inventory management strategies. We had mixed results in international, which is also down for the quarter. Asia performance is up with strong gains in China and we also see improvements in Australia.","Europe is down as solid gains in Russia did not offset softness in Western European POS and headwinds from pockets of higher retail inventory. Latin America is down as it continues to weather macroeconomic challenges and we made some progress working through our pockets of retail inventory which are impacting our 2 largest markets.","Going forward the organization is focused to execute the fourth quarter and the all important holiday season. Our new fall products are hitting the shelves now and we have good representation on many of the hot holiday toys lists. We've been executing our path to purchase work and our spending mix model work and have significantly more advertising and retail promotion spending available in the fourth quarter.","And we have significantly improved our inventory situation, both owned and at retail, which should ultimately help close the POS and shipping gap we have this year. And as Kevin will review with you in a few minutes, we remain committed to our total shareholder return objectives and our commitment to sound capital deployment, including the dividend.","As we're keen on saying at Mattel, there will be a Christmas, it will come on or around December 25, and I'm confident there will be more Mattel toys under the tree than any other toy company in the world. And now I'd like to turn it over to Kevin Farr, Mattel's Chief Financial Officer. Kevin?","Kevin Farr","Thank you, Bryan, and good day, everyone. As Bryan said, our third-quarter results reflect our continuing commitment to financial discipline as we manage 2014 to realistic revenues and look to optimize the middle of the P&L. Before I go into the slide deck I wanted to take a few moments to add some detail to the key drivers of our financial performance.","First, as it relates to the top line, Bryan outlined the reasons why our revenues have not been keeping pace with our improving POS momentum. Specifically our third-quarter and year-to-date global revenues are down 7%, yet our global POS is up low-single-digits for the year.","History would tell you over time POS and shipping will align, but over the near-term we have seen dislocations in these numbers from time to time by both brand and market. We believe we are now placing our advertising and trade spending in the right places and at the right time with our investments in the fourth quarter to help us achieve better alignment in the near future.","Next, let's talk briefly about gross margin. As you know, we've achieved annual gross margins at or above 50% since 2009. And while gross margins have had many challenges in 2014 with the acquisition of MEGA Brands, our efforts to clean up inventory, and a change in product mix, we are still committed to our long-term and near-term gross margin objectives.","Our third-quarter gross margin of 50.5% is 330 basis points below last year's record of 53.8%. Despite the decline it still represents the fifth time in the past 6 years that we've achieved gross margins above 50% in the quarter and it's consistent with our goal of delivering gross margins for the full year of low- to mid-50s range over the near-term.","When you include the 150 basis point \u2013 exclude the 150 basis points of our MEGA Brands acquisition, which includes a related 30 basis points of accounting adjustments, the gross margin is the third highest achieved since 2009. However, this is still 180 basis points lower than last year.","About two-thirds of the decline was related to our continued efforts to clean up inventory as well as lower sales leverage on our fixed manufacturing base. The impact of inventory clean up and leverage should lessen as we move forward. And the balance is related to mix primarily due to the recent sales trends in our Girls portfolio.","The good news is that pricing and net savings from OE 3.0 initiatives have roughly offset increases in product costs as we exited our peak production period.","And excluding MEGA, some of the headwinds in gross margin are beginning to moderate as the year-over-year decline this quarter was 180 basis points versus 240 basis points in the second quarter as we're seeing that the relative impact to these specific items is less in the third quarter, which has significantly higher volume.","We continue to expect that MEGA Brands will have a near-term headwind of about 100 basis points, although it has been slightly higher in the past 2 quarters because of the purchase accounting inventory adjustment.","Looking forward, we remain committed to achieving our near-term objective of low- to mid-50s range as we execute and continue our manufacturing effectiveness programs and cost savings initiatives, but recognize that product mix could be a headwind if recent sales trends in our Girls portfolio persist.","Our commitment to optimize the middle of the P&L is also evident in our SG&A results. As I told you at the beginning of the year, we would manage spending tightly in 2014 with a balanced approach to enable the organization to both execute in the near-term and develop future business drivers for the medium-term. In that regard, we said that our goal for 2014 excluding MEGA was to have a modest increase in SG&A in absolute dollars including funding severance and our strategic growth initiatives.","Consistent with our goal of tightly managing SG&A, our total SG&A spending for the third quarter, including MEGA Brands, was down $18 million to $393 million.","The primary drivers of lower spending were lower accruals for incentive and equity compensation giving our performance to date is tracking below our expectations and the benefit of $11 million of gross savings from OE 3.0 program, which was partially offset by MEGA integration and amortization costs of $15 million, as well as the ongoing MEGA baseline SG&A cost. We expect to continue to tightly manage SG&A for the balance of the year.","And finally, I want to touch on capital deployment. As you know, our business model remains one of strong cash flow generation and we have been effectively executing on our capital investment framework since 2003. Dividends are an important component of that framework. Dividends are also a critical element to consistently achieve our long-term goal of delivering top third to top quartile total shareholder returns.","Our Board and the management team remain committed to the dividend and it is our preferred way to return cash to shareholders. That commitment is evident today with the Board declaring a fourth-quarter dividend of $0.38 per share reflecting an annualized dividend of $1.52, a 6% increase over the prior year.","We continue to target being a top quartile dividend yield provider and look to pay out 50% to 60% of prior year's EPS. And as we've done in the past, we will from time to time exceed that payout ratio. After the dividend acquisitions remain a key component of our capital deployment framework where we look to buy great companies like HiT Entertainment, MEGA Brands or ourselves in the form of share repurchases.","We ended 2013 with about $1 billion in cash and have deployed $551 million towards acquisitions and share buybacks year to date compared to $400 million in the first 9 months of 2013. We did not purchase any additional shares in the third quarter. That said, we remain financially disciplined in our approach and continue to execute against our capital investment framework with a focus on ending the year with cash within our targeted range of about $800 million to $1 billion.","Now let's turn to the slide deck to review our third-quarter results in more detail. Starting on page 4 you can see that our worldwide gross sales are down 7% in the quarter and down 7% year to date.","Sales were down both in our North American and international regions impacted by higher retail inventories to start the year \u2013 a lack of POS momentum in core brands, a shift in advertising and trade programs in the fourth quarter, certain US retailers that tightened their retail inventory management strategies this year and recent headwinds from Monster High.","And as Bryan noted earlier, we are seeing improved POS and have made good progress on retail and owned inventories, which we believe puts us in a better position to deliver in the all-important holiday season.","Turning to page 5 of the presentation, you can see the brand perspective on sales. Worldwide sales in the Mattel Girls & Boys Brands were down 11% for the quarter and down 10% year to date. Declines in Monster High and Barbie as well as some entertainment properties were partially offset by strength in Disney Princess and the launch of Ever After High and BOOMco.","Worldwide sales of Fisher-Price brands were down 16% for the quarter. Declines in Fisher-Price core brands and tough comps related to a number of our Fisher-Price licensed properties were partially offset by growth in Thomas & Friends.","Sales of American Girl brands were down 7% in the quarter and were flat year to date as the business was up against a very challenging 20% sales comparison last year. Last year's successful retirement of our popular Molly historical doll and a new store opening in the third quarter of 2013 were partially offset by encouraging early results from our re-launch of our BeForever historical doll line which we didn't begin to ship until later in the quarter, as well as our recent expansion to Canada via a partnership with Indigo.","In our new construction and arts and craft brands category, which includes sales of our recent MEGA brands acquisition, continue to be in line with our expectations.","On page 6 we highlight the performance of our North American region. Overall sales for the region were down 7% for the quarter and down 6% year to day. Our international business, as seen on page 7, was also down 7% for the quarter, and down 8% year to date.","We're encouraged to see strength in our Asia-Pacific region driven by China, as well as our emerging markets including Russia. Softness in POS in our core brands and some pockets of higher retail inventories continue to impact our sales in Europe and Latin America.","Now let's review the P&L starting on page 8 of the slide presentation. I've already talked to you about our gross margins for the quarter, so let me focus on our year-to-date trend.","On a year-to-date basis gross margins are down 380 basis points to 49.5%. About 140 basis points of the year-to-date decline is due to MEGA brands, including 30 basis points related to fair market value inventory adjustment. Excluding MEGA, gross margins year to date declined by 240 basis points with about 75% of this variance related to our efforts to clean up inventory and the manufacturing deleverage that occurred due to lower sales volume. And the balance is primarily related to mix.","I've already talked to you about our SG&A expense as seen on page 9 which continues to demonstrate our financial discipline.","Moving to page 10 of the presentation, we summarize the performance of our ongoing OE 3.0 program. For the quarter we delivered incremental Operating Excellence 3.0 growth savings of $41 million and we're on track to deliver our full-year target of around $115 million in gross savings and our 2-year target of cumulative gross sustainable savings of $175 million.","And, yes, in a couple weeks at our investor conference in New York I will be talking to about our continuing commitment to continuous improvement programs which will deliver more cost savings going forward.","Turning to page 11, operating income in the quarter was $409 million and $417 million year to date. The decrease in the quarter was driven primarily by lower sales and gross margins, partially offset by reduced advertising spending as we shifted this to the fourth quarter and lowered SG&A.","Turning to page 12, our earnings per share for the quarter were $0.97, a decrease of $0.24 compared to the prior year's third quarter. The decrease in EPS was driven by lower operating income including the costs associated with the MEGA Brands acquisition, partially offset by lower tax expense and a reduction in share count.","Over the long term, excluding discrete period tax items, we continue to expect that our income tax rate will be approximately 21% to 22% assuming no changes to current tax laws.","Page 13 outlines the costs related to the MEGA Brands acquisition including the estimated acquisition integration and amortization expenses which impact SG&A, as well as the inventory fair value adjustment which impacts gross margin. We highlight both the actual cost incurred in the quarter and the estimated annual cost Mattel expects to incur in 2014.","For the quarter these expenses totaled $22 million and for 2014 we expect these expenses to be between $70 million to $80 million. This is a $15 million reduction from our earlier forecast as we refined our estimates and realized some efficiencies in our integration efforts.","As expected, the remaining impact of inventory fair market value adjustments was incurred in the third quarter, but the non-cash amortization cost and some integration costs are expected to continue in 2015 and beyond.","We discuss cash flow on page 14. Year to date cash flow use for operations was $144 million compared to $321 million last year. The decrease is primarily due to changes in working capital. Cash flow used for investing activities increased to $604 million due to the acquisition of MEGA Brands.","Year to date we issued $500 million of additional debt and repurchased 3.3 million shares of stock for a total of $128 million. In September we paid out our third-quarter dividend of $0.38 per share which is included in our year-to-date dividend cash payment of $386 million.","Today we announced our fourth-quarter dividend of $0.38 per share. Our cash on hand was $262 million at the end of the quarter, down from $406 million last year.","In closing, we will continue to work through our headwinds and remain focused on executing in the all-important holiday season. Specifically we are looking to end the year with POS momentum and lower retail in Mattel owned inventories while optimizing 2014 profitability.","We continue to be committed to growing our business consistently, growing it profitably and deploying the cash generated in value enhancing ways to reward our shareholders. Our overarching long-term goal remains to continue to consistently deliver top third to top quartile total shareholder returns and we look forward to talking to you more about this in a few weeks.","This concludes my review of the financial results. Now we would like to open up the call for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Sean McGowan of Needham & Company. You may begin.","Sean McGowan \u2013 Needham & Company","Thank you very much. Good morning, guys. I have a couple of questions. Could you just give us some guidance on the \u2013 sorry to use that word \u2013 some guidance on the \u2013 advertising the sales target? What percentage should we be targeting for the full year?","Bryan Stockton","Good morning, Sean. I think what we have tried to say is for the year we are probably within our range that we talked about, 11% to 13%. And we will probably be in the lower end of that. What we have tried to articulate is that you recall last year we spent probably too much money in hindsight in the third quarter, and we've tried to shift that spending into the fourth quarter.","I highlighted, for example, that in the US our media spend will be up 40% in the fourth quarter. So we tried to be very thoughtful using our spending mix model results to understand where to spend and where to spend and how much to spend on our brands.","Kevin Farr","Yes, and I think as Bryan said, we don't give guidance. But I think as we execute in the fourth quarter we want to allow ourselves flexibility to adjust this lever based upon real-time results. But, Sean, I think it is going to be in that range of 11% to 13% for the year.","Sean McGowan \u2013 Needham & Company","Okay. And then related to that, sort of more of a philosophical question. So in conversations that you have with the major customers you need to obviously communicate very clearly and strongly what that advertising commitment is.","Has there been any push back on the timing of that or is there any question of just how much commitment they are going to be expecting? I mean I imagine that affects greatly their willingness to take any inventory, right?","Bryan Stockton","You would have to ask them about their willingness on inventory. But what I would tell you is we have been very open about our lessons learned on the spending mix model and how we are thinking about spending for the third and for the fourth quarters. These planes get aligned with a fair amount of lead time.","I would tell you as we look to the fourth quarter I know 2 things \u2013 customers want to sell more toys, we want to sell more toys, and we try to put the spending together to really optimize the consumer sales of Mattel branded toys in the fourth quarter.","So I think everybody is aligned on that. We are pleased with the retail support we have. I think they are pleased that we're spending more money because the modeling tells us to spend in the fourth quarter. So I think we are all as comfortable as we can probably be as we all suffer a case of the pre-Christmas jitters at this time of the year.","Kevin Farr","Yes, I think as you would imagine, Sean, we sit down with retailers and plan the holiday season. So we've worked with regard to these plans, we have talked to them about, look, shifting monies from the third-quarter to the fourth quarter when consumer purchasing patterns are such that over 50% of POS occurs in the last 3 quarters.","And we have aligned our advertising and trade programs with retailers and we are poised to execute. And at this point it's now about consumers coming out and buying our products. And as we have said for the entire year, we've been really focused on driving POS with retailers.","Sean McGowan \u2013 Needham & Company","Okay, thanks. Last question is on currency. So assuming that current exchange rates prevail throughout the quarter, can you comment on sort of what kind of an overall headwind that might be in the fourth quarter?","Kevin Farr","Well, I think we do hedge our transaction exposure, so we are pretty well set on that with regard to that not being a headwind. It is really the translation of our product and that's \u2013 I think every 1% change in the index has a \u2013 in the US exchange index has a $0.01 to $0.02 impact to EPS. So it depends upon what your assumptions are for that. Year to date I think though we've had a 1% unfavorable impact on top-line sales and only about $0.03 negative impact from ForEx.","Sean McGowan \u2013 Needham & Company","So, would you expect there to be more of a headwind in the fourth quarter then?","Kevin Farr","Well, it depends obviously on where rates go and we have hedged a good portion of that from a transactional perspective. The translation of our profits are subject to that \u2013 to the foreign-exchange fluctuation and it depends on where it lands. I have given you the index that you can estimate it depending upon what your assumptions are.","Sean McGowan \u2013 Needham & Company","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Gerrick Johnson of BMO Capital. You may begin.","Gerrick Johnson \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Hey, good morning. I was wondering if you'd talk about your point of sale, the comment of it being up globally. There has got to be some closeouts in that and I was wondering if you could give us what your POS would have been excluding those closeouts of excess inventory?","Bryan Stockton","Hey. Good morning, Gerrick. We don't really get into that kind of detail when we talk about the POS. But what I can tell you is we look at the products that we developed and launched this year; the POS is consistent with what we've been talking about. So I think we feel very comfortable with the momentum we have across our line.","Is there some closeouts POS in there? Yes, obviously because we've been working on reducing our retail inventories and our owned inventory. But overall we are pretty pleased with what we call the good line POS.","Gerrick Johnson \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Okay. And just one more on cash, the cash that is overseas versus the US to support your cash deployment. Will there need to be a repatriation at some point in the near future?","Kevin Farr","No, I think we have got access to cash on a worldwide basis. We're in a good position from a liquidity perspective to fund dividends and share repurchases. Obviously we do have access to foreign cash, we could repatriate it, but we don't need to in the near term even though most of our cash is overseas.","Gerrick Johnson \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Tim Conder of Wells Fargo. You may begin.","Tim Conder \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Good morning. You know just a couple questions, gentlemen. One, if you can talk about the Barbie, Monster High and Fisher-Price. You are making progress, as you have talked about on the call already. But where do you anticipate seeing those properties stabilize on a wholesale basis? I guess what type of time frame would it be towards the end of \u2013 at the end of this year or the first half of next year?","And then secondly, as it relates to the dividend payout. Kevin, you talked about that a little bit, but just kind of looking at the trajectory here and the loss of Disney Princess, how comfortable are you a year, 2 years staying above that targeted 50% to 60% range?","Bryan Stockton","Good morning, Tim. I guess the way I would approach your question on stabilizing these brands is: number one, I'm not going to give you guidance by quarter in terms of when things are going to happen. What I would tell you is we have a very strong focus on POS this year. And what we have talked about is trying to build POS momentum throughout the year.","Barbie POS has been improving sequentially kind of first half to third quarter and we like that a lot, we think that is good. We've got some good programs in the fourth quarter and for next year as well. With Monster High, we talked about where that brand is. It is still a very strong brand if you just look at the nominal sales and POS of that. And I think when you hear Richard talk in a couple of weeks you're going to hear us talk about a slightly different approach to Monster High.","And on Fisher-Price, we've talked about we have more work to do. Frankly what I'm pleased with is it looks like the international POS on Fisher-Price is beginning to turn. And as you know, we've always wanted to grow the Fisher-Price international business. So I'm not going to say that international is back on track, but it is certainly making a step in that direction. Kevin?","Kevin Farr","Yes, I think Monster High books like Q2, POS was down high teens. When you look at your dividend question, I think the good news about our business due to our strong brands, our portfolio markets and our portfolio customers, the Company generates strong cash flow even in challenging times.","And as we look at the future, the Board and management remain committed to the current level of the dividend. And I think we will be less focused on the payout ratio in the near term. And we have a strong financial position to continue to pay our dividend.","Tim Conder \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Okay. And then one other question, gentlemen. As it relates to I guess a couple of the license-related properties, you've got a strong relationship with Warner and DC Comics. They have just outlined some plans for a very robust movie outlook through basically the end of the decade.","Maybe just any color on that and how that enters into the plans going forward. And the other part of the license question is, any other Disney license expiration or renewal dates coming up here over the next 3 years?","Bryan Stockton","Well, I guess I would start off, Tim, with \u2013 one of the things that we think is a strength of Mattel is our global footprint as it relates to licenses. So all of our licensees or licensors appreciate that and we still think we are the Company of choice to come to when it comes to licenses.","As it relates to Warner Bros., we have got a long-term partnership with them on a number of things and we are looking forward to working with them in the future on all the great things that they are talking about. We are still a big partner with Disney and look forward to continuing to work with them on Boys and for preschool properties.","We don't really get into license expiration dates with each of these individual partners. But as you recall, most of these licenses tend to be kind of in the 3- to 5-year period. So we like where we are, we think we have got a great portfolio of evergreen licenses.","As I have said a couple of times, this is one of the few times in Mattel history we have actually looked forward to a Star Wars movie. And as you know, we are launching Star Wars Hot Wheels in the fourth quarter this year. So it is going to continue to be an important part of our growth here. And as some doors close many other doors open.","Tim Conder \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Okay, thank you gentlemen.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Felicia Hendrix of Barclays. You may begin.","Felicia Hendrix \u2013 Barclays Capital","Hi, good morning.","Bryan Stockton","Good morning, Felicia.","Kevin Farr","Hi, Felicia.","Felicia Hendrix \u2013 Barclays Capital ","Hi. Sorry. That should be better. Sorry about that. Just a question on your POS trend. If you exclude Frozen from your POS \u2013 from the POS statistics that you gave us, would the underlying statistics be similar to what you highlighted?","Bryan Stockton","Well, Felicia, I'm not going to get into slicing and dicing our POS. What I would tell you is that if you look across our brands, we are seeing continued sequential improvement in POS. I am pleased with the improvement that we are seeing in international overall. I've talked about Barbie POS improving. Monster High, as Kevin said, is stabilizing. So we like that.","And I guess the other thing that we always talk about, we talk about a Girls portfolio. So within that portfolio we always have some brands growing. And, just like your portfolio, some brands underperform, some underperform. So I can't pull Frozen out of the Girls portfolio because it is part of a very strong portfolio.","Kevin Farr","Yes, and we are really managing that portfolio overall and looking to optimize the entire performance of the portfolio. Some years it is Monster High driving it and some years it is intellectual property like Frozen driving it. So that is the beauty of having a portfolio of brands in the Girls portfolio.","Felicia Hendrix \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay that's \u2013 thank you. And then as far as \u2013 you had mentioned several times you have seen improving Barbie. What do you think is driving that the most?","Bryan Stockton","Well, I think it is a couple things. Number one, we have talked a lot about the spending mix model. And Barbie is a huge brand, she is still the number one dollar brand in the world. And it is a brand that our retail partners like to promote and I think we have just gotten a lot smarter about how we are spending our money and where we are spending our monies, that is number one.","Number two, I think we talked last year, or I should say February, about we have invested in the doll, the dolls look better this year than they did last year. We have more activities going on in terms of the accessory part of the business.","So Barbie is not out of the woods yet, but I would say we continue to make solid progress on it. And Barbie is going to continue to be a brand that we spend a lot of time and attention on to make sure she continues to improve her momentum.","Kevin Farr","Yes, I would say we are still not where we need to be. I think we really are focused on better execution and I think we will be talking to you next week about a focus on bigger and better ideas in 2015 and beyond. And that combination with leveraging the spending mix model and better execution should drive us to where we would like to get to.","Felicia Hendrix \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay, thanks. And then just finally, and I apologize if you said this, but I don't think I heard this. You talked about the pockets of international inventory in the quarter. Can you just tell us specifically where those were and in what categories those were?","Bryan Stockton","Well, we've talked about the fact in Latin America we have got some pockets in our 2 largest markets there. It tends to be more in the Monster High area, as we have mentioned. There is some in Western Europe. But I think the good news is we have worked through a lot of that in the third quarter, there is just a few spots here and there.","And as I mentioned, we think we're coming into the fourth quarter with probably the best position we've had in the last 3 quarters. POS momentum is improving, our inventories are in much better shape, both owned and at retail. So I think we are in as good a shape as we have been.","Kevin Farr","Yes. So I think it should be a lesser factor. There is still a little bit of pockets in Europe and Latin America, and it's principally around Monster High and Fisher-Price.","Felicia Hendrix \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay, all right. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mike Swartz of SunTrust. You may begin.","Mike Swartz \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Kevin Farr","Good morning.","Bryan Stockton","Hi, Mike.","Mike Shartz \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey ","Just a quick question around \u2013 I think you made some comments around inventory or retailers tightening their inventory management this year. Are we supposed to understand that is something new versus the year \u2013 versus years past? And I mean is it just as simple as they are ordering later, they are doing shelf resets later this year than in years past or is there something more to it?","Bryan Stockton","Well, I would say it is a combination of factors. If you look at \u2013 for example, the timing of resets. Some customers were a little later than last year, some were a little earlier than last year. It really boils down to there is a couple of customers \u2013 and you should, again, check with our customers here in the US to see what their strategies are. But there is a couple that I would say have a sharper focus on cash flow and timing of receipts. Over time we think that is probably good for us and good for them. But it is just as simple as that.","Kevin Farr","Yes, and I think one of the retailers have been quite public about that. But you should ask the retailers.","Mike Swartz \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Okay. And then just with the \u2013 I guess the foot traffic environment we have had in the toy category over the past 12 months, I mean are you seeing anything differently? And how does that maybe influence how you're spending on trade, marketing, etc.?","Bryan Stockton","Well, I always start with our number one objective is to try to create demand for our toys. And then our second job is to make sure those toys are where consumers are buying. So from an internal standpoint that is what we focus on.","If I take a step back and think on a macro basis I think what is encouraging this year is that the toy category has been growing in the measured markets both in Europe and in the US, it is up about 4% or 5%. I think that is very good for the category and it is ultimately good for Mattel.","We have historically invested in a variety of channels to try to make sure our toys are where people are buying. And there is always discussion about what is happening online. We would expect online toy sales to continue to grow. And that is why we continue to invest in our omni-channel capabilities.","Kevin has talked to you about project Launch Pad, that is now being activated at American Girl and we are going to be using that across some other brands as well. We launched our Thomas direct to consumer as another way to become a little more omni-channel focused. So as we look at it, again, we have to create demand for our products and we are going to sell our products wherever consumers want to buy them.","Mike Swartz \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","All right, great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Linda Bolton Weiser of B. Riley. You may begin.","Linda Bolton Weiser \u2013 B. Riley & Co.","Hi. I was wondering if you could just kind of \u2013 I'm sure you will talk about this at your analyst meeting, but your strategy to work on developing new brand platforms. I think you had a strategy to do that every 1 or 2 years or something. So could you update us on if you still think that is a wise thing to do?","And related to that, I am just curious if you think that that strategy could put some tension between you and entertainment companies who own Internet intellectual property. Because essentially you are trying to develop your own intellectual property. And does that pit you in competition with those companies that are issuing licenses? So I wonder if that is something you have been thinking about long-term in terms of strategy? Thanks.","Bryan Stockton","Hey, good morning, Linda. As we think about new brands, there is really 3 sources of new brands. One, as you mentioned, is partnering with some of our terrific entertainment partners and those brands we hope to have long relationships with. The second is creating new brands as we have with Monster High or BOOMco and those are organic.","And we also think about new brands through acquisition with things like our HiT acquisition and Thomas and with MEGA Brands with the MEGA Brand as well as RoseArt. So we really think about those 3 areas as a source of new brands just not exclusively organic growth.","Having said that, we continue to work on developing new brands, that is important to this industry, it is important to us. We have expanded into new categories which we think is important for Mattel, we have expanded into construction with the acquisition of MEGA and RoseArt into Arts & Crafts. We expanded into outdoor with BOOMco. So we're going to continue to look across the portfolio and look at these various strategies and how to enter.","As it relates to tensions with licensees, I am really not going to comment on that. We are very good, for example, in the doll portfolio with the brands that we have, our organic brands, Ever After High, Monster High, Barbie and of course American Girl. We are going to continue to look at how we can segment the fashion doll market and continue to grow that. We do the same thing with our vehicles business and infant preschool as well.","Linda Bolton Weiser \u2013 B. Riley & Co.","Okay. Can I also ask about Western Europe. I believe you said that your POS was a little bit soft in Western Europe. Can you comment on, is that a function of just the macro environment or the whole toy category there being soft? Or are you just having some issues with certain brands in terms of your market shares?","Bryan Stockton","Well, I would say it is not so much a macro toy issue because, again, the toy category is growing there and so, again, that's we think very favorable. We've had probably some greater inventory challenges in Europe than perhaps we thought at the beginning of the year and we have been working through that.","We have also in Europe been applying some of the lessons learned from our spending mix model and shifting spending out of the third quarter into the fourth quarter. And I won't get into details by country, but as I said, in the US we've been trying to shift significant amounts of media from the third to the fourth quarter.","So, I think it is us getting our spending right and getting ourselves in a better position from an inventory standpoint. Cleaner inventory means we can start shifting new product and I think that is good for us.","Linda Bolton Weiser \u2013 B. Riley & Co.","And just on housekeeping, can you just remind me which of those sub segments BOOMco is being reported in?","Kevin Farr","It is in the entertainment segment.","Linda Bolton Weiser \u2013 B. Riley & Co.","Okay, great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Greg Badishkanian of Citigroup. You may begin.","Greg Badishkanian \u2013 Citigroup","Great. Thank you. You know fourth quarter of last year was disappointing for you guys and you've had some time to think about some of the issues there. So how do you think you are positioned this year versus last year at this time? Because you've made a lot of changes, you are making some progress in your brands this year. How are you positioned this year versus last year?","Bryan Stockton","Well, I guess I will start by saying I'm not going to give a lot of guidance on the fourth quarter because we don't really manage the business quarter to quarter. But as we look at the fourth quarter, again, we are really focused on 3 things: number one, improving our POS momentum.","I mentioned in the third quarter we've made progress and that is good. Our intention with the changes we made in our marketing programs is to continue that improving into the fourth quarter. We talked about the fact we need to really work on inventories.","We started with an inventory challenge at the beginning of the year and I think we have done a terrific job through the first 9 months of working that through and getting ourselves in a better position there and driving profitability.","As I think about the fourth quarter, we are going to have some headwinds, particularly at Fisher-Price and Monster High. Recall Monster High had record POS and record shipments in the third quarter, and was still doing relatively well from the POS standpoint in the fourth quarter. So that is going to be a challenge for us.","But as I think about the tailwinds we have, we've got MEGA. That is a brand-new business for us and we are very pleased with that. BOOMco, we are into our first holiday season with that. Of course, there is a lot of momentum on Frozen and we are really working hard to capture that opportunity. We've got the American Girl expansion with 2 new markets here in the US and a third shop in Canada.","I talked about our retail inventories are cleaner. But I really am pleased with our lessons learned from the spending mix model. We are spending more money on media, both digital and analog, and that is good. And as we see this unfold, as Kevin said, we still have some flexibility in the fourth quarter. And as we see things sort of ebb and flow in terms of POS, we are going to have the ability to turn the faucet on a little faster on some brands that need it, maybe turn it down on some others that maybe don't need it so much.","But I would say the most important thing for us is this focus on POS. And as the POS continues to improve, the shipment POS gap ought to begin to close.","Kevin Farr","Yes, and I think the good news, too, is the toy industry has been doing well this year. It is up 4% year to date. And when we look at the good in our portfolio, obviously Frozen is great for us. We also have BOOMco and we have got MEGA and continued momentum on Thomas. And we have seen challenges on Fisher-Price, Monster High and Barbie, but we are very focused in on executing better in the fourth quarter.","We've got a lot of work done on the path to purchase, and we also aligned our advertising and trade programs consistent with our spending mix model, and we are laser focused on execution this fall. So ultimately, it is going to come out to our consumers coming out and buying our products. And also the other thing is what are retailers' outlook for the holiday season, which we think they are positive on, given the toy industry. But ultimately, how cautious are they going to be given the current economic environment.","Greg Badishkanian \u2013 Citigroup","Good. And just moving to Disney, what would you say the EBIT margins are for that versus the overall company?","Kevin Farr","I think they are, like all of our fashion doll category or doll portfolio, they are higher than the average.","Greg Badishkanian \u2013 Citigroup","Okay. EBIT, not gross margins, right?","Kevin Farr,","Yes.","Greg Badishkanian \u2013 Citigroup","Okay.","Kevin Farr","I mean gross margins and EBIT.","Greg Badishkanian \u2013 Citigroup","Right. Okay. And then also because you were selling Disney, maybe it prevented you from introducing some fashion doll ideas. Were you holding back a little bit? Are there some things that you can do now that you don't \u2013 you won't have a relationship in 2016 with Disney that maybe will give you some opportunities to add some new ideas and some new products?","Bryan Stockton","Greg, what I would say is we manage our relationships with all of our license stores across all of our categories, whether it is infant preschool or die cast vehicles or fashion dolls or games, for example. And a part of our responsibility is we treat their brands as if they are our own brands. And that is exactly how we have treated Disney Princess and Cars and our Nickelodeon partnerships and WWE and Warner Bros. as well.","So we always treat it like as if it were our own. Having said that, we obviously, as I mentioned, have a hole in our revenue for 2016. We know that fashion doll play is important, we know that the Princess play pattern is very important.","We have I would call it deep and wide experience with Princess play patterns, whether it is in our Fisher-Price Friends business or whether it is in our fashion doll business. And you can imagine that we have a whole bunch of people trying to think very creatively about how we fill this gap. And we will look forward to sharing some of those ideas with you when they get a little closer to reality.","Greg Badishkanian \u2013 Citigroup","Great, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Eric Handler of MKM Partners. You may begin.","Eric Handler \u2013 MKM Partners","Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Two questions for you. First, on MEGA can you give us a sense of as you transition from the distribution model internationally to taking it more in-house, what type of delta do you think you can achieve by doing that?","And then secondly, you talked about a 40% increase in the fourth quarter for your media spend. And so we're hoping you could sort of break out in advertising and promotion expenses how much of that bucket is media spend. And then what is in the other bucket? And I am assuming in that other bucket we are going to see a decrease to sort of offset that on a year-over-year basis. So wonder if you could talk about that.","Bryan Stockton","Well, let me take your last question first. I'm not going to get into details about the marketing plans for all of our brands and media. What I would tell you is, again, based on the spending mix model lessons learned that with have throughout the year and we've been validating it quarter by quarter to make sure that we feel comfortable with the results and the validations have been we think very positive.","But the most important thing is we are shifting money into the fourth quarter. And again, as we discussed in our February meeting with you, in hindsight last year in 2013 we wish we would have changed the mix. We have done that this year. I would say we are going to be much more fluid in how we spent whether it is on analog media or digital media or promotions. But we have gotten I think very analytical about how we think about that.","Kevin Farr","And I think with regard to that shaft, 40% shift is in the US. The international markets aren't that big, but we do have a tremendous amount of spending in the fourth quarter and what we have done is realigned that spending according to our spending mix model.","So our expectation is with even our existing spend base last year we should drive better top-line revenues because we think it is on the right platform at the right time, at the right price with the right retail promotions also happening.","Bryan Stockton","Then as it relates to MEGA, I'm not going to give guidance on how big a POS and sales bump we're going to get by taking this over. What I would tell you is that we have had a good relationship with these distributors. I know MEGA did over the years as they have done a nice solid job for it. But I think there is a couple of things that we're going to see.","Number one is you eliminate the distributor market which tends to get the prices probably a little higher than they ought to be. So I think as we take this over you are going to see sharper pricing and you will see the margins go up on MEGA which is good.","Secondly, as I look at when I am in the markets I see, frankly, pretty good displays in some markets, but in other markets there is room for improvement I would say.","And then finally, I think one of the things that is just as important as is the product on display is the marketing muscle behind it. We have the ability to take all of our experience in international and our scale in international and apply that to not only the distribution side but the marketing side as well in terms of trying to create demand.","And as we all know, the number one job when you expand something international is to create demand. And we think we've got terrific brand and some terrific opportunities to migrate some of our brands like Monster High and other things into MEGA. So we are looking forward to the opportunities.","Kevin Farr","Yes and I think they've also had some great global licenses in things like Halo and as we look at some movie properties for next year. So I think there's opportunity to grow it internationally. Right now it is 70% US, 30% international. Most of the international business is in English-speaking countries. So with our distribution platform I think we've got a great opportunity to grow MEGA internationally.","And also our sales will be higher because we will pick up the distribution uplift in sales, so that is a great opportunity for us. And we will provide more detail in a couple of weeks when Geoff Massingberd meets with you in New York for those of you that are attending our investor conference in a couple weeks.","Eric Handler \u2013 MKM Partners","Great. Just one other follow-up question. When you look at Monster High, and sort of it has come down from its peak in terms of sales. Is there anything particular that you can point to why we are seeing this weakness with Monster High? Is it just the new characters aren't resonating? And along those lines, do you see Monster High now being a finite life type of product or is this still an evergreen type product.","Bryan Stockton","Yes, Eric, great question. I think there is a couple of things on Monster High. Number one, as we look at the brand I think the first thing we recognize, it is still a huge brand in fashion dolls just in terms of nominal sales of POS it is still quite large.","One of the things that you are going to hear Richard talk about in a couple of weeks is that we are thinking about making it a little more relevant and irreverent, which is really what drove it at the beginning. And so, that is I think very important as we begin to kind of dial up the energy behind this.","Secondly, I think as you think about this brand it has been a tremendous brand in terms of the launch. And now it is kind of transitioning to an evergreen brand. And we are looking at the spending mix model on Monster High just as we have on Barbie and some other brands. And we're likely to start to shift some of the mix of what we spend on Monster High to recognize the fact that it is out of its initial launch phase and now more of an evergreen brand.","So to summarize, we need to bring a little more stock value to it and that is appropriate given the older girl target for Monster High. And we are going to look at changing our spending mix to really recognize where it is in its lifecycle. But we are keen on Monster High, it is big and it is going to be an important part of our portfolio.","Kevin Farr","Yes and I think, again, I think if you looked at this past year I think it's been more about more dolls. And I think as we look at 2015 we are going to reinject some irreverence and some shock value and also change some of the form. So I think we've got some ideas to transition this to an evergreen brand. And I think, as Bryan mentioned, one important element of that really is putting more advertising dollars behind it which we are doing this fall.","Eric Handler \u2013 MKM Partners","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jaime Katz of Morningstar. You may begin.","Jaime Katz \u2013 Morningstar","Hi. Good morning, guys. I have a quick question. You guys mentioned omni-channel briefly and I know in the past you have talked about changes you are making. Are there any new initiatives to better connect to consumers in a measurable way that you would like to share with us?","Bryan Stockton","Hi, Jaime. We have talked in the past about our Launch Pad program that we are really sort of focusing the initial launch of Launch Pad, pun intended there, with American Girl. And we are pleased with the progress and the execution of that so far.","Our objective is next year to really start to think about how we apply this to other parts of Mattel in terms of connecting consumers with us. It is a very rich platform in terms of our ability to connect with consumers, communicate with consumers, market to consumers.","We have got a lot of work ahead of us on it, but I would say we feel pretty good about that. And as you think about omni-channel, it really is a couple things. It is how you connect with consumers, it is things like making sure we have the right websites and connections there. It is email connections with consumers. It is event connections with consumers.","And then we have to think about channels. And again, we really spend a lot of time on channel management to make sure our products are where consumers want whether it is e-commerce, whether it is a kiosk in Spain, a hypermarket in Brazil or a toy specialist in France, we really work to make sure our products are where consumers want to buy them.","So, it is not as simple as it is 1 project or 1 initiative, there is a whole fabric of things we are doing to make sure that we are well-positioned for an omni-channel strategy.","Kevin Farr","Yes, I think Launch Pad has brought us this state-of-the-art platform to have digital marketing at the right place at the right time on the right platform no matter what platform that is. And we have been doing a lot of work this year on path to purchase and really focusing on improving our digital capability so that as a consumer goes down the path to purchase and gets to conversion, we have the right message at the right time in the right place to hopefully convert more of them this year.","And we know that 80% of people before they shop are online or on their digital platforms focusing on understanding the \u2013 what they want to purchase. They sort of get that down to a couple and 20% of them buy online, the other 80% go to brick and mortar. So that is why these omni-channel capabilities are important. And we have done a lot of work in this past year to execute better this fall.","Jaime Katz \u2013 Morningstar","Okay. And then lastly, unless I missed it, can you comment a little bit about what is working in Latin America and what isn't? It had been a pretty promising area for growth for you guys in the past.","Bryan Stockton","Well, we are still bullish on Latin America. If you look to the fundamentals of Latin America you have a lot of middle-class household formation. And we know that is one of the key drivers of toy category growth.","We've also talked about in the past that if you look at our shares in Latin America they tend to be higher than what you see, for example, here in the US. And that is because we have been there a long time, we have invested in our brands there for a long time. So we are still bullish in Latin America.","I think there is a couple factors that are impacting where we are today. Number one is macroeconomics and you can all read the stories about what is now called the Atlantic coast of Latin America and the political and economic challenges there. And we are seeing that both in terms of consumers and customer responses to that.","And that secondarily, we spent a lot of time this year talking about our inventory challenges, both owned and at retail. Latin America has had those as well, particularly in our 2 largest markets, Mexico and Brazil. So I think once we work through that and we are going to continue to invest in our brands and continue to invest in channels and regain the momentum that we had in Latin America. We still love it, it is a great place, it is about $1 billion of business for us and we make good money there.","Jaime Katz \u2013 Morningstar","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Drew Crum of Stifel. You may begin.","Drew Crum \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Okay, thanks. Good morning, everyone. So, on the Disney Princess license can you remind us what the selloff period is for that in 2016?","Bryan Stockton","Drew, I will have to get back to you on the details on that, but we are essentially going to drive everything we can with POS with the Frozen and the rest of Princesses through not only this holiday season but the next holiday season as well. So we have 2 more holidays to drive POS and partner with Disney on that.","Drew Crum \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Got it, okay. And then you touched on this to some degree, but can you get into some more detail on the variance in POS domestically versus internationally? My sense is that a big part of that is Fisher-Price. And so, as you look at the fourth quarter beyond the increase in media spend and some of the innovation you have across the other categories, is that enough to overcome the weakness you are seeing in Fisher-Price? And do you have confidence that you turn positive POS in the fourth quarter?","Bryan Stockton","Well, right now from a Company standpoint we are positive. We said that globally we are up a couple percentage points, international is strong single-digits and the US is kind of flattish. As we look across the line we are making good progress in terms of our sequential improvement in POS.","On Fisher-Price I mentioned that international POS is positive and we like that. I think as we've shared with you in the past, international is much less developed for Fisher-Price than it is, for example, on Barbie or Hot Wheels.","So as you kind of do the math you have to have a pretty substantial improvement in POS in international to offset softness in the US. And I mentioned we are likely to have some headwinds still in the US on Fisher-Price with some brand momentum issues and some inventory issues as well.","And as you know, the Friends business is a very US centric business and we've got some challenges there as well as we have some properties that are facing some top comps. And we have some good new properties like, for example, Dora and Friends and we are waiting on that great new show to create engagement.","So that is kind of my Fisher-Price specific. But I would tell you again, international POS is up. If you look at our 4 core brands for international it is up across all four. We think that is encouraging. So again, as I said on Fisher-Price and I'll say it for Mattel and international \u2013 I'm not going to make the statement we're back on track, but we are certainly making a solid step towards getting back on track on international.","Drew Crum \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Okay. And then just one last question for me is \u2013 there was a question earlier about the Time Warner, the DC film slate that was announced yesterday. Assuming that the license you have runs parallel with that slate, does that in any way change your philosophy around licensing your own IP for movies to other studios?","Bryan Stockton","Well, I would say generally not. We have some IP that people always find interesting and we have got some projects underway in various stages and studios. And it is very difficult, as you know, to create a great movie. We always partner with whoever is interested in our brands. We have yet to have a theatrical release.","I think our philosophy has always been we like to focus on our day in day out marketing whether it is Barbie DVDs or advertising or better end caps for Hot Wheels, for example. So our Company is all about everyday marketing, everyday consumer engagement. We like to partner with our entertainment partners on their movies. If we were to get a Barbie or Monster High or Hot Wheels movie that would be great, but that is really not core to what drives our brands.","Drew Crum \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Got it, okay. Thanks, guys.","Drew Vollero","Operator, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Our next question is from Stephanie Wissink of Piper Jaffray. You maybegin.","Maria Vizuete \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Great. Thanks for taking our questions. This is actually Maria Vizuete on for Steph. We are just wondering as it relates to the decline of American Girl, we are wondering if you can provide us some color as to what percentage was related to anniversarying the Molly doll versus declines in ticket or transactions? And are there any similar headwinds in Q4?","Bryan Stockton","Hi, Maria, welcome. I'm not going to get into any specifics on American Girl. I think we were pretty clear that if you look sort of year on year last year we opened a very successful store in Columbus, Ohio. We didn't open any stores this year in the third quarter. We have 2 store openings in the fourth quarter, we had one last year, and we have another shop-in-shop opening with Indigo in Ottawa, Canada. So that is encouraging I think for American Girl.","You know, the BeForever \u2013 it is a launch of our historical line and we have always had a very strong position in that particular segment. But we really like what Gene McKenzie and her team has done to sort of refresh that line and breathe some new life and make it a little more contemporary. And I know we're all excited for Gene to share her vision of that with you in a couple weeks.","Maria Vizuete \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Great, thank you. And then just last question on trends in Barbie. Can you talk about the trends in the US versus international? And also, is there any color you can provide on the ready-to-wear collection that retailed during the quarter? Thank you.","Bryan Stockton","Well, if you think about Barbie, I mentioned that the Barbie POS is kind of low-single-digits and that is a marked improvement over where we have been. Historically international has always had slightly stronger POS trends than the US and I would say that is still consistent. So that is I think about as far as I'm going to go on Barbie POS.","As it relates to the ready-to-wear, I can tell you that I personally was a big purchaser of that for my granddaughter. But no, I am not going to get into specifics on that one either. But it is a terrific partnership and it was very, very successful.","Maria Vizuete \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Great, thanks so much.","Drew Vollero","Thank you.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference call may be recorded.","I will now turn the conference over to your host for today's call, Whitney Steininger. Ms. Steininger, you may begin.","Whitney Steininger - Mattel, Inc.","Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me today are: Margo Georgiadis, Mattel's Chief Executive Officer; Ynon Kreiz, who will succeed Margo as Chief Executive Officer following this call; Richard Dickson, Mattel's President and Chief Operating Officer; and Joe Euteneuer, Mattel's Chief Financial Officer.","As you know, this afternoon we reported Mattel's 2018 first quarter financial results. We will begin today's call by providing commentary on our results. We will then provide time to take your questions.","To help guide our discussion today, we have provided you with a slide presentation. Our discussion and our slide presentation will reference non-GAAP financial measures such as gross sales; adjusted net sales; adjusted gross profit and adjusted gross margin; adjusted other selling and administrative expenses; adjusted operating income or loss; adjusted earnings or loss per share; earnings before interest, depreciation and amortization or EBITDA; adjusted EBITDA; and constant currency.","Our earnings release also includes non-GAAP financial measures.

These statements are based on currently available information and they are subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.","We describe some of these uncertainties in the Risk Factors section of our 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K, our 2018 Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our earnings release and the presentation accompanying this call, in other filings we make with the SEC from time to time, as well as in our other public statements. Mattel does not update forward-looking statements and expressly disclaims any obligation to do so.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Margo.","Mary Margaret Hastings Georgiadis - Mattel, Inc.","Thanks, everyone, for joining today's call. First, I would like to address the news announced last week. As you know, effective today, I am stepping down as CEO of Mattel. It has been an honor to work with this incredibly talented team over the last 14 months as we put in place a clear strategy, roadmap and took aggressive action to transform Mattel into a high-performing toy company again.","I would specifically like to thank Richard and Joe for their partnership. During this important time in Mattel's life cycle, Richard has continued to be the brand and creative visionary and a strong commercial leader who now has the right organization, structure and processes in place to deliver consistent results across our regions. Joe has been instrumental to shaping a rigorous cross-functional program of simplification initiatives and a disciplined approach to our investments to restore medium-term growth and profitability.","Along with the rest of the board, I am very confident that Ynon is the right leader to take this company to its next stage of growth. I have known Ynon for a decade and have witnessed his strong leadership and track record of successfully driving transformations to accelerate growth. And this is especially true for businesses that thrive on creativity.","Ynon has worked closely with me, Richard and Joe since he's joined our board. He is an incredible champion for our business and a great complement to the leadership team.","I will continue to serve as an advisor to Ynon, Richard and Joe to ensure a smooth transition. I want to thank everyone at Mattel, our investors and our leadership team for their tireless commitment to inspiring wonder in kids across the world.","Before turning over the call to Ynon, I'd like to provide a few high-level comments about the first quarter. After Ynon, Richard will discuss our brand performance in the quarter, as well as the progress we are making against our strategic pillars. Joe will then provide more detail on the quarter, including the plan to address TRU, our progress on Structural Simplification and the strategic investments that we're making to support our future growth.","Turning to the first quarter. While the Toys \"R\" Us liquidation created some challenges, setting this aside, Mattel is off to a good start with early momentum. Excluding TRU, worldwide revenues were positive in the first quarter with important progress in North America, now that POS and shipping are in alignment.","The team's hard work in developing our brands as 360 degree play systems and experiences continues to show positive impact with double-digit momentum in both Barbie and Hot Wheels continuing across the globe. And as Joe will explain, we continue to make progress in our Structural Simplification cost savings initiatives and strategic investments, which underpin our plan to restore the growth and profitability you expect from a high-performing toy company.","I will now turn the call over to Ynon to make a few comments.","Ynon Kreiz - Mattel, Inc.","Thank you, Margo. I'm very excited about the opportunity to lead Mattel as its new CEO and deliver on our strategic plan as we'll return the company to its leadership position as a high-performing toy company. We have a lot of work to do to reach our objectives, but I'm very confident that we have the right plan and the right team in place and, as you will hear today, we are already making strong progress against our strategic pillars.","My immediate focus includes the following priorities: Implementing our Structural Simplification to restore profitability, stabilizing revenue, reinvigorating our culture to drive creativity, which I believe is essential to our success, and strengthening our collaboration with our partners. Long-term, I'm committed to better leveraging our intellectual property to unlock the full potential of this great company.","I look forward to working with the talented team here to deliver on our transformation plan and maximize long-term value. And I look forward to speaking and meeting with all of you, our analysts and investors, as we continue to provide updates and discuss our opportunities ahead.","I want to thank Margo for her leadership, her hard work, and her many important contributions. It has been a pleasure working alongside her at Mattel during my time with her in this company.","I'm happy to take your questions at the end of the call and I now will turn over to Richard to take over from here.","Richard L. Dickson - Mattel, Inc.","Thank you, Ynon. I'd like to start by thanking Margo for her partnership and vision. It's been a pleasure working alongside her to reset the strategic foundations of the company, and now we are focused on executing the plan to regain growth, improve profitability and achieve our medium-term objectives.","I would also like to echo Margo's comments about Ynon. I've had the opportunity to work closely with Ynon for several months, and I am eager to move forward together and work with a leader who deeply understands the importance of creativity and has a track record of unlocking that value.","Now, let me provide a few comments about our performance in the quarter. As you know, we have been on this journey to transform the business and despite significant headwinds, I can say with conviction that the continuity of the team's efforts to stay on course and execute against our strategy is paying off. And you could see that in the results this quarter.","For the first quarter, excluding the impact of the TRU revenue reversal, gross sales would have been up 2% worldwide. All regions were positive at actual FX, except American Girl. Importantly, excluding the impact of TRU, North America gross sales were up 4%, demonstrating the early results of our turnaround. International gross sales were up 5% as reported, which includes a benefit from currency.","As you know, we have worked hard to get POS and shipping moving in tighter alignment across all geographic regions, which is contributing to our results. Looking ahead, we expect second quarter POS growth will be softer due to a tough comp as a result of two factors: one, the year-over-year Easter shift; and two, the theatrical release of Cars 3 in June 2017.","Turning to our brand performance, our Power Brands, particularly Barbie and Hot Wheels, continued to deliver strong performance across regions. In addition, we now have robust programs in place and an action plan we're implementing at Fisher-Price, Thomas & Friends, and American Girl to improve performance over time. Let me provide a short summary of each.","We have been laser-focused on reinvigorating our Power Brands based on a clear vision and purpose, and there is no better case study of progress than Barbie. I'm proud of the team and their continued efforts to sustain and build upon the momentum of this brand. As our performance shows, Barbie is hot in North America and globally. Worldwide gross sales were up 24% for the first quarter as reported, and POS was up similarly in double digits.","We now have a multiyear trend and a compelling purpose of inspiring girls to dream big, which will impact the franchise opportunity for consumer products, live events, and other brand extension opportunities. Barbie is a platform for girl empowerment, and I am confident and passionate about where we're going to take this franchise.","I am pleased to report that Hot Wheels is off to a strong start as well this year. Worldwide gross sales as reported were up 15% for the quarter, and POS was up similarly. Over the past two years, we've been transforming Hot Wheels, moving it from a diecast car to a 360-degree connected system of play. Core diecast performed very well in the quarter, as did tracks and play sets with the launch of the new City line and continued momentum of Track Builder, which are driving results and reinvigorating the brand. Looking ahead, the Hot Wheels 50th Anniversary kicks into high gear on May 17, our official birthday, with multiple exciting execution platforms.","Fisher-Price and Thomas & Friends worldwide gross sales were down 8% as reported, and POS was down similarly, as we expected, although International POS was positive. POS was down mainly in January and February due to higher clearance sales at retail after a slowdown in the fourth quarter. However, in March, the business pivoted with clear signs of improvement in key areas such as infant, Little People play sets, and Imaginext, all of which continue to perform well.","Additionally, we've had a strong response from retailers to our fall key items. And looking ahead, we will need to carefully manage through the TRU transition as Fisher-Price was the most indexed brand, given Babies \"R\" Us.","As you saw at Toy Fair, we have new leadership and plans in place for improving Fisher-Price's performance. In 2018, we are focused on stabilizing the brand and setting the stage for growth in 2019. Looking forward, our strategy under Chuck Scothon's leadership is to continue to reinvigorate the brand. We are doing this with strong products that are priced right to provide the best solutions for every age and stage, and evolving our strategy to be a true partner to parents. We are also leveraging our proven playbook from China and ensuring consistent retail execution across markets.","Regarding Thomas & Friends, we are excited that the brand has been delivering strong audience ratings on Nickelodeon, ranking as a top 5 show among preschoolers on all TV since its debut in mid-March. The early broadcast success bodes well with retailers, who are gaining confidence and seeing store sales picking up as a result. We're looking forward to the launch of new refreshed content in the second half of 2018, which we will expect to improve brand health.","Now in American Girl, we've launched a large-scale turnaround program. American Girl remains one of the most beloved franchises in the U.S. and has also proven to perform well in our international partnerships. We're investing in this key franchise because we believe it will contribute significant returns for our shareholders when we get it back on track. Joe will discuss the turnaround plan in more detail in a few moments.","We continue to be focused on rightsizing the Toy Box. And this is the year we're working to transform it into a more stable and profitable innovation portfolio. We now have Geoff Walker, who you met at Toy Fair, leading the Toy Box. He is one of the most recognized toy leaders in the industry, and I'm working closely with him to reinvigorate toy innovation at Mattel. As expected, our Toy Box business declined, as we continue to optimize the portfolio to improve stability and profitability.","To help you better track progress, we now break down the performance of Toy Box in two categories, Owned Brands and Partner Brands. Our Owned Brands were down 6% in the quarter, largely driven by MEGA. We also had important strengths, Enchantimals continues to perform well and games overall is strong, led by the launch of DOS, which is a sellout in a number of markets. In the second quarter, we're looking forward to the launch of Polly Pocket.","Partner Brands were down 14% as reported due to the timing of launches of select brands. We have amazing partners in our portfolio, Disney, Nickelodeon, Universal, Warner Bros., and WWE. All of them have exciting launch programs in the back half, as you saw at Toy Fair. For the quarter, we're looking forward to the Jurassic World movie, which debuts in June. We have gotten great feedback from retailers and early reads at retail are encouraging.","As we work to reshape operation in conjunction with Structural Simplification, we continue to reduce layers, increase speed and agility and maximize the best talent in the toy business. I feel good about the opportunity ahead with early indications that we are headed in the right direction delivering what we said we would, and gaining momentum with the right team in place.","I'll now turn the call over to Joe to walk through the quarter and our strategic investments in more detail. Joe?","Joseph J. Euteneuer - Mattel, Inc.","Thank you, Richard, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me start by thanking Margo for being a great partner. She has had a tremendous impact on the organization over the past year and I wish her all the best in her new endeavor.","I look forward to partnering with Ynon and believe we are in great hands with him at the helm. I have no doubt that his insights and expertise will be invaluable as we progress our strategy and operationalize our plan forward.","So with that, let's turn to our results. I'm pleased to report that our first quarter performance reflects continued progress on executing our transformation plan. We delivered to our quarterly expectation on the top-line with gross sales up 2%, excluding the impact of Toys \"R\" Us revenue reversal.","The organization continues to make progress on our $650 million Structural Simplification cost savings initiatives and prioritized investments. Our consistent execution on a quarter-by-quarter basis will enable us to deliver our medium-term objectives for our shareholders.","The Toys \"R\" Us liquidation is an unfortunate event, and a near-term headwind in our industry. We have been proactive in taking action to mitigate its impact on our business. As I review the financial performance for the quarter, I will note the areas impacted by Toys \"R\" Us liquidation and our outlook for the year.","Today, I will walk you through the P&L, update you on the balance sheet and liquidity, lay out actions against our Structural Simplification initiatives, and update you on our strategic investments. We will then open the line for questions.","As I shared earlier, our gross sales in the first quarter were up 2%, excluding the impact of the Toys \"R\" Us revenue reversal. In Q1, we incurred charges of $87 million related to the Toys \"R\" Us liquidation through a combination of revenue reversal and bad debt expense, which primarily related to the United States and the United Kingdom.","Since last fall, we have evaluated several Toys \"R\" Us scenarios and have a proactive mitigation plan in place. We continue to work with other retailers who are energized by the opportunity to expand our relationship and value the strong performance from our key brands. As a result, the final impact of the Toys \"R\" Us liquidation will be dependent upon the number of markets that remain in operation and the impact of inventory liquidation on industry pricing and consumer purchase patterns.","As we shaped our mitigation plan, one factor taken into account was the fact that Toys \"R\" Us carried much higher inventory levels than other retailers to deliver the same POS. Over the next several months, we should have a much clearer view of what parts of TRU will remain and the overall impact on our 2018 revenue.","As we look to Q2, we expect a decline in year-over-year revenue due to the comparability of the Cars 3 launch in Q2 2017 and the impact of the TRU liquidation.","Now, let's discuss sales adjustments. The increase from 9.7% to 11.5% for the quarter was primarily driven by the higher weighting of International sales as a percentage of total sales which is consistent with Q4 2017. We expect our full-year sales adjustment rate to be similar to the first quarter and do not expect a significant year-over-year variance for the full year.","At Toy Fair in February, we told you we expected our 2018 gross margin to increase year over year into the low-40s, driven primarily by our Structural Simplification cost savings initiatives. We also shared that the timing of those savings would be weighted towards the back half of 2018, and that our freight and distribution challenges from 2017 would likely persist into the first half of the year.","Excluding the impact of Toys \"R\" Us liquidation, the first quarter was in line with our full-year plan. And we remain committed to deliver a gross margin in the low-40s, with the majority of the year-over-year benefit coming in the back half of the year.","In the first quarter, our reported gross margin was 30.9%, down from 37.9% in the first quarter of 2017. This includes the cost of goods sold associated with the $30 million of net sales reversed as a result of the Toys \"R\" Us liquidation.","Our accounting treatment of reversing Toys \"R\" Us revenue recorded in the current quarter versus bad debt is consistent with the accounting treatment we used in Q3 2017 when Toys \"R\" Us originally filed for bankruptcy.","Our adjusted gross margin, which was in line with our expectations, was 34.1% of net sales, down from 37.9% in the first quarter of 2017. The primary drivers of the first quarter decline were raw materials inflation as well as the continuation of the freight and logistics cost associated with bringing in-house a previously-outsourced distribution facility we described on our last earnings call. This negative year-over-year impact is expected to be concentrated in the first half of the year.","Meanwhile, our Structural Simplification actions, including the recently implemented reduction of labor overhead in our manufacturing plants, are expected to be realized in the P&L in the back half of this year. We remain committed to deliver our full-year gross margin expectations in the low-40s.","Moving on to advertising. As we shared in February, we expect our full-year advertising rate to return to our historical range of 11% to 13% of net sales as we continue to optimize spend. As part of our Structural Simplification, we've developed full-year advertising and media plans that are expected to save us approximately $30 million to $40 million versus prior year to meet this goal.","Now, let me discuss SG&A. At Toy Fair, we said our 2018 full-year outlook for SG&A would be up slightly year over year, driven by strategic investments, increased incentive and severance and restructuring cost, partially offset by Structural Simplification.","First quarter SG&A was in line with our full-year expectation. In the first quarter, our reported SG&A was $425 million, up $94 million year over year, which included a $57 million bad debt expense related to the Toys \"R\" Us liquidation and $25 million of severance and restructuring costs related to overhead reductions as part of Structural Simplification.","First quarter adjusted SG&A of $341 million was up $15 million compared to prior year, but is on track to meet our full-year expectations. This year-over-year increase was driven primarily by unfavorable foreign exchange, increased employee-related expenses, increased non-cash amortization and strategic investments, partially offset by cost savings from our Structural Simplification.","Now, let me give you an update on taxes. In the first quarter, our income tax benefit was $2.7 million. Our overall 2018 effective tax rate may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to the level and mix of income or losses in our foreign jurisdictions and due to the fact that we established valuation allowance on our U.S. deferred tax assets in the third quarter of 2017. In the U.S. during periods of taxable loss, we would record no income tax benefit, and during periods of income, we would record no income tax expense as the valuation allowance is released.","In the first quarter of 2018, we provided no income tax benefit for any U.S. losses and recorded an income tax benefit on our net foreign losses in jurisdictions with no valuation allowance or in jurisdictions that don't provide a benefit for losses. Additionally, in 2018, we expect the cash we paid for taxes to be similar to the prior year.","Consistent with what we shared at Toy Fair, we do not have an estimate of the mandatory repatriation tax under the Tax Act today. We continue to believe the cash tax impact of repatriation is not expected to be material to our annual cash flows because we will use foreign tax credits and deferred tax assets that we have on our balance sheet to offset the cash tax payments.","Moving to the balance sheet and liquidity. We ended the first quarter with a cash balance of $527 million, which included the benefit of the $1 billion raised in December 2017, partially offset by the impact of the $250 million debt repayment we made during the quarter.","Another critical component of our business transformation is improving working capital. During the first quarter, our working capital improved by $121 million, primarily due to accounts receivable declining $131 million or 16% year over year, resulting in a 7-day reduction in our days sale outstanding and owned inventory declining by $92 million or 12% year over year, as a result of higher obsolescence charges taken in Q4 2017 and continuing to tightly manage our inventory.","Moving to the statement of cash flows, cash flows used for operations was $274 million for the quarter, which was an improvement to the prior-year first quarter usage of $310 million, driven by proactive management of working capital.","The primary driver of investing activities was capital expenditures, which were $47 million for the first quarter, down 33% year over year. Tooling and planned capital expenditures were the primary drivers of this reduction. Our spend is in alignment with our commitment to reduce full-year capital expenditures to about $200 million.","The primary driver of financing activities was the repayment of the $250 million of debt due in March 2018. Additionally, there have been no borrowings against our asset-based lending facility. As we work to execute our business transformation, we will continue to focus on our liquidity through management of our cash, working capital and capital expenditures.","While we do expect Toys \"R\" Us to have an impact, we continue to have adequate liquidity through our cash on hand, the availability of our asset-based lending facility and access to the market.","Now, let me provide an update on our Structural Simplification cost savings initiatives. The organization remains focused on achieving approximately 40% of the $650 million in 2018 with savings heavily weighted towards the second half of the year. Through the first quarter, we have already taken actions toward achieving this goal. These actions are expected to result in full-year run rate savings of approximately $165 million, which includes $85 million in SG&A, $50 million in cost of goods sold, and $30 million in advertising.","Examples of these actions include streamlining and delayering the organization across functions, taking first steps in optimizing our global manufacturing footprint by reducing our plant overhead, and optimizing our real estate footprint by closing our New York City office and three outlet toy stores, as well as restructuring our Fuhu operations. Each of these actions have been taken with careful consideration to manage impact to our top line and to minimize disruption to our ongoing operations. While these are difficult decisions, we remain committed to treating employees fairly during the transition and believe these changes will make us a stronger and more focused company.","Overall, we continue to feel good about our Structural Simplification progress. Importantly, our cost savings initiatives are not dependent on revenue. So we will continue our progress towards the $650 million regardless of the impact of the Toys \"R\" Us liquidation.","Simultaneous with the cost savings initiatives, we are investing in our business for the future. We said at Toy Fair that we intend to invest $85 million in 2018 to help us deliver our strategy and to maximize shareholder value. I want to provide you with an update on the progress we're making. Of the $85 million, $70 million is funded from the P&L, and $49 million of that has been committed to date. Let me update you on two of our key investment areas.","The largest investment area for us is IT, where we have allocated about $30 million of the $85 million to reshaping our operations through a three-year IT transformation. We have kicked off four major projects which will help make us leaner, faster, and a smarter company.","For business-to-business, we are setting up a modern self-service digital platform for our retail customers, which will make Mattel easier to do business with. It allows end-to-end order management for small to medium accounts with low to no-touch customer support. We are investing in our consumer digital content supply chain to enable a faster shift to omni-channel. These enhancements include simplifying workflows for sales and marketing campaigns, consolidating our marketing and digital sites and experiences, streamlining our in-house content creation and publishing capabilities, and improving direct consumer engagement.","We spend over $0.5 billion a year on trade spend which we can optimize. To enable this, we are standardizing our global trade spend systems and processes to increase consistency and transparency, improve analytics, and reduce manual work. We are investing in digital design and development to enable seamless collaboration from product design to market, which will increase our efficiency and agility in a digital-first world.","A second key investment which we launched in Q1 is the turnaround plan for American Girl. As Richard mentioned, we believe the value-creation opportunity for our shareholders is significant from restoring the iconic brand. Our turnaround plan focuses on four areas.","The first area is overhauling the omni-channel experience and ensuring we get the price\/value equation right. This includes reinvigorating the premium retail experience with better merchandising and marketing that inspire kids to want to come back more often. The second area is enhancing customer relationships and conversion through best-in-class data management and CRM and improving the online experience and personalization. The third area is delivering a far smarter sequential direct marketing and loyalty program to increase purchase frequency with American Girl's most avid customers. Last, we will modernize the brand's content ecosystem to both attract new customers and deepen brand passion of existing customers.","We have an investment plan in place to enable these important turnaround initiatives for American Girl. When executed well, American Girl has the potential to return to one of our most profitable franchises and is very well positioned to win in a more experiential and digital-first world. We are excited about our plan to revitalize this brand and will provide updates on our progress.","We will continue to provide you with updates on our major investments each quarter. We believe these investments along with the cost we're taking out of the business will help reposition Mattel for the future and are confident that over time they will provide the growth and returns you should expect from a high-performing toy company.","Before I close, I want to sincerely thank the Mattel team for their hard work in the first quarter. Positive sales growth, excluding the impact of Toys \"R\" Us revenue reversal, is a great accomplishment. And to our shareholders, we continue to hold ourselves accountable to the commitments we make to you and can assure you we are taking the necessary steps to create long-term shareholder value.","Thank you for your time today, and we'll now open the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Tim Conder of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Timothy Andrew Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you, just a couple here. So on Barbie and Hot Wheels, we've assumed that, again, the POS and the wholesale that we're seeing are fairly well on track. I guess it's question number one.","And question number two, there was a little bit of color given earlier in the week by a competitor. But what are your views of the timetable of the TRU liquidation? When will it be completed? And I guess more importantly to that, completed being out of the stores, or that product ultimately being completed in the hands of being sold to an end consumer?","Richard L. Dickson - Mattel, Inc.","So, Tim, I'll take the first part of the question. It's Richard. On the Barbie and Hot Wheels front, we're incredibly proud of the performance for the quarter. But as you know, these brands and our portfolio has been in deep work in the context of getting POS and shipment aligned and ultimately driving the 360-degree play systems that these brands are now getting traction with.","So I think we're seeing the beginning results of what we believe is great momentum. And Barbie, of course, having a really terrific quarter, Hot Wheels right behind it, we're excited with the programs that we have to maintain these numbers, and we expect to have continued great narration in the future.","Joseph J. Euteneuer - Mattel, Inc.","This is Joe. In regards to the second part of your question, I think everybody is pointing towards midyear, maybe in the summer, but there's so many moving pieces with the TRU liquidation. You've got everything going on in Asia. You've got what just happened with Smyths and you've got the Canadian deal, so it's really hard to predict.","Timothy Andrew Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And would we anticipate also, Joe, just going forward here, just a lower minimum level of cash that the company will operate with? And you talked about the liquidity that the company has, the market, the cash on hand, the ABL. And do you feel pretty comfortable at this point looking out especially to another maturity of debt you have a year out from now?","Joseph J. Euteneuer - Mattel, Inc.","Without a doubt. Remember, in December, we went out and sort of restructured our capital structure by putting on the $1 billion and then putting the $1.6 billion ABL in place. So we feel good about that. We haven't had to draw on the ABL to-date. We're focused on the Structural Simplification program. It helps to take the cost out of the company. So yeah, we know we have the maturity coming up in May of 2019. We feel we have access to the markets. So we feel we're pretty well-positioned.","Timothy Andrew Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Margo, best of wishes. And, Ynon, welcome aboard.","Mary Margaret Hastings Georgiadis - Mattel, Inc.","Thank you.","Ynon Kreiz - Mattel, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gerrick Johnson of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey. Good afternoon. I guess I'll ask the same question I asked Margo a year ago. Ynon, you come from outside the toy industry and I guess one criticism we hear within the industry is you don't have toy experience. So what would you say to someone who says you don't have toy experience and what makes you qualified, I guess, to run a toy company? Thank you.","Ynon Kreiz - Mattel, Inc.","Thank you, nice to meet you. I actually do have toy experience from my work at Fox Kids that I launched and ran and took public. But I bring to this more than 20 years of relevant experience, including having served as Chairman and CEO of three companies. I successfully delivered transformation to create significant value to shareholders, and more than anything I have deep experience in focusing on operations and execution of turnaround plans. So I feel pretty good about where I sit.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. And, Joe, if you could talk about channel inventory out there excluding Toys \"R\" Us. How is the channel inventory at all the other retailers looking right now?","Joseph J. Euteneuer - Mattel, Inc.","Very good. We're feeling very good about our positioning and working with our customers, so we are \u2013 I mean, we feel like we're getting our mojo back, quite frankly. I mean, the team really executed well in the first quarter and we continue to maintain and we did a great job at year-end bringing down those inventories to a very, very tight level. We continue to monitor that and we clearly want on a going-forward basis to have demand before we have supply.","Richard L. Dickson - Mattel, Inc.","And as I mentioned as well, our POS is completely aligned. In fact, when we look at it, we're about 20% down in our inventory at this level and feeling really good about the stock levels and our performance. Is there anything you want to add?","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great, thank you.","Richard L. Dickson - Mattel, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Arpin\u00e9 Kocharyan of UBS. Your line is now open.","Arpin\u00e9 Kocharyan - UBS Securities LLC","The name is actually Arpin\u00e9. Can you hear me?","Joseph J. Euteneuer - Mattel, Inc.","Yes, we can. How are you doing, Arpin\u00e9?","Arpin\u00e9 Kocharyan - UBS Securities LLC","Hi. Good, Joe, how are you? Ynon, welcome aboard, and Margo, best wishes. So before I get into my retail picture question, I just had a quick clarification. When the release mentions excluding Toys \"R\" Us, it is referring to excluding revenue reversal, right? So then, could you quantify what percentage of shipments were to Toys \"R\" Us in Q1? So literally just taking Toys \"R\" Us business entirely out of the base in Q1 and then comparing that to Q1 last year. What would be the underlying business up in constant currency or down, I would presume in constant currency?","Joseph J. Euteneuer - Mattel, Inc.","I think those are sort of apples and oranges sort of positioning. We haven't really given those numbers. But remember that the delta probably what you're looking for is probably 2%, give or take.","Arpin\u00e9 Kocharyan - UBS Securities LLC","Down low-single digit?","Joseph J. Euteneuer - Mattel, Inc.","Yeah.","Arpin\u00e9 Kocharyan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. No, that's helpful. And then I appreciate the color on the retail on Barbie and Hot Wheels, seems like those are doing quite well. But could you give what retail sales were in the quarter for your entire portfolio adjusted for Easter? If you have U.S. and International that will be great, but if you can just share overall retail sales, sell-through for your entire portfolio in Q1, Easter adjusted?","Joseph J. Euteneuer - Mattel, Inc.","Yeah. We haven't disclosed that information, but we can take a look at that for you.","Richard L. Dickson - Mattel, Inc.","I understand. What you're trying to do, the Easter impact, and how big it was?","Arpin\u00e9 Kocharyan - UBS Securities LLC","Yes.","Richard L. Dickson - Mattel, Inc.","I think we have pretty good momentum. But I don't have that number for you.","Joseph J. Euteneuer - Mattel, Inc.","Yeah, Arpin\u00e9, Easter was about two weeks earlier this year, which provided maybe mid-single POS digit increases in the quarter. But it's really important to understand that Easter actually didn't drive the quarter. Barbie and Hot Wheels truly drove the quarter.","Arpin\u00e9 Kocharyan - UBS Securities LLC","Right, right. No, that's helpful. And then on Toys \"R\" Us, what are your other retail partners telling you for the back half? It's very difficult to forecast this business. There is zero visibility really how the consumer will act in the back half. But what are they telling you in terms of their plans to expand and take advantage of a major specialty retailer going out of business past June when this liquidation would likely be over? Do you have any color on that?","Richard L. Dickson - Mattel, Inc.","I'll start, Joe can add to it. I mean, I think we're probably all seeing the same thing as an industry. We're all having very productive and great conversations with retail partners, including of course Walmart, Target, Amazon and others around the world. Everybody is eager about the opportunity to grow their share, certainly based on the strong performance in POS that we have currently with our momentum brands like Barbie and Hot Wheels.","I also think it's also important to recognize that today consumers have the opportunity for commerce to take place anywhere. So it doesn't necessarily have to be destination oriented. As we look at our consumer base, we're looking at making sure that we are anywhere they are. They have the opportunity to buy on store, online, on mobile devices. And our franchises are so strong and we have the scale, so we're in a great strong position, despite the near-term headwind that toys represents to really seize the opportunity and engage in many opportunistic conversations with partners.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian with Citi. Your line is now open.","Gregory Robert Badishkanian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you. So first question is how realistic is your previous target of achieving flat top-line this year if you exclude the Toys \"R\" Us impact?","Richard L. Dickson - Mattel, Inc.","Yes, obviously, Toys \"R\" Us is a big impact to us. Just to size it for you, so if you want sort of the bookends. We did say at Toy Fair before we knew of the liquidation and stuff, that we thought we would be flat on a top-line basis and that was assuming they had just announced some store closures; say that was about 25%. And if you go back to our 10-K at the end of 2017, we said we were doing about 8% of revenue from Toys \"R\" Us which is about $400 million. So if you take $400 million, take 25% of that, it's $100 million, that would give you \u2013 roughly Toys \"R\" Us for us this year would have been about $300 million. So if you sort of take that bookend, we don't think it's going to be that bad because we've got Asia, we've got Canada we're shipping to, et cetera. So we know it's somewhere in between sort of being flat and maximum down to $300 million.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Ynon, a big picture question for you. I just was hoping you could tell us about your vision. I know that you're going to continue along the path that Margo set out but clearly, you must have your own ideas and own takes on the business, so I was hoping that you could help us understand that early stage.","Ynon Kreiz - Mattel, Inc.","Yeah, look, I'm very excited to be here. The big-picture opportunity is to transform Mattel to an IP-driven, high-performing toy company that is more efficient, more profitable and has a higher growth trajectory. We have very strong assets, including some of the world's best and greatest toy brands. We have a very good team and we have a strong strategy that I feel very good about. So our focus now is to deliver on our transformation plan and maximize value for the company and our shareholders.","This is not going to be easy. There's no denial that we faced significant challenges over the last few years and there are still headwinds in certain key areas of our business. But I feel confident about where we sit and what we have to do to take it on.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful, and we look forward to hearing more about that from you. Richard, I have a few just clarifications on Barbie to help me understand this. So I was wondering if you could help us, what would Barbie sales have been ex Toys \"R\" Us? And clearly Barbie is having a strong quarter and having momentum, but I was just wondering how much of the growth that we saw in the quarter is restocking versus the sharp declines that you recorded in the first quarter of 2017?","Richard L. Dickson - Mattel, Inc.","Sure. We're incredibly proud of the Barbie brand performance globally and across all accounts. We've had a terrific quarter. As an example of momentum, in connection to what has been as you know a lot of work focusing around our message and our product lines on the purpose of the brand. The You Can Be Anything campaign that you also saw at Toy Fair which highlighted careers and role models has been incredibly well received across the board at every retailer around the world, and we continue to get traction. So Toys \"R\" Us was an important obviously account for Barbie. But even without Toys \"R\" Us, Barbie continues to get great momentum.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And regarding the restocking \u2013 the growth versus restocking question?","Richard L. Dickson - Mattel, Inc.","No, there's no association with any impact that I could speak of that would affect it.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I guess what I'm really saying is that you have very easy comps versus last year. So how much is it that you just shipping into a market where the Barbie inventories were just lower?","Richard L. Dickson - Mattel, Inc.","No, it's all about our POS, and our POS has been literally double digits around the world. Our inventory was down approximately 20% and now our stocks are in line with our POS, and so we feel very strong about the quality of inventory that we have. The momentum on the top line is driving of course the shipments. And we feel we're completely in line with where the brand is headed, and our inventory models are in line as well.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay.","Richard L. Dickson - Mattel, Inc.","Shipping and POS has never been better in the context of the Barbie brand.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, that's great. And then, Joe, finally just a balance sheet question. I was just wondering how or when do you plan to refinance the 2019s. Do you still intend to tap the 2025s to do that given how they're now trading lower in the market?","Joseph J. Euteneuer - Mattel, Inc.","Look, we just finished the recapitalization with the $1 billion in the ABL. We've got 12 months out to do something. The markets are open to us. My belief is we had a great quarter here and working on the next one, so we have some runway room to come up with the answer to that question.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you.","Joseph J. Euteneuer - Mattel, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Ng of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Michael Ng - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi, thanks for the question. I have two for Richard. Richard, I was just wondering if you could comment a little bit about what drove the strong momentum in Wheels, which after I think about three quarters of decline showed a reversal this quarter.","And then second, as a follow-up to the comment that you made earlier that Fisher-Price was among the most indexed brands to Toys \"R\" Us, Babies \"R\" Us, could you just help quantify for us how much of Fisher-Price's revenue came from Toys \"R\" Us, and how we should be thinking about that as the rest of the year unfolds? Thank you.","Richard L. Dickson - Mattel, Inc.","Sure, Michael. So Hot Wheels also had a great quarter on top of what was a really solid year last year, which was as you know a big vehicle category-driven year. We've been working hard on emphasizing within the Hot Wheels brand moving from just diecast play into complete 360-degree play. Our Track business playsets have all seen double-digit increases, and it's really being driven by our YouTube content platform, which has been incredibly robust and well-received. So to some extent, all the hard work that we've been putting in Hot Wheels, building out the 360-degree system of play, and marketing in new and relevant ways on digital platforms where our consumers are, you're really seeing the results of that progress.","The momentum will continue as we start to have our robust programs celebrating our 50th Anniversary. There's going to be a series of events around the world that will continue to maintain that momentum, and I think we could expect some really great things coming from Hot Wheels as our quarters roll.","As it relates to Fisher-Price, we obviously had a bigger impact with Toys \"R\" Us at Fisher-Price. But as I mentioned, our other partners are incredibly excited about the opportunity that they have to make up that share. And in fact, as you know, Fisher-Price is a gateway brand with relationships with mom, prenatal, and families. So the opportunities that people see to capture that Fisher-Price volume is not only product related but relationship. So we're taking advantage of those conversations. They've been taking place for a while, as we've known about obviously the challenges with TRU, and we are going to continue maximizing opportunities around the world for that brand.","Michael Ng - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Susan Anderson of B. Riley. Your line is now open.","Luke Hatton - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","Hi, this is Luke Hatton on for Susan. I just wanted to ask, so you delivered another strong quarter of international growth. So I was just interested in hearing your thoughts on what is working there, and then how you're planning on maintaining that growth going forward.","Joseph J. Euteneuer - Mattel, Inc.","So I think a couple things. One is we have a new guy running Europe, who is just really starting to gain some momentum. We've reorganized the Asia-Pac region under Peter, who is just doing fantastic and bringing all those properties to bear. So I think really what you start seeing is with some of the people movement we had and the brands that are doing so well, we're just starting to gain some momentum back and move forward. Richard, what do you think?","Richard L. Dickson - Mattel, Inc.","I would just add to that. Our focus on consistent execution of our Power Brands around the world is paying off. A lot of time and energy has been spent reengineering the line architecture, driving new media and marketing for momentum. And as you know, we've been spending a lot of time developing those retail relationships. And I think you're just starting to see the beginnings of what is traction on those brands.","Luke Hatton - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","Okay, great. And then following up on Asia, I'm just interested on hearing about how that parent engagement and Babytree programs in China have been performing since I think you launched them in the fall. And then any details on whether you expect to roll this out to additional countries?","Richard L. Dickson - Mattel, Inc.","We're continuing to develop our partnerships with people like Alibaba, both in Babytree, and they're continuing to enable us to differentiate in the China market. These partnerships are growing and advancing. We will continue to update you as they have more updates to share, but we're really pleased with all of the progress that we're making. And we are on track with our performance and our expectations of where these partnerships will go as well as working on rollouts, in particular with some of these partnerships around Asia and around the rest of the world.","Luke Hatton - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","Thank you. Good luck next quarter.","Richard L. Dickson - Mattel, Inc.","Thank you.","Ynon Kreiz - Mattel, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jaime Katz of Morningstar. Your line is now open.","Jaime M. Katz - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. First, I'm curious about the brand or SKU rationalization process that you guys were going through in the Toy Box. I think at the end of last year, you had discussed paring back a number of brands that you no longer wanted to invest in, and I'm wondering whether that is completed, and how that has allowed you to change your capital allocation process behind improving the remaining Power Brands.","Richard L. Dickson - Mattel, Inc.","I think in regards to that, it's an ongoing process. But remember, a lot of the SKU reduction isn't really an elimination of the brand, but might be different things within the brand, but we've made great progress on it. It's something that each of the brands are very, very focused on and managing that tightly, and we continue to work on it. So it's something that has provided some benefit to-date and will provide added benefit in the future.","Jaime M. Katz - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","And then do you have any sense of what Jurassic World is set to add? I think historically it's been rumored to have added something like $100 million in movie years, so that would help sort of fill the gap or part of the gap from the Cars 3 movie last year. Any insight you have on that would be helpful.","Richard L. Dickson - Mattel, Inc.","We won't share the specificity on what the expectations are for that total, but I can tell you early reads are incredibly exciting. The merchandise that has hit has been flying off the shelves. Around the world, we have incredible excitement not only for the product itself but obviously for the movie that comes out in June, and it is strategically part of our Toy Box narrative that will ultimately make up some of the volume from Cars.","That being said, it's important to note Cars is performing really well. We're having a great partnership with Disney. We've been working very closely to continue that momentum. We believe it's an evergreen property, and so we've been really pleased with their performance. And we continue to work very closely with them to ensure that we have a good year in Cars.","And we're working \u2013 as Joe was talking about the Toy Box \u2013 amazing partners with the depth that we have and experience that we have on great innovative items, concentrating on innovation and creativity, not necessarily SKU count. We're trying to get the best product that we can out there in the marketplace.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Eric Handler of MKM Partners. Your line is now open.","Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC","Yes. Thanks for taking the question. Just wondered on your American Girl turnaround efforts, how important is it to have a retail bricks-and-mortar presence for that business? Is it worth continuing to expand the number of retail stores? Or you're better off maybe shuttering some of those stores, going to more of a digital-type model and focusing more on that platform?","Richard L. Dickson - Mattel, Inc.","Yeah. I'll start on this, and Joe can add. When you step back, we continue to take a lot of pride in the American Girl franchise, and it's not necessarily a silver bullet answer. We're overhauling the entire omni-channel experience, which includes evaluating bricks and mortar, ensuring also that we get the best product and price value equation right.","Customer relationships, whether they are online or in-store is paramount for us to get exceptionally better at. Data management, CRM is a really important part of the future. Proof of that brand, particularly as it started out as a direct brand, origins of that brand was as a catalog, delivering more effective direct marketing and loyalty programs to build attachment. All of these things are really important ingredients that make up what is American Girl. We take a lot of pride in that in-store experience and making sure that the relationships our consumers have when they get there is incredibly robust and exciting, but ultimately there is a lot of work to do on American Girl and, as we've mentioned, it's in all these different parts.","Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC","So then do you have a long-term view as far as what would it take to get American Girl revenue stopping to decline and maybe flatten?","Joseph J. Euteneuer - Mattel, Inc.","Yeah, I think the realities are we're kicking off this turnaround process now in these four key areas that we talked about. So the idea would be once we start getting into 2019 to start making that progress and start flattening things out and then ultimately get back to growth. We have a lot of repositioning to do, as Richard said, but there's no doubt that focusing on the direct, focusing on the experiential store experience are all key parts to making American Girl successful. I think any of us who are dads who maybe have gone through the experience at American Girl is memories we keep forever with our daughters. So we will get back to that.","Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And that does conclude our Q&A session today. I'd like to hand the call back over to Ms. Whitney Steininger for any closing regards.","Whitney Steininger - Mattel, Inc.","Thank you, operator.

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference Mr. Martin Gilkes, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir please begin.","Martin Gilkes","Thank you, Liz and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me today are Chris Sinclair, Mattel\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Richard Dickson, Mattel\u2019s President and Chief Operating Officer; and Kevin Farr, Mattel\u2019s Chief Financial Officer.","As you know, this afternoon we reported Mattel\u2019s third quarter 2015 financial results. We will begin today\u2019s call with Chris, Richard and Kevin providing commentary on our results and then we will take your questions. To help guide our discussion today, we have provided you with a slide presentation. Both our earnings release and slide presentation, include non-GAAP financial measures. The information required by Regulation G regarding non-GAAP financial measures is included in these materials and both documents are available in the Investors section of our corporate website, corporate.mattel.com.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that certain statements made during the call may include forward-looking statements relating to the future performance of our overall business, brands and product lines. These statements are based on currently available information and they are subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. We describe some of these uncertainties in the Risk Factors section of our 2014 annual report on Form 10-K, our 2015 quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other filings we make with the SEC from time-to-time, as well as in other public statements. Mattel does not update forward-looking statements and expressly disclaims any obligation to do so.","I would now like to turn the call over to Chris.","Chris Sinclair","Thank you, Martin and good afternoon, everyone. I would like to thank you for joining us today. In a few minutes Richard and Kevin will provide a lot more detail on the quarter and our outlook. I wanted to start things off today by giving you some perspective on how we're progressing broadly on our turnaround at Mattel. And then in that context, I'll review the quarter and the balance of the year.","So briefly with the quarter, now clearly the results were somewhat mixed and certainly we'd have liked to had a little bit more on the top line. But absent the major impacts of weakening foreign currencies the results are just about where we expected to be. As most of you know foreign exchange continue to be a huge headwind, as currencies in many of our key markets weakened even further and depressed our overall quarterly gross sales by close to 8%. It also had a significant impact on gross margin and on operating income.","But separating this out our progress was more balanced. We further were very encouraged by the progress we're making on our turnaround, our cultural transformation and our strategic priorities. Since my first call with you in January, we have been digging deep as I said we would. We've begun to make some significant progress in transforming and strengthening ourselves. And today I can quite confidently say that we are radically different and stronger company than we were just nine months ago.","We've continued to reshape our culture to emphasis creativity, innovation, speed and more personal accountability. And we have substantially transformed our leadership team to help lead this change. In fact since January, we've changed out over two-thirds of our key senior leaders. We've also attracted some extremely talented new executives to help lead us in important areas like human resources, core brands, content and brand and commercial finance. We're continuing to streamline further to reduce bureaucracy. We're also driving stronger performance management systems to build more accountability and to help us drive change.","We've also begun to execute strongly against our six key priorities, where our core brand positionings and platforms are much improved, our pricing and price value is much more competitive and we're regaining some very good content deals in the works including the recently announced Barbie movie with Sony. We've also continued to build our Toy Box initiative with a full cored effort underway on the licensing front, with all of our major studio and network partners. At the same time we have some other creative deals underway like the recently announced 9 Story venture for brands like Barney and Angelina.","We're continuing to drive the invention and innovation pipeline with ventures like our deals with Google and View-Master and with ToyTalk and Hello Barbie. Retail execution and focus has also improved significantly and we've begun to strengthen our top-to-top relationships across all of our major retail and e-commerce customers. We've also been building a much more robust holiday strategy and we've increased our ad and display support in most of our key accounts.","Similarly we've executed well on many of our major cost initiatives and we've begun to bend the curve on cost of goods and SG&A. We continue to see hitting at the high end of our cost reduction target of $250 million to $300 million by the end of next year. And we already getting a pretty sight line on moving well beyond that range.","Now this strong focus on costs has allowed us to step up investments and advertising and trade promotion, in retail expansion for American Girl and to accelerate our emerging markets business in key countries like China, a market that continues to perform extremely well. Frankly we should begin to see more follow through on these cost initiatives and re-investments over the balance of this year and into 2016.","So turning back more specifically to the quarter end of the full year, my takeaways are as follows. First, some real positives. We're building strength in our leadership team and improving our culture, equally importantly retail POS is growing across most of our core brands with notable strength in Fisher-Price and Hot Wheels and stability now with Barbie. We're also executing better with our customers and we're setting up for improvements in space and merchandizing. We're getting costs out at an accelerating rate and we're managing the middle of the P&L much better.","Finally we're getting some very good traction in core emerging markets like China and Russia. And all of this said we're clear eyed about the challenges we face. ForEx will certainly continue to be a headwind across many key markets. We're also moving aggressively to offset significant declines in important entertainment properties like Disney Princess and to reverse continued softness with Monster High. And we're acutely focused on addressing the challenges caused by space losses over the past 12 months and some of the recent customer shifts on inventory timing.","While our work is by no means done, I'm pleased with the way that our team is responding and I'm confident in our direction. As we look ahead we expect the fourth quarter to be another very competitive and aggressive one across all categories. But overall we do expect improvements; with the stabilizing of space and inventory impacts, stronger trade promotion and merchandizing support, continued core brand growth and improved flow through on our cost initiatives. That with some appropriate caution we continue to believe that the full year 2015 outlook that we provided after the first quarter is largely on track. Further as we continue to build momentum on our implementing our core strategic priorities, we remain committed to continuing our current dividend payoff, which the Board just reaffirmed.","So with that let me now turn it over to Richard, who'll give you a lot more specifics. Richard?","Richard Dickson","Thanks, Chris. As Chris just alluded to, there were three things that weighed down our third quarter financial results. A continuation of strong foreign exchange headwinds, declines in Monster High and softness in some license entertainment properties. Although we look at our business quarterly we also need to look beyond the financial headline to assess the business and when we do that, we see a lot of progress towards our turnaround and lot of reasons to believe in Mattel's long-term success.","Long-term success starts with having the right people in the right places. In this past quarter we were pleased to announce four exceptional new members to our leadership team. They join Mattel with clear mandates to strengthen and build four critical opportunity areas; core brands, content and digital, brand and commercial finance and culture. Each of these leaders is a recognized innovator and already on a job contributing to Mattel's transformation. Many of the signs of a turnaround at Mattel are just below the surface, so as I take you through some of the specifics of our Q3 results, I'll go a little deeper to give you the opportunity to see what I'm seeing, which is great progress to-date and a belief that our turnaround efforts are in line with our expectations.","Today with regard to performance, I'll focus on POS to show how our brand management and retail execution efforts are driving consumer demand and strengthening Mattel's retail customer base. Then I'll quickly pivot to talk about what our turnaround progress means for the upcoming holiday season and for 2016. Global POS arguably the leading indicator of our progress remains positive for the year although down slightly in Q3. Not surprising the decline in the quarter was mainly driven by Monster High and Disney Princess. But when we look at the numbers excluding Disney Princess, Global POS was actually up about 3% and in fact accelerated relative to the first half of this year. Most importantly POS continues to outpace shipping, which means with better alignment there is a real opportunity to increase sales going forward.","Almost all of our core brands have POS outpacing shipping as we enter the holiday season with a significant opportunity to better align Barbie and Fisher-Price shipping to POS trends. Core brands are the leading indicators of our success, so let me take a minute to provide a little bit more detail on the three brands that you're likely to be most interested in; Fisher-Price, Barbie and Monster High.","On Fisher-Price, we continue to see positive and improving POS this year despite some POS headwinds related to licensed properties within Fisher-Price brands and for the first time a very long time global Fisher-Price POS is up mid-single-digits year-to-date and up high single-digits in the third quarter. With Q3 POS significantly outpacing shipping, which was up only slightly in the quarter we have a great opportunity to close the gap and increase sales. In our baby business, which represents about half of our total Fisher-Price business, our efforts to connect and convert with innovative product and messaging are gaining traction. We are seeing real solid results as we build the brand into a relationship with Millennial parents, one that provides the guidance, gear and toys parents need to help their children get the best possible start in life.","There is great enthusiasm and a renewed focus on brand management at Fisher-Price that's showing in consumer programming and our Fisher-Price Best Possible Start Campaign is a great example of this. We still have work to do in our pre-school line and we\u2019ll have more positive news about our brands' license entertainment business soon. But as we moved out of the third quarter, we see a great opportunity to leverage our progress to-date and begin to close the gap between POS and shipping.","Moving on to Barbie; now earlier this year I mentioned that we expected 2015 to be the most competitive doll market in recent memory and we really saw that in Q3 as significant doll competitors hit the shelves with advertising to support the launches. So given that we\u2019re pleased to see Barbie POS continue to hold its own this quarter with global POS up slightly year-to-date and Q3 POS flat. We continue to see positive results in the U.S. where our brand new marketing messages and strategies got an earlier start and we are very happy to see improving POS trends internationally as we cleaned up older inventory and now move into the holiday season with a clean slate and the opportunity to really drive sales.","Relevance never rests and the Barbie brands' renewed commitment to connect to pop culture is really starting to show in POS trends and growing buzz for the brand, both with girls and moms. On the digital front, we saw significant increase in app use this past quarter and our YouTube video views nearly doubled. From our milestone globally diverse Fashionista line to the recent New York Times Magazine cover story featuring our innovative Hello Barbie Doll we are very pleased to see Barbie leading the cultural conversation again.","We are continuing to expand our efforts to spread the word about Barbie in that vein. Just last week we launched a ground breaking new advertising campaign titled imagine the possibilities that reinforces and goes to the heart of Barbie's message. Like Fisher-Price, Barbie brand shipping is lagging POS trends partly due to older inventory that was on the shelf in some international markets and a reduction in shelf space globally. But now with shelf space productivity up and currently clean inventory on shelf there is a great opportunity to close the POS to shipping gap and improve sales momentum going forward.","International shipping has already started to respond. In Q3 we saw sequential improvement and we see a great opportunity in North America where Barbie POS is significantly outpacing shipping with POS up high single-digits and shipping down 8%. From exciting new product to focused more relevant marketing and a renewed sense of purpose, Barbie's strategically returning to strength despite a very tough marketplace.","So on balance I see a lot of very positive momentum coming out of our two biggest brands; momentum that we haven\u2019t seen for a while. Moving brands like Barbie and Fisher-Price takes time, but I'm increasingly convinced about the work that we\u2019re doing and I am pleased to see that the strategies we put in place are working. These brands are getting stronger and the work we\u2019ve done this year will only continue to build into 2016.","Moving on let's take a look at our greatest challenging core brands Monster High. As you know the brand has struggled in its evolution from the global sensation it was at launch to an evergreen brand, yet it remains very relevant as a top five global doll property and arguably the Monster High message is more relevant than ever in today\u2019s pop culture.","In Q3, while we saw declines in the base business persist globally, we were encouraged to see that the additional new product lines introducing new scales and new form factors performed well. Growth continued to tune in. Website traffic remains robust and this quarter we saw app use increase along with YouTube video views. IP for this brand is incredibly powerful as the metrics show. So as we fix the toy side of the business, we are also thinking bigger by finding ways to monetize the brand as global IP. The brand\u2019s recent partnership with HIGH SCHOOL STORY the number one game for female teens in the U.S. is a great example. In this month Monster High will be the star of the game.","The brand\u2019s refreshed purpose driven message means it can command marquee partners and placements and we couldn\u2019t be more thrilled about our collaboration with Lady Gaga\u2019s Born This Way Foundation, a leading voice for inclusivity and tolerance worldwide. Lady Gaga is one of the most distinctive and famous music artists in the world today and she is fiercely dedicated to her foundation\u2019s mission, which dovetails nicely with Monster High\u2019s brand purpose. This is a partnership that will unite and mobilize both fan bases to multiply a shared message to original content, social media and eventually product. It\u2019s a perfect pairing.","To be sure the journey today for Monster High has been bumpy, but I can tell you I like where this brand is going with strong new work just starting to hit the market now and much more to come in 2016.","Despite my optimism, I am sure the question remains with Disney Princess and Monster High declining, what are the implications for Q4 and for 2016. Clearly, we have our work cut out for us, but there are several positive catalysts for Q4, including our continued revitalization of core brands, which gives us the opportunity to increase sales momentum by closing the current POS and shipping gap, particularly with Barbie and Fisher-Price as we have discussed.","We should see continued momentum from Hot Wheels and Thomas & Friends, which are performing well, both from a POS and shipping perspective. I am particularly excited about View-Master, since it\u2019s getting placement in different parts of the store, which will hopefully lead to expanding cross-generational appeal. MEGA Brands which is gaining some traction in international markets will have exciting new products timed to the release of Halo 5 - Guardians as well as the new Call of Duty - Black Ops videogame.","MEGA will have great holiday product for its expanded license properties, Minions and SpongeBob. We will see continued sales momentum with our new license entertainment properties Minecraft and Nickelodeon\u2019s Blaze and the Monster Machines. And we are building on momentum from our investments in emerging markets, particularly China, where sales are accelerating.","While there has been a lot of product news and activity this year and this quarter, traction is also due in part to substantially better execution at retail. Going forward, in addition to benefiting from some timing shifts, we will be supported by increased advertising and stronger trade promotion and merchandizing support. This year, we have made significant progress aligning our brands and commercial organization to execute at retail, including for holiday 2015, doubling our presence on many of the retailer top toy lists like Walmart and Toys\"R\"Us and we have a much bigger presence in many of their toy catalogs.","This year unlike last year, we will have meaningful [segments] in store during Black Friday and Cyber Monday events with a number of key products and you will see several ads of our product placements throughout the holiday period. These catalysts give us confidence that we could achieve the 2015 outlook we shared with you earlier this year and Kevin will walk you through more of the details on that in a moment.","Looking ahead to 2016, it\u2019s clear we will continue to have significant challenges with the loss of Disney Princess and the current trend of Monster High. We have been aggressively developing plans to offset the Disney Princess revenue gap and we have confidence in the new team managing Monster High. We\u2019re focusing our efforts to build core brand momentum and building on new partnerships. And as we are just beginning to share our 2016 plans with retailers, here is some insight.","We expect partnerships will make up a big chunk of the gap, including incremental in 2016. In partnership with Warner Bros., we will be supporting brand new entertainment properties from their DC Comic World. For starters, we are tapping into the rich DC Comic vault and focusing on the growing hyper-relevant DC\u2019s Super Hero Girl franchise with content launching this fall. In addition, Warner Bros., is kicking off a completely new multi-film multi-year theatrical franchise in 2016 with the release of Batman versus Superman - Dawn of Justice.","Also incremental to 2016, MEGA Brands will be launching a new innovative line of toys supporting the incredibly popular property Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and its 2016 theatrical release. We will also continue to build on our efforts to-date and improve the momentum on all of our core brands. We will look to Toy Box, Mattel\u2019s energetic hub of innovation and new technology to provide the scores of the incredible ideas and partnerships that are setting a new pace for the industry.","We will continue to invest and expand in emerging markets like China with all of our brands and of course we will continue to align our brand and commercial organizations and focus on supporting our retail partners around the world. Beyond these efforts, we continue to build a robust pipeline for the licensed entertainment component of our business and I look to sharing more news with you on this in the upcoming months. The net is this, while we are just entering the holiday season, which represents more than 50% of retail sales for the year and have recently begun to preview fall 2016 lines with customers we are increasingly confident that we should be able to cover a significant portion of the Disney Princess revenue gap as we build momentum throughout the year and into 2017.","The current year now three quarters in has not been without its challenges. But taken as a whole we believe we're meeting these head-on, making solid progress against our strategic priorities and positioning ourselves competitively for the future. As we enter this critical holiday period and look toward next year, Mattel is structurally a much stronger organization. We have focused ourselves wholeheartedly to the creativity, innovation and speed that made Mattel great. When I speak with partners, licensors, licensees, press and our own people there is unmistakable energy and enthusiasm for what we are doing and evidence that we are on the right path. Transformation is hard work and we're making great progress. So my continued thanks to the people of Mattel who I know are today more committed than ever to accelerating our turnaround.","I look forward to sharing much more with you in the coming months. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin.","Kevin Farr","Thank you, Richard and good afternoon, everyone. As Chris said, while our overall third quarter results are about where we expected them to be, our reported sales were slightly below our expectations for the quarter due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus our plan. Specifically in late August and early September, which negatively impacted sales by an incremental $50 million. The retailers bought our product later as they reduced their mix of direct import purchases, which likely shifted $30 million to $40 million of sales to the fourth quarter.","Looking beyond the top line, gross margin was also significantly impacted by currency but we did make progress with our cost saving initiatives, which are helping to fund investments in the turnaround and a key reason that we believe we can deliver gross margins about 50% for full year 2015 despite the currency headwinds. With foreign exchange having a significant impact on the quarter and year-to-date, I'll provide some additional color on the currency dynamics before moving into the brand and P&L discussion.","In aggregate, currency reduced reported net revenues by $150 million in the quarter and almost $300 million year-to-date. As many of you know, we have market leading positions in Mexico and Brazil where the peso and real depreciated about 20% and around 40% year-over-year in the quarter. These markets represent two of our largest countries outside the U.S. and currency volatility had a meaningfully negative impact on our reported results. We also saw the Russian ruble weaken by around 40% year-over-year in the third quarter. We expect revenues will continue to be negatively impacted by foreign exchange, but we believe the impact in the fourth quarter will be less pronounced since U.S. dollar began to strengthen in the fourth quarter of 2014.","Adjusted gross margin was another key P&L driver that was significantly impacted by currency, accounting for 200 basis points of the year-over-year decline. As we noted on our last earnings call, the transaction impact on gross margin is more pronounced in the second half due to seasonality coupled with the timing of inventory movements and hedging at less favorable rates in 2015 versus 2014. We expect this strength to continue in the fourth quarter but similar to the sales line it should be less of a headwind than in the fourth -- third quarter.","As we move into detailed sales and P&L discussion, I want to remind everyone that we'll discussing our results in constant currency and referring to adjusted financial measures that exclude certain items related to our acquisition of MEGA as well as severance expense unless otherwise noted to provide better visibility into the underlying business performance as we execute the turnaround.","In constant currency worldwide gross sales for the quarter were down 3%, down 11% as reported. Year-to-date worldwide gross sales were flat in constant currency, were down 8% as reported. From a brand perspective worldwide sales from Mattel girls and boys brands were down 5% in the quarter and down 3% year-to-date. Monster High shipping continues to be our biggest headwind in the quarter and year-to-date, followed by softer shipping of licensed entertainment properties. This was partially offset by continued strength in Hot Wheels and our Minecraft license and Barbie sales were down 4% in the quarter moving from down 8% year-to-date.","Notably Barbie international shipments improved to down 2% year-over-year in constant currency after declining 9% in the first half. As you know about two-thirds of Barbie sales are from international markets, so this is an important element at getting the brand on a improving trend globally. Worldwide sales for Fisher-Price brands were up 1% in the quarter and up 3% year-to-date with good strength in our baby company business which accounts for about half of the total as well as Thomas and Imaginext, which were offset to a large degree by declines in the number of Fisher-Price brands license properties.","American Girl was down 2% in the quarter and down 1% year-to-date. Our [Be Forever] historical line continues to be the bright spot with its recent brand relaunch and strong new character introductions, which were offset by Truly Me and Girl of the Year. And we\u2019re very encouraged by the performance of our shop-in-shops in Canada and Mexico, which continue to meet expectation. MEGA shipping was up 2% in the quarter despite declines in RC Craft business where we\u2019re deemphasizing non-strategic lower margin product lines. Importantly the performance of the construction business continues to be in line with their expectations. We\u2019re particularly pleased with this growth internationally, which was up 40% in the quarter at constant currency. International expansion was a big focus for this acquisition and these trends reinforce the potential.","Looking at regional sales, we had mixed results on the surface but I will highlight a few key themes. Asia Pacific was very strong in the quarter and year-to-date led by China where our investments are paying off with accelerated sales. We also continue to see strong growth in Russia another market where we\u2019ve been investing, but this has been offset by softness in Western Europe. And Mexico is posting solid growth but our overall sales in Latin America are being impacted by a slowing economy in Brazil. Furthermore, while there are nuances by market, brands like Hot Wheels, Fisher-Price core and Thomas are doing well around the world.","Finally we\u2019ve worked hard in the quarter to successfully clean up remaining retail inventory overhang in international markets, particularly Europe and we\u2019re entering the holiday season relatively clean around the world, which has enabled us to effectively activate all the great retail promotional programs you heard about earlier.","Before discussing the rest of the P&L, I want to briefly reiterate Richard\u2019s commentary on POS versus shipping trends. Excluding Disney Princess, global POS was up low single-digits in the quarter compared to declines in gross sales in constant currency which presents an opportunity to improve shipping through better alignment. We believe the combination of cleaner inventories, incremental in-aisle displays to mitigate shelf space losses and better shelf productivity should narrow us -- should help us narrow this gap, especially for key brands like Barbie and Fisher-Price. As always global Fisher-Price should be considered directional and reflects our internal figures which are based on wholesale sales and reflect more comprehensive coverage of our diverse product offerings and extensive global reach.","Looking beyond the top line through our other key P&L drivers, our adjusted gross income -- gross margin remains solid at 49.1% in the quarter but down 170 basis points versus 50.8% in 2014, primarily due to the negative impact of foreign exchange, which was about 200 basis points. As I said we believe the impact to gross margin from ForEx should be less in the fourth quarter. As it relates to other key drivers of gross margin in the quarter and year-to-date, our cost saving initiatives and our price increases more than offset changes in product related costs, higher royalties and mix. And finally our overall basket of product related costs were roughly consistent with our forecast assumptions for the year as we exited peak production.","As planned our advertising rate remained higher including additional spending in emerging markets. SG&A was down versus the prior year in absolute dollars on both the reported and adjusted basis. We continue to aggressively reduce overhead costs coupled with synergies from our MEGA Brands acquisition and balance through strategic investments and growth. As it relates to our funding our future programs, we delivered $45 million in overall gross savings in the quarter and $93 million year-to-date, putting us ahead of our run rate for 2015. As a result we will exceed our 2015 objectives of $125 million in-route to delivering at the high end of the $250 million to $300 million range for the program by the end of 2016.","For 2015, we now expect to deliver gross cost savings of $140 million to $145 million. We expect half of the 2015 gross savings will impact gross margin and the balance will reduce SG&A and advertising. In the quarter, our adjusted operating profit was $322 million versus $435 million in the prior year and currency was $80 million headwind in the quarter. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.71 and $0.63 per share year-to-date compared to $0.98 and the $1.06 respectively in 2014. Currency had a negative impact of $0.20 per share in the quarter and $0.23 per share year-to-date, explaining the majority of the year-over-year decline in the quarter and more than half of the decline year-to-date.","Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, consistent with our expectations we ended the quarter with about $290 million of cash in our balance sheet as we continued to invest in our business and tightly manage our seasonal working capital needs over the first nine months. Our third quarter results also reflect our ongoing commitment to disciplined capital deployment. As we said, dividends remain our first priority after reinvesting in the business and the Board declared a fourth quarter dividend of $0.38 per share, which is flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2014.","Overall we remain confident in our progress to-date as does the Board and we have sufficient flexibility within our capital deployment framework to execute the turnaround in 2016. We\u2019re also committed to growing back into a reasonable dividend payout ratio and yield with our turnaround efforts.","Clarifying our 2015 outlook, based on our year-to-date financial results, we continue to believe the 2015 outlook that we provided in the first quarter investor call remains achievable, including stabilizing net sales for the full-year versus 2014 on a constant currency basis. Based on year-to-date trends and assuming current spot rates for the fourth quarter, foreign exchange is now expected to be a 5% to 7% headwind to revenues for the full year versus our previous estimate of 4% to 6% impact. The negative impact to adjusted EPS is expected to be 32% to 37% versus $0.30 to $0.35 previously communicated. Based on current spot rates, we expect ForEx translation headwinds to be about 6% for the fourth quarter, which is slightly less than the negative year-to-date impact.","We also believe that fourth quarter revenues will be higher than the third-quarter this holiday season. As Richard already said, as part of our turnaround efforts, we\u2019ve worked hard to improve our retail execution this holiday season and while the last two holiday seasons do not reflect this, we historically ship more in the fourth quarter than the third quarter.","With respect to other P&L metrics, we continue to target gross margins of about 50% for the year, and we expect stronger gross margins in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter. Advertising at the high end is 11% to 13% range and adjusted SG&A for full year 2015 that will be [dealt] in absolute dollars compared to 2014 by $80 million to $95 million.","In closing, we recognize that risks remain and we will continue to monitor the currency markets and macroeconomic outlook closely. But as you heard from both Chris and Richard, we see several clear catalysts that deliver solid performance in the fourth quarter. There is always puts and takes in the early stages of turnaround. But overall, we\u2019re pleased with our progress today. In particular, we\u2019ve been encouraged by our ability to improve POS for core brands through product and marketing and retail execution with increased shelf space productivity, which gives us greater confidence about the levers under our control as we prepare to execute in the holiday season and beyond.","With that, we\u2019ll now open the call for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line Sean McGowan with Oppenheimer & Company. Your line is now open.","Sean McGowan","Thank you. Lot of information there, it\u2019s all very helpful and we appreciate the color. I wanted to start with a question on how you guys describe when -- as you guys described closing the gap between POS and shipments, I assume at some point closing the gap means positive shipments, otherwise that would be a weird relationship. So do you think there is a possibility that at least Barbie and Fisher-Price could actually see increased shipments in local currencies in the fourth quarter?","Chris Sinclair","Sean it's Chris. Let me take a stab at that. Actually we are looking at the fourth quarter as probably when the inflection point starts to happen. Cleary, we've been chasing a loss space which has been part of the gap creator and I think that was in Kevin\u2019s remarks. Some of it was just direct import inventory shift that also affected the quarter. As we start to move through the fourth quarter, we think both will start to mitigate. So I don\u2019t know if it will be completely in balance at that point but certainly we\u2019d expect us start to close the gap.","Sean McGowan","On that direct import shift, do you have a high degree of confidence that that business will be recaptured in the fourth quarter that it\u2019s simply a question of timing?","Chris Sinclair","Yes, we do. Look, we go through this on a constant regular basis and keep testing it. So far barring anything unforeseen happening on opened orders or whatever, we think we\u2019ve got a pretty good sight line on the fourth quarter and it does look like we would be offsetting most of that.","Sean McGowan","And my other question and I know you never like to comment on particular customers. But Walmart did sort of spook the world recently with their comments on expectations. What do think that says about the pricing environment that you\u2019re facing this holiday season? And is it more a case of them losing business to other retailers, where Mattel could be picking up some of that business that Walmart appears be concerned about losing? Thank you.","Chris Sinclair","Look, Walmart\u2019s been an excellent performer for us this year and a very strong customer, Sean. So, we\u2019re benefiting from their efforts to get more aggressive and particularly in some of our sectors and we expect that to continue in the fourth quarter. I think what they\u2019re trying to do in-store makes sense and obviously we\u2019re hoping to partner with them in doing it. So we\u2019re quite optimistic on what Walmart is doing at this point, at least from our business standpoint.","Sean McGowan","And then the last housekeeping question I have is when you say Disney Princess are you including Frozen in that because I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ve officially made that move yet?","Chris Sinclair","Yes we are.","Sean McGowan","Okay just wanted to clarify that. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steph Wissink with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","Stephanie Wissink","Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. I want to follow-up on Sean's question regarding closing the gap between POS and shipments. I think Richard you talked a little bit about the space losses and rising competition. But can you give any more detail on your ability to fully close that gap if you are facing some intense competition for that space? And then secondly just related to the A&P spend it does remain elevated versus historic levels. How have your discussions been going around 2015 with your retail partners and what's the expectation to maintain that level of support? Thank you.","Richard Dickson","Yes. So it's Richard. Stephanie we are pretty confident that obviously with the continued results of POS that shipping inevitably will follow and just speaking in the context of clean inventories and good POS we're looking pretty good at this point to close that gap. Statically speaking we will obviously deliver those results at the end of the year but there is a lot of confidence that those numbers will come our way. We are increasing our advertising in the fourth quarter. There is a variety of different promotional efforts along with new allocations in media, some increases in digital as well as some reallocations in terms of traditional TV advertising. Overall I think we are confident in the context of our percentage that we're spending in advertising and we continue to invest significantly more in our core brands and key license partners.","Chris Sinclair","I will touch on next year, I think she also asked that. I think your question was also Steph if I heard you right, do expect us to continue next year in terms of heavy spending was that fair?","Stephanie Wissink","Yes. What is expected of you by some of your partners in terms of that elevated spending?","Chris Sinclair","Yes. Look I think we've been pretty clear that we're continuing to stay price competitive. So you probably expect to see us promoting like we have done and our advertising rates I think we've flagged would be also in the same vicinity of where we are this year.","Richard Dickson","Yes. I think as we plan to '16 we want to make sure that we're focused in on generating top line revenues and get the momentum continue in POS and aligning shipping. So at this point subject to review after the holidays we're planning on keeping those elevated levels in 2016.","Stephanie Wissink","Thanks. That's very helpful.","Chris Sinclair","Steph, the last point I would make on your question on space. Remember that as we did the fall research that was another punch through on space loss for us. So when you are talking about inventory and shipping adjusting we should be stable on space now going through the fourth quarter and beyond. So logically it will start to come back in balance.","Richard Dickson","Yes. I think one of the things that's going to help us to close that gap in POS versus shipping is also the space that we do have is more productive and that should drive more sales.","Stephanie Wissink","Thanks guys. Kevin just one follow-up with respect to the loss of Disney and the replacement of that business potentially in part with the DC business, is there any comparability we should think about in terms of the margin structure of the incoming and the outgoing business? Thank you guys.","Kevin Farr","Yes. I think with regard to that, look the Disney Princess business is a great business both from the top line and bottom line perspective and as we look forward to 2016 we think we've closed as Richard said a significant amount of that gap. I think so that's from a revenue side. I think from a margin side we are confident as we continue to work on the cost side that we can deliver strong margins of 50%. And look we've got a tailwind with respect to our cost savings initiatives in that we're going to be at the high end of the range of $250 million to $300 million and as Chris said earlier we also have a sight line beyond that, that\u2019s well beyond that range. So I think all that together should help us offset Disney Princess from an profit perspective too.","Stephanie Wissink","Thanks guys. Appreciate that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Lee Giordano with Sterne Agee CRT. Your line is now open.","Lee Giordano","My question is on emerging markets, just wondering your thoughts about the recent volatility we have seen in China and Russia, it sounds like you are doing pretty well overseas these days. Any changes to your plans? It sounds like you are doing well but just wondering long-term, how you view those markets considering what we've seen lately? Thank you.","Chris Sinclair","Actually Lee, frankly we just got back from China a couple of weeks ago and had a pretty good review on that business and I'll tell you while we are seeing a little bit of impact at retail from some of those latest turmoil. We've got so many good things going there in terms of driving the brands, driving e-commerce, driving new distribution that we haven\u2019t seen a beat missed in that market and continue to be very optimistic with the plans. Russia we went through a little bit of a wobble, like everybody else did, when things cratered earlier in the year and we thought we're going to see a fairly big pullback. If anything that\u2019s actually showing a lot of strength recently. And so we're kind of in a more forward lean posture if you will. But we think the emerging market businesses for us are a huge upside in the coming months.","Lee Giordano","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian with Citi. Your line is now open.","Greg Badishkanian","Great thanks. So just if you think about losing Disney Princess in 2016, you core growth of your brands, what\u2019s going to be the biggest driver do you think to bridge the gap?","Richard Dickson","Like I mentioned, we have a lot of great new volume and incremental volume coming from new partners. The Warner Bros. piece of our business is going to be significant. Obviously as I mentioned, we\u2019re looking forward to the new girls launch, rich IP value, great trend product and a great activation program including content, which will be pretty robust. In addition to that as I mentioned, it is a multi-year multi-theatrical line up with Warner Bros. that we are partnered with them on. In addition to that as well, with the current trajectory of our core brand revitalization as you can see of interest, Barbie and Fisher-Price being the two largest, starting to deliver a POS growth ultimately with the strength that we\u2019re building on 2016 should be another good strong POS year. With the adjustments in cleaner inventory and adjusted space we should start to see some real give back in the context of filling that gap. We\u2019re also really excited about some of the initiatives from the Toy Box, which there is some great new items that we\u2019re obviously launching this fall with View-Master for one, but there is a series of line-ups that are going to be announced subsequently later on for Toy Fair we will show and share with you. But some really powerful new properties and some great new products lined up for 2016. So all-in-all I would say, core brand continued growth, Hot Wheels as you could see, I mentioned it time-to-time again that is to some extent the sleeper in the portfolio delivering great POS and also MEGA a great platform for us in the construction category and of course Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles which is the theatrical release will commensurate there and that will be great new volume for us.","Greg Badishkanian","Great. Makes a lot of sense. And then just in terms of Star Wars and in your Hot Wheels business, a little bit of color there and then just if you could remind us how much Star Wars business did you have during the last movie?","Richard Dickson","So you know the Star Wars movie -- we are first of all really excited to have a piece of the Star Wars business and in particular I think what it does is it proves the extension possibilities that we have with Hot Wheels. To imagine a Star Wars vehicle integrating Star Wars into vehicle play was pretty extraordinary and the results of which we\u2019re really pleased with and encourages us to extend further partnerships using Hot Wheels as the leverage to do so. Star Wars is going to be a great business for us this year and we anticipate subsequent years to follow and we\u2019ll share more with the results at the end of the year. ","Greg Badishkanian","Good. All right. Thank you very much.","Chris Sinclair","Thanks, Greg.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Taposh Bari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Taposh Bari","Hey guys good afternoon. A couple of questions on net sales and constant currency. So you\u2019ve given us a bunch of pieces, but can you tell us if that line should grow or decline in the fourth quarter?","Richard Dickson","I think what we said versus the third quarter we expect the fourth quarter to be bigger.","Chris Sinclair","So yes it will grow in the fourth quarter.","Taposh Bari","How about year-over-year versus the fourth quarter of last year?","Chris Sinclair","Well we\u2019re sitting here deciding how much we can give you color on this, Taposh. But I'd say would say pretty close is probably we\u2019re going to answer.","Taposh Bari","Okay. And then as we think about next year you\u2019ve given us a bunch of different pieces and clearly a lot of licenses and opportunities in the works. Is there any possibility that again constant currency net sales can increase next year or is that pretty unlikely in light of the hole that you face and the challenges that you're facing with Monster High?","Chris Sinclair","I am not sure we want to get into quite that level of detail today to be honest with you, but I think what we\u2019re trying to signal is we\u2019re working pretty hard at closing that gap and trying to keep stability at the top line and I think that\u2019s probably where we\u2019ve been.","Taposh Bari","And last one is just on input costs. Kevin it seems like you called out input costs as a headwind to gross margins year-to-date but clearly the outlook shows a different trajectory. So can you remind us I guess first how much of your COGS are comprised by resin and how we should think about kind of the magnitude of input costs released going forward?","Kevin Farr","Yes. Well raw material costs with regard to resin are about 15% and the headwinds traditionally over the last few years have really been in direct labor, which has been growing at a double-digit rate. But again as we have talked about we\u2019re trying to bend the cost curve here and as we look at a line of sight beyond our current range we\u2019re really trying to bend that -- continue to bend that cost curve in 2016.","Taposh Bari","And Richard can I ask one more for you on DC Super Hero Girls, I guess it's a new type of toy, it\u2019s not a doll, it's on an action figure. Where do you expect it to be sold in the toy aisle and what do you think it replaces?","Richard Dickson","Well, we positioned it as actually action figures for girls and arguably one can debate whether action figures are dolls and dolls are action figures. But ultimately there is some features, articulation, scale that basically position positioning as well that we\u2019re driving to capture girls\u2019 attentions in the action figure aisle. We have great amount of research and insight that suggests that there are girls actually shopping in the action figure aisle. We hope that retailers acknowledge and put the brand and double expose the brand in a variety of different places. That would be obviously determined by retailers. But everybody collectively is pretty excited about the category and certainly that we are providing in fact a play pattern for girls that\u2019s been missing with obviously iconic products really driven by girls themselves, the insights and design application has been really head in head with girl insight.","Taposh Bari","Great, thank you. Best of luck this holiday.","Chris Sinclair","Operator, I believe we have time for one last question.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Linda Bolton-Weiser with B. Riley. Your line is now open.","Linda Bolton-Weiser","Just on Monster High, I know you\u2019ve talked about it a lot. But can you just kind of explain once again why it is taking so long to kind of get a turnaround strategy for that line? I mean you\u2019ve really made great progress on the lot of the other brands and this one just seems to be so problematic. Is it a matter of prioritizing versus the other brands or what? And then can you just remind us is Monster High similar in margin profitability to Barbie? Thanks.","Richard Dickson","Sure, Linda. I mean look Monster High was a lightning rod, an unbelievable brand that frankly proved Mattel\u2019s savviness in the context of marketing and content and digital. The reality of how the brand has progressed is, it\u2019s going through a maturity curve that we likely frankly accelerated by moving too quickly away from the core messaging, not necessarily investing enough in product innovation and frankly exploited the characters a little too far without enough content to describe who these characters were. Frankly the insights and research and certainly the response that we get from our consumers and their relationship with the brand and the stories continues to suggest that we have something pretty powerful. And we believe with the right management and investment we\u2019re going to find the sustainable foundation and then start to build upon it.","I think some of the work that the team has done is pretty outstanding in the context of it, the speed at which we brought new products, new scales to market. We\u2019ve been doing some tests that we\u2019ve gotten some great reactions on. We\u2019ve re-established our creative messaging. I think for 2016 you will see a whole variety of changes from product to packaging to content. And I think examples like this partnership we\u2019re announcing with Lady Gaga is pretty remarkable and I think that it validates the longevity of what Monster High could be. Clearly we\u2019d like the turnaround to be faster but as I mentioned I am really excited about some of the work that\u2019s going to be coming out for '16 and we anticipate the brand will stabilize and then ultimately we\u2019ll grow upon that stability.","Kevin Farr","And your second question on the profitability, the profitability is very similar to Barbie, it is a very profitable brand.","Linda Bolton-Weiser","Great, thanks a lot.","Chris Sinclair","Thanks, Linda.","Martin Gilkes","There will be a replay of this call available beginning at 8 PM Eastern Time today. The number to call for the replay is 404-537-3406 and the pass code is 39720076.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference may be recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Ms. Whitney Steininger with Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.","Whitney Steininger - Mattel, Inc.","Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me today are Ynon Kreiz, Mattel's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Richard Dickson, Mattel's President and Chief Operating Officer; and Joe Euteneuer, Mattel's Chief Financial Officer.","As you know, this afternoon, we reported Mattel's 2018 third quarter financial results. We will begin today's call with Ynon and Joe providing commentary on our results and then we will provide time for Ynon, Richard and Joe to take your questions.","To help guide our discussion today, we have provided you with a slide presentation. Our discussion and our slide presentation will reference non-GAAP financial measures, such as gross sales, adjusted gross profit, and adjusted gross margin, adjusted other selling and administrative expenses, adjusted operating income or loss, adjusted earnings or loss per share, earnings before interest, depreciation and amortization or EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, and constant currency.","Our earnings release also includes non-GAAP financial measures. The information required by Regulation G regarding non-GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release and slide presentation and both documents are available in the Investors section of our corporate website, corporate.mattel.com.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that certain statements made during the call may include forward-looking statements relating to the future performance of our business, brands and product lines. These statements are based on currently available information and they are subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.","We describe some of these uncertainties in the Risk Factors section of our 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K, our 2018 Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, our earnings release and the presentation accompanying this call, in other filings we make with the SEC from time to time, as well as in our other public statements. Mattel does not update forward-looking statements and expressly disclaims any obligation to do so, except as required by law.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Ynon.","Ynon Kreiz - Mattel, Inc.","Thank you, everyone, for joining our third quarter earnings call. I'm happy to say we are on track with the execution of our strategy and have made meaningful progress towards restoring profitability as we transform Mattel into an IP-driven, high-performing toy company.","During the third quarter, gross sales were down 6% as reported and 4% in constant currency, primarily due to a negative 3% impact from Toys \"R\" Us and a negative 3% impact from the slowdown in our China business.","At the same time, gross sales in North America were up 6%, which is the highest sales growth we've had in this key market for 11 quarters. Importantly, we have achieved profitability in the quarter as a result of savings realized from our Structural Simplification program, as well as a net benefit related to Toys \"R\" Us bankruptcy accounting. As a result, reported operating income was up 41% versus the same period last year, which is the first time in eight quarters that we have posted year-over-year growth in operating income.","These results were achieved in spite of increased inflation in the cost of raw materials and plant labor. We are proud to say that we recaptured the position of the number one global toy company in each of the last four months through September, according to NPD. We're also the number one toy company in the U.S. and Latin America year-to-date through September.","We continued to make tangible progress in reshaping our organization. We are on track to achieve or exceed our $650-million savings target for Structural Simplification. In addition, we're actively exploring strategic alternatives for our manufacturing footprint as we move towards a capital-light model, which could lead to additional efficiencies over time.","We also have taken meaningful steps to drive future growth. This includes the creation of a new theatrical film division and a global franchise management organization to capitalize on our iconic brands and IP. We saw particular strength in Barbie, Jurassic World and Games and are positioned well going into the holiday season.","In terms of performance by brand, in the third quarter, Barbie continued its strong momentum with growth across all regions. Barbie gross sales were up 17% in constant currency. This makes the fourth consecutive quarter of strong year-over-year sales growth for the brand. POS continue to be strong and was up high-single digits.","Barbie sales in North America and International were up 22% and 11% respectively, in constant currency. Reinforcing these strong results, Barbie was the number one global fashion doll property year-to-date through September according to NPD. We expect to see continued momentum for Barbie in the fourth quarter and look forward to her 60th Anniversary in 2019.","Hot Wheels POS continues to be up double digits and accelerated in the third quarter across all regions. However, gross sales were down 3% in constant currency versus 2017, which was the year that included sales in advance of the theatrical release of Star Wars, The Last Jedi and the Toys \"R\" Us exclusive product offering. While these factors will also impact the fourth quarter comparison, we expect them to be more than offset by growth in holiday sales of basic vehicles and track sets.","According to NPD, Hot Wheels continues to be the number one property globally year-to-date in the vehicles super category through September and we expect the brand to deliver strong growth in the fourth quarter and full year. Looking towards 2019, we are excited about the product pipeline, which includes breakthrough innovation, which will be announced next year.","Fisher-Price and Thomas & Friends gross sales were down 10% in constant currency, which included a 4% impact from Toys \"R\" Us. POS in the quarter was down similarly due to the challenges in our China business, which we expect to continue into the fourth quarter but was partially offset by positive POS results in Latin America.","Looking ahead for Fisher-Price, we have already received very positive feedback from customers on our new 2019 product line, which was developed under the brand leadership brought on-board earlier this year. Thomas & Friends new TV series was launched on Nick Jr. in the U.S. in September, airing daily and available on demand. The new content also launched in the UK and has been well received with viewership growth of 44% over the previous period. This should provide momentum for the brand as we enter the fourth quarter and beyond.","As expected, American Girl gross sales continued to decline, down 31% in constant currency. Despite the decline, increasing Net Promoter Scores indicate the brand health remains strong with its existing consumer base. We will be executing retail activations and live events in the fourth quarter with a 40-city theatrical touring program to help promote new consumer acquisition. As I discussed last quarter, this brand is in a multiyear turnaround and we expect to dedicate 2019 to making the fixes necessary to deliver improved performance thereafter.","Toy Box Owned Brands gross sales were up 2% in constant currency in the quarter. We have seen promising success from the Polly Pocket launch in the U.S. and Europe. Momentum from Polly and other brands have returned sales in our total girls' portfolio to positive growth for the first time in five years.","Games also performed well in the quarter with gross sales up 20% year-over-year in constant currency, benefiting from the continued success of the UNO brand, including ongoing momentum for DOS. Year-to-date, through September, UNO is the number one selling game in the Games and Puzzles supercategory in the U.S., according to NPD.","Turning to Toy Box Partner Brands, gross sales were down 15% in constant currency when compared to 2017, which benefited from the theatrical release of Cars 3, partially offset by the initial sales of Jurassic World in 2018.","Our success with Jurassic World has been largely driven by the creation of a toy line with action figures that are in scale with other categories, such as vehicles and drones, for a more immersive play experience. Universal recently stated that our collaboration with Jurassic was, and I quote, one of the most compelling toy lines ever developed, driving toy sales results for the brand to new heights.","Looking ahead, we are excited for the release of Toy Story 4 in 2019, which will serve as one of our biggest tentpole properties next year. We are working hard to position Mattel as the partner of choice for all of our partners by delivering innovative product and strong global execution.","We also made good progress when it comes to our local execution in the various regions around the world. We are the number one toy company in the U.S. and Latin America year-to-date through September, according to NPD. Having maintained our strong position there, we are now turning our focus to improving our performance in Europe and Global Emerging Markets, including China in particular.","Looking at the regions in more detail, North America gross sales were up 6%, driven primarily by strong Barbie and Jurassic World sales, even with the negative impact from Toys \"R\" Us. This is the highest growth we have had in this key market since the fourth quarter of 2015.","Given the magnitude of the Toys \"R\" Us disruption expected in the fourth quarter this year, gross sales are likely to decline. Yet, we are very proud of the progress we are making in the largest and most competitive toy market in the world.","International gross sales were down 11% in constant currency, including the 6% negative impact from China, which accounted for essentially all of the decline in Global Emerging Markets.","As I mentioned last quarter, we are seeing a slowdown in our China business and expect this to persist for the remainder of 2018. Our team on the ground is managing through inventory at retail amidst a softening market and we are taking action to mitigate the decline. We are reassessing our approach and continue to aim for long-term growth in the Chinese market.","Europe represents our next big opportunity geographically to improve performance, given the size of the market and the strength of our brands. Europe was down 10% in constant currency, mainly due to Cars 3 comparison and declines in Fisher-Price and Thomas. We are currently implementing a growth plan to improve our positioning, while enhancing productivity and efficiency. This includes building out our e-commerce capabilities and expanding our presence with value retailers.","To accelerate our strategy in Europe, we have appointed our Board Member, Soren Laursen as Executive Director. Many of you may be familiar with Soren's background as a long-standing senior executive at LEGO and most recently the CEO of TOP-TOY, the largest retailer of toys and children's products in the Nordic region. We believe Soren will add significant value to Mattel in this expanded role.","We have continued to do well in Latin America, with gross sales up 1% in constant currency in spite of the 2% impact from the Cars 3 comparison in 2017. Gross sales as reported were down 8% due to the significant foreign exchange impact in Brazil. We have a strong leadership team driving our strategy in Latin America, which positions us well for continued success.","I will now provide an overview of the primary elements of our strategy. We see two sets of opportunities. In the short to mid-term, our priorities are to fix the core business by continuing to reshape operations, grow Power Brands and expand our brand portfolio. In the mid to long-term, we are looking to capture the full value of our IP through franchise management and develop our online retail and e-commerce capabilities.","As part of reshaping operations, our first and foremost priority is to deliver on our Structural Simplification target of $650 million of run-rate savings exiting 2019. We are on track to achieve or exceed the savings target.","We are seeing good momentum in product and marketing innovation and we are increasing focus on efficiency and performance, as well as the quality and consistency of our execution. We are also proceeding with the reassessment of our manufacturing footprint and supply chain as we discussed last quarter. We are considering strategic alternatives for our manufacturing footprint and expect to advance towards a capital-light model during 2019.","The second phase of our strategy is driven by Mattel's ownership of one of the strongest catalogs of kids and family entertainment franchises in the world. Our vast and diverse portfolio of hundreds of intellectual properties reaches beyond any one category or genre. Yet, we have commercialized only a small portion of it. With that in mind, we plan to capture the full value of our IP in highly-accretive business verticals, including film and television, digital gaming, live events, music and consumer products.","These have been historically under-leveraged, and we believe there is transformative value to be created if executed well. To achieve this, we have brought on board world-class leadership capabilities to execute and set us up for success.","We are excited about the potential to unlock the value of our IP on the big screen. We have recently announced the creation of Mattel Films and the appointment of Robbie Brenner as Executive Producer to lead this new opportunity. We are constructing a capital-light business model with plans to collaborate with other partners in the industry and we do not anticipate taking on financial risk.","We have already received significant interest in our film division from some of the world's leading distributors, film makers, producers and talent. At this stage, we can't be specific about timing of film releases, but it would be worth waiting for.","We also recently announced the launch of a global franchise management organization. This team led by Janet Hsu, as Chief Franchise Management Officer, will complement our Core Toy business and expand Mattel's brands to new significant commercial areas.","In conclusion, our turnaround plan is starting to show tangible results. While there is still a lot more work to do, we are confident in our strategy and the progress we are making. We delivered 6% growth in North America and recaptured the number one position in the U.S. year-to-date through September according to NPD.","Also, per NPD, we recaptured our position as the number one toy company globally in each of the last four months through September. The toy industry is expected to continue to grow on a global basis through 2022, according to Euromonitor and we intend to accelerate our own pace and increase market share.","We delivered meaningful improvement in the bottom line performance. This is in spite of the increased inflation and cost of raw materials and plant labor as well as the Toys \"R\" Us disruption and we expect to deliver further improvement in profitability in the fourth quarter. As we head into next year, our focus will be on driving top-line performance and continued growth in profitability.","Looking into 2020 and beyond, we believe the capabilities we're putting in place will position us well to accelerate growth and capture the full value of our IP. We are in a multiyear turnaround and execution will take time. However, given the quality of our assets and the strength of our team, I'm confident that we will be able to execute on our strategy and increase long-term shareholder value.","I will now turn the call over to Joe to walk through our third quarter progress in more detail.","Joseph J. Euteneuer - Mattel, Inc.","Thank you, Ynon, and good afternoon everyone. Today, I'll begin by walking you through the financial results and updated outlook for the full year. Then I'll provide an update on our strategic investments and our continued progress against Structural Simplification.","We are starting to see demonstrated improvement in our performance as a result of our continued strong execution. As Ynon mentioned, gross sales in the quarter were down 4% year-over-year in constant currency, driven by a negative 3% impact from Toys \"R\" Us and a negative 3% impact from the slowdown in our China business.","As expected, POS for Mattel was down mid- to high-single digits for the quarter as consumers began transitioning from Toys \"R\" Us to other retailers. Our performance was roughly in line with the industry. And as Ynon said, we recaptured the number one global toy manufacturer position in each of the last four months through September, according to NPD.","In looking at the full year, we said back at Toy Fair in February that we would be working to stabilize the top line in 2018. While we've made meaningful progress, especially in North America, there have been a number of developments throughout the year that have had a negative impact on our full-year outlook, including the impact of Toys \"R\" Us, a 3% foreign exchange headwind and a 3% negative impact from challenges in our China business.","We expect the impact of these developments to result in a full-year top-line decline similar to prior year. Despite these headwinds on the top-line, I am pleased to report that our third quarter performance reflected significant improvement in our profitability, as we continue to realize the benefits of the actions taken towards Structural Simplification.","In the third quarter, our adjusted gross margin was 43% of net sales, up from 41.5% in the third quarter of 2017. The improvement was primarily driven by the $63 million benefit from Structural Simplification, last year's Toys \"R\" Us revenue reversal of $43 million, which did not include a corresponding reversal of the cost of goods sold, favorability in freight and logistics costs associated with bringing in-house a previously-outsourced distribution facility and price increases in select international markets.","These were partially offset by a negative 300-basis-point impact from inflation and the cost of raw materials and plant labor. Consistent with the second quarter, we remain confident that our second half gross margin will be in the low-40s and continue to expect full-year gross margin to be in the high-30s.","In the third quarter, our advertising rate was 11.5%, which was flat year-over-year. For the full year, we continue to expect our advertising rate to return to our historical range of 11% to 13% of net sales, as we benefit from Structural Simplification savings of $30 million to $40 million.","In the third quarter, our reported SG&A was $326 million, down $55 million or 15% year-over-year, which included severance and restructuring costs of $26 million. Our third quarter adjusted SG&A of $300 million was down $50 million or 14% compared to the prior year. This year-over-year improvement was primarily driven by cost savings of $55 million from Structural Simplification and approximately $13 million of Toys \"R\" Us bad debt recoveries.","Looking ahead, we continue to expect adjusted SG&A for the full year to be slightly better than the prior year in dollars. Adjusted operating income in the quarter was $153 million, up $36 million or 31% compared to the prior year, driven by the $119 million of savings realized from our Structural Simplification cost savings programs, as well as the net benefit of last year's Toys \"R\" Us revenue reversal of $43 million and the $13 million of Toys \"R\" Us bad debt recoveries, partially offset by inflation in the cost of raw materials and plant labor as I previously mentioned.","Now, let me give you an update on taxes. Our income tax expense was $66 million in the third quarter and $71 million year-to-date. Our overall 2018 effective tax rate may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to the level and mix of income or losses in our foreign jurisdictions and due to the full valuation allowance on our U.S. deferred tax assets.","As a result of the valuation allowance in the third quarter of 2018, we did not recognize an income tax benefit for any U.S. losses since we released the valuation allowance to cover the related expenses but recorded an income tax expense on our net foreign income in certain jurisdictions.","Additionally, we had previously expected to pay cash taxes of $100 million in 2018, similar to the prior year. We now expect cash taxes for the full year to be $60 million to $80 million, excluding any actions related to Structural Simplification.","With regards to the Tax Act, in the third quarter, we recorded a provisional tax of $9 million associated with the deemed repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings. Additionally, in order to enhance Mattel's access to foreign earnings, we changed our indefinite reinvestment assertion on a portion of our foreign earnings and recorded a tax expense of $15 million (25:59) related to this change.","Assuming no changes in tax laws and excluding discrete tax items, Mattel anticipates fourth quarter tax expense should be less than $30 million based on our current projections.","Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the third quarter with a cash balance of $209 million. During the first nine months, our working capital improved $552 million, primarily driven by accounts receivable improvement of $193 million or 13% year-over-year, half of which was driven by lower sales and the other half by improved collections. This improvement resulted in a five-day reduction in our days sales outstanding.","As it relates to the recently-announced Sears bankruptcy, Sears represented less than 1% of our overall revenues last year and our exposure is insignificant as we have closely managed the account for some time.","Additionally, owned inventory improved $264 million, or 27% year-over-year, as a result of our continued efforts to tightly manage our inventory by better aligning the timing of production with consumer demand.","Moving to the statement of cash flows, cash flows used for operations was $731 million year-to-date, which was an improvement, compared to prior-year usage of $740 million driven by lower working capital usage, offset by higher net loss excluding non-cash charges of approximately $266 million.","The primary driver of investing activities was capital expenditures, which were $111 million year-to-date, down 53% year-over-year due to reductions in tooling and plant capital expenditures. We originally expected capital expenditures to be down $100 million or 33% versus the prior year. Based on year-to-date spend, we are confident that we will exceed that goal.","We will continue to tightly manage working capital as we approach the 2018 holiday season. We also continue to monitor our capital structure and remain confident that we have sufficient liquidity to run our business efficiently. And we have no debt maturities until October 2020.","Turning to our strategic investments, after a comprehensive review, we remain committed to our investment strategy. While we originally expected investment spend to be $85 million for both 2018 and 2019, with the leadership transition, we took time to reassess and reprioritize. We now expect the spend to be more heavily weighted towards 2019. We expect our 2018 spend to be approximately $60 million and have spent $27 million year-to-date on initiatives, including our IT transformation, American Girl turnaround, other brand growth opportunities, as well as our International strategy.","We plan to provide more visibility into our plans for 2019 in the coming months. With regards to Mattel Films, as Ynon said, we are constructing a capital-light business model and we do not anticipate taking on financial risk.","Now, let me provide an update on our Structural Simplification cost savings programs. We continue to be on track to achieve or exceed our $650 million targeted run rate exiting 2019. We are pleased to report that we achieved approximately $120 million of savings in the quarter and year-to-date savings of approximately $160 million.","Our year-to-date severance and restructuring costs related to Structural Simplification are $104 million. As Ynon stated, we are making good progress and exploring strategic alternatives for our manufacturing footprint as we move toward a capital-light model, which could lead to additional efficiencies over time.","In closing, I am pleased with our progress as we continue to execute against our strategy in spite of the short-term industry disruption related to Toys \"R\" Us. We are clearly seeing the benefits of Structural Simplification materializing in the P&L. We remain focused on value creation for our shareholders through our comprehensive actions to restore profitability and to stabilize the top line.","Thank you for your time today. And we will now open the line up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our first question comes from the line of Eric Handler of MKM Partners. Your line is open.","Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC","Yes. Thanks for taking the question. Joe, just a couple questions for you here. First, when you say you expect revenue for the full year to be down similar to last year, so that's about 10% on a net adjusted sales basis, are you talking gross sales or are you talking after the sales adjustments on that line?","Joseph J. Euteneuer - Mattel, Inc.","I was talking gross sales.","Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC","You're talking gross sales. And then, how would you then think about the adjustments line, the sales adjustments line?","Joseph J. Euteneuer - Mattel, Inc.","No. I didn't provide any guidance on that. I wanted to just give you the top line and the bottom line. It is a line we continue to work hard on, but remember, the majority of that money is going to happen here in the fourth quarter so.","Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC","Got it. And then, one other quick question for you. With regards to the movie business, so given you don't expect to take any financial risk, does that mean you expect to get any equity participation in these films? And if you do, how exactly is that going to work?","Ynon Kreiz - Mattel, Inc.","Yeah. Let me answer on the film side. This is Ynon. We intend to receive different forms of participation. It's a combination of cash for the rights, as well as royalties for back end and upside (32:50) in the movie. This is without taking on financial risk. And the driver, the reason we can receive good terms is because the IP is such high quality and in such high demand. So, without risking capital, we intend to still have meaningful participation in the upside (33:13) in the event of success.","Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gerrick Johnson of BMO Capital Partners. Your line is open.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey. Good afternoon. Got a couple here. First, on the Chinese part. Is this slowdown a macro Chinese issue or is this a more micro Mattel issue?","Ynon Kreiz - Mattel, Inc.","It is more of our own issue. This is a self-inflicted situation related to a miscalculation of forecast and mismatch in supply versus demand. This will have an impact of 3% on the top line for the full year. And our team on the ground is managing through inventory at retail and are taking action to mitigate the decline.","I should say that we do have great partnerships in place in China between Alibaba, Fosun, Babytree, NetEase and are continuing to engage with them to differentiate ourselves in the market and still see potential growth in China going forward. So, it is a local issue. It's a 2018 issue and we hope to work through it going forward.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Thank you for that. And how about shipments from China, are those containers getting through the ports okay? Is there any slowdown because of the tariff issue and inspection of containers? Thank you.","Ynon Kreiz - Mattel, Inc.","Not at all. We're fine.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Arpin\u00e9 Kocharyan of UBS. Your line is open.","Arpin\u00e9 Kocharyan - UBS Securities LLC","Hi. Thank you very much. I wanted to talk about margins. It seems like high-30s gross margin guidance is still your guidance and given year-to-date performance that would imply Q4 has to be up definitely more than 800 points, 900 points to meet that guidance. Could you just go over some of the puts and takes?","There was a lot of SKU rationalization last year that was margin disruptive and some distribution center issues but still on a declining top line, that seems aggressive. So, if you could just go through puts and takes. And then, I have a follow-up on China. Thanks.","Joseph J. Euteneuer - Mattel, Inc.","Yeah. Sure. Remember, you have two big things. One is fourth quarter is your biggest quarter so obviously you have scale and then second thing if you remember last year I had the big write-off in the fourth quarter. So, from a year-over-year basis, I'm getting the benefit of the write-off I had last year that I don't have or not anticipating this year.","And then you have the benefits from Structural Simplification. You have the benefits from the TRU sales reversal, which is a last-year issue. You have the benefits that I've been talking for the past two quarters of the Pennsylvania distribution facility that's online and achieving the savings and operating the way we want after we've gone through two-and-a-half quarters of problems with it. So, that's up and running great. And then, we did have a little bit of price increases in selected places. And then, it's just offset by the inflation as discussed. So, yeah, we feel pretty good about \u2013 we feel great about where we are and confident in the numbers we put out there.","Arpin\u00e9 Kocharyan - UBS Securities LLC","So, would you say, by my calculation, that's at least sort of half of that, potentially 800 basis points, 900 basis points of margin? Would you say that's about right in terms of impact? What's really, truly one-off?","Joseph J. Euteneuer - Mattel, Inc.","Well, yeah. If you remember last quarter, I did say that part of the benefits we were going to get in the back half of the year were going to be mathematical in the sense of stuff that happened in last year that aren't repeating this year obsolescence is one. The TRU issue is the second one. So, yes, a portion of it is mathematics and another portion is real execution on our part to improve our profitability.","Arpin\u00e9 Kocharyan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then, I have a quick follow-up on China. I'm sorry. I'm still sort of not understanding it, because 3% of top line is $165 million. That, to my knowledge, represents more than half of your China business. It's not \u2013 it doesn't seem like it's a slowdown. It seems like it's a significant, significant decline, because the base of that business could not have been more than $500 million. Could you just go over the scale of that decline?","Joseph J. Euteneuer - Mattel, Inc.","Yeah. Look, we have not given out specific numbers in regards to China individually. I mean, look, the realities are in China it's very simple. It's a market that even though you see press headlines that the market is slowing, it still has great growth as a market and what's happened to us is something that was self-inflicted, where somebody overestimated the demand and therefore we were supplying to an overestimated demand and now we're having to work through those issues. That's it. It's something that gets corrected and we move on with life and then we can take advantage of the high growth opportunity in China.","Arpin\u00e9 Kocharyan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you. And then, I have one quick one. It seems like industry sales softened significantly into the third quarter. As you look at the retail picture, not just for Mattel, but your competitors and kind of the Toys \"R\" Us situation and what retailers are doing, what is your explanation of what's happening at the demand level outside of Toys \"R\" Us?","Given that the rest of the consumer picture seems okay, do you feel like it's TRU sales being pulled forward a bit into the first half of the year and that's having a bit of impact? Why do you think toys retail slow down significantly into Q3? Thank you.","Ynon Kreiz - Mattel, Inc.","Well, there's no denying that Toys \"R\" Us liquidation had an impact on the U.S. market specifically. But to put it in context, the Toys \"R\" Us situation is a very specific situation to Toys \"R\" Us. This is not a reflection on the rest of the industry and people do confuse that.","Based on the research that we see, take Euromonitor research, for example, that was published in May this year, they project that the industry will grow through 2022 at 4.7% CAGR and this is based on a study they have done in 32 countries, making up about 80% of the global toy industry. So, we do expect a disruption in 2018 but that impact will subside during 2019 and beyond.","And as it relates to this year, what we see are all the other retailers moving in and picking up the demand for toys and catering for consumers, who are looking to buy products. Now, fundamentally speaking, the fact that one retailer is out of business doesn't mean that consumers will change what they do, what they consume, and the toys they like. The market will realign over time and based on what we know, we expect growth to continue in the industry.","Arpin\u00e9 Kocharyan - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Ng of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Michael Ng - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks so much for the question. I just have a few if I could. In North America I think you said you expect the 4Q revenue to decline year-over-year because of the impact of Toys \"R\" Us. I just wanted to understand this a little bit better in the context of the very strong 3Q North America growth despite 400 basis point headwind from Toys \"R\" Us. Does this imply that the headwind from Toys \"R\" Us is increasing in 4Q versus 3Q? Or is the underlying growth in North America slowing down?","Ynon Kreiz - Mattel, Inc.","Yes. Q4 will have the greatest impact year-on-year from Toys \"R\" Us.","Michael Ng - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. And then, I was wondering if you could just comment on the 300-basis-point headwind from Toys \"R\" Us in the quarter on the top line. Is that a gross or a net number? Said differently, Toys \"R\" Us was 8% of revenue last year. Does that mean that you recaptured the majority of the lost Toys \"R\" Us revenue, or?","Joseph J. Euteneuer - Mattel, Inc.","So, you're talking about on the top line? As far as recapturing, we haven't really estimated \u2013 it's hard to estimate what recapturing really is if you think about Walmart or Target. It's hard to estimate what the impact of recapturing really is.","Michael Ng - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. And then, I was just wondering if you could comment on your owned inventories, which were down fairly substantially in the quarter. Do you feel like those inventories are in a good place to fulfill demand going forward? And could you just comment on the health of what you believe retail inventory of Mattel's products are? Thank you.","Ynon Kreiz - Mattel, Inc.","Look, we are very focused on managing our inventory very tightly and making sure it's aligned with demand and the production output. We are in a healthy place now. We are very cognizant of legacy issues and supply chain challenges we had in the past and we are very focused on fixing it going forward.","When we talk about reshaping operations, which is part of \u2013 is a key pillar in our strategy, this is a big part of that component. To make sure that we are on top of our own production capabilities, that we optimize pricing, that we deliver product on time, that our distribution is up \u2013 is on par with our expectation, and all of that takes a lot of heavy lifting, but we are making good progress and feel that we are in a healthy place now.","Michael Ng - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tim Conder of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Timothy Andrew Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you. I just wanted to get \u2013 and I apologize if I missed this during your earlier comments. Got disconnected there for a little bit. But China list four (44:19), what do you view as you or the industry's risk to that? There's some commentary earlier in the week by a competitor from that perspective but wanted to hear your thoughts.","And then, just to sort of stay on the channel inventories, it seemed like exiting Q2 you felt very good with the exception of China and you've already commented about how that's an issue you'll have cleaned up by the end of the year here. Just to make sure everything else at this point you feel good about the channel inventories or are there some pockets you may be seeing some things that need to be addressed?","Ynon Kreiz - Mattel, Inc.","Okay. Let me start and take the tariff question first. We are being very watchful. This is something that will impact the entire toy industry. The Toy Industry Association of America reported recently that 85% of all toys sold in the U.S. are imported from China. In our case, it is actually less than two-thirds, so we are somewhat in a better position.","And actually, I should say, I should point out an important advantage is that Hot Wheels and Barbie products, the majority of Hot Wheels and Barbie products are not manufactured in China. So, there's no threat on the majority of that business.","Our job is to design an organization that is flexible, it can respond to headwinds and challenges like tariffs in China and this is part of our plan to move towards a capital-light model that will give us more flexibility as we are looking to optimize our supply chain across the world.","Joseph J. Euteneuer - Mattel, Inc.","Yeah, in regard to your second question, you've seen that our inventory is down. Across the board, we have everybody focused on making sure that inventory is healthy, not only at the retailer but at our levels too. It is one of our A-number-one focuses that we take. We want to make sure that our retailers are taken care of along with ourselves and we're servicing them properly.","Timothy Andrew Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then, to circle back to the third quarter retail slowing, would you believe that the \u2013 or is the majority of that due to the comparables of Toys \"R\" Us? Or, again, I just want to make sure there's nothing else that you're seeing, whether domestically or Europe, that should be influencing that.","Joseph J. Euteneuer - Mattel, Inc.","Yeah. I think, yeah. If you think about it, the Toys \"R\" Us liquidation ran until the end of June. So now that that's behind us, you're now focused on the back half of the year. The fourth quarter, you're going to have that negative comparison because obviously the bulk of historic Toys \"R\" Us sales were in the fourth quarter. But, yeah, there's nothing that we think is going to affect the business on a going-forward basis. We think it's going to be pretty healthy.","Timothy Andrew Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And lastly, Joe or, Ynon, however you want to answer this question, just sort of walking through some math that we had, what you reported, now you've updated, even though the top line's going to be a little bit lighter, directionally on an adjusted EBITDA basis, do you feel comfortable that something north of $200 million is within the ballpark, just sort of a benchmark guidepost here for 2018?","Joseph J. Euteneuer - Mattel, Inc.","Yeah. I didn't provide any guidance on the EBITDA number. Look, you can pretty easily get to a number that you can get comfortable with, but we didn't give any specific guidance on it.","Timothy Andrew Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you, Joe.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix of Barclays. Your line is open.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, thanks. Good evening. Good afternoon, rather. Joe, in your financials, now it looks like you are taking out the Toys \"R\" Us adjustment, so can you just walk us through the decision there?","Joseph J. Euteneuer - Mattel, Inc.","Yes. That decision was through our discussions with the SEC that they prefer that we did not do the math for you and that we provided the raw numbers and let you do the math on your own. So, we're just complying with a comment letter that they had that you can see. It's on public file, so you can see it. That's the reason for the change.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then, and this is for both of you, Ynon and Joe. Maybe I'm a little bit confused, but I'm just trying to reconcile the implied fourth quarter revenue guidance. So, based on what you said and what you reported this year, it looks like the revenues will be down about 13%, which means that you're shipping 13% less year-over-year in the fourth quarter, but you kind of did better in the third quarter, so, I mean, it was down. So, I'm just trying to understand. I guess it gets kind of to the retail inventories and push back to that, like I just don't understand the cadence here.","Joseph J. Euteneuer - Mattel, Inc.","Actually, it's really just that there's a bigger impact last year in Toys \"R\" Us in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. That's all it is. Our inventories, everything else, we're fine. We're going into the fourth quarter strong. We've got great relationships with everybody. We're working it hard. We're feeling very good internally about what's going on and carrying forward. That's the issue.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. I guess maybe asked another way. I mean, for a lot of us who've modeled and you've seen all the sell-side model for the year, inclusive of the fourth quarter, it's a little bit of a surprise to us, but since you guys don't give guidance, I mean, is that fourth quarter implied guidance now in line with perhaps what you were thinking last quarter or with your overall plan? Or is it more than you expected?","Joseph J. Euteneuer - Mattel, Inc.","Yeah. No. The interesting thing is in the part of the reason we gave top-line guidance is to get everyone's models adjusted because internally, we feel very, very good about the numbers. And the fact of the matter is, is Toys \"R\" Us impact in the third quarter was low single digits and the fourth quarter it'll be double digits, so that's the issue.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then, just finally on American Girl, I mean, I know some of the problem is that you guys are kind of working through some decisions that were made from the prior management team. So, how long do you think it'll take for you to work through all the third-party channel stuff?","Richard L. Dickson - Mattel, Inc.","So, we've decided that we are obviously hard at work at American Girl. This will be a multiyear turnaround. The focus of the turnaround, as you know, is obviously on the omni-channel experience that we have, catalog, e-commerce and our own stores, evaluating our price\/value equation, enhancing customer relationships through improved data management and CRM and most importantly as well, modernizing the brand's content, which with new talent in the organization and the new partnerships that we've established in the content arena, we're very confident that we're going to be able to address that quickly.","So, one to watch, absolutely. We are working feverishly on driving the turnaround for that brand. Despite all of the challenges, Net Promoter Scores remain high, loyalty remains high. Our conversion of the customers we do have is very impressive and so we still are very confident in the DNA of the brand and we'll work hard to turn that around.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks, Richard. You were prepared. You knew I was going to ask that. All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian of Citi. Your line is open.","Frederick Wightman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey, guys. It's actually Fred Wightman on for Greg. If we look at that $160 million in cost savings year-to-date, can you just walk through the bigger buckets of the bridge to the $500 million that you're expecting by the end of the year?","Joseph J. Euteneuer - Mattel, Inc.","Oh, you mean as far as where it's coming from?","Frederick Wightman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yeah, please.","Joseph J. Euteneuer - Mattel, Inc.","Yeah. So, you're going to have roughly $200 million is going to come out of cost of goods sold. You'll have the $30 million to $40 million that we're going to get in advertising here in the fourth quarter and then the balance will come out of SG&A.","A number of actions have already been taken. You saw the 22% reduction in workforce. You've heard us talk about all of the initiatives we have at the manufacturing plants. And you've heard Ynon talk about this. This isn't about expense take-out. It's about reorganizing and becoming a far more efficient organization. And all those things, they have multiple projects contribute to getting to that exiting run rate.","Frederick Wightman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Thanks. And if we look at the strategic roadmap slide, one of the short to mid-term goals talks about expanding the brand portfolio. Is that something that you think is likely to come from acquisitions? Is that something that you guys think you can develop internally? Is that talking about licensing? How are you thinking about that?","Ynon Kreiz - Mattel, Inc.","Yeah, this is a combination of three components. The first is leveraging our own library, more of the dormant brands that we haven't commercialized in full. And as we noted in the prepared comments, we have hundreds of those, so there's a huge portfolio that we can commercialize. Then, you have the brands that we do not know that exist yet. These are all the brands that we will create as we're looking to drive and innovate and create the next big brands for the industry.","So, these two components are Mattel-owned brands and the third I mentioned are licensed brands. This is where we are looking to position Mattel as a partner of choice for the big \u2013 the other media platforms around the world, especially the entertainment companies that own the big movie franchises.","It is fair to say that we lost a few key licenses along the way and we intend to go back and compete for them in a much more front-footed way. We've done as a case in point a great job with Jurassic World, which exceeded everybody's expectations and we are looking to collaborate with other partners going forward.","Frederick Wightman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jaime Katz of Morningstar. Your line is open.","Jaime M. Katz - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I'm curious about the working capital metrics that you guys had improving on the balance sheet and you've made some pretty good strides at unlocking some value there in the last quarter and I just am wondering what you guys expect going forward, particularly on the receivables side, maybe as you move to some smaller retailers, which could provide a headwind on that line. Thanks.","Joseph J. Euteneuer - Mattel, Inc.","Sure. We still expect to manage receivables very tightly. We would think that receivables should be down along with inventory going down here into the fourth quarter. So, we feel pretty good about our positioning and the effort going on across the company to really manage those two balances very tightly.","Jaime M. Katz - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Okay. And then, you guys have made some key hires for the commercial organization. Are there any priorities you guys would like to share with us that might help us think about if there's a way to squeeze some cost savings out of that side of the business? Thank you.","Ynon Kreiz - Mattel, Inc.","This is less about cost savings and much more about addressing highly-accretive business verticals, where we have incredible potential to commercialize our library.","I think I just want to put things in perspective because when we talk about our portfolio, this catalog spans girls, boys, infant and preschool demographics. We have dolls and vehicles, action figures, construction, games from learning and development, superheroes, spies, space explorers, princesses, you name it.","So, we have so much opportunity around our own catalog that has not been commercialized, that it's going to be mostly about cadence and the way we progress our efforts on that front.","We did talk about film. And as we said before, there are a few big projects in the works. We're not ready to announce anything at this time, but it is in motion and we're also looking at the other verticals that are highly-accretive businesses in and of themselves.","Historically, we have done things in those areas, but it was mostly about marketing and promotion. Our approach now is about commercializing these areas as successful verticals in and of themselves and that's where we see the potential and you should expect more to come in that area.","Jaime M. Katz - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Whitney Steininger for any closing remarks.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Martin Gilkes, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Martin Gilkes","Thank you, Sabrina, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me today are Chris Sinclair, Mattel\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Richard Dickson, Mattel\u2019s President and Chief Operating Officer; and Kevin Farr, Mattel\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. As you know, this afternoon we reported Mattel\u2019s 2016 first quarter financial results. We\u2019ll begin today\u2019s call with Chris, Richard, and Kevin providing commentary on our results, and then we\u2019ll take your questions.","To help guide our discussion today, we have provided you with a slide presentation. Both, our earnings release and slide presentations include non-GAAP financial measures. The information required by Regulation G regarding non-GAAP financial measures is included in these materials, and both documents are available on the Investors section of our corporate website, corporate.mattel.com.","Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind you that certain statements made during the call may include forward-looking statements relating to the future performance of our overall business, brands and product lines. These statements are based on currently available information and they are subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.","We describe some of these uncertainties in the Risk Factors section of our 2015 annual report on Form 10-K, our 2015 quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and other filings we make with the SEC from time-to-time, as well as in our other public statements. Mattel does not update forward-looking statements and expressly disclaims any obligation to do so.","Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Chris.","Chris Sinclair","Thanks, Martin, and welcome everyone. I would like to thank you for joining us. Today I am going to lead things off with a brief perspective on both the quarter and the full year, and then Richard and Kevin will each provide some additional details. And as usual, we will open things up at the end for any questions you might have.","So, let me begin by saying that overall we\u2019re very encouraged by the start of the year and particularly with our ability to hold the top line as we offset the loss of Disney Princess. We also made some good progress against our cost reduction goals, both in cost of goods and in SG&A. The offsetting negative of course continues to be significant headwinds in foreign exchange, both in translation and transaction, which depressed our gross margins in quarter. We also recorded a $26 million charge on other income to recognize adjustments from Venezuela\u2019s currency devaluation, which I think most of you know, has really impacted most corporations with operations in that country.","Putting aside foreign exchange the net message is that we continue to make good progress on our strategic priorities and we also remain on track to execute well and to deliver on our outlook for this year. We\u2019re certainly setting up well to restore real growth in 2017 and beyond. Our shipments and POS were closely aligned in this quarter with POS positive and shipments off slightly in constant currency. We\u2019re also encouraged by solid POS trends on key core brands like Barbie, Fisher-Price and Hot Wheels and by a number of our key brands within the Toy Box.","Importantly, our retail space also stabilized versus last year, and shelf productivity has remained strong, which we expect will support some expansion opportunities on shelf space this fall. We also continue to execute well broadly across much of our customer base. And to this latter point, while North America remains a good leading indicator of our progress with positive shipping in the quarter, we\u2019re also seeing some fairly broad-based strength across most regions, and particularly in our emerging markets.","Now, as for the middle of the P&L, we also made some good progress. And we do remain on track with our cost targets, performance of which was largely masked at least in gross margin by the impact of currencies. And here, it\u2019s important to point out that on a constant currency basis gross margin was actually relatively stable. And looking ahead, we expect the cost savings to accelerate through the balance of the year; we also expect the seasonal impacts from foreign exchange and from the loss of Disney Princess to begin to mitigate and that we\u2019re still tracking to our expectations. And finally, I\u2019d note that our balance sheet remains strong, and we\u2019re continuing to invest in the business and to maintain our dividend.","So to summarize, we\u2019re encouraged and we remain cautiously optimistic about the way the year is setting up. It\u2019s early and we still have a lot of work ahead, but we\u2019re executing well, our entertainment drivers and most of our important brands are performing. We\u2019re expanding rapidly in key emerging markets. And we\u2019re getting out the cost that we expected to. Little help from foreign exchange would be nice as well, but we do think we have this accounted for as we move through the year. So, what this all means is that we continue to see things taking shape much as we communicated to you in February, at Toy Fair. Our outlook for 2016 is largely unchanged, and we\u2019re tracking well for strong performance next year.","And with that as a setup, let me turn things over to Richard to highlight some of our top line progress, and our core initiatives. And he\u2019ll be followed by Kevin who will give you a lot more color on our performance and on our outlook. Richard?","Richard Dickson","Thank you, Chris. As Chris said, we\u2019re making progress on many fronts with lots of positive indicators of our success, not the least of which is the attention that tells transformation is receiving worldwide. Consumers and the media are once again focused on our brands and our products rather than our challenges. And while much of the attention we\u2019ve been receiving has revolved around key strategic priorities, we attribute our success largely to quarter after quarter of solid execution. And our first quarter execution demonstrates that we\u2019re off to a good start with consumer takeaway and shipping, giving us even more confidence that we can achieve our 2016 goal to hold the top line relatively flat in constant currency.","Let\u2019s review some specifics. We were pleased to see continued positive global POS up 2%, normalizing for the Eastern holiday with considerable POS strength in international markets. One of the most encouraging steps this quarter is that we almost completely offset the loss of the Disney Princess license which represented about $100 million or 10% of last year\u2019s sales. This was accomplished through great execution across the entire organization. And when the impact of Disney Princess is excluded, Mattel\u2019s positive POS performance improved significantly to the mid-single digits with shipping up high-single digits.","It wasn\u2019t that long ago that we began to transform the Company\u2019s culture and reset our approach to brand management with the creation of our core brand teams and the Toy Box organization. While recognizing we have more work to do, the first quarter results continue to demonstrate our conviction to fundamentally change our approach to the business. These trends also continue to validate our strategic initiatives, ongoing revitalization of our core brands, the rebuilding of relationships with strategic license partners, accelerated growth in emerging markets and a much more effective presence at retail.","So, let\u2019s take a closer look at results. Overall, our strong holiday season led to reduced retail inventories on key brands. We were encouraged by retailer confidence in our business as they look to restock their shelves with Mattel products in the first quarter. Excluding the impact of ForEx, we saw strong shipping numbers on many of our brands including Barbie, Fisher-Price, Hot Wheels, Thomas and MEGA brands, and we saw strong consumer and retail support for our new DC Comics executions.","We continue to be pleased with Barbie\u2019s performance coming off such a strong holiday season with global POS and shipping closely aligned in the first quarter. As you know, last year, we were essentially re-launching Barbie and saw tremendous results, particularly in the U.S. where POS was up double digits. And from that new base, we continue to see positive POS here in the U.S.; and with shipping up 11%, we are also beginning to see this momentum broaden with positive Barbie POS in Europe and Asia.","Now, we have more work to do but we will continue to build on the brand resurgence in North America and the very strong response we\u2019re seeing with our Barbie marketing strategy and new breadth of products. We will also be increasing our successful marketing Thomas to drive brand preference.","Looking forward, expect us to build on these successes with many exciting innovations including those you saw recently Toy Fair. We are confident that Barbie will only become more engaging and relevant to girls and moms as we move forward toward holiday 2016. But remember, Mattel is not just a Barbie story. Fisher-Price results for the quarter reflect positive POS trends with very strong shipping. We were pleased to see our biggest segment Baby have particularly solid POS and shipping in the quarter, notably in international markets. We\u2019re seeking to accelerate this momentum as we continue to emphasize early childhood development, the most important demand driver in the category today. We\u2019ve already seen a tremendous response to our new think and learn lines with the widely anticipated Code-a-Pillar [ph] product set to launch later this year. In addition, earlier this month, we were excited to formally announce the appointment of one of the world\u2019s most popular designers, Jonathan Adler, as Creative Director for the Fischer-Price brand. You will begin to see his influence this fall and we\u2019re hard at work, leveraging this unique understanding lifestyle aesthetics for today\u2019s families with more sophisticated Fischer-Price style, fashion and function for 2017.","Thomas and Hot Wheels each continue to see solid POS and shipping trends, particularly in the international markets. Both brands had exciting new content and products this year to support the strong momentum we\u2019re seeing on these brands. Now, as we said in the February, American Girl results will be challenging in the first half of this year as the major new initiatives to generate positive brand momentum will be coming on line in the third and fourth quarters. We continue to take meaningful steps to energize this brand. And as I mentioned in our last update, there are some specific price value issues that we\u2019re addressing as well as improved distribution and expanded consumer engagement. I will be sharing more on these as the year progresses.","Monster High has yet to stabilize. Despite some success with the new offerings, the decline in POS and competitive product launches have impacted its shelf space and overall performance. Consumer engagement continues to build with this brand with over 2 million subscribers on Facebook, over 800,000 monthly visits to the website, and significant growth in views on YouTube. Our focus remains on how to connect this great brand energy with more towards sales. As you know, we\u2019re effectively re-launching the brand in the second half of this year with a new look, new content, a refocus on popular core characters, more features, and enhanced play value. We remain cautiously optimistic but we holistically hope to see improving POS trends in the second half of the year which will be a leading indicator that the brand is stabilizing as we exit 2016.","Turning now to Toy Box, we\u2019ve been very encouraged by early consumer demand for our new DC\u2019s Super Hero Girls line, even though some of its content just went live late in Q1. While currently in exclusive launch target, its retail presence will go broader in June. On a related note, we\u2019re very pleased with the initial response our DC\u2019s Super Hero\u2019s Batman versus Superman product with the blockbuster film premiering the last week of the quarter. We\u2019re excited to watch how this franchise builds as we continue to support the extensive upcoming DC movie slate.","And lastly, I\u2019d like to highlight the solid performance of MEGA Brands construction globally. We continue to see very strong results with MEGA\u2019s preschool executions, our own brand overlays of Monster High and American Girl as well as the initial popularity of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles product line ahead of the June movie release.","Overall, I am pleased with the Company\u2019s. I am proud of the continuing progress on resting Mattel\u2019s culture to be more innovative, more competitive, and more efficient. We have both, significant opportunities and significant challenges to face this year. And I am encouraged by our execution to-date and look forward to reporting more progress to you throughout the year. As Chris said, our progress to-date has generated strong momentum to build on. And we are increasingly well-positioned for growth and greater profitability in 2017 and beyond.","And now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Kevin Farr. Kevin?","Kevin Farr","Thank you, Richard and good afternoon everyone. As Chris said, foreign exchange continues to negatively impact our financial results in the first quarter. Overall, our results were in line with our expectations. Specifically, we\u2019re encouraged by our top line performance as growth in our revenues of our core brands and Toy Box almost fully offset the loss of the Disney Princess license. We also made significant progress on executing our cost savings programs which resulted in roughly flat year-over-year operating margin on a reported basis.","Before going into detail, I want to remind everyone that unless otherwise noted, I\u2019ll be referring to sales in constant currency and adjusted financial results, so they exclude certain items related to our acquisitions of MEGA, Fuhu and Sproutling as well as severance expense.","So, highlighting the top line trends, gross sales were down just 1% in constant currency or 6% as reported. This included growth in North America and Europe despite the loss of the Disney Princess license business. We continued to see double-digit growth in China but our Asia Pacific region declined modestly, primarily due to Australia. Latin America also declined as Mexico continues to deliver solid growth, but our business in Brazil has been impacted by macroeconomic weakness, pricing challenges, and inventory overhang.","And of course, the underlying trends look much more favorable when we exclude Disney Princess with overall gross sales up high single digits for the quarter. This included broad-based growth across all regions except Latin America where sales were flat; overall, very solid top line performance on an underlying basis. These early reads are very encouraging as continued strong growth in our core brands and Toy Box revenues are the key for us to achieve our goal of relatively flat sales for the full year.","Moving to the rest of the P&L, sales adjustments were roughly flat versus the prior year as a percentage of net sales where we continue to invest in retail promotions to drive POS and shipping for the first quarter and full year. As Chris said, our gross margin was relatively flat year-over-year in constant currency with 44.7% as reported. As we said in our 2016 outlook, we expect foreign exchange would be a headwind for the full year. We expected that particularly in the first-half on a gross margin rate basis due to the seasonally smaller quarters and tougher year-over-year comparisons. And we saw this in the first quarter with around 340 of the 410 basis-point decline in gross margins attributable to unfavorable foreign exchange. Almost half the negative impact from foreign exchange can be explained by less favorable euro hedging rates in 2016 versus 2015. Another driver is the fact that we\u2019re selling inventory that was produced last year at less favorable rates when the dollar significantly strengthened against key currencies. In the first quarter, we also saw strong trends and growth in countries with more volatile currencies like Mexico and Russia versus 2015.","Looking forward, we expect this to balance out, particularly in the second half of the year with higher seasonal revenues. The other key drivers of the declining gross margin rate in the quarter was related to the mix shift from our higher margin doll business, given the loss of Disney Princess to lower margin product lines like MEGA and Fisher-Price. And finally, as it relates to our overall gross margin, what\u2019s encouraging is that our cost savings initiatives more than offset inflation while continuing to improve our price value propositions.","Moving beyond gross margin, advertising was lower as we began to move somewhat closer to the 12% for the full year coupled with the benefit of foreign exchange. On a positive note, adjusted SG&A was down $25 million or 7% year-over-year as cost savings and favorable foreign exchange more than offset labor related inflations. In total, we delivered gross cost savings of $46 million in the quarter, roughly evenly split between gross margin and SG&A.","Finally, adjusted EPS was a negative $0.13 per share or negative $0.21 as reported. As some of you may know, in February the Venezuelan government changed its official exchange rate, which re-prompted devaluation this quarter. As a result, reported EPS included a $0.06 negative impact from the re-measurement of our Bolivar denominated assets, primarily cash in Venezuela which we excluded from adjusted EPS.","As it relates to our balance sheet cash flow, we ended the quarter with around $600 million in cash, a similar quarter-over-quarter change to what we ended the fourth quarter of 2015. This was in line with our expectation and reflects solid performance especially when you consider the roughly $30 million cash outlay for the acquisition of Fuhu and Sproutling and roughly $20 million reduction in cash due to the Venezuelan devaluation.","Not surprisingly, owned inventory on our balance sheet was up year-over-year as we position the business to support our new license entertainment launches throughout the year in addition to the continued positive POS trends on a global basis including great momentum and new launches for MEGA.","Receivables were also up due to later timing of the customer shipments as well as the impact of longer term for some of our emerging market customers. We did see a benefit this quarter from our efforts around extending key vendor terms to match industry norms over the last two years with the latest extension implemented in May of 2015. This favorability should moderate going forward, based on the timing when we implemented these changes in 2015. However, we\u2019ll continue to emphasize even greater overall discipline in accounts payable management, going forward, as we continue to reward our shareholders by deploying capital in a disciplined manner and maintaining the dividend. As we\u2019ve said dividends remain our first priority after reinvesting in the business. And the Board declared the second quarter dividend of $0.38 per share which is flat compared to the second quarter of 2015.","As we look ahead to our second quarter and full year 2016 outlook, we\u2019re targeting gross sales in the second quarter to reflect similar year-over-year trends to what we achieved in the first quarter or relatively flat on a constant currency basis. Although Disney Princess comparisons get easier, we believe there is some benefit in the first quarter from initial retail restocking of Mattel products due to low beginning inventory levels on shelves. Offsetting this is early results from key incremental revenue drivers which look promising, and this momentum should continue in the second quarter and beyond. As it relates to gross margin, we believe the second quarter gross margin rate will be roughly flat to the first quarter with supply chains efficiencies and cost savings partially offsetting foreign exchange headwinds.","And we believe we\u2019ll continue to see year-over-year savings on adjusted SG&A in the second quarter driven by continued efficiencies and cost savings initiatives. However, the year-over-year improvement will be less than that what we saw in Q1 in part due to the full quarter addition of Fuhu SG&A. As such, we expect second quarter adjusted SG&A spending to be modestly down versus the first quarter run rate in dollars.","Finally, despite the significant first half headwinds, our full year P&L outlook for 2016 remains unchanged. I\u2019ll briefly focus on the key drivers. We\u2019re still looking to deliver relatively flat net sales in constant currency. On gross margin, we continue to target about 50% for the full year, similar to what we achieved in 2015, specifically the are two key drivers of first half headwinds that should moderate in the second half; the first is foreign exchange. Assuming current spot rates and our current hedge position, for reference, foreign exchange had roughly a positive 100 basis points impact to gross margin rate in the first half of 2015 versus a roughly a negative 200 basis-point impact to gross margin rate in the second half. For the second half of the year, we expect the impact of foreign exchange to moderate as seasonal revenues are significantly higher than the second half. The hedge euro rate differential for the second half is closer to the hedge rate for 2015, country mix should balance out. We offset some of the foreign exchange with price increases on the fall line and easier year-over-year gross margin rate comparisons.","The second factor is mix, as we look to the second half, we expect that the negative impact of Disney Princess mix will lessen, since it is smaller relatively to our overall revenues and we should see the benefit from expected growth in our doll business improving Barbie, the global launch of DC Super Heroes and strong initiatives on American Girl. And importantly, as we ramp up production in the second quarter and work towards peak production, we expect structural supply chain savings accelerate, which will be positive gross margin for the second half.","Lastly, we continue to target adjusted SG&A to be down $55 million to $65 million year-over-year. Our previous outlook excluded SG&A Fuhu and Sproutling which we had recently acquired. However, we\u2019ll look to absorb bulk of the overhead from Fuhu and Sproutling acquisitions by aggressively pursuing additional cost savings opportunities.","Finally, looking beyond this year of transition as Chris said, we see a path to approaching our 15% to 20% operating margin target in 2017, as we have a tailwind on top line revenues from Cars 3 movie and continued traction in China, Russia, and emerging markets.","Beyond the key drives we\u2019ve already discussed, Fuhu and Sproutling will help offset the earnings impact related to increase SG&A in 2016 but we expect sales to ramp up in 2017 as we leverage the technology platform across our portfolio and expand our market opportunities.","In closing, we don\u2019t want to get ahead of ourselves in a seasonally small quarter but the turnaround continues to track to our expectations. Our global POS remains positive, which is driving further shelf space stabilization for key core brands and a shipping recovery across most of our regions when you exclude Disney Princess. If these trends continue, it should set a solid foundation for growth and improve profitability in 2017. We look forward to updating you on the progress throughout the year and will now open the call up to questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Jaime Katz of Morningstar. Your line is now open.","Jaime Katz","I am curious if you guys would be willing to talk about the contribution from the DC Comic relationship, obviously entertainment has been pretty lucrative for Hasbro. And I\u2019m curious how the read through has been for you guys so far?","Richard Dickson","As I mentioned, we\u2019re really pleased with the early reads right now of the DC Super Hero Girls collection exclusive at Target Company but we\u2019ll have a broader rollout in June. And we anticipate continued momentum through the year and potentially a much longer franchise as they continue to introduce new characters into the mix. In addition, as we also mentioned, we\u2019re coming off of the blockbuster hit at this point with Batman versus Superman, the toy business is reacting really terrific. We continue to see momentum behind that segment. And as you know, we have a really robust line up over the next several years with Warner Bros and DC. So, we are looking forward to continuing to grow that franchise overall and currently really pleased with the initial leadings.","Jaime Katz","And then can you -- I don\u2019t know if you guys have gone this yet, but can you talk about how you\u2019re thinking about integrating some of the digital ideas from either Fuhu or Sproutling into the product lines? And what sort of progress actually we might see coming out of those acquisitions?","Chris Sinclair","I\u2019ll take that. I think we\u2019ve got a very active team working on integrating it at this point; a lot of work being done to integrate, both Fuhu and Sproutling with some of the Fisher-Price lines. I think we\u2019ll probably be rolling some things out in the fourth quarter of this year, principally in China as a lead market, but all designed to go after early childhood development, sort of a nursery of the future, if you will, getting a lot of excitement and interest on that front. Additionally, we\u2019re doing a lot of things with the Fuhu learning platforms that we\u2019ll start to roll out little bit more this fall, on their tablet business. But we think actually have some great applications with some partners we\u2019re working on, again starting in Asia. But the early read on both is very exciting and I think are integral actually to the whole childhood development platform we\u2019re going after on Fisher-Price, principally. There is another benefit that I would highlight is that we\u2019re going to have these toys with connected homes and the nurseries, which obviously will give us a great pipeline of data that we can help to manage and mine for consumer marketing, so another key benefit to these acquisitions.","Jaime Katz","And then lastly, Kevin, I think there is a note coming due later this year, and in light of the fact that debt to cap is around 45%, I think, are you guys thinking about refinancing, letting that mature, how do you see capital allocation?","Kevin Farr","I think we\u2019ve got a strong balance sheet and adequate liquidity. So, as we look at the full year, our plan is to refinance that in the back half of the year.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Eric Handler of MKM Partners. Your line is now open.","Eric Handler","Kevin, I know you gave a little bit of color regarding gross margin. And I wonder if you could just talk a little bit again about the back half of the year. I mean it seems like you\u2019re implying a 52%-53% gross margin in the third and fourth quarters, it\u2019s been a long time since we\u2019ve seen gross margins that high. Is it just the fact that you\u2019re going to see more girls doll business, or are there other factors involved in that?","Kevin Farr","Okay, I\u2019d be happy to answer that. So, we are still targeting gross margin 50% for the year, as I said, similar to the amount that we achieved last year. And that means moderate year-over-year improvement in our second half gross margin rate versus last year; we achieved gross margins about 50%. And based upon the current spot rates and hedge rates, we believe it\u2019s achievable and well within our three to five-year historical averages. But how we achieve in 2016 will be a little bit different than how we achieved it in our historical averages, which will rely more on pricing and better mix. As we look at the second half of the year, we\u2019re going to really achieve it through the acceleration of cost of goods sold through supply chain structural changes, which don\u2019t impact our price value propositions. So, it\u2019s going to be more about accelerating cost savings on structural supply chain in the second half of the year.","Eric Handler","Okay, that\u2019s helpful.","Chris Sinclair","There will be some positive mix shifts versus the first half of the year, which start to come into effect. And I think he also pointed out; we do expect ForEx to moderate as we move into the back half. So, when you ladder those things, I think we\u2019re comfortable getting some more close to that 50% target.","Eric Handler","That\u2019s very helpful. And just as a follow-up, you pointed to contributions from Toy Box as being a key driver this year. And can you just go through again what have been some of those successes from Toy Box that have got you excited?","Richard Dickson","Toy Box is myriad of brands, as you know, certainly our license partnership brands are in there as well as the variety of other brands and properties within Mattel. Specifically, we\u2019ve had some great POS and traction on our games business. UNO continues to grow and is a legacy brand in our portfolio and the team there is doing an incredible job of keeping that brand relevant and driving unit. MEGA continues to be outstanding for us overall, had a great quarter internationally specifically as well as the U.S. And we continue to get traction both in the preschool segment as well as leveraging our own properties, American Girl, Monster High and of course as we anticipate the launch of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle movie, we think that we\u2019re going to have a great hit there. Brands like Minecraft also continue to be really terrific and the team\u2019s doing an excellent job maintaining the relevance of that brand. And brands like Dinotrux with our partnership with Dreamwork, Blaze also with Nickelodeon is doing terrific. There\u2019s a lot of great brands within Toy Box that are continuing to be nurtured and developed and are frankly shipping away at our gas but ultimately driving some great growth in their own right.","As we continue to develop the strategic partnership profile, not only will we do a continued job driving our existing but we continue to see new relationships as well as renew existing relationships. So, going forward, Cars of course 3 which we\u2019ve talked about lining up even 2018 with Toy Story and others will be revealed shortly.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Arpine Kocharian of UBS. Your line is now open.","Arpine Kocharian","Could you talk a little bit about POS for the quarter? The global POS improvement you talked about, is that adjusted for Disney, is it possible to give us at least U.S. Disney adjusted and Easter adjusted in terms of POS?","Richard Dickson","This is Richard. What we can tell you is ex Disney, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, has performed very well, up single digit increases worldwide; it\u2019s commensurate with our shipping numbers as well. Across our core brand portfolio, we see more positives than not. In fact, in cases like Hot Wheels across the board, we\u2019ve seen both shipping and POS really strong results. I mentioned Fisher-Price had a really strong quarter, both in shipping and POS; brands like Barbie of course turning the corner and gaining more and more momentum. U.S. was a strong performer; Europe is now reflecting positive POS as well as Asia and we continue to work on Latin America. And ex the Disney Princess business, we\u2019re performing quite nicely.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Tim Conder of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.","Tim Conder","Thank you. And Richard, obviously on that a little bit here, any breakdown there on Fisher-Price between U.S. and international, and then maybe the infant portion, you seem to call out but that was remaining very strong and that the infant versus the non-infant portion of Fisher-Price at POS?","Richard Dickson","Sure. I think as I mentioned across the board, particularly in international, we were really pleased with the Fisher-Price brand overall. Baby which as we mentioned is our biggest and frankly the most strategic piece of the business had a positive POS across all regions. So, we\u2019re really pleased with the response that we\u2019ve -- our child development messaging certainly has been having and also products and pricing has played a great impact in the continuation of the trend with Fisher-Price. Generally speaking, as we sort of look ahead, we continue to leverage the momentum that we currently have, especially in international markets. The strength across the Baby business will continue, there\u2019s some amplified marketing as we continue with our best possible start campaign that\u2019s gotten great traction, the continued brand evolution tied to child development is really rich with content and connectivity, as we\u2019ve said particularly in emerging markets like China. And even as we reenter the preschool learning category more aggressively with our think and learn line the Code-a-Pillar which I mentioned is a key item for us is getting a lot of attention and traction. And we anticipate that that will be just one of many early childhood development items that Fisher-Price becomes well known for. Not to belabor the point of Jonathan Adler\u2019s appointments, but I think the aesthetic piece of what he\u2019ll bring to the overall brand will be important as we move and develop the line with a bit more fashion sensibility. And of course as we mentioned, new content, new partnerships with 9 Story, DHX, all fuel that particular segment of the brand. So, we\u2019re confident in our strategic path going forward and certainly early reads are suggesting we\u2019re heading in the right direction.","Tim Conder","So it would be fair to say that Fisher-Price is going to be more of an early childhood development versus -- and maybe the preschool part will be somewhat deemphasized on a relative historical basis?","Chris Sinclair","I wouldn\u2019t characterize it quite like that. I would say that we\u2019re going to put a lot more emphasis on the early child development and the nursery of the future, but clearly the rest of the line will continue to get plenty of focus.","Tim Conder","Okay. And one maybe housekeeping item here, the currency impact from Venezuela, was that in or not in the gross margin? I know you called it out on the EPS side and on the adjusted basis, but on a gross margin basis; was that included in your gross margin number.","Kevin Farr","No, that was in other non-operating losses.","Tim Conder","Okay. And then, from an inventory perspective, you called out Monster High, your plan to hopefully exit the year with that stabilized that will still little bit challenge than in the Latin America as a whole. Any pockets of inventory brand wise, geographic wise; you exited the third quarter of last year, you felt good on a global basis and that really showed up in Q4. So, how is that now here in the off season so to speak?","Richard Dickson","I think we made progress in the only place that we had overhang in the fourth quarter which is Brazil. We made good progress in the first quarter; we\u2019re still bit less but we\u2019ll be through that by the time we get to the important second half of the year.","Chris Sinclair","We\u2019re actually I think in very good shape, Tim, on inventory at this point.","Tim Conder","And American Girl, gentlemen, is that do you feel good where that is? I know you\u2019ve got a lot of new stuff coming in the back half of the year.","Richard Dickson","Yes. I think as we mentioned, we isolated the brand with a diagnosis that we\u2019ve now started to execute against. First half, we anticipated would be challenging as we redo some pricing strategy, evaluate distribution and reengage with some new content, all of which will be executed and revealed in the back half. We\u2019re excited about the programs that we have. I think our partnership that we\u2019ve announced with Amazon is going to bring new content connectivity to the consumer and reach a broader base consumer. And I think some of the work that the team is doing there will show up on the scoreboard, of course in the second half. So, we\u2019re confident with our plans there.","Kevin Farr","Yes. And just adding to the retail inventory answer, I think what Chris indicated is we\u2019re much better shaped. And I think on a year-over-year basis that\u2019s particularly true in Europe.","Tim Conder","And lastly, Kevin, just a clarification on the hedging; you guys have called out the very favorable hedging that you had in \u201815. How is the cadence of that; should we think about -- so the FX a bit more favorable in the back half of the year just from where the rates are? But where did you have the best hedges on I guess would create the most difficult comparisons in \u201815?","Kevin Farr","Yes, I think that was really in the first-half of the year. As I said in the first-half of the year, the year-over-year gross margin rate was favorably impacted by 100 basis points, where in the second half of the year, it was unfavorable by 200 basis points.","Tim Conder","200, okay, you did mention it. My apologies there.","Chris Sinclair","Tim, most of that was in the euro by the way.","Kevin Farr","Right.","Chris Sinclair","That was step down this year.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jim Chartier of Monness Crespi Hardt. Your line is now open.","Jim Chartier","Thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to circle back on the gross margin, Kevin. Looking at the full year outlook, 125 million to 135 million of cost savings and $46 million realized in first quarter. It looks like the rest of the year, the cost saving would have a smaller impact as a percentage of sales on margins. So, is there more than just the funding our future cost savings embedded in the improvement in second half gross margins? You talked about some structural changes there.","Kevin Farr","Yes. I think as we said, our funding our future is part of what we\u2019re doing, we\u2019re on track to deliver at the high end of the range but we have incremental programs around structural cost savings related to cost of goods sold as well as SG&A that will be in excess of what the funding our future is. So, as we look at the cadence of the year, the inventory that we\u2019re selling in the first quarter we produced last year. As I said in the call earlier that as we ramp up our seasonal production in second quarter and get peak production in the third quarter, we should see more flow through from the structural savings in the second half of the year and that will help us, as I said to improve our year-over-year gross margins in second half of the year, along with better mix and less impact to foreign exchange in the second half of the year.","Jim Chartier","And then just wanted to clarify, Fuhu and Sproutling acquisitions, will they be mutual to EPS this year and then accretive next year; is that the plan?","Kevin Farr","Yes. So, overall, we should be adding top line revenues for the year and we are adding SG&A. But from a perspective of looking at those operations, we expect them to be breakeven for this year and then hopefully accretive next year.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Gerrick Johnson of BMO. Your line is now open.","Gerrick Johnson","Could we talk about Barbie for a second? The disconnect between U.S. up 11% and international down 7% and local. We haven\u2019t had a positive quarter in Barbie internationally since 2013. So, what\u2019s there; toys are doing well here or not out there?","Richard Dickson","I think we\u2019ve always watched them and certainly we have enough history with this brand. North America tends to lead the brand\u2019s narrative, both in messaging and in products and activity as well as retail execution. It tends to be part of the history of the brand. And as we see North America really start to get traction and connectivity, both at retail execution and with consumers, those programs take shape as the tail, if you will, in the international market a bit later. When you digest or at least dissect the international market, there is developing markets, there is developed markets, there is a variety of different things that go into the play of the brand. But overall, what we\u2019re seeing now is Europe getting traction on POS with Barbie; Asia also getting traction on POS Barbie. Latin America is still catching up. We have some work to do in Latin America. But overall, we\u2019re seeing great connectivity. Frankly, the successful campaign that we ran here, the You Can Be Anything campaign that was wildly acclaimed, didn\u2019t get executed throughout international. So that\u2019s still new in some cases and rolling out as we see. Some of the new product that we launched here in the U.S. is also being executed later in certain markets. Our DVD calendar in terms of distribution and marketing is also slightly different in international markets. So, I think overall, I would take a look at the Domino of the business in North America as the least indicator of where the brand should be going could be going. And so far the indications here are very good and the tail and the context of international is catching up.","Gerrick Johnson","So, in what markets where the new Fashionista Barbie dolls launched, was it U.S. and what the markets are those dolls currently in?","Richard Dickson","They\u2019re currently rolling out now. In fact, they\u2019re just hitting shelves in Europe more significantly than other markets. As you look at the Barbie brand, as you know, we have segmentation strategy. So, there is variety of different segments to the brand. There is an ITB segment, there is fairy segment, there is entertainment, there is Fashionista, there is key items. And as we execute against the brand around the world, different countries dial up or down different segments. So, difficult to have a peanut butter approach to the answer but what I would tell you is that the Fashionista collection is rolling out more aggressively in Europe; it will hit Asia shortly, in certain markets in Asia and Latin America probably in the second half of the year.","Gerrick Johnson","Okay. And one more on dolls, the DC Super Hero Girls, are those in any market internationally, are they only in target here in the U.S.?","Richard Dickson","Only in target here in the U.S. and those also will be rolling out the back half.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Taposh Bari of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Taposh Bari","I wanted to ask a question on sales in the quarter versus your expectations. It sounds like you\u2019re pretty pleased with the underlying sales momentum despite the fact that you\u2019ve lost in the Disney piece and the fact that that impacted proportionally large in the quarter. So, can you give us a sense for how POS and\/or shipments realized versus your expectations and if Easter has any effect on the reported numbers?","Chris Sinclair","Look, we actually normalize Easter. So, it\u2019s important to understand, we took out any of that effect. And so, the numbers you\u2019re seeing I think are fairly pure as you would look at it. I would say overall, we\u2019re actually very enthused by the outcome of the first quarter. I think we actually probably exceeded a little bit what we had hoped to do. And I think it was very broad-based which was encouraging and not just the core brands but the Toy Box kicked in, in a lot of meaningful ways. So, I think as we try to indicate, we felt we\u2019re well positioned for what we\u2019ve been guiding for the full year. And I think this is just a good early start. But again broad based and both shopping and POS.","Taposh Bari","And just a follow-up on both the entertainment and the construction segment lines, you have some big increase there, presumably due to some of these licensed properties that you\u2019re taking on this year. Trying to get a better sense for if there was anything unique to the first quarter given that you\u2019re probably still in the channel for some of these product lines. In another words, should we expect to see continued robust growth rates in those segments throughout the year especially as you roll out the DC Super Hero lines and also enter the Ninja Turtles of the optical window?","Richard Dickson","Well, I think specifically from MEGA, we, as I mentioned, introduced some of our brands into the construction category. American Girl has been a resounding success out of the gate; Monster High also connecting very well in construction; and of course Teenage Ninja Turtles is launching and the movie has started and we\u2019re relatively pleased with that progress. And as you know, the preschool segment of MEGA is robust and doing well. So, we anticipate that that will get better and better, as we execute against those properties and introduce others as time moves on. So, I think overall in general, we\u2019re really pleased with where we\u2019re moving and I think it\u2019s just going to continue momentum.","Chris Sinclair","The other thing I would add on MEGA is a lot of that growth also came internationally. So, it\u2019s not structurally tied to either entertainment property or one of our own brands per structure, it\u2019s we\u2019re expanding, we\u2019re getting distribution, we\u2019re getting better execution against it.","Taposh Bari","And one last one; last year in 2015 is the year where you\u2019re really increasing spending in terms of supporting the trade. As you think about 2016, it looks like advertising was down. Your sales adjustments were flat year-over-year even though you\u2019re guiding for it to be up. Help us better understand how you\u2019re thinking about supporting the trade in 2016? Thanks.","Kevin Farr","I\u2019ll just talk about it from a financial perspective and then Richard can talk about it from more on execution. But I think as we did our 2016 outlook, we really said we reinstated our sales adjustment from a planning perspective to be at the higher rate that we experienced in 2014. So, we would make sure that we would drive POS this year. Whether we spend that or not will depend upon how our POS performs in the second half of the year, but that\u2019s the way we put the financial plan together.","Richard Dickson","And speaking specifically on behalf of the retail execution, we continue to have those reserves and be ready to drive various different forms of execution to ensure retail success, whether or not those application is used or not. And then on the overall advertising side, we continue to get much more intelligent in the context of what works and what doesn\u2019t in our media spend and that will continue to evolve. So, much of our advertising moves around and gets redeployed based on what we believe is going to have better connectivity. And as you know that\u2019s a moving target as our consumer constantly changes and new forms of connectivity are introduced constantly. So we are very much on top of that as well.","Kevin Farr","And I think going back to our plan, we also planned advertising to be less, getting closer to the midpoint of our 11% to 13% range, but also if we need to drive POS, then we will invest what\u2019s necessary in advertising to do that.","Taposh Bari","Thanks, and all the best.","Chris Sinclair","Okay, Taposh.","Taposh Bari","Were you going to say something, Chris?","Chris Sinclair","No, I was just going to say the one thing to keep in mind on advertising, most of the scale back is in what we would call non-working. So, the actual impact of advertising growing against the consumer is not being reduced, it\u2019s more effectively deployed but it\u2019s the non-working production stuff that we\u2019ve been shaving.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Linda Bolton-Weiser of B. Riley. Your line is now open.","Linda Bolton-Weiser","Just to circle back once more on Barbie, again on that international decline in the Barbie shipments in constant currency. When Richard was talking about it, he said that Barbie was I think he used words gaining traction or something in Europe and Asia. So, does that mean improving but still down POS and that down POS correlates to the down shipments or do we still have like some kind of inventory problem in the channel? So in other words, POS is actually growing but you still have inventory too high in certain markets. Can you just explain a little bit more?","Richard Dickson","Sure, Linda. Let me be more specific. The POS momentum in Barbie is real in the international marketplace, specifically in Europe and in Asia. Now, it varies by country. But overall, we\u2019re seeing great positive traction on POS, some in the lower single digits and some in the higher but generally speaking, gaining more and more momentum. We continue to look at Latin America to some extent catching up, there is some programs that we\u2019re launching there and some various different challenges that we\u2019ve had in that marketplace, but it is moving along, it\u2019s a smaller percentage of the total. But in general, we\u2019re seeing more green shoots with Barbie across the world.","Chris Sinclair","And final point, there is no inventory issue, if that was your other question, Linda.","Linda Bolton-Weiser","Okay. So then, I mean we should start to see that shipment pattern improve for the international piece of Barbie it sounds like?","Chris Sinclair","We would expect so.","Richard Dickson","Yes.","Linda Bolton-Weiser","And then can you just clarify how much of the Batman versus Superman products shipped in the first quarter, or is it a significant bigger shipment in the second quarter?","Richard Dickson","No, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s significantly bigger. I think there will be -- no, because we filled the shelves up in the first and then we\u2019re continuing to restock in the second and introduce some new items. So, it isn\u2019t going to be significantly bigger, no.","Linda Bolton-Weiser","And then finally, Kevin, on the cash flow performance in the quarter, you mentioned that working capital, use some more cash than last year. What are your thoughts on that for the full year? Are you thinking working capital could be a modest source or use of cash?","Kevin Farr","Look, I think what we said when we did the outlook is that in a challenging year, we delivered strong cash flow in 2015 and we expect cash flow to be a little bit better in 2016. And we\u2019re still focused on tightly managing working capital. And I think there is an opportunity for us to as we exit the year to tightly manage inventories; they\u2019re little bit higher than our historical rates. And I think through better information technology better planning process and trying to shorten lead times, we think there is an opportunity to exit the year with working capital being positive.","Linda Bolton-Weiser","Okay, that\u2019s it for me. Thank you.","Martin Gilkes","Operator, I think we have time for one final question.","Operator","Great, thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian of Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Greg Badishkanian","So, with the expected second half acceleration in sales, what do you think that biggest driver will be or is it just going to be across multiple brands?","Richard Dickson","Greg, we\u2019ve described our plan without a silver bullet. So, I mean a collection of core brand momentum I think will contribute to the momentum. And we\u2019ve been pleasantly surprised, as I mentioned with a lot of the Toy Box initiatives, some of these smaller brands are really showing up on the scoreboard and incrementing our expectations. But as we said, Hot Wheels, Barbie, Fischer-Price, Thomas specially are continuing to deliver and certainly will have a strong back half, as planned. And then as we drive some of our entertainment relationships that are incremental like Warner Bros that will drive momentum. MEGA continues to gain traction. And I think as you look at our brands in the construction space, it\u2019s all very new business for us and we\u2019re excited with that continuing to build in the construction category, which is as you know is a successful growing category in the industry.","And then as a verity of other new things that we\u2019re excited to introduce, Mixie Qs is a new brand for us that is going to be launching to the Toy Box. And innovative items like the [indiscernible] which we introduced at Toy Fair is getting a lot of traction and interest and symbolizes the innovation and invention aspect that we\u2019re driving as part of our new culture. So, we really got all our ducks in a row. And now as I mentioned, it\u2019s really about the execution of it mattering more.","Greg Badishkanian","So, you would expect let\u2019s say maybe the third quarter to start seeing positive year-over-year growth, if I were to put words in your mouth or do you think will be the fourth quarter?","Chris Sinclair","I don\u2019t think that Greg we\u2019ve given any guidance; we sort of told you where we think we\u2019ll be for the year which is fairly flat on a constant currency, so that would be a good model for you to work with.","Martin Gilkes","Thanks everyone.

[Operator Instructions] Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Drew Vollero, Senior Vice President of Corporate Strategy and Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Drew Vollero","Thanks, Latoya. As you know, this morning, we reported Mattel's third quarter financial results. We provided you with a slide presentation to help guide our discussion today. The slide presentation and the information required by Regulation G regarding non-GAAP financial measures is available on the Investors and Media section of our corporate website, corporate.mattel.com.","In a few minutes, Bryan Stockton, Mattel's CEO; and Kevin Farr, Mattel's CFO, will provide comments on the results, and the call will be opened for your questions.","Certain statements made during the call may include forward-looking statements relating to the future performance of our overall business, brands and product lines. These statements are based on currently available information, and they're subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties, which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. We describe some of these uncertainties in the Risk Factors section of our 2011 annual report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and in other filings we make with the SEC from time to time, as well as in other public statements. Mattel does not update forward-looking statements and expressly disclaims any obligation to do so.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bryan.","Bryan G. Stockton","Thank you, Drew, and good day, everyone. When I ended last quarter's call, I said the second half of the year was all about executing, as we transition from preseason to the season. And we are now officially in the season. The global economy is still challenged. It's driving volatility in both input cost and currencies, and is contributing to a continuation of the cautious global retail environment.","That said, I am very pleased with the third quarter results. The quarterly results reflect our success in building momentum in the marketplace through share gains and solid sales across our portfolio of brands and countries. Worldwide revenues were up 4% including a 4% unfavorable impact from currency, while operating income grew 23%.","Let me touch briefly on a couple of the key drivers. We experienced continuing global momentum in most of our core brands, and I want to give a special callout to American Girl Brands which grew 16% for the quarter due to strong execution of McKenna, the new Girl of the Year, as well as solid performance at retail and in our online Direct-to-Consumer business.","Our Monster High brand also performed particularly well in the quarter. The franchise continues to resonate strongly with our consumers, and as a result, the dolls are now featured on many must-have toy lists.","We also experienced growth across all of our regions, including solid growth in North America. Although currency fluctuation continues to be a major challenge in 2012, when you exclude the impact of currency, our 3 major regions, Europe, Latin America and Asia, each grew revenues in the quarter.","Our global POS was consistent with our shipments. In addition, we gained share in both the U.S. and Euro 5 toy markets through August versus last year, according to NPD, as our POS continues to outpace the overall toy market in each of those regions.  We also experienced NPD share gains across a number of our key brands.","Let's go into a little more detail on our core brands.  Barbie performed well, considering the incredible momentum of Monster High, as well as the introduction of our new fashion doll line for the fifth Disney Pixar movie, Brave. Not only did Barbie grow NPD share in toys, we continued to build the brand outside of the toy aisle. For example, the release of the brand's 24th direct to DVD movie, Princess and the Popstar, is off to a great start. Our consumer products licensing team has worked closely with our retail partners to create and feature compelling fashions in the strategically important apparel category.","With the support of the overarching brand campaign, See What Happens When You Play with Barbie, the brand has established placement with apparel with retailers around the world, reaching more than 10,000 outlets.","Monster High continues to fire on all cylinders. It is the #2 selling fashion doll property in both the U.S. and the Euro 5 toy markets through August, according to NPD. Recently in the U.S., Monster High became a top 10 property among all toys, when ranked by dollar volume. This now gives Mattel 6 of the top 10 properties in the U.S. toy industry through August.","Monster High just released its first-ever DVD movie, Ghouls Rule!, through our partnership with the Universal Studios. We're also set to release a second console game this November for multiple platforms, including DS, 3DS and Wii.","Revenues for Hot Wheels grew double digits in North America in the quarter, driven by stronger in-store merchandising and our new approach to advertising and promotion. This year, the North America division leveraged a great idea that our Mexico and Australia teams had successfully implemented. The campaign called Collect and Compete showed boys a whole new way to play with Hot Wheels Cars, and it's working.","The highly effective Collect and Compete campaign has created positive momentum, not only for the basic car business, but for the overall brand as well.  This is just one example of how our new structure provides increased opportunity for best practice sharing across all of our subsidiaries, including the U.S.","We continue to believe that Fisher-Price is one of Mattel's best growth opportunities. As we mentioned before, Fisher-Price is one of the few Mattel Brands where international sales are less than 50% of total brand revenues.","In the quarter, we made good progress in a few strategic areas, mainly with our International business and our consumer messaging. For the quarter, the International business grew substantially, up 8%. On the consumer front, Fisher-Price is really focused on connecting with today's mom through its Joy of Learning campaign.","We recently relaunched the U.S. website, and I've seen a nice bump in the number of visitors. International versions of the website have been rolled out to 32 different markets and 27 languages. Our award-winning television advertising is now on its second season in the U.S., and it will be launched this year in many markets across the world.  Our new global packaging, which will be launched in the spring of 2013, will help reinforce the key Joy of Learning messages. I am confident that the foundation of the turnaround is starting to take shape as we are seeing positive momentum in Core Fisher-Price.","We're also pleased with the strategic progress of the Fisher-Price Friends business. Approximately half of Fisher-Price Friends revenue is now generated by Mattel-owned intellectual properties like Thomas & Friends.  These brands lay a strong foundation of evergreen properties, which helps to balance our portfolio. Additionally, we continue to build out our Friends portfolio by having strong relationships with robust properties such as Dora the Explorer from Nickelodeon and Jake and the Never Land Pirates from Disney.","To that point, we've also made substantial progress on the integration of HIT Entertainment. We are well positioned and ready to launch our new Thomas wood line for a 2013 global rollout. And what is really exciting is that for the first time in recent history, one company, Mattel, will be managing the entire toy and content portfolio for the brand.","Thomas & Friends launched its fall entertainment tentpole, Blue Mountain Mystery, in September with strong support at retail. We recently wrapped up the 17th consecutive year of our national Day Out With Thomas tour, which reached nearly 1 million consumers. And the 17th television series is well on its way. In fact, Thomas & Friends is currently airing in the U.S. on PBS KIDS and was rated the #1 show for kids ages 2 to 5 in the month of August.","As I mentioned earlier, American Girl had a spectacular quarter. The Miami store opened 2 weeks ago, joining St. Louis and Houston, which opened earlier in the year. To date, these store openings had been extremely strong. We have a good momentum heading into the peak season, and you'll begin to see television advertising for the brand, which builds on our successful test of TV commercials last year.","Additionally, we continue to reap the benefits of our credo, partner with the best and be the best partner. In the quarter, we experienced growth across a number of our licensed entertainment brands, Disney with the new movie, Brave; Warner Bros.' Batman the Dark Knight Rises; Disney's new Jake and the Never Land Pirates; and of course, WWE.","Looking beyond revenue, Mattel achieved solid overall third quarter results, as we continue to complement our focus on brand building with a disciplined approach that emphasizes gross margins, tightly managing costs and reinvesting in growth initiatives.","We continue to work very hard to manage our overall basket of costs, including commodities, currency and labor, through manufacturing efficiency programs and Operational Excellence 2.0 initiatives. And we look to optimize our sales mix to deliver gross margins consistent with our expectations.  We remain on track to deliver our Operational Excellence 2.0 savings target of $175 million.","As we move into the final quarter of the year, we know that retailers will continue to manage inventories tightly as they execute their holiday season strategies. That said, in the U.S., some retailers have started their layaway programs and other toy promotions earlier in the year, no doubt in part to help consumers ensure access to hot toys.","Overall, our belief is this is positive for the toy industry, particularly higher-priced toy items, and may help drive incremental traffic. We have worked hard to partner with retailers on these and other initiatives. I believe we're well positioned to deliver the must-have brands and toys.","The key dynamic that remains consistent is retailers continue to buy what is selling. With retail support programs in place, we feel good that inventory levels, both at Mattel and at our retail partners, position us well for success in the holiday season.","So as we continue to execute the last 12 weeks of the year, we have the brands of momentum: Barbie, Monster High, Hot Wheels, Fisher-Price, Thomas & Friends and American Girl. We also have the evergreen licenses with scale such as Cars, Disney Princess and WWE. We have sales momentum in key countries and regions, and we are well aligned with customer plans and promotions.","As we are keen on saying at Mattel, there will be a Christmas. It will come on or around December 25, and I am confident there would be more Mattel toys under the tree than any other toy company in the world.","And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Mattel's CFO, Kevin Farr.","Kevin M. Farr","Thank you, Bryan, and good day, everyone. As you know, execution is critical in this toy business. And as you can see from our third quarter performance, Mattel continues to execute well.","While there are many ways to measure our performance to-date, the most encompassing measure may be to look at the bottom line. Year-to-date, our net income is 18% higher than last year. Moreover, our operating profit is up 19%, and our operating margins have expanded 230 basis points, which was driven by revenue gains and expansion of gross margins.","As we shared with you, our goal has been to move up higher in our targeted range of 15% to 20% operating profit, and we are well positioned to do that in 2012.","Now let me touch briefly on a few of the key drivers for the quarter. Even with significant currency headwinds, we were able to grow our revenues 4% in the quarter.  Global execution at retail has been very strong, with each region of the world growing sales in the quarter substantially in local currencies. And all but one grew after considering the negative impact of foreign currency exchange.","Execution across our brand and product portfolios was strong as well. We continue to see outstanding performances with our new Monster High franchise. And we're happy with the results of Fisher-Price where we saw improvement at core business, especially internationally, and excellent results in our Friends business, which includes our newly acquired brand, Thomas & Friends.  Finally, American Girl continues to grow across its product portfolio and range of distribution channels.","Although our gross margin expanded nicely in the quarter, about 1\/3 of the improvement was related to foreign exchange. We benefit from the positive comparison to last year's rapid appreciation of the U.S. dollar in late September of 2012, which negatively impacted 2011 third quarter gross margins by 180 basis points.","Product mix was another significant reason for our gross margin improvement, with a shift towards our owned intellectual properties, particularly in dolls. Strong performance in the quarter for Monster High and American Girl, as well as the addition of the HIT licensing business, were key drivers of improved product mix.","Another significant factor in the improvement in gross margin was better-than-expected results from our O.E. 2.0 cost savings programs and manufacturing efficiency programs through the use of lean principles in our design and manufacturing process and the implementation of more automation in manufacturing, pricing actions that were effective January 1, 2012, partially offset by increased input costs, which were less volatile than in prior years.","Our SG&A expenses met expectations, as we integrate the new HIT organization and invest in strategic growth initiatives. Our Global Cost Leadership and O.E. 2.0 savings programs have generated about $225 million in sustainable SG&A gross savings since 2008, part of which we've reinvested in the business to drive the results you see in this quarter.","Let me touch on a couple of the investments made today. You see the double-digit sales growth that American Girl has posted in the quarter. Our investment in retail expansion continued to pay big dividends, particularly this year as our Houston, Miami and St. Louis stores are enjoying outstanding opening results.","On the information technology front, we're investing in upgrading American Girl's e-commerce infrastructure to support further growth and leverage it to support our other core brands.  This technology should allow us to better align with how consumers are buying products today while improving Mattel's overall global capabilities to market digitally to our consumers and customers.","Also, our investments in the expansion of fashion doll client capacity have been critical to meet the growing global demand for Barbie, Monster High and Disney Princess. And as I said previously, certainly, this growth of dolls and our product mix continue to have the additional benefit of helping drive gross and operating margin expansion.","We're also investing in new product life cycle management system to improve our design, development and manufacturing processes, which will provide better collaboration between functions and greater cost transparency.  When fully implemented, this system should help us to continue to deliver against our gross margin target by improving enhancing toy value and potentially help offset future input cost increases.","As you know, our 2 key priorities in 2012 are the successful transition to our new North American division structure and the integration of HIT Entertainment. And both priorities continue to exceed our expectations.  Let me touch briefly on both.","The North America division continues to deepen its relationships with its retail partners, as well as both the [indiscernible] retail execution. We are seeing this evidenced by our improving consumer takeaway trends in the quarter, as well as the increased NPD share in the U.S. across a number of our key categories.","Next, the integration of HIT continues to progress as planned, and we're already working to reap the benefits of adding its organization and core competencies in licensing and content development to Mattel. As we've previously said, growing the Thomas brand around the world is a key focus for us. And in the quarter, Thomas shipments grew double digits outside the U.S, so we're starting to get good global traction here.","So to summarize, as we enter the fourth quarter, we're in a good position to deliver another year of solid performance in 2012. That said, we still have a lot of work in front of us and as Bryan mentioned, we need to continue to execute well in the fourth quarter to keep the momentum going.","Now let's focus on where we've been, specifically the third quarter results in the slide deck. Starting on Page 4 of the slide deck, you can see that our worldwide gross sales are up 4% for the quarter, with growth coming in both our North American and International regions.","Based on the latest NPD data, we continue to gain category share in both the U.S. and the Euro 5.  Despite retail cautiousness and a continued focus on inventory management, we're seeing better alignment of shipping, consumer takeaway and retail inventories.  And we are comfortable with the current state of both our inventories and those of our retail partners as we enter the all-important holiday season.","Turning to Page 5 of the slide presentation, you can see sales by brand. Worldwide sales for Mattel's Girls & Boys Brands were up 3% for the quarter, despite a moderate impact of currency exchange and a tough Cars 2 comparison. Our fashion doll business did extremely well driven by significant growth in Monster High and Disney Princesses. We also saw growth in our core Barbie and Hot Wheels brands, excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange.  And we continue to see good results in our evergreen Batman and WWE properties.","Worldwide Fisher-Price sales were up 6% for the quarter, aided by the addition of HIT and good performances in Disney properties. We're also very encouraged to see solid results in categories where we're putting additional focus, including our infant and playset categories.","American Girl delivered another strong results for the quarter, with sales up 16%. Our Girl of the Year, McKenna, is performing extremely well as did the My American Girl line.  And we continue to see good momentum in our retail operations, especially with our new store openings.","On Page 6, we highlight the performance of our North American region, which includes American Girl in our North American division, which consists of operations for the U.S. and Canada. Overall sales for the region were up 6%, which is a solid result and builds on the strong 6% growth in the third quarter last year.","Our International business, as seen on Page 7, continues to show strength, growing 2% in the quarter despite a 9 percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange. We remain very encouraged with our performance in Europe, where revenues were up 3% despite a 7% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange.  In Latin America, revenues were down 1%, including a 11 percentage point unfavorable impact from currency, with strong growth in local currency across the entire region. And Asia Pacific revenues were up 10%, including a 3 percentage point unfavorable impact with currency, with growth in China, India and Australia.","Now let's review the P&L, starting off on Page 8 of the slide presentation. Gross margin for the quarter were 53.7%, 590 basis points higher than last year. Key drivers were favorable foreign exchange, favorable product mix, including the HIT licensing business, manufacturing efficiency programs and O.E. 2.0 cost savings and price increases, partially offset by increased input cost.","On Page 9, selling, general and administrative expenses increased approximately $55 million to $393 million. Higher incentive and equity compensation accruals and ongoing HIT organization and acquisition-related costs drove over $0.75 increase in SG&A in the third quarter.","As you know in Mattel, short-term and long-term compensation is based on pay-for-performance, which aligns with shareholder interest. Consistent with pay-for-performance, the increase in incentive accruals are directly tied to the improved year-to-date performance as compared to last year.","As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expense was 18.9%, up 200 basis points compared to the prior year's rate of 16.9%.  Excluding HIT acquisition and integration cost and HIT's ongoing SG&A, Mattel's SG&A is up about 3% year-to-date in absolute dollars.","Page 10 of the presentation summarized the performance of our 2-year Global Cost Leadership initiative and continuing efforts on our ongoing Operational Excellence 2.0 program. We have delivered incremental Operational Excellence 2.0 gross savings of $20 million in the quarter.  And I think we've got a good shot at exceeding our $175 million target of cumulative savings by the end of 2012.","Turning to Page 11, operating income in the third quarter was $487.4 million or 23.5% of net sales, up 360 basis points compared with last year's third quarter.  The increase in operating income was driven by solid sales growth and the expansion of gross margins, partially offset by higher SG&A.","Turning to Page 12, earnings per share for the quarter were $1.04, driven by improved operating income that was partially offset by higher interest expense and share count.  We continue to expect that the HIT acquisition should not have a material impact on earnings per share in 2012 but should be accretive to our business going forward.","Page 13 outlines both the estimated integration and amortization cost of HIT. For the quarter, acquisition and integration expenses were $3 million and should total between $25 million and $30 million for the year. These expenses include acquisition fees, consulting fees, severance and IT infrastructure costs.  In addition, we also incurred about $1 million in expenses related to amortization of intangibles. For the year, these expenses should be about $5 million to $6 million.","As you can see on Page 14, for the first 9 months of the year, cash flow used for operations was $101 million compared to the $322 million last year. The decrease was driven primarily by higher net income and lower capital -- working capital usage.  Year-to-date, capital expenditures were $156 million -- $157 million, up $12 million from the last year. For the year, we expect to spend about $215 million to $225 million in capital.","So to recap, cash flow for the first 9 months of the year, we increased capital deployment for the acquisition of HIT Entertainment and our higher quarterly dividend payments, which were partially offset by the improvement in operating cash flow, lower share repurchases and lower debt repayments.","As a result, our cash on hand at the end of the first 9 months was $282 million, up $28 million from the prior year. Today, we announced our fourth quarter dividend of $0.31 per share, reflecting the annualized dividend of $1.24 per share, which represents a 35% increase to our 2011 annualized dividend of $0.92.","We remain committed to our capital deployment strategy to maintain $800 million to $1 billion in year-end cash, to maintain a year-end debt-to-total-capital ratio of about 35% and to return excess fund to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","In 2012, we expect to end the year with cash and debt levels consistent with our capital framework.  And we'll continue to manage excess cash appropriately and look to deploy opportunistically through dividends, targeted acquisitions and share repurchases over time.","In summary, we're pleased with our solid third quarter performance, we are well positioned for success this holiday season and finally, we recognize that we have more execution work to do in the fourth quarter to deliver another solid year of financial performance. That concludes my review of the financial results. Now I'd like to open the call to questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Jaime Katz of Morningstar.","Jaime M. Katz - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Can you guys talk a little bit about the data points that was in your press release on accounts receivable days outstanding? It looks like it went a little bit higher, and I was just curious if there were any terms from the retailers that have changed and if that would be a more permanent thing going forward?","Kevin M. Farr","No, I don't think there's any change. I think the account receivable increased primarily due to the timing of sales volumes that have happened later in the quarter.","Jaime M. Katz - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, any thoughts on price increases in the future? I know you guys don't want to gouge anybody. But anything for the upcoming 2013 year? And maybe if there are any pricing increases that you guys are thinking of passing through?","Kevin M. Farr","Yes. I think, yes, we continue to operate in an inflationary environment with a lot of volatility as the economy slowly recovers and input costs continue to rise. There are goals to offset as much of the increase in input costs that we can through a continued focus on cost efficiency programs. And as you know, our last leverage to take pricing actions to sustain gross margins of about 50%. And our customers are in right now to see our 2013 products so it's too early to really talk about 2013 pricing actions.","Operator","The next question is from Michael Kelter of Goldman Sachs.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask just broadly about the toy industry, which is off 5% to 10% year-to-date. You guys are outperforming by a mile. But as a leader in the industry, I just really look to get your take on why the industry weakness is as pronounced as it is and whether you think it will persist?","Bryan G. Stockton","We're still very positive about the toy industry. As we look at data sources, for example, like Euromonitor, they continue to forecast the toy category growth globally of, I think, it's around 6%. The numbers in the U.S. had been a little weaker than probably anyone would like this year. But as you recall, the U.S. is only about 1\/3 of the global toy business. And when you peel the layers of the onion back on the U.S. business, the softness is really in categories where you can argue there has not been as much innovation as there had been in others. For example, the categories in which we compete primarily are outperforming the industry on average. So we're still positive that when there's innovation, this industry can grow, particularly here in the U.S. As you look at Europe, frankly, we're quite pleased with the toy business in Europe. It's down only about 1%, and Europe, as you know, has a very challenging economic environment. Outside of Europe, as we look at the information that we get with our boots on the ground all over the world, we see growth in Eastern Europe, Latin America and Asia. And then I guess, finally, this is more of a short-term comment than a longer term strategic comment that we've had customers here last week and this week to talk about what's happening this year and start planning for next Christmas, believe it or not. And our customers continue to have we think a positive outlook not only for this year but for the future as well.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And, you mentioned that some of the international regions, maybe you could talk about not just sort of the absolute numbers of toy demand but maybe the derivative, the direction of toy demand going around the world, Europe versus Latin America versus Asia, given the recent macro slowdown? It's -- something that\u2019s obviously not showed up in your results to date but might it in the Christmas quarter? Or do you expect continued strength\u2026","Bryan G. Stockton","As we look out for this year based on the promotional plans and merchandising plans that we have with our customers and, I would say, the positive outlook our customers have, we, as we say, there will be a Christmas this year. As you look out and sort of take the tour around the globe, our customers in Eastern Europe still look forward to continued category growth. In Latin America, that's a basket of countries, and every year, some countries are slowing down, some are speeding up. Our businesses continue to be robust in Latin America. Same thing in Asia. And I think one of the things as it relates to Mattel is when we look at the -- either the development of the category or the development of our market share, our market shares for example in Western Europe are still quite low. There are only about 10%, and that's about half of what we are here in the U.S. So we look to both the trajectory of the category and our ability to try to grow our market share as -- category share as measured by NPD or other sources. So that's why we're still bullish on toys.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then, one last one. The gross margin numbers were fantastic, and you mentioned that ForEx was a part of that. But even if you adjust for the ForEx, it seems like the underlying run rate post the HIT deal and O.E. savings is above the 50%, which is your long-term guidance. So I guess, now that you're solidly above that 50% line, what's holding you back from raising that prior guidance?","Kevin M. Farr","Yes, I think as we look at the future, I think over the long term, we believe that targeting gross margin of 50% is the right approach to managing our business. But when we look at our P&L on an annual basis, we focus on 2 key goals: growing operating income by 6% to 8%, which is consistent with delivering top third to top quartile performance, and sequentially improving our operating margins consistent with our targeted range of 15% to 20%. As we develop our annual financial plan, we balance several levers: sales growth, gross margins, advertising, SG&A and investments. Our goal is to deliver improved operating margins while achieving 6% to 8% growth in operating profits. And gross margin is an important element in that equation. This approach aligns with our goal of consistently delivering top third to top quartile total shareholder returns.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So what would make you reevaluate the gross margin guidance?","Kevin M. Farr","Well, again, I think we look at it on an annual basis. Over the long-term, we look at the fact that we think 50% is the right approach to managing our business. But we have opportunities to grow our margins. We've got a lot of moving pieces with respect to it. I see opportunities to grow margins through our HIT licensing business and our overall Licensing business for core brands, as well as continued growth in Barbie, Monster High and American Girl. All of which should have a positive impact on our gross margins. But we also have a great opportunity to grow Fisher-Price on a global basis since it's underdeveloped outside the U.S. And this will put pressure on our margins. So Michael, looking forward, it's always a challenge to predict margins since there's a lot of moving pieces like forecasting sales mix, as well as market-based items like foreign exchange and input costs which have been volatile over the last several years. So again, I would focus in on we manage our P&L on an annual basis with a key focus on 2 goals: As I said, growing operating income by 6% to 8%, which is consistent with delivering top third to top quartile performance; and sequentially, improving our operating margins consistent with our targeted range of 15% to 20%. And we look at all the levers in the P&L really to deliver that with a goal of delivering 6% to 8% in operating profits. And this aligns with our overall goal of really delivering top third to top quartile TSR.","Operator","The next question is from Jason -- I'm sorry, James Hardiman of Longbow Research.","Phil Anderson - Longbow Research LLC","Yes, this is Phil Anderson for James. Just looking at the Barbie results, I know things were up excluding the currency drag there. But it looks like it was a difficult comp. Just wondering if you can kind of refresh our memories on why things were up so much in the third quarter last year? And then, maybe talk about what your expectations for that business are in the holiday season here?","Bryan G. Stockton","We're feeling actually quite positive about Barbie. As I mentioned in my comments, and I think Kevin did in his as well, there is a lot of activity in the fashion doll aisle, and we manage our portfolio like we do, for example, in the vehicle aisle. So we're constantly trying to optimize properties like Disney Princess and Monster High and Barbie. So as we look at the Barbie business exiting the third quarter, the reason we feel still pretty confident about Barbie is POS continued to build a positive momentum in the third quarter despite all of this heavy competition, if you will, from our own brands. So we like how Barbie exited the third quarter. As we look at the third quarter -- I'm sorry, the fourth quarter, we think Barbie is pretty well-positioned. If you look at from a product standpoint, we have Photo Fashion Barbie, which should be a big hit. We have the Barbie Holiday Doll, which is off to a very good start. We've got this new fall entertainment called Princess and the Popstar, and we always love movies that have 2 feature dolls in them. And that's off to good start, both from the toy sales standpoint and also the DVD standpoint. And as always, we worked extraordinarily hard this year because of all the complexity in the portfolio and our desire to succeed across the portfolio with our retail partners to make sure we have the right merchandising and we have the right promotional programs in place. It was a tough comp in the third quarter. As you recall, international I think was up around 20% for Barbie and domestic was up about 13%. But again, we like where Barbie is. The POS is building in the third quarter, exited with positive POS momentum, and we think Barbie is well-positioned to succeed in the fourth quarter.","Phil Anderson - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And then, second question, I\u2019ve seen a lot of the ads recently here for Fisher-Price. I know you guys are kind of in the process of rebranding and launching a new ad campaign around that. Just wondering if you could kind of give us an update on where that stands? And then, just the sort of the sustainability of this quarter's growth going forward for Fisher-Price?","Bryan G. Stockton","Sure. Thank you. The objective we have for Fisher-Price is to make sure that we really reach the full potential of Fisher-Price. As you'll recall, Fisher-Price revenue is less than half from our International business. It's one of the few brands that is less than half. And we've always believed that there's great growth potential for Fisher-Price not just here in the U.S. but particularly in our International business. And as we've gone through this transition process over the past few years, we've really worked hard to come up with a message that resonates not just with the U.S. mother but with mothers around the world. Because as we told you before, they're different than the baby boomer moms, they have different way of thinking about things. The commercials have been successful. We're expanding their airing to more countries this fall. Fisher-Price, from a POS standpoint, was exiting the third quarter with positive momentum. So we feel very, very good about that. We think there's some more opportunities to continue to build this business, whether it's through the new packaging in the 2013, continued promotional support with our retailers. So we know there's more work to be done in Fisher-Price, but we're feeling that we're beginning to build some solid momentum on the core. The other thing that I mentioned in my remarks is we're also very pleased with the Fisher-Price Friends business. That portfolio used to be exclusively licensed property with intellectual property owned by others. About 1\/2 of that portfolio now is from our IP with the acquisition of HIT. So we think we've done a very good job of balancing out that portfolio not only for growth but also for the ebbs and flows of licenses. So when we look at Fisher-Price either from the Friends standpoint or from a core standpoint, we think we're making solid progress.","Operator","The next question is from Linda Bolton-Weiser of Caris.","Linda Bolton-Weiser - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","I was wondering if you could talk about your dividend policy because you've raised your dividend quite a bit higher than earnings growth in the last couple of years. Are you where you want to be in terms of payout ratio, and any other metrics that you're looking at? That's my first question. My second question has to do with, can you just remind us some of the key entertainment kind of driven things coming up in 2013, 2014 even though your core brands are becoming more and more important it seems. But I seem to recall that we have Pixar's Planes movie next year, and there's been other movies mentioned in the past. Can you just update us on that? Not to steal your thunder away from the Analyst Meeting but a little color would be helpful.","Bryan G. Stockton","I'll start and then turn it over to Kevin to talk about our dividend policy. We have we think a pretty a solid lineup next year both in terms of movies and evergreen properties. Next year, for 2013, we'll be supporting Superman from Warner Bros., DreamWorks\u2019 new movie, Turbo, and Disney Pixar's Planes movie. Those are probably the 3 big things for next year. From an evergreen standpoint, we're going to be continuing to support both Dora, Jake and Disney Clubhouse. And Disney's also coming up with a new show called Sophia the First: Once Upon a Princess, which will be on Disney Junior TV. And we think that's got some interesting potential as well. So both from an evergreen standpoint and a movie standpoint, we think we have a solid lineup for next year. Kevin, do you want to comment on the dividends?","Kevin M. Farr","Yes. Linda, dividends are a board-level decision. And over the last few years, profit growth is equal to dividend growth, and we caught up when we announced our dividend in 2012, January this year of $1.24. In this year, we expect our dividend would increase consistent with our growth in earnings and within our targeted payout ratio of 50% to 60%, resulting in a dividend yield that's consistent with top quartile yields of best-in-class customer goods peers. The company intends to maintain a strong balance sheet, with targeted year-end cash of $800 million to $1 billion. And we'll continue to work with credit ratings to maintain our A ratings.","Operator","The next question is from Gerrick Johnson of BMO Capital Markets.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I'd like to qualify -- go over gross margin real fast and strip out the FX impact. If we add 180 basis points to last year's 47.8 and subtract 200 from this year's 57.3 (sic) [53.7], is that the right way to look at it, 200 basis points of true gross margin improvement excluding FX?","Kevin M. Farr","No, I don't think so, Gerrick. I think that it's up 590 basis points. And I think when you look at stripping out the 180 basis points related to ForEx, it's more of like a 400 million -- or 400 basis points improvement. And that 2\/3 improvement in gross margins reflects improved mix, better-than-expected savings from our manufacturing efficiency and O.E. 2.0 savings programs, our pricing actions, partly offset by increased input costs, which were less volatile than prior years.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And Monster High, is that now launched in every international geography that it's supposed to go into?","Bryan G. Stockton","Yes. There may be one lurking out there someplace, but the Monster High is essentially global now and continuing to succeed, even in the early markets like the U.S.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And one last question. 2013, when will your wooden Thomas hit the market? Does Tommy have a sell-off period for the first half or anything like that?","Bryan G. Stockton","Well, our products will be available for sale on or about January 1. So you should expect to see our products out in the marketplace in January, February as it goes through the distribution channels.","Operator","The next question is from Felicia Hendrix of Barclays.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Bryan, I just wanted to talk about the point-of-sales trends in the quarter. I just have some questions around that. At the beginning of your prepared remarks, you said that point-of-sales was in line with shipments. So if your sales are up about 4%, should we assume that your point-of-sales was about there?","Bryan G. Stockton","We look at our point-of-sales and shipments both globally, and where we can, by region. If you look at our global shipments in POS, they're roughly in line. I'm not going to give you the knits and knots but they're roughly in line. As we look at the U.S. business, particularly in the third quarter, our POS was positive. And momentum was building in the U.S. with our POS as we exited the third quarter, which we think positions us well for the fourth quarter. So you're in the ballpark.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And internationally, was POS positive as well?","Bryan G. Stockton","I'm sorry, can you repeat that?","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Internationally, was POS positive as well?","Bryan G. Stockton","Yes, it was.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And then, just digging down a little bit further, you said for Barbie and Fisher-Price that POS was showing positive momentum. So can we infer that those numbers are not positive yet?","Bryan G. Stockton","No, you can infer that they are positive.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, great. And then, just -- I will take another stab at gross margins. If we -- excluding HIT, would your gross margins still be over 50%?","Kevin M. Farr","Yes, yes. HIT had a small impact on gross margins for the quarter.","Operator","The next question is from Sean McGowan of Needham & Company.","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","3 housekeeping questions, and then, a question on Batman. On the housekeeping, how much of the American Girl growth is new stores versus increased sales of the product?","Bryan G. Stockton","We're not going to quantify that, Sean. But let's just say that most of the growth came from McKenna and existing stores.","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's what I figured. Second question. The next one is for you, Kevin. If FX stays where it is now, can you quantify what you expect the impact would be in the fourth quarter?","Kevin M. Farr","Well, it's impossible to predict ForEx. So I usually give you a rule of thumb, and that rule of thumb relates to looking at the U.S. dollar index, and for every 1% movement in U.S. dollar index should impact annual EPS by $0.01 to $0.02 and impact revenues by about 0.5 percentage point. That said, I think if you look at our fourth quarter last year, we had an 80-basis-point reversal in the fourth quarter of last year that was positive. So when we look at gross margins for the fourth quarter this year, we've got a comp that will be positive that we will be lapping.","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Great. And also, housekeeping, your tax rate forecast, any reason to expect the fourth quarter to be different from kind of year-to-date number?","Kevin M. Farr","Yes, I think when we look at full year, we expect the tax rate to be about 21% to 22%. Year-to-date, the tax rate is about 20.1%, and that benefited from some discrete period items, which is a timing issue from the perspective of a full year tax rate. So at year end, the tax rate will be again, I think, around 21% to 22%.","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","And Bryan, on your comments on some product performance during the quarter, I think I hear you say that you're pleased with evergreen performance of products like Batman. Would you put Batman in the year when there\u2019s a movie in the evergreen category? Did it not get a big boost from movie?","Bryan G. Stockton","No, we would say that the movie properties for us performed very solidly.","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. But did Batman -- I mean in the past, you kind of talked about Batman being one of those big hit products. Did it live up to your expectations?","Bryan G. Stockton","Yes, yes. I would say that our toy sales on Batman met our expectations.","Operator","The next question is from Margaret Whitfield of Sterne Agee.","Margaret B. Whitfield - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I wondered if you could comment, Bryan, or elaborate on your comment about the early layaway leading to earlier sales benefiting high-ticket items. I'm wondering what you're seeing at Mattel? What toy brands are resonating and might this lead to some early reorders compared to prior years? And also, I wonder if you could provide us with some information on what categories grew share in quarters -- or through August? And any comments on retail response to that new Barbie construction line through MEGA Bloks?","Bryan G. Stockton","Let me start first with the Barbie construction line. As you know, MEGA Brands is going to be selling that in, and we expect that there will be some distribution to that product probably in late December based on what we hear from MEGA Brands. And the response from retailers is, our understanding, has been pretty positive. So we'll wait and see what happens with that. As it regards to the earlier promotions and specifically layaway, as I said, we think it's a positive thing for the industry. When you think about the structures of the programs this year, there are a number of months of layaway is available, has been extended by a month. The cost of the programs has been reduced to consumers. And so when you look at higher ticket items, for example, for us, things like the Barbie DREAMHOUSE, you would expect that an item like that is probably something that would be a popular layaway item. It was last year. We would expect that this year, it should be similar. So I guess, the way I would view this is it's quite early. Layaway has been in place for just a few weeks. We've got last year's layaway to comp here in the next few weeks. And as you know quite well, every year at Christmas, consumers change their buying patterns. There's always a delay for one reason or another, I believe, for example, this year Hanukkah is 11 days earlier than it was last year. So there's always sort of shifting momentum with consumers, but in the end, is why we say there's Christmas on December 25. To your question on categories responding to innovation, for us in particular, dolls and infant\/preschool are performing better than the category average. There's a lot of activity there. Fisher-Price has been growing its share of total toys there. The vehicle category is going up against a very strong Cars 2 comp from last year, so you will expect that category is behind last year. But when we look at the core of our business, particularly the basic car business with this new promotion that we started, it looks quite strong. So again, when we look at the core categories that we tend to compete in around the world globally, those are the ones tend to be outperforming the total.","Margaret B. Whitfield - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","One follow-up, how is Cinderella being received at retail?","Bryan G. Stockton","Well, we think, pretty well. We think it's going to be a good solid initiative by Disney and by us. And again, we are very good, we think, at managing a portfolio of brands. And so we think that this is going to be another strong initiative for us in the fall.","Operator","And the next question is from Eric Handler of MKM Partners.","Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","It looks like HIT Entertainment seems to be probably outperforming a little less than the Street expectations. Can you talk a little bit about what degree your Mattel-specific initiatives for HIT or items that they didn't have last year in terms of distribution or products have helped out this year? And then secondly, when you look at their full portfolio, what are some of your thoughts behind maybe some of the other brands in terms of whether you -- that's a focus for next year or maybe sell off some of those brands like the Barney or Bob the Builder?","Bryan G. Stockton","We are pleased with our performance on HIT. As you'll recall, we said this year, we had really a couple of objectives. The first was to work hard on getting that business integrated into Mattel, and I think we're well on plan to have that accomplished by the end of the year. And we feel quite good about that. We also said our second overall objective was to improve the execution of the business. And I think there's a couple of examples of where we tried to do that. I mentioned this new DVD called Blue Mountain Mystery. We're very excited to have that out, that's a big thing for us. As we look at how to execute the DVD business, we have found from our experience on Barbie that selling Barbie DVDs by the toys in the toy department is a much better execution than selling it exclusively where retailers sell DVDs. So we're improving the execution of not only having a great DVD but executing it better in store. The other example I would give you would be TV placement for Thomas, particularly in Latin America. I think we've given you the example in Mexico, for example, where historically, Thomas has been on there on TV Azteca, which is a smaller network with much narrower reach than Televisa. And we've been successful in transitioning Thomas from TV Azteca to Televisa. And that's an important execution element. So those are 2 examples of what we try to do to strengthen execution. I'd also say that retailer response to the new wooden line has been very positive. The toy line looks great. The sets look great. Retailers' response, as I said, has been positive. So that's something we'll see next year. As it relates to the HIT global brands, the non-Thomas brands, Mike the Knight, we always talked about it as our gift with purchase. That continues to do well on Nick here in the U.S. and on the BBC. We've got it placed in a number of countries now and are excited about the opportunity for that next year. So HIT is, I think to your point, at least on plan, and we feel very positive about it.","Kevin M. Farr","Yes, and I think for 2013, we expect it to be increasingly accretive beyond 2013 by owning the Thomas brand. As we look at it next year, we won't have the acquisition cost and we'll have substantially lower integration costs. We've got the addition of the Thomas wood business in 2013. We're launching a toy business for Mike the Knight in the fall of next year. We'll have cost synergies. So those things will drive accretion and EPS from the acquisition in 2013 and beyond.","Operator","The next question is from Tim Conder of Wells Fargo Securities.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","A couple of items here. Back on the gross margin side. Kevin, you touched on and you pointed out on the slide deck the 80 basis points comp. I think that's a, correct me if I\u2019m wrong, that's the reversal of what we saw with the inter-companies from third quarter of '11 to fourth quarter '11. So there'll be a little bit of a headwind, correct, as you're pointing out for the fourth quarter. But my real question in gross margin is, this year, you're tracking 52% has to deal with that FX headwind in the fourth quarter, but it appears this year, you will track above that approximate of 50% guidance. Are you saying based on a prior comment that next year, given Fisher-Price should start to accelerate on a relative basis here, that, that will keep you closer back towards that 50%, all else equal?","Kevin M. Farr","Tim, we really don't give line item guidance. And I think there's a lot of moving pieces in gross margins. So when we look at near term, we really manage our P&L in an annual basis, as I said, with 2 key goals: to grow operating profit by 6% to 8%; and sequentially improve our operating margins, up the range of 15% to 20%. And as we develop our plan for next year, we're going to look at delivering improved operating margins while achieving 6% to 8% growth in operating profits by really looking at all of our levers: sales growth, gross margins, advertising, SG&A and investments. And gross margin is an important element in that equation. But overall, what we're trying to do is consistently deliver top third to top quartile total shareholder returns.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And the track record is good. So thank you on that. The licensing, can you remind us where that stands as a percent of revenue? And now, with the addition of HIT going forward and a couple of other things that you're doing with Monster High and soon to be new IP, any goals or anything on licensing as a percent of revenue on a go-forward basis here?","Kevin M. Farr","We haven't specifically called out the percentage of sales that it is and the growth rate. But again, it's an important part of our business. We are focused on growing our Licensing business. As Bryan said, HIT gives us more capabilities with Licensing business. And I think with regard to HIT, that there is an opportunity since it's underdeveloped on a global basis, an opportunity to continue it to grow. So overall, we like new business. I think it is a tailwind to our gross margins as we look to the future, and it is a focus for the company.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then 1 last clarification here, more housekeeping. The -- I think you've thrown out before about $75 million to $80 million ballpark-ish on incentive comp. Is that incentive and equity or just one of those 2 buckets?","Kevin M. Farr","It's one of 2 buckets. So if you look at the target level of incentive for our short-term incentive program, it's about $75 million to $80 million. And when you look at our equity compensation, the target is $50 million to $55 million.","Operator","And the last question comes from Mike Swartz of SunTrust.","Michael A. Swartz - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Just wanted to touch real briefly on some of the comments or the comment you made around O.E. 2.0, maybe the savings from that program coming in above $175 million. I mean, could that be north of $200 million when all\u2019s said and done by the end of the year? And then, I mean, how do we think about where the incremental savings go? Is that going to be reinvested in the business or would that fall at the bottom line?","Kevin M. Farr","Through the end of 2012, we've -- or through the third quarter of 2012, we delivered cumulative gross savings of about $173 million against our target of $175 million. At this point, we expect to exceed our goal by 2012 by about $5 million to $10 million. And that will likely drop to the bottom line.","Drew Vollero","Thank you.

Welcome to Mattel, Incorporated Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s call, Whitney Steininger. Ms. Steininger, you may begin.","Whitney Steininger","Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me today are Margo Georgiadis, Mattel\u2019s Chief Executive Officer; and Joe Euteneuer, Mattel\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. As you know, this afternoon, we reported Mattel\u2019s 2017 fourth quarter financial results. We will begin today\u2019s call with Margo and Joe providing commentary on our results, and then we will provide extended time for Margo and Joe to take your questions.","To help guide our discussion today, we have provided you with a slide presentation. Our discussion and our slide presentation will reference non-GAAP financial measures such as gross sales, adjusted net sales, adjusted gross profit and adjusted gross margin, adjusted other selling and administrative expenses, adjusted operating income or loss, adjusted earnings or loss per share from which we exclude the impact of a net $467 million non-cash charge related to the establishment of a valuation allowance on U.S. deferred tax assets and an estimate of the impact of U.S. Tax Reform, earnings before interest, depreciation and amortization or EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and constant currency.","Our earnings release also includes non-GAAP financial measures. The information required by Regulation G regarding non-GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release and slide presentation, and both documents are available in the Investors section of our corporate website, corporate.mattel.com.","Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind you that certain statements made during the call may include forward-looking statements relating to the future performance of our overall business, brands and product lines. These statements are based on currently available information, and they are subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements.","We described some of these uncertainties in the Risk Factors section of our 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K, our 2017 quarterly report on Form 10-Q, our earnings release and the slide presentation accompanying this call and other filings we make with the SEC from time to time as well as in our other public statements. Mattel does not update forward-looking statements and expressly disclaims any obligation to do so.","Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Margo.","Margo Georgiadis","Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining our fourth quarter 2017 earnings call. Our fourth quarter performance reflects a tough quarter as part of what was a difficult and extraordinary year for Mattel. This year we faced multiple significant dislocations driven by retail inventory levels, planning misalignments, mixed brand performance and the TRU bankruptcy. Collectively these contributed to significant top and bottom line pressure.","Importantly, we use this year to proactively take actions to turnaround this business and reset our economic model for the future. The results in the quarter reflect a series of decisions to enter 2018 with as clean a slate as possible. We are optimistic the business is on course to stabilize revenue in 2018 and with the benefit of our significant cost reduction program. We expect to improve profit trends in 2018 and to demonstrate momentum toward the medium term goals we shared at our June Investor Day.","On today\u2019s call, I will take you through an overview of our topline performance in the fourth quarter related drivers and the privacy continue to make in our strategic transformation. We expect a series of green shoots in 2018 that will demonstrate progress against our plan and highlight the value creation potential of our strategy. We will layout key milestones during today\u2019s call and will expand further during our Toy Fair Presentation. So you can track our progress through the year.","Joe will provide further details on our fourth quarter financial performance and provide an update on our structural simplification efforts ongoing strategic investments and our broader capital strategy. Richard will not be joining the call today, because he is in Nuremberg at the European Toy Fair. After Joe, we will open up the call for Q&A.","Let\u2019s turn to our top line performance. Our growth sales declined 8% in the fourth quarter and 9% for the year, which were consistent with the most recent outlook we provided in December. North America growth sales were down 14% for the quarter and continue to reflect challenges associated with tighter retail inventory management, the Toys \"R\" Us bankruptcy and underperforming brands that we have discussed previously. Internationally growth sales were up 4% for the quarter with the strongest performance in LatAm led by Cars 3, Fisher-Price Core up 16% and Barbie up 14%.","The strongest brands globally in the quarter were Barbie, Cars 3 and Hot Wheels. And we continue to be pleased with the launch of Enchantimals. Fisher-Price performance in the quarter was stressed, particularly in North America by Toys \"R\" Us and underperformance of key items versus last year. American Girl remains challenged as we continue the turnaround program. I will address the key momentum drivers for each power brand in a moment.","As we have shared throughout 2017 rightsizing retail inventory level has remained a critical priority. In Q4, we continued our proactive actions to hold the line and shipping and aggressively manage inventory at retail, particularly in the U.S. and Europe. We believe that we have ended the year with retail inventory for our key power brands down over 20% across these markets. In the fourth quarter, we saw POS more aligned with shipping for most of our brands and expect to see further alignment going forward with few exceptions. This alignment gives us confidence in setting and achieving our goals in 2018.","A quick note about industry trends. I\u2019m sure you have seen Q4 showed deceleration although the industry finished up for the full year for NPD data. Franchise brands that deliver immersive and connective experiences and trend based brands continue to take share as well as companies that are addressing the significant growth differences across international regions. These industry growth drivers fit squarely into our strategy and reinforce our optimism as we reset our business for the future.","Moving on to margins. As expected we had issues all the way down the P&L in the fourth quarter and full year. We also executed a number of write downs as part of our action plan to address underperforming areas and to reset profitability. In particular these items had a significant impact on gross margins, which we would not expect to recur at the same levels in 2018. We do expect smaller charges in 2018 related to ongoing skew optimization. Joe will walk you through each of these in more detail.","As we look at the full year effective unwinding the dislocations in our business, the impact on our profitability is significant and we expect to turn a new page in 2018. As I said earlier our power brand performance was mixed with Barbie and Hot Wheels showing continued momentum. I\u2019ll now provide a quick update on each major brand. Barbie\u2019s worldwide gross sales for the fourth quarter were 9% and POS was up similarly in the high-single digit. This is the third year in a row that brand has delivered mid to high single digit POS growth demonstrating what our power franchises can achieve with systematic development of 360 physical and digital systems of play.","Shipments and POS were in alignment with strong sales through retail in all markets including strong double-digit wholesale POS in Europe, APAC and Latin America. Barbie remains the world undisputed leader in dolls and its continued momentum is allowing us to gain additional market share in dolls and fashion categories, again for NPD. Barbie has strong momentum heading into 2018 as we continue to lean into empowerment and careers with exciting new 360 systems of play expansions and experiences anchored by compelling content partnership across short form television series and documentaries. We\u2019re excited to tell you more at Toy Fair.","Hot Wheels Q4 POS grew mid-single digits globally with gross sales down slightly as we carefully managed retail inventories, which are now down over 25% versus last year. This good result reflects our commitment to expanding systems of play. The brand achieved double-digit POS growth in Q4 in both LatAm and Europe and mid-single digit growth in Asia. The strength of the Hot Wheels brand franchise is allowed us to continue to gain market share even as we work to make Cars 3 a success for NPD.","In addition, as exemplified by double-digit sales growth Track Builder Set were successfully building beyond the core diecast car line and capturing share of incremental categories, which is part of our systems of play strategy. We believe our success in construction can be a significant contributor to future growth of the brand. 2018 will be an exciting year for Hot Wheels. We celebrate the 50th anniversary of this iconic brand. We have bold plans for product and marketing to inspire both kids and collectors, including re-releases of original treasure diecast cars and exciting new connected line for younger kids and a next generation augmented reality offering that fully immersive kids in the Hot Wheels of racing experience. We\u2019ll share a larger preview of what\u2019s coming at Toy Fair.","Turning to Fisher-Price Core, worldwide fourth quarter sales were down 9% and POS was down high-single digit. Overall, our fall 2017 product line did not perform as well as our 2016 line up. In North America our largest market for Fisher-Price, these issues were exacerbated by the TRU bankruptcy and some online retail issues where competitor price discounting and shipping cost became an obstacle for reordering late in the season on some top item.","Where we are fully executing our new strategy across brand, retail and parent engagement, Fisher-Price performed well in 2017, particularly in China and Latin America. China continues to be the leader in our parent engagement program anchored on our innovative partnership with BabyTree, the leading website and app for new moms in China. Over 1 million moms have engaged in our content since our fall launch. And every day thousands are taking our assessment tool, which anchors our customized 24-month age and stage program tailored to the learning and development needs of each child. We look forward to rolling these programs out to additional countries.","We have also brought in a new leader for Fisher-Price, Chuck Scothon. We are excited to welcome back to the company after a few years away. He is a highly respected purpose driven leader and a proven product and marketing innovator who has a track record in driving success at Fisher-Price. He is deeply passionate about child development and accelerating our ability to help every parent across the world provide their child the Best Possible Start and unlocking the power in Fisher-Price\u2019s unrivaled seven decades of learning and development expertise.","As we have discussed in prior quarters American Girl and Thomas remained under pressure this year. Regarding American Girl this brand remains one of the most beloved and iconic doll franchises, which we are dedicated to reenergizing. American Girl the premium experiential brand that needs to be cultivated with the right 360 experiences, premium product and content support.","The consumer excitement behind our New York store opening and a very positive reception of overseas partnerships, for example Dubai reinforce the true potential of this brand. Our Q4 results show that we are still deeply and turnaround with the mass distribution strategy previously put in place not performing and the need to address certain stores that are not meeting our location and brand experience expectations.","We are accelerating aggressive plans to refresh this franchise in 2018 with both investment and talent enhancements to revitalize this brands premium appeal and improve the offline and online experience. We plan to provide more detail in AG\u2019s action plan on the Q1 call.","In the case of Thomas, we are excited to reinvigorate the brand in 2018 with new content and expanded retail distribution. The all new Season 22 of Thomas & Friends takes Thomas on global adventures outside of Sodor for the very first time and introduces exciting new girl characters to expand our already strong broad gender appeal. This new content will launch on many of the number one kid\u2019s preschool networks across global markets, making it available in more than a 100 countries worldwide.","In Thomas\u2019s biggest market, the U.S., we announced last week a major new content and brand activation partnership with Nickelodeon starting in March, which will anchor the transformation of this franchise. The Toy Box remain under pressure into Q4, as the games from Cars 3, Enchantimals and other properties were overwhelmed by declines in certain underperforming brands, including Monster High, Ever After High and MEGA.","As expected, Cars 3 came within range of our revenue target for the year led by strength in international markets by the franchise exceeded our expectations. We continue to deepen our closed partnership with Disney I believe we will see solid performance into 2018 for Cars3, particularly across international market. Our biggest new own brand launch this year Enchantimal also performed well especially in Europe, where we deliver the broadest retail and content activation program. We will continue to grow this property into 2018.","Looking forward, we continue to focus on the transformation of Toy Box into a more stable and profitable innovation portfolio. We believe that we will complete Toy Box optimization during 2018 focusing on three main opportunities. First, we will continue to invest in our top entertainment partners including Disney, Warner Bros, Universal, Nickelodeon and WWE. We are bringing them the best of our creativity, 360 play systems capability and strong global commercial execution to unlock brand passion for their brand.","In 2018, we are excited about your two of the Cars 3 franchise, the launch of our Jurassic World line and Sunny Day. We\u2019re also leading into Turning Mecard, which has a breakout franchise in Australia and Korea that we are expanding to multiple markets this year.","Second, we have one of our best ever lineups of own brand launches, which we will share in-depth at Toy Fair. To share a few highlights, Enchantimals has a continued growth opportunity and we are excited to relaunch Polly Pocket this year, the original surprise brand. We\u2019ve been testing the brand in Latin America and have taken these learnings to redevelop the product line and content to enable a successful multi-market expansion. We also have a major new Uno related product launch.","Third, we are committed to retaking our leadership as the top toy innovator. In a world, where trend based items are increasingly important in today\u2019s digital age. The hallmark of Mattel is connecting deep consumer insight and creative ingenuity. We\u2019ve created a small dedicated team of expert toy leaders to unleash a much faster, leaner and more nimble business model for hot products. We unveil to be exciting work of this team privately at Hong Kong Toy Fair and you\u2019ll be hearing more about the new product from this group at New York Toy Fair.","Turning to our strategic transformation in the year ahead, we have completed the process of resetting our leadership team in organization, which is a critical underpinning to regaining momentum. We now have regional leaders with consistent responsibility, accountability and operating structures. In addition, the global brand team is now fully focused on creating global brand strategies that allow for the specific developmental needs of individual market. Our new incentive structure is better aligned with our overall objective including a more balanced approach to sales, margins, working capital and EBITDA.","In 2018, we are focusing on stabilizing revenue, enhancing profitability with stage investments in our growth pillars. We expect improving trends and green shoots to start emerging throughout the year, I\u2019ll walk through milestones you can expect as part of our progress. The cornerstone of our strategy is our three key power brands Barbie, Hot Wheels and Fisher-Price. We expect growth across these three power brands driven by more consistent execution across markets and growing our play systems into new areas.","Each of these brands has strong brand presence, strong consumer demand and opportunities for differentiation across markets. So the number one job for us now is high quality executions to support their continued growth. We also expect to see POS and shipments more closely aligned for our top brands across market. We also are committed to our innovation pipeline in the Tox Box, with a focus first and remixing this portfolio to improve revenue sustainability and profitability.","Beginning in Q1, we will breakout the Toy Box separately from our power brands. So that you can track how we are progressing across our entertainment partnerships and own brands. In 2018, our focuses on leaning into our top entertainment partners, top own brands, and trend based products, which will be offset by pruning elsewhere. We also will share updates on how top launches such as Jurassic, Sunny Day and Polly Pocket are performing.","We are making fast progress on structural simplification, which is a cornerstone to restoring profitability. We are happy to announce that we expect achieve a greater proportion of the $650 million savings in calendar year 2018 than originally anticipated. We are also happy to announce a significant reduction of our CapEx spending. Each of these will provide significant lift to margins and cash flow as we move forward, Joe will provide more detail on both shortly.","In addition, we are investing to create the runway for longer term growth with staged investments against our five pillar growth strategy, which we announced at June Investor Day. These investments and milestone should provide you with further confidence that we are on track to delivering the medium-term growth and profitability targets we have shared.","Key milestones you can expect to see in 2018 include, breakthrough content partnerships to unlock the value of our IP with a slate of short form TV series and theatrical content against our top brand franchises. Our new Thomas content and Nickelodeon announcement is a start of this new momentum. As discussed at our June Investor Day, this content strategy is designed to underpin the growth of our brands, unlock increased consumer product opportunities and allow us to better leverage our advertising and promotional spend over time.","On gaming, you recently saw our partnership with NetEase a leading global gaming company to create a series of mobile games based on our IP that will unlock meaningful monetization potential from world class immersive experiences.","The first major release based on our Uno brand will come out in April and a second will be released in the fall. To enhance our innovation pipeline and economic, you will see as announced more co-production deals. We are on track to unveil multiple co-pro deals with top partners several of which you will be seeing at Toy Fair.","On connected play systems, we have to find a clear strategy to drive scalable and cost effective platform based innovation led by our new CTO, Sven Gerjets in partnership with our global brand leaders. In Q4, we made the top decision to clean up some of our connected products that did not meet our new strategy and to redirect or accelerate others. We are prioritizing opportunities and Fisher-Price, Hot Wheels and STEM.","For 2018, you will see us launch exciting connected products such as Hot Wheels AR that deepen our play experience for a digital age and offer extendability. You also will see us take a careful and stage approach to developing more immersive an adaptive solutions, which are the highest quality experiences and accessible price points that our consumers expect from Mattel.","You will see an announcement soon about how we were leveraging best in class partners with proven software and hardware development capabilities to accelerate progress and capture scale benefits.","In conclusion, while 2017 was a tough year. We took action to work through our main challenges and look forward to a fresh start in 2018. Our five pillar strategy remains the foundation for growth and profitability over the medium-term. 2018 will be a very different year, as we continue to make progress on a strategic transformation. Job one is to return Mattel to a high performing toy company that delivers the returns you would expect from a toy market leader.","In addition, we are making meaningful progress and unlocking the value of our IP and accelerating innovation to create further growth momentum. We look forward to sharing more exciting updates with you at Toy Fair in a few weeks. And we greatly value your support as we implement a transformation plan to restore growth and profitability and deliver significantly enhanced shareholder returns over the medium-term.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Joe.","Joe Euteneuer","Thank you, Margo. And thank you everyone for joining the call. Well, it was a challenging end to a challenging year. We\u2019ve taken the opportunity to make the tough decisions in 2017 to step a foundation for continued progress on our transformation in 2018.","As mentioned previously, one of the overarching drivers causing dislocation this past year was business planning misalignment. Beginning 2017 was a mid-to-high single-digit growth expectation for the full year gross sales and ending the year with high single-digit decline.","The cost base of the organization was not able to fully adjust for the swing in the year, which negatively impacted our profitability. You will hear in my review of our expense results, the impact this misalignment had on the company. Since Marvel has already addressed our top line performance, I\u2019ll start by walking you through the P&L, identifying key drivers and any potential headwinds or tailwinds that we expect to carry over into 2018.","Starting with sales adjustement. The increase from 10.2% to 11.5% for the full year was primarily driven by the year-over-year sales decline in North America, which resulted in a higher weighting of international sales as a percentage of total sales. Since our international markets have higher sales adjustment rates in North America our overall sales adjustment rate increase year-over-year due to this waiting, while we would like to reduce sales adjustments over the long-term. We expect similar levels to continue in the near-term, as we continue to stabilize the top line.","Our reported gross margin was 30.7% in the fourth quarter and 37.3% in the full year which included a $20.6 million asset impairment, related to tooling write-offs in the quarter. Our adjusted gross margin decreased significantly from 47% to 32% for the quarter, and for the full year, adjusted gross margin declined from 46.8% to 38.3%.","The primary drivers of the Q4 and full year decline were actions related to our structural simplification cost savings initiative, which included write-downs of excess owned inventory and impairment of asset. This made up approximately 40% of the decline for Q4 and 25% of the decline for the full year.","We don\u2019t expect these costs to reoccurring at these levels in 2018, if at all. Both the higher sales target and proliferation of SKUs in brand led the higher level of close-out sales and unfavorable product mix. This made up approximately 20% of the decline for Q4 and 30% of the decline for the full year.","As we look to 2018, we will be remixing the business and managing our portfolio of brands and SKUs to improve profitability going forward. The continued freight and logistics challenges primarily driven by North America made up approximately 15% of the decline from both Q4 and the full year, while we started implementing corrective actions in Q4 2017. These challenges may continue to have a negative impact in the first half of 2018.","And finally, increased sales adjustments, as I just previously mentioned, made up approximately 15% of the decline for Q4 and 5% of the decline for the full year. As we noted in December, advertising was slightly higher in absolute dollars and more so as a percentage of net sales in the full year as sales continuing to decline during the year. As part of our structural simplification, we expect to reduce our advertising spend in the coming year without jeopardizing our sales stabilization effort.","Fourth quarter adjusted SG&A was $387 million, up 13% compared to the prior year, driven primarily by an unfavorable year-over-year comparison, due to a prior year reversal of incentive compensation, as well as increased amortization, unfavorable foreign exchange, and bad debt. Our full year adjusted SG&A of $1.4 billion was up 4% versus the prior year and was primarily driven by employee related expenses, growth investment and bad debt. Full year bad debt, as a percentage of net sales was less than one half of 1% in both 2017 and 2016.","In the fourth quarter, our income tax provision was $39.6 million, excluding the impact of U.S. tax reform. As I mentioned, on our third quarter earnings call, we booked one-time non-cash charge of $561.9 million to record a valuation allowance for a significant portion of our deferred tax assets.","To account for U.S. tax reform, an estimated non-cash benefit of a $105.3 million was reported in Q4. We anticipate finalizing and recording the full impact of tax reform including the liability for the mandatory repatriation tax within a year of its enactment, while we do not have an estimate of the mandatory repatriation tax to share today.","The cash tax impact is not expected to be material to our annual cash flows, because we will use foreign tax credit and the significant deferred tax asset such as loss carryforwards and credit that we have on our balance sheet to offset the cash tax payments. The valuation allowance does not impact Mattel\u2019s ability to utilize these deferred tax assets under the applicable tax laws.","Overall, total tax expense for the full year was $548.8 million, inclusive of all non-cash charges current estimated impact from U.S. tax reform and the effect of our operations in 2017. Cash tax payments for 2017 were a $117.7 million, as compared to a $113 million for 2016. Cast tax payments for 2018 should remain relatively constant before taking into account any incremental cash tax liabilities resulting from U.S. tax reform.","The Q4 decline of adjusted operating loss of $434 million, adjusted EBITDA of $418.5 million and adjusted earnings per share of a $1.24 were primarily driven by the decline in gross sales and the proactive actions we took in the quarter to set the foundation for our continued turnaround in 2018.","Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the year with a cash balance of $1.1 billion, which reflected the $1 billion of debt issuance part of which we used to repay all outstanding short-term borrowings as we transition to a capital structure. In 2017, working capital improved slightly year-over-year in absolute dollars.","Key components of working capital included accounts receivable, which was flat year-over-year with the sales outstanding up, primarily as a result of the higher sales in market with longer payments structure. Our owned inventory balance was $601 million, down slightly versus $614 million in 2016.","We increased our obsolescence expense by $96 million this year, primarily due to excess owned inventory caused by our Q4 sales decline as well as the discontinuation of certain product line to simplify our business going forward. As we manage down our excess owned inventory, this may result in gross margin pressure in the first half of the year.","Accounts payable and accrued liabilities were $71 million or 5% higher than 2016. We continue to tightly manage the timing and terms of our payable. As we go through our business transformation, we will continue to emphasize site management of working capital.","Capital expenditures were $297 million in 2017, reflecting costs associated with our flagship American Girl store in New York and continued investment in automation and our core manufacturing clients. We expect to reduce our CapEx spend by approximately one-third in 2018.","We took proactive measures to update our capital structure in Q4, as we said, we would on Q3 call. By replacing Mattel\u2019s unsecured revolving credit facility within asset based lending facility, which is secured primarily by Mattel\u2019s accounts receivable and inventory. In addition, we raise $1 billion of debt to cover the repayment of $250 million in debt coming due in March 2018, along with fortifying our balance sheet.","Looking to 2018, we have engaged in a more comprehensive planning process to ensure clear accountability and alignment on revenue expectations. Additionally, our business leaders have embraced to zero-based budgeting approach to our expenses.","Our structural simplification cost savings program is in full course and we\u2019re revising our employee compensation incentive structure to ensure the organization is executing towards the strategy that balances top line, gross margin, EBITDA, working capital and free cash flow.","As we discussed in December, we are working toward revenue stabilization and profit improvement in the year ahead. And we will talk to you more about our expectations for 2018 at Toy Fair in a few weeks.","Last quarter, we announced our structural simplification cost savings program with a plan to eliminate at the $650 million in net cost over the next two years, with one-third of the savings expected to be achieved in 2018 and the remaining two-thirds exciting 2019.","We told you, we were going to pick action and we did. We are now onset to exceed our original cost savings expectations for 2018 of one-third and our working toward achieving closer to 40% of the total savings beginning with the actions taken in Q4, which included delayering the organization, which eliminated approximately $50 million run rate payroll, exciting 2017, SKU reduction initiative which resulted in $20.6 million of tooling write-off and deploying comprehensive zero-based budgeting to all spend as part of our 2018 budgeting process.","As we entered 2018, we\u2019ve begun work on the following: Pursuing action plans, pertaining to indirect procurement to consolidate our vendor base with a focus on reducing the number of small vendors and actions to renegotiate large areas of spend and developing dedicated initiatives to reduce expenses related to product packaging.","We continue to expect 2018 cost savings to be achieved primarily through process simplification and the optimization of SG&A, cost of goods sold and advertising, while the larger more structural changes like our manufacturing footprint and investment in IP will drive most of the remaining savings in 2019.","Over the next two years, we expect about half of the cost savings to come from cost of goods sold by simplifying the product offering and linking production to demand as well as streamlining our global manufacturing processes, about 45% to come from overhead by streamlining our reporting structure through headcount reduction and reducing the cost of outside services and 5% will come from the optimizing, rightsizing of our advertising spend.","We remain committed to our strategic investments and our confident that when implemented in conjunction with our structural simplification cost savings program will lead to improved revenue and profit growth. As we mentioned on our Q3 earnings call, we expect to spend approximately $30 million on our strategic investments in 2017. The investments made during the year were focused on our China strategic partnerships with Alibaba and BabyTree, IT transformation, 360-degree play systems, Hot Wheels connected products and the key external hires we highlighted on the Q3 earnings call.","As we look ahead, our long-term investment plans and areas of business focus have not changed. We still intend to invest $170 million, about half expected to be spent in 2018 and half in 2019. The overall breakdown between operating expense and capital expenditures being approximately 80% to 20%. Investment areas of focus for 2018 include the execution of our IT transformation, whole production partnerships, China and other emerging markets, connected products and content to support our brand.","In 2018, we will work toward revenue stabilization, unlocking profitability through structural simplification cost reductions and targeting investments to accelerate our future. We have highly prioritized initiatives against each of our strategic pillars and have an organization in place that is ready and willing to execute against them to transform our business. Finally, as a management team, we will continue to hold ourselves accountable for the commitments we make to you and can assure you we are taking the necessary steps now to create long-term shareholder value.","I look forward to continuing the conversation at Toy Fair in a few weeks. Thank you. And we\u2019ll now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Gerrick Johnson with BMO Capital Markets.","Gerrick Johnson","Hi, good afternoon. Two questions. One, if you could just discuss the inventory management efforts a little bit and more granularly I guess, specifically what you\u2019re writing down there? And also how did the retailer shift adjusted time fulfillment affect you guys in the quarter? Did you miss out on sales? Did you build too much and have too much inventory? Did you get just it right? How did that work for you guys? Thank you.","Joe Euteneuer","I think on the \u2013 your second question, I think, look, we ended up at the spot where we wanted to on retail inventory. We were down about 20% and that was sort of our target. I think we feel very good about where we are there. When you think about the write downs and stuff you are talking about, think about that we were going through all of our inventory by SKU. And when you clean out your inventory, some of it you\u2019re using in closeouts, some of it you\u2019re declaring obsolete because you think you\u2019re going to be able to sell it at below cost and so it\u2019s a little bit of accounting issue. But needless to say, we think we cleared the ranks that we\u2019re starting 2018 with the right inventory that we believe is going to help us. I have a very successful 2018. And most importantly, focusing on a philosophy of having the demand come and then being able to supply.","Gerrick Johnson","Thank you, Joe.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Linda Bolton-Weiser with D.A. Davidson.","Linda Bolton-Weiser","Hi. I was wondering if you could explain a little bit more about the lower CapEx spending in 2018 that you\u2019re projecting? Because I believe your earlier comments were that some investment is needed in the business. So I\u2019m just wondering, should we be worried that you\u2019re going to hinder your turnaround because you can\u2019t make those investments upfront? And also I think you talked about the investment level and the breakdown between CapEx and income statement. And so will there be some of that strategic investment in the CapEx? And so are you reducing the CapEx net of that investment? And so can you just explain the whole investment side? Thanks.","Joe Euteneuer","Sure, sure. Yes. Let me break it out for you. So we are trying to treat capital and the investment bucket separate for you so that we can provide clear transparency on what we are doing. So on the investment side, we said we were going to spend $170 million. We are going to spend it 50-50 in the two years, 2018 and 2019. So that\u2019s \u2013 we did that for you. And from a breakout, we think of the 50-50, 80% would be focused on OpEx and 20% CapEx. So we\u2019ll be able to track that fully separately and tell you how we\u2019re doing in that regard.","In regards to CapEx, we view that as more of the historical stuff that we\u2019ve done. And remember, this year we don\u2019t have the American Girl store that we built in New York and we haven\u2019t quoted exactly the capital number that we are going to do. But we are just getting back to normal levels of what we are spending and clearly setting ourselves up for the future to finish automation. And part of the reason we are able to do this is we are starting off on a zero-based budget approach, that we are actually challenging every dollar that we are going to spend, are we going to get the right return and how is it contributing to the overall development of the company going forward?","So we will track both separately for you. We\u2019ll provide you more color at Toy Fair because we are not through the process yet. But we look forward to seeing you at Toy Fair. And yes, in regards to the capital, I did say that we were going to be down approximately 1\/3. So just ballpark numbers as you said, we were $300 million and you took 1\/3, that\u2019s about $100 million. So give or take, $200 million or more less.","Margo Georgiadis","So we don\u2019t see it as, to answer your other question Linda, we do not see \u2013 feeling constrained at all in investing in our go forward strategy. That the ability for us to right size our existing CapEx gives us plenty of room to make a meaningful difference there as well as to invest for the future.","Linda Bolton-Weiser","Thank you.","Operator","And our next comes from the line of Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Ng","Great. Thank you for taking the question. I was wondering if you could help parse out the impact of Toys \"R\" Us in the quarter? And what\u2019s your expectation in terms of the impact from the upcoming store closures to Fisher-Price in 2018? And then I have a quick follow-up.","Joe Euteneuer","Sure. So remember, the first impact really happened in the third quarter when we recorded the $43 million reversal of revenue because of the timing of the bankruptcy. What you see in the fourth quarter is just, as you\u2019ve heard about their performance, it\u2019s down from where they thought it would be. And I think they \u2013 from our perspective, we sort of anticipated sort of that in and what we were thinking. So we are very cautiously optimistic about where they\u2019re going. We are going to continue to work with them. And \u2013 but we haven\u2019t sized anything specifically.","Michael Ng","And are you expecting the store closures to have a meaningful impact to Fisher-Price in 2018 or do you think those distribution points can be absorbed by other retailers?","Margo Georgiadis","We are taking a cautious approach to it to ensure that we are being conservative in our outlook. So that that\u2019s baked into the guidance that we\u2019ll give you at Toy Fair. And I think just to kind of give you some milepost. If you look at 2017 as a whole, it was a really challenging year for us. Obviously, we ended the year with a 9% sales decline. And so I think the way if you want to kind of do mental math, we think about we were only able to recognize our growth in Cars and Enchantimals for the year.","And then we had offsetting that about 50% of the challenge and you think about that sales decline was driven by the retail inventory challenge that we\u2019ve been talking about and some of the non-recurring brands. TRU was about 30% to 40% of the growth challenge in the year. And the power brand issues like Thomas and AG, which we talks a lot about that are in turnaround were about 20%. So if you \u2013 if we were able, as we now are, just to have the POS takeaway and our shipments in alignment, the year would\u2019ve looked very different. And so as we think about going forward we have more time to prepare for the TRU shifts and we will also have our shipping and POS takeaway in alignment. So that\u2019s how I would think about the modeling.","Michael Ng","Great, thanks. That\u2019s very helpful. And just a quick housekeeping question. When you talk about revenue stabilization in 2018, what does that mean exactly? Is that flat revenue growth year-on-year or is that a revenue decline better than what we saw in 2017?","Joe Euteneuer","Yes. We will give you the specifics once we get to Toy Fair. We\u2019ll give you the whole line out of 2018.","Margo Georgiadis","And as I said before, stabilizing means in range of flat. And we\u2019ll come back with specifics. That\u2019s our goal.","Michael Ng","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Arpine Kocharyan with UBS.","Arpine Kocharyan","Thanks. I was wondering, how much of the SKU rationalization that hits revenue is actually behind Mattel? You have said before that you trimmed around 20% of 2018 launches for this year. And what is going on with Toy Box, it seems like there was a leadership change there recently. Just if you could breakdown sort of each of those headwinds you expect on top line for this year? And then I have a quick follow-up.","Margo Georgiadis","For 2018?","Arpine Kocharyan","For 2018.","Margo Georgiadis","For 2018. So as we\u2019ve talked about \u2013 as we look into 2018, we will see reduced pressures from the Highs, MEGA and those fragmented launches as you just said. So that clearly was a significant headwind for us this year. In addition, with the inventory issues now behind us, I was just sharing in the previous discussion, now down 20%, more than 20% in several brands. We will then shift what we sell in our cornerstone brands, Barbie, Hot Wheels and Fisher-Price. And that\u2019s extremely important to getting ourselves back on track.","I mean, just think about it. For Barbie, we were double-digit POS growth for the year. But we were negative two in shipments in 2017. So it\u2019s a very material dislocation in a very important brand. And then we also have a far stronger portfolio of owned brand and partner launches coming in to the franchise this year and you\u2019ll see a lot more about that in Toy Fair and I articulated several of those in my previous remarks. I won\u2019t repeat that again. So that\u2019s how you think about it.","Arpine Kocharyan","Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. And then a question for Joe. Could you perhaps talk about the cash situation this year and how much flexibility there is if demand for \u2013 in terms of top line, it doesn\u2019t hold up as anticipated? And if Toys \"R\" Us impact globally, it\u2019s a little bit more than a couple of percentage points on the full year basis. How much room there is for Mattel to navigate if it could be another surprisingly tough back half of 2018 in terms of cash need? Thank you.","Joe Euteneuer","Yes. We are very confident in our liquidity position going forward in 2018. That was the whole purpose of redoing the capital structure. The $1 billion gives us the initial $250 million to take care of the March maturity and also putting in the asset-backed loan will give us great flexibly going forward. So we feel very, very confident. Even though there\u2019s a lot of some potential headwinds that we can manage through the year.","Arpine Kocharyan","That\u2019s helpful. And then for a second, going back to the inventory number, I found that number pretty interesting. Margo, you mentioned inventory is down north of 20% at retail. And that\u2019s in general a good thing because it sort of allows you to ship in future periods. But if the retailer has adjusted these expectations and now that\u2019s a new base whereby it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you could more ship \u2013 you could ship more in the future, what does that really imply for sort of that underlying base shipment growth for 2018? Because you\u2019re absolutely right that there is huge gap between even if it\u2019s a wholesale POS but sort of huge gap between wholesale POS and the way you\u2019re actually shipping. How do those actually align?","Margo Georgiadis","They are very important in the sense that this year, we had consumer takeaway. But then we were not realizing the benefits of the incremental shipping because we needed to readjust the inventory levels. So next year, we\u2019ll have the positive POS and we will have the positive shipping to go with it. And so if you saw in Q4, and Barbie I think was the easiest and best example of that where you had POS and shipping in alignment across all markets. And we made the top decisions to ensure that we were in all markets aligned across our top brands.","So therefore going into next year, the POS and the shipping trends will align. So those \u2013 that can all flow together. So when you think about the fact that more than half of our decline this year in revenue was driven by the fact that we had a right size the retail inventory as well as some of those non-recurring brands, that will have a very material impact next year. So we can continue to optimize The Toy Box portfolio. So you\u2019ll see, as I said, the milestone, as you\u2019ll see our key power brands as a group growing with positive POS and shipping in alignment and that enables us to remix and improve the profitability of our Toy Box, so we have a stable and more profitable base of business on which we can grow going forward. So that\u2019s what gives us confidence going into 2018 to give you targets and hit them.","Arpine Kocharyan","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Tim Conder with Wells Fargo Securities.","Tim Conder","Thank you. A couple here. Margo, just to clarify, the decline that you mentioned was 20% each for American Girl and Thomas as you referred to earlier or 20% collective.","Margo Georgiadis","I was explaining. As you try to think about \u2013 since Michael was asking about what happened to sales and how do you think about the sales decline we experienced this year, I was explaining the proportions of what were the drivers behind sales decline to give you the confidence to understand that this was an extraordinary year. But our future performance will not be reflective of what\u2019s happened in 2017. So as explained, the only incremental growth driver this year were really Cars and Enchantimals due to that dislocation between POS and shipments.","So when you look at that negative 9% sales decline, think about half of that or a little more coming from the retail inventory reset and some of the non-recurring brands. But we do not expect that to recur next year. 30% to 40% of it from TRU. We now have advanced understanding of what\u2019s happening in their store base versus coming in October. So we can plan ahead and ensure that we are having a conservative and thoughtful approach to how we are managing through that in partnership with Toys \"R\" Us, and then 20% of the decline came from some of those challenges in our power brands, American Girl and Thomas.","As we announced, Thomas will have new content, the spend refreshed, we will have stronger retail distribution so we expect that brand to stabilize. And AG is the one brand that we are still in aggressive turnaround plans and we will share that with you at the end of Q1.","Tim Conder","Okay, okay. Thank you, thank you. And then on the fulfillment issues, how do you \u2013 what\u2019s your comfort with those being rectified here now as we move forward? Joe, I think you alluded to there could still be some. But by the time we get to the critical back half of the year, how do you feel about that? And then manufacturing, you cited that that will benefit still and that narrative hasn\u2019t changed, we\u2019ll benefit more of 2019. But can we get little bit more color on what\u2019s your expectations are with that footprint? Any additional color you can give us there?","Margo Georgiadis","So let me take the logistics piece and then \u2013 so follow up on the manufacturing side. We have a very bold plan that we\u2019ll continue to reveal to you. On the logistics side, the issue was not a fulfillment issue as much as it was. We had a cost issue. So we had a third-party contractor that we\u2019ve made a done a \u2013 contract done in the fourth quarter of 2016. And that initiative just didn\u2019t grow as well as was originally planned. So we now have a focused effort. So it\u2019s really a cost overrun for case movement on the shipping. So the reason we feel confident that we can remedy that is that we have now taken back control of that facility and we are well on track to moving that on the right direction.","So we do feel good about the progress that we are making. In addition, as you know, we\u2019ve been rightsizing retail inventories through the second and third quarter as we recognize the need to want to be much tighter in partnership with our retailers around ensuring the POS and shipments are in alignment. We now feel that we are in a very good position with our retailers there. So that going forward, we\u2019ll have that cadence far more optimized than we did clearly in this year. So do you want to\u2026","Tim Conder","Do you feel that the distribution center on the West \u2013 in the East Coast, excuse me, costly sales in Q4 as a result of all the logistics issues?","Margo Georgiadis","That\u2019s a tough question that we were not at optimal performance. So we do see that as an opportunity for us.","Tim Conder","Okay.","Joe Euteneuer","And in regards to the manufacturing \u2013 next question in regards to the manufacturing facilities. We\u2019ve been spending more time on it. We are very, very optimistic about what we have to do. We have to give with the local governments et cetera. But our plan is very, very aggressive and we feel very, very good and look forward to giving the details in the coming months. But we are a lot more confident now than when we first started talking about it just because we were into the details and things are accelerating at a great speed for us. So I\u2019m pretty happy about our progress.","Tim Conder","Okay, thank you both.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix of Barclays.","Felicia Hendrix","Hi, thank you. Can you \u2013 Margo, can you talk a little bit more about the announcement you made recently between Thomas and Nick Jr.? So may be how that benefits you and just some more details there. And then I know you have plans for improvement in American Girl and I know you\u2019re going to give us more detail in the first quarter. But do you expect that growth to be positive in 2018 or less negative? And finally, I\u2019m wondering if you could just share some thoughts on MEGA. The acquisition really hasn\u2019t been additive to the company since it was made. So what are you thinking about that?","Margo Georgiadis","Sure. Let me make sure you get all these in turn. On \u2013 let me take American Girl first. On American Girl, this is one of the \u2013 as you know, one of the most beloved and premium brands. What really drove dislocation in American Girl in the fourth quarter was that we had real challenges in the mass distribution strategy that was launched last year. We just were not able to comp that.","And as we really moved that franchise to refocus on its premium routes, truly premium experiences, products and a 360 experience which has been the hallmark of that product line, since it was originally launched and successful. I think I\u2019ve shared that I personally worked on that brand back in the early 2000 and it\u2019s right on trend with what people are looking for today, amazing. Parent child, grandparent child, family, experiences that are premium and create lifelong memories. So we just need to get back to that route.","So I think the best way to think about putting that into your model is the less negative. But what we want to do is the right decision so that we can put the premium back in that franchise and really invest behind it and that\u2019s what you\u2019ll be hearing more about in terms of investment, talent, et cetera. At the end of Q1, we just one incident drip feeding without we just lay out the whole plan to that. So you would have that to hand.","In the case of Thomas and Nick, we are really excited. The U.S. is the biggest market for Thomas. And while we have some distribution for our content, we weren\u2019t getting as much reach to that distribution to as many of the people that loved this franchise as we really wanted to. We\u2019ve also created new content. Thomas is going off of Sodor. He is going to travel the world. He\u2019s \u2013 we have great girl characters which will appeal to the broad gender appeal of this iconic brand.","And our partnership with Nick, we are really excited about is not just content activation on their channel which is the best case platform. It also includes the consumer-products activation program so that we can really continue to enhance and surround our fans with the 360 product experience, which is world-class.","So we are very excited about working with the Nickelodeon team to expand that franchise. And they obviously are a fantastic partner in doing that. We also have distribution in over 100 markets for existing and new content and we have received rave reviews about the quality of the content and the excitement behind it. So we feel really good about this being able to re-energize Thomas, which is such a wonderful, wonderful franchise for us. In terms of\u2026","Felicia Hendrix","Can you just talk about the consumer product activation just mechanically, how does work between Nick and Mattel?","Margo Georgiadis","We really don\u2019t get into those details. But it certainly enables us to take the best of both of our companies and a variable aggressive program that takes the best of both to accelerate that development. So for us, as we shared at the Investor Day, Thomas is one of our iconic brands in terms of its ability to really generate a very strong consumer product franchise and so this just enables us to continue to extend that best-in-class performance.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay. Sorry for interrupting.","Margo Georgiadis","No, that\u2019s okay. On MEGA and OutPLAY wasn\u2019t here for the acquisition of the company, it\u2019s a wonderful brand that\u2019s very powerful in the preschool space. And in that business, I think we\u2019ve made really some good decisions this year in terms of how to ensure that some of those iconic products like the MEGA BLOKS and there\u2019s some wonderful all-in-one, our full toys that did exceptionally well. We\u2019re also very pleased with the performance of our partnership with Pok\u00e9mon. We have had some of the other areas that we have shared in previous calls some challenges.","There were a lot of new licenses that were developed and some were really successful like Pok\u00e9mon and some were much less successful. And so as we reflect on what\u2019s the role of that brand within our franchise, we see a very important role for that franchise in the infant preschool space. The product is fabulous. Kids really love it. And then we are integrating it very successfully and have very strong sales. At American Girl, if you going to the store, you\u2019ll find really great construction set there in online they start really well. It\u2019s integrated into our Hot Wheels experience as well as Barbie as part of our construction \u2013 construction Barbie, which actually gets to build things and do different developmental activities related to it.","So we are very excited about that as a brand in its home base and integrated within our other products. And then I think we need to be very selective as we think about expanding into the license arena to make sure that we truly have breakthrough products as we did in the case of Pok\u00e9mon which really just became beloved by fans. And I think that we just need to hold that high bar on inspiration and creativity.","Felicia Hendrix","Thanks. And Joe, I know you gave us a number of things to think about on cost and you probably give more details at the Investor Day. But our gross margins for 2018, is there going to be a 4 in front of that number or a 3?","Joe Euteneuer","No. Look, we ultimately want to get to where we used to operate so this will be the first step and yes, we should be close to the 4s or in the 4s yet.","Margo Georgiadis","Well in the 4. We\u2019ll give more updates on the\u2026","Felicia Hendrix","Well into the 4s. Okay, and then last one, just Joe, so understanding again the spending, can you just give us a color on kind of the investing you\u2019re doing on systems like European inventory management which tend to run significant kind of \u2013 I don\u2019t know how you spread OpEx or CapEx dollars.","Joe Euteneuer","Yes. So there\u2019s a split between OpEx and CapEx. But yes, we are working on our ERP system and just really trying to get some consolidation of our systems. One is doing a marvelous job of doing that. It\u2019s not something that\u2019s going to happen overnight. But more importantly, it\u2019s really about getting everything in the cloud, so that we can have easy access to some of this information that is very hard to get to. So we have a very balanced approach to it. We feel very, very good that we are spending at the right levels and we will see the results here in the coming months as we go forward.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Susan Anderson with B. Riley FBR.","Susan Anderson","Hi, good evening. Thanks for taking my question. On the $650 million in savings, 1\/3 in 2018, how should we think about that flowing through? Is it going to be back half weighted or first-half? And then just to clarify, did you say some of it came through in the fourth quarter?","Joe Euteneuer","Yes. So in the fourth quarter, we recorded just over $40 million of severance, which is going to give us a run rate reduction in payroll going forward of about $50 million. And so when you think about these numbers, the 1\/3 and the 2\/3, the goal is to get everything out on a run-rate basis as you\u2019re exiting the year. And we\u2019ve gotten started and I think you\u2019re exactly right. Everything will be a little more back end loaded. But we are seeing some progress made to where we\u2019ve moved that 1\/3 up almost 40% up for this year, so for 2018.","So we will see how it all comes out. But we are going to try to get it out sooner rather than later and that\u2019s why we did the severance here in the fourth quarter to get things moving. We also shut down our Venezuela facility and start looking at facilities that can be shut down.","Susan Anderson","Great, that\u2019s helpful. And then just really quick, a follow-up on Toys \"R\" Us and inventory. So it sounds like you feel good about inventory at retail. I\u2019m assuming that does encompass kind of your view of the Toys \"R\" Us store closures and how you\u2019re going to kind of end out from that and where the inventory is going to go?","Joe Euteneuer","Yes.","Susan Anderson","Okay, great. Thank you so much.","Joe Euteneuer","We feel very good\u2026","Susan Anderson","Okay, perfect. Okay, great. Thank you so much. Good luck next quarter.","Joe Euteneuer","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian with Citi.","Fred Wightman","Hi, guys. This is actually Fred Wightman of for Greg. If you look at the NPD estimates for the year, I mean, U.S. up around 1% which is a bit of a step down from the mid-single digit rates that we\u2019ve seen for the past few years. I mean, I know there\u2019s some one-off issues with Toys \"R\" Us but what are you guys assuming for industry growth in the U.S. moving forward?","Margo Georgiadis","So we\u2019re optimistic for the industry. The fourth quarter results load, it was clearly less momentum from entertainment properties than we\u2019ve had in the past. At the same time, we are seeing strong growth in the areas that we\u2019re very focused on, which is franchised brands that offer immersive experience. And obviously, you asked about the U.S. But the emerging markets continued to deliver very strong growth. And obviously, trend based products where we have put in place our new team to really ensure that we are participating in that excitement. So in my view, the place that we are focusing on those things are doing well.","Fred Wightman","Okay, great. And then I think the language you guys used for Cars 3 was that it came in within range of your target. How should we be thinking about the ability to lap that as we head into 2018?","Margo Georgiadis","So we don\u2019t typically give specific guidance. But we do feel good about the property. It was a great partnership with Disney. The product is terrific and we did come within range of our target particularly with the strength in international organization. So we are expecting a solid year too and we\u2019ll provide more updates at Toy Fair.","Fred Wightman","Great, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steph Wissink with Jefferies.","Steph Wissink","Thanks, good evening everyone. I just want to focus in on the dolls portfolio if we could. I think Barbie looks quite strong. The Other Girls came in a bit below where we would have expected and I think in combination still down kind of mid-single digits in the fourth quarter. So as you look to 2018 and even beyond that, how should we think about the share transfer for Monster High to Barbie? How much more is there for Monster High to donate? And how much of a faster was that in Barbie\u2019s growth this year?","Margo Georgiadis","So as I shared earlier, we will have reduced pressure from the Highs, MEGA and the other fragmented launches going into next year. We feel really good about Enchantimals and its performance as well as Barbie. Barbie is a very different franchise. We don\u2019t see that as really necessarily taking share from Monster High. That brand\u2019s positioned very differently from Barbie. Barbie is about empowerment, career and imaginary play. So it \u2013 we don\u2019t view those as really overlapping properties. Just like we don\u2019t view Enchantimals as competing with Barbie either.","Steph Wissink","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then I think what you talked mostly about is your core focus brands. I think you\u2019ve classified in the past it\u2019s about 70% of the revenue. How should we think about the other 30% of the business? What kind of actions are you taking there to maybe streamline some of the portfolio? And how should we think about the capital deployment towards the non-core assets over the next couple of years?","Margo Georgiadis","So Stephanie, the way I \u2013 and we are actually going to actually change our reporting in Q1 because we think it will be very helpful and more transparent for you. We will be having our power brands, Barbie, Hot Wheels, Fisher-Price, Thomas and American Girl reported as the power brands. And then we will have The Toy Box separate with entertainment, partner brands and our owned brands so that you will be able to see those in a much more transparent way and then we can talk about them as think of buckets and you can track them over time.","We believe that\u2019s important as we move into the strategy. As we think about our investments in the company, we are just as passionate about our Toy Box brands as we are \u2013 our core brands and we believe that the investments that we are making in 360 play systems and experiences are equally applicable to both our power brands and how we bring the entertainment brands of our franchise partners to life and how we can improve our ability to launch and scale our own brands. So if you think about brands such as Enchantimals, especially in Europe, we had a really full 360 experience with kids and the brand was extremely successful, with a hammer breakout hit there and we will be taking that best practice and expanding into other markets.","And so the whole concept of how we approach it. As we think about our business, obviously in the near-term, our focus in 2018 is to really demonstrate consistent growth in our three Power Brands that I shared. That\u2019s a critical milestone for us, with that package of brands is growing and that we have POS and our shipping aligned.","As we think about the Toy Box, we are focused on remixing that to be a more stable and profitable growth of properties, both within our entertainment partnerships where we think about not just the A1 licenses that we are really committed to, but also as we think about innovative new coproduction arrangements which will have a much more attractive profit profile. As we think about our own brands, obviously we are focusing on the areas that we know that we have distinctive capabilities and also are very accretive to our franchise.","As you think about our expertise in dolls and girls properties, our expertise in gaming and games where we\u2019ve been very successful which this one of the reasons we are investing in an expansion of our UNO product that you\u2019ll see at Toy Fair. So expect to see us continue to lay that out for you. But we are looking at innovation in both. And then 2018 is all about stabilizing revenue, restoring the profitability through structural simplification and portfolio optimization and then staged investments in our growth, our five pillar growth strategy where we will demonstrate the seeds of opportunity systematically against those so that you can understand that we will have the engine room for growth going forward and profit improvement that you should expect from a market leader.","Steph Wissink","Thanks, Margo. Just a really quick one, Joe, on the tax. There\u2019s a lot of information that you provided around the tax act. But could you just clarify your comments on the deemed repatriation and some of the potential negative impacts, so I just want to make sure we understand on how to think about tax rate.","Joe Euteneuer","Yes, the simple way to think about it for us is that the new tax act is neutral. And then on the repatriation that we will inevitably have will be sort of immaterial. And the real benefit, we\u2019re getting out of the tax act is really the flexibility on the international cash management.","Steph Wissink","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Drew Crum with Stifel.","Drew Crum","Thanks. Good evening, everyone. I\u2019m wondering if you could quantify what e-commerce was as a percentage for gross sales and discuss how it performed during the quarter? And if you\u2019re seeing any change in the economics with those partners?","Margo Georgiadis","So we don\u2019t break out e-commerce as a separate channel within our partners. We just break out our top partner. And the share of e-commerce vary significantly across the world. So in Asia, it\u2019s half. UK that would be the second, about 30-plus percent, maybe 35% this year, and the U.S. is around 23%, 24%. Depending on the category, it varies significantly differently by category. So bigger ticket items like BabyTree tend to have \u2013 may be even up to 40%, 50% penetration. So it\u2019s a little bit hard to just give a broad average. We are very committed to being successful online and growing at a proportional share in that business and that\u2019s a very important focus area.","One of the reasons that we optimize our organization to really have our brand leaders focused on our global brand footprint and how we develop our brands and marketing and our product line, was so that they could specifically ensure that the way we think about our development is very thoughtful and responsive to the needs of the online channel. I think there are more and more transparent to the consumer, we have to make sure that we provide meaningful merchandise differentiation and consumer excitement in these different channels based on that kind of customers that are going to those sites. We also have to think a lot about our economics of the cube.","So what are the shipping costs for our items? And so we had to think about that end-to-end optimization and how that diversify buy market. And then that will enable our commercial leaders now that they are fully focused on the brand activation and having a dedicated management structure to each of our retailers on the channel or online only. We feel that we have a really strong execution set up now but consistent across all of our markets. Now clearly in China, that\u2019s your \u2013 your beachhead of your business. So that becomes everyone\u2019s business. Whereas in Latin America for example were online is just a very small penetration, it\u2019s a very different focus. It\u2019s much more of a marketing focus. Is that helpful?","Drew Crum","Yes, I appreciate the color. Separately, Margo, could you comment on the outlook for Fisher-Price in China this year? You announced a couple of initiatives last year with Alibaba and BabyTree. Are those going to be material to numbers in 2018?","Margo Georgiadis","We continue to feel very good about our Fisher-Price franchise in China. It is the preeminent learning and development brand for parents in the market. And the actions that we\u2019ve taken with BabyTree and Alibaba to create a truly distinctive parenting platform are continuing to enable us to differentiate. We also announced the development of learning and play centers which we\u2019ll launch in 2018 in partnership with Fosun. And so we are very excited to continue that expansion and the differentiation of that franchise in China. We did continue to grow in Fisher-Price some double digit in China and to take share. And we will continue to invest to build that business in the market.","Drew Crum","Okay. And then just one last question for me and kind of a follow-up to Steph\u2019s question may be asked differently. On licenses, there are some larger entertainment property that come up for renewal in the next couple of years. Just curious philosophically how you\u2019re thinking or what the company\u2019s exact appetite is for pursuing these and also your ability to do so, given the state of your balance sheet and cash flow? Thanks.","Margo Georgiadis","So we feel very good about our ability for the A1 licenses to be an exceptionally strong competitor particularly when they\u2019re in our wheelhouse which obviously is around dolls and action figures. But we are very strong in those markets and we truly believe we can bring distinctive experience in insights, design, manufacturing and commercial execution that are truly second to none.","I think it doesn\u2019t take much to compare some of the products that have been taken over and created by others next to our products to understand the enormous difference in quality that we can deliver at the same price point at a very attractive margin. So we feel very strong about our ability to bring not just a best-in-class design and insight. But also to leverage our capabilities in other areas to ensure that we can provide a differential value proposition.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Handler with MKM Partners.","Eric Handler","Yes, thanks for taking the question. Actually two questions from Joe. Joe, I wonder if you could sort of give us what the base EBIT is in terms of what you\u2019re guiding from before the $650 million of cost savings? And then secondly, what are you thinking at this point your interest expense for the year looks like?","Joe Euteneuer","So interest expense will be up on a year-over-year basis just because we put in place to $1 billion of 6.75% and then during the year, remember we are going to lose $250 million that much lower interest rate. So interest expense will clearly be up. Look, we talked about, we release that in December and when I first guide on the third quarter phone call about our aspirations and turning the company around in two years and getting back to the levels of margins and stuff that we\u2019ve seen historically. It\u2019s not all going to get done in one fell swoop.","So it\u2019s going to take a two step process, 2018 is that sort of reestablishing process. So when you hear things like being flat on the top line and trying to become self sustainable, that\u2019s sort of the initial goal. And then once you get that under control, you can sort of grow from there. But that is taking into account the added new interest expense, that\u2019s taking into account the fact that we think we have a good capital program. But it also takes into account that we\u2019re going to continue to invest concurrently with the turnaround, so that we can build future revenue streams and profitability for the company going forward.","Eric Handler","Okay. And then one for Margo. Margo, I\u2019m curious that you talked for a while about the company for a long time, it\u2019s had a revenue issue. And with all the changes that have occurred at the company, do you feel like there\u2019s enough creative talent to facilitate that turnaround?","Margo Georgiadis","So I definitely do. What inspired me from the first day were the people that I met. Their incredible passion and insight into kids and decades of proven ability to create and sustain some of the most beloved franchises that were ever created in this industry. So that passion in this company still there. As we\u2019ve talked about a couple of years ago when we lost the Disney Princess franchise and then our Monster High franchise, but it started to go through a natural cycle, evolutionary cycle that you see with entertainment-led properties, we had a choice. So we rightsize the company to a new base business \u2013 in order, we tried to outrun those losses. And the decision that was made and as really wasn\u2019t here. So I can reflect on it, all I can see is the aftermath of that.","The decision was made to outrun them with a very aggressive set of launches and promotion programs over a couple of years. And as we\u2019ve talked openly about, that decision inadvertently led to the issues that we\u2019ve had in 2017 where you sort of got the trifecta of issues, right? You have the combination of inventory misalignment, with the planning misalignment, we started with the year the a high single-digit growth which was a little bit too aggressive. We had too high aspirations for the year twos of a number of these new launches, so that led to dislocations in a long lead cycle business. And then we added to that the TRU bankruptcy. And some usually quite manageable issues that you can have from time to time with some of your brands as they go through different life cycle transition.","So we just had all of those at once in one year, which is why we keep talking about how 2017 was just an extraordinary year but does not reflect what this brand franchises are capable of. And that\u2019s why we\u2019ve continued throughout the entire year to focus the discussion on the real consumer takeaway that\u2019s happening against these brands. The fact that Barbie is delivering this on the third year of high \u2013 mid-to-high single-digit growth and it\u2019s driven by consumer passion for that franchise, it\u2019s following in social media, it\u2019s excitement on YouTube and the willingness of kids to fall in love with this content on Netflix and we are only continuing to expand those initiatives.","Hot Wheels continuing to grow in the face of a very successful launch of Cars 3, because we\u2019ve really differentiated them, they are two very different properties that serve a different passion point for kids and families. And that\u2019s why the Hot Wheels franchise continues to be very successful because this is just a fantastic play part. And the combination of die-cast cars, play sets and the opportunity now to expand into construction and younger kids offers us a really strong growth opportunity in that franchise. And I could go on with each one of our franchises.","So the reason why we\u2019re optimistic about the future is we know and have a very strong strategy for how we want to grow this company in a profitable way that\u2019s truly differentiated, anchored on Power Brand franchises and capabilities and then our ability to think that capability set and use it to activate innovation in our Toy Box whether it\u2019s with our wonderful entertainment partners or creating next-generation launches in spaces where existing brands aren\u2019t competing. And we feel that we are starting the year in 2018 in a much better position in terms of retail inventory. So our sales will fully reflect the consumer takeaway. Our economic model is now reset with the tough decisions that we made to take the write-downs that we needed to do and our structural simplification program which is well underway and that will restore our profitability.","And this year, it\u2019s our plan. We are going to set realistic revenue expectations and we are going to align our operating costs all the way down to P&L. If you\u2019ve heard from Joe, we have issues all the way down to the P&L because of the very high plan we started with and where we ended. That will not happen this year. And we have a fully new leadership team and a much stronger organization structure and the incentives to get the job done. So that\u2019s how I view where we are and we hope that our investors will be able to keep it in a perspective and appreciate that we are making the tough decisions to reinvigorate this incredible franchise and we hope that you will be at Toy Fair you can see how magical the product is and how wonderful the creative team.","Eric Handler","Great, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of William Reuter with Bank of America.","William Reuter","Hey, guys. I\u2019ve got a couple. The first one is for Joe. I just want to make sure I understand the 15% decline in gross margins. I think when you were breaking down the different percentages you said that 40% of it was due to the write-down of inventory. I guess one did I hear that correctly, which should be about 6%? And two will that be kind of one-time-ish nature in your opinion?","Joe Euteneuer","Yes, I mean, look \u2013 we are \u2013 on that one, we clearly went and tried to clean up as much as we can, while we never have another inventory write-off in the future. Now we probably will have some. But we tried to get the majority out now and shouldn\u2019t have any of these large repeating items like we have now. It\u2019s all about better management on a going forward basis and making sure that we are setting up our inventory to the match the demand out there rather than building ahead of it.","William Reuter","Okay. And just to make sure I understand. You did not add that back to adjusted EBITDA number that write-down of inventory. Did you?","Joe Euteneuer","No, no.","William Reuter","Okay. And then just my second question is with the 40% of the $650 million of cost savings you think you can achieve this year, I know you\u2019re going to be reinvesting $170 million over the next two years in some technology. But other than that, should we assume that the remainder of those cost savings will flow through to the bottom line?","Joe Euteneuer","Yes. Remember we said that $650 million would be net. But remember, we also talk about $200 million of implementation of which $40 million came here in the fourth quarter with the severance plan that we put in place. So we still have about another $160 million of implementation that will be one-time to touch certain areas over the two-year.","William Reuter","Thanks for taking my questions. Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Whitney Steininger for any closing remarks.","Whitney Steininger","There will be a replay of this call available via webcast and audio beginning at 8:00 p.m. Eastern time today.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host, Mr. Drew Vollero, Senior Vice President of Corporate Strategy and Investor Relations. Mr. Drew Vollero, please go ahead.","Drew Vollero","Thanks, Janine. As you know, this morning, we reported Mattel's 2013 fourth quarter and fiscal year-end financial results. We'll provide you with a slide presentation to help guide our discussion today. The slide presentation and the information required by Regulation G regarding non-GAAP financial measures is available on the Investors and Media Section of our corporate website, corporate.mattel.com.","In a few minutes, Bryan Stockton, Mattel's Chairman and CEO; and Kevin Farr, Mattel's CFO, will provide comments on the results, and then the call will be open for your questions.","Certain statements made during the call may include forward-looking statements related to the future performance of our overall business, brands and product lines. These statements are based on currently available information, and they're subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties, which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.","We described some of these uncertainties in the Risk Factors section of our 2012 annual report on Form 10-K and our 2013 quarterly reports on Forms 10-Q and in other filings we make with the SEC from time to time, as well as in other public statements. Mattel does not update forward-looking statements and expressly disclaims any obligation to do so.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bryan.","Bryan G. Stockton","Thank you, Drew, and good day, everyone. The fourth quarter of 2013 was a disappointing conclusion to what had been a pretty strong year for Mattel. Our financial performance in the quarter was below our expectations, driven by revenue declines in the U.S. market, partially offset by emerging market growth and sound financial management. No question, the holiday retail environment in 2013 was very dynamic and challenging. Consumer behavior evolved quickly as retail foot traffic fell, while online purchases grew. Additionally, consumers were more discount oriented, particularly towards the end of the holiday shopping period. Despite these shifts, the overall toy industry proved once again it can hold up well. And as predicted, consumers did finally make their toy purchases for the all-important holiday season.","For Mattel, unlike prior years, our product innovations and our marketing programs were not strong enough to drive growth for our core categories like dolls, infant, preschool and vehicles. And as a result, advertising expenses as a percentage of net sales were higher than planned due to a lack of sales leverage. Despite these challenges, we delivered strong gross margins and lowered overhead expenses, which helped to partially offset the revenue shortfall.","The fourth quarter was clearly disappointing, but I've said in the past, we don't manage the business quarter-to-quarter. For the full year, revenues grew 1%, our fourth consecutive year of growth. We increased gross margins to 53.6%. We delivered 4% EPS growth versus last year's adjusted EPS, and we returned nearly $1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases while ending the year with $1 billion of cash on hand.","Before we talk about Mattel's performance in more detail, let me talk a little bit about the holiday retail environment and the toy space. From my perspective, the 2013 holiday period has to be one of the most transformative I've seen, particularly here in the United States. Consumers came out much later and less frequently to brick-and-mortar stores with ShopperTrak showing retail foot traffic in stores to be down as much as 15%.","Per NPD, holiday sales came later this year with a higher percentage of sales in December compared to last year. Consumers continue to shop more online as they have all year long. Cyber Monday sales were up 16%, and we saw similar gains for the online channel throughout the holiday season. And while consumers ultimately bought, they seem to have done a lot more online research than they had in the past, and they were more deliberate, focusing on discounts and deals.","So what we saw as the season progressed was consumers going into retail stores less frequently, going later and being very focused with their purchases. As a result, it seems retailers began to discount aggressively and limited their reorders to manage their inventory.","With toy fair season well underway, we'll be meeting with our retail partners to supplement on our analysis of what happened, why and how we may modify our approach for the 2014 holiday season. Despite these shifts, I was encouraged to see how well the industry held up. Per NPD, overall industry trends for the year did not change with the U.S. business down slightly and the Euro 5 market essentially flat. Our international results and our boots on the ground also lead us to believe their solid growth in other emerging and developing markets. As usual, new innovation brought energy to the toy aisle with strong growth in youth electronics, as well as some hot entertainment properties and new products.","Shifts in sales between categories are normal for the toy business and 2013 was no different. Unfortunately for Mattel, during the holiday period, U.S. NPD results showed the key categories we play in, dolls, infant preschool and vehicles, performed below the industry average. In the end, 2013 looked a lot like the past decade for toys with a relatively flat market in mature markets and growth in emerging and developing markets.","Now turning to our results. It was clear that our innovation and end market execution did not resonate with consumers enough to achieve our sales goals. Mattel's U.S. POS for the year finished down high single digits, and while our international POS results were better, they were still below our expectations. As a result of our POS performance, Mattel did not achieve its goal to reduce retail inventory. Mattel's retail inventory in the U.S. is up slightly compared to 2012. And while our visibility to international retail inventory is limited, we do see pockets of inventory that vary by market and brand.","Over the last few years, we planned and executed well during the holiday season. And while I believe we continue to excel in some areas in 2013, I thought we came up short in others. With the benefit of hindsight, let the take a minute to share my thoughts on a couple of areas where it seemed like we could have done better in 2013, marketing and product innovation.","First, our marketing came up short on a couple of key dimensions. We invested heavily in advertising and promotions in the quarter, but the effectiveness of our in-store commercial and promotion activities was hit and miss, generally less effective than last year and well below our expectations. While there's no doubt that this is partially driven by less in-store traffic and the evolution in consumer behavior, we did not maximize the effectiveness of our spending. As we move forward into 2014, we'll need to better partner with retailers to optimize our spending. And while our efforts in product innovation were good, they just weren't good enough in 2013. According to NPD, Mattel had 12 of the top 50 toys in the U.S. in 2013, but it was still below last year's number of 14. In 2012, we had strong product innovation in areas like Games and Radica with Angry Birds and Fijit that we were not able to replicate in 2013. Our performance with our core brands of Barbie and Fisher-Price were also particularly disappointing in the quarter.","While I believe our product innovation, marketing, promotion and packaging surrounding these core brands was better, it wasn't as effective as we had planned. In 2013, Barbie advertising and promotional activity was focused on her lifestyle and play patterns. Accessories like the Dreamhouse and Camper did very well. In fact, the Barbie Dreamhouse was the #1 item for Barbie this holiday season and shows us that girls still love to play with Barbie. The reality is we just didn't sell enough Barbie dolls. And while we had 2 video releases in the fall, only 1 met our expectations, and the other came up short.","Overall, global shipments for the brand ended down mid-single digits, but was pretty aligned with POS.","In the U.S., shipments were down sharply in the fourth quarter, but POS was stronger than shipments.","And as for Fisher-Price, we had some great products like the Laugh & Learn Crawl Around Car, as well as some great Thomas products in entertainment, but it simply wasn't enough to offset other parts of the business. And while I was happy with the full year results for Fisher-Price Friends, the fourth quarter had some challenging comps with last year's launch of Disney's Jake and the Never Land Pirates and Dora's 10th anniversary.","Overall, Mattel built a plan to grow in the fourth quarter and built inventory accordingly. Unfortunately, sales declined, and as a result, our Mattel-owned inventories are up.","One piece of good news is the quality and the mix of this inventory is good, allowing us the opportunity to optimize and ship the inventory over the course of this year. In the near term, this will likely mean inventories from Mattel in 2014 versus '13 will be higher.","As I mentioned earlier, while the fourth quarter was disappointing, we still grew in 2013 for the fourth consecutive year. And there were some bright spots in the quarter, so I'd like to highlight both markets and categories where we are executing well. First, we saw a good momentum in many of our international markets with very strong growth in the emerging markets. Eastern Europe is doing well, led by strong growth in Russia, where we nearly tripled our sales in 2013. Asia continues to grow with our investment in China continuing to exceed expectations with sales up once again high double digits. And in Latin America, we achieved about $1 billion in sales for the third year in a row despite some economic headwinds.","Second, I continue to like what I see in our Girls portfolio, which grew slightly in the quarter. Monster High consumer takeaway globally was up double digits in the quarter and for the year. We're encouraged that the early reads and initial placement of Ever After High and Disney Princess gained a lot of momentum in the fourth quarter with Sofia the First, and Frozen. And we saw continued strength with American Girl. Our TV advertising continued to be effective and Saige was an outstanding Girl of the Year. We saw positive results with our e-commerce entry into Canada, and our retail expansion in the U.S. continues to be a strong driver of growth. Simply put, sales across all channels of American Girl grew in 2013, driven by great product and a very effective omni-channel marketing and sales strategy.","As I mentioned earlier, I felt we managed the P&L well in light of the challenges in the fourth quarter. We ended the year with an 18% operating margin, equal to last year's adjusted margin. We achieved this by continuing to focus on gross margin, posting our fifth consecutive year at\/or above 50%.","Another contributor to solid operating margins is the fact that we are a pay-for-performance company. We clearly didn't meet our internal expectations for performance, which reduced our incentive and equity compensation pools, resulting in reduced SG&A expense in the quarter.","Mattel's sound economic model continues to generate significant cash flow, and we've deployed much of it to shareholders. In 2013, we were able to reward our shareholders with solid dividend growth and opportunistic share repurchases. We paid out almost $1 billion in dividends and share repurchases, and today, we announced a 6% increase in 2014's first quarter dividend. And we ended the year with $1 billion in cash on hand, which gives us tremendous flexibility as we enter 2014.","So as we move into 2014, I want to spend a few minutes talking about where we're heading and what we need to focus on in the near term. As we move forward, we remain committed to our long-term growth strategies and our where to grow and how to grow roadmaps. Our long-term goals remain grounded in total shareholder return, and we continue to target to achieve top third to top quartile performance. This means a commitment of 6% to 8% profit growth over the long term. We need the commitment to grow and continue to be financially disciplined while doing it.","So in the short term, here are the activities we're going to focus on. First, we need to improve the performance of our core brands through more innovative products supported by more effective advertising and promotions. Next, we need to drive our overall POS higher, particularly in North America. We need to evolve our demand creation strategies to better align with the changing consumer environment and make our advertising and promotion dollars work harder and go farther.","As I said earlier, our Mattel-owned inventories are higher, and retail inventories are slightly higher. We need to work through pockets of inventory that vary by brand and market. While the inventory position is small relative to our full year shipments, we expect to see a modest impact to our shipments over the next few quarters as retailers sell through this inventory. As you would expect, we're working closely with our retail partners to better understand the changing consumer dynamics, and we'll adjust our 2014 consumer engagement strategies accordingly to ensure we're targeting the consumer, where they are and when they are ready to buy. And I look forward to sharing with you all the new things coming in 2014 in a couple of weeks.","As I told you in October, Mattel begins with investing in our core brands and will continue to bring innovation to all of them. We'll continue to invest in the emerging markets and consumer engagement. We'll be annualizing and building up the success of a number of great launches and additions we had in 2013, including Ever After High, Disney's Sofia the First and Frozen, our American Girl retail expansion and move into Canada, Max Steel, Disney's Planes and a full year of Thomas on the PBS network feed. We'll also begin new partnerships with Marvel, Minecraft and Star Wars, and we'll bring some clarity to a whole new category launch for spring that I teased you with at our Analyst Day in October.","Our path to growth remains in our core brands, in creating new franchises and partnering with the best entertainment partners and leveraging our global infrastructure. I still believe we have the strongest and most diversified portfolio of brands, countries and customers in the business.","Thank you for taking the time with us today, and I look forward to seeing you in a few weeks in New York. And now, I'd like to turn it over to Mattel's Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Farr. Kevin?","Kevin M. Farr","Thank you, Bryan, and good morning, everyone. As Bryan noted, our fourth quarter performance came in below expectations, driven by revenue declines from the U.S. that were partially offset by sound financial management. As we entered the all-important fourth quarter, our revenues and profitabilities were consistent with our long-term goals. We planned to grow, built the inventory and built the marketing and advertising plan to support it, and we came up short. As Bryan noted, while we did grow slightly for the year, we did not reach our objectives primarily due to the revenue shortfall in the fourth quarter. For the year, revenues grew 1%. Operating margins were a healthy 18%, and earnings per share increased 4% over last year's adjusted EPS.","Before we review the slide deck, I want to comment on 4 areas: our progress on Operational Excellence 3.0, our balance sheet, our capital deployment and an update on our business investments. First, we made terrific progress in our Operational Excellence 3.0 cost savings program. For the quarter, we had over $30 million gross savings and finished $10 million ahead of our 2013 goal of $50 million. These savings were necessary to offset the commodity and marketplace cost pressures that we experienced in the quarter. Moving forward, we're well positioned to deliver our 2-year savings target of $175 million.","Second, as you look at our balance sheet, what stands out is that Mattel-owned inventory is up 22% or about $100 million. While some of the increase in inventory is a result in rising cost, we finished the year with more inventory than planned since we did not meet our sales objectives for the fourth quarter. As we go forward, we expect to optimize the disposition of most of these inventories during the first few quarters of the year. As a result, we expect to have higher inventory balances throughout 2014.","Third, we continue to focus on capital deployment, balancing dividends and share repurchases throughout the year. And today, we announced our first quarter 2014 dividend $0.38 per share, which annualizes to $1.52 or a 6% increase from 2013. This represents about a 59% payout ratio of 2013 EPS, and it's consistent with our EPS growth in 2013. We also repurchased $83 million of shares in the quarter and $469 million for the year. We will continue to be opportunistic about investments in our own stock.","Fourth, I'm very pleased with the traction we're getting on our strategic growth investments. Our emerging market investments in China and Russia were key drivers of our Asia-Pacific and European growth in the quarter. Our investment in expanding American Girl retail footprint is a big part of that brand's growth story, and our investment in new American Girl omni-channel system is timely given the changing retail environment and the ongoing shift to customers online. In 2014, both American Girl and Mattel will have an enhanced digital capabilities to market and transact across multiple channels. The system is now being implemented and is expected to go live in the middle of 2014.","And finally, with our 2 most recent investments in new franchises, Max Steel and Ever After High, we expect to recoup the original investments and more as we work to maximize the global reach in 2014.","Now let's move onto Page 4 of our slide deck. You can see that our worldwide gross sales were down 6% for the quarter and up 1% for the year. The primarily driver was POS, which was below our expectations. Mattel's U.S. POS for the year finished on high-single digits, and while our international POS results are better, they were still below our goals for the year.","Let's turn to Page 5 and 6 of the slide presentation to review sales by brand. Worldwide sales for Mattel Girls & Boys brands were down 4% for the quarter and up 3% for the year. Our Girls performer -- or Girls portfolio performed well with Monster High as a clear standout and Disney Princess was also up, too. As Bryan noted, we are happy with the launch of Ever After High and believe it is well positioned to grow on a global basis in 2014. And while Barbie performed well below our expectation in North America, the performance internationally, which is about 2\/3 of the total business, was better.","Our Wheels business was down both in the quarter and the year with solid performance in Hot Wheels basic cars offsetting underperforming Hot Wheels tracks and play sets. Our Wheels business overall was also impacted by declining sales in our Matchbox and radio-controlled lines.","A number of entertainment properties did well in 2013 including Disney Planes and Max Steel. As expected, we did not -- we did experience a decline in Cars 2 sales as consumers were introduced to Planes. And our Superman line met expectations but was unable to comp last year's Batman movie launch. And our Games and Radica business declined as it was not able to match the sales in 2012 of popular toys associated with Angry Birds and Fijit.","Worldwide sales for Fisher-Price brands were down 13% for the quarter and 6% for the year. We continue to see declines in our core Fisher-Price and Power Wheels businesses, which were partially offset by full year growth in Fisher-Price brands. For the quarter, Fisher-Price brands were down due to tough comparisons to last year's fourth quarter successes of Disney's Jake and the Never Land Pirates and Dora's 10th anniversary promotion.","American Girl continues to deliver strong results with sales in the fourth quarter up 3% and sales up 11% for the year. Our 2013 Girl of the Year Saige, and American Girl retail stores continue to drive growth for the brand.","Our International business, as seen on Page 7, had flat sales for the quarter and was up 5% for the year. The solid growth in Europe is encouraging in light of the economic headwinds that continue in that region. Latin America recorded its third straight year of annual growth sales of about $1 billion with strength in Max Steel offset by some softness in Brazil and a continuing unfavorable foreign currency environment. Our Asia-Pacific region continues to be a source of great opportunity for Mattel with our results in China particularly encouraging.","Now let's review the P&L starting on Page 8 of the slide presentation. For the fifth year in a row, Mattel has delivered gross margins at\/or above 50%. The fourth quarter gross margin rate of 54.5% was up 20 basis points compared to last year's record quarter. For the full year, gross margin was 53.6%, which was up 50 basis points versus the prior year. The improvement was driven by OE 3.0 savings, favorable mix and our pricing actions, which helped offset increased input costs.","As seen on Page 9 of the slide presentation, selling, general and administrative expense decreased in the fourth quarter by 120 basis points to 18.4% of net sales as compared to last year's adjusted spending. For the year, SG&A expenses increased slightly by 20 basis points to 24.1% in net sales compared to last year's adjusted spending. This increase reflects higher employee-related expenses, higher spending on strategic growth investments and the second quarter intangible impairment related to Polly Pocket, which were partially offset by lower incentive and equity compensation accruals, lower HIT integration expenses and net savings from OE 3.0 initiatives.","Page 10 of the presentation summarizes the performance of our O.E. 3.0 cost savings program. As I noted earlier, we exceeded our 2013 targeted savings by $10 million, and we're well positioned to deliver $175 million of sustainable savings by the end of 2014.","Turning to Page 11. For the quarter, operating income was $479.3 million, down 6% but flat as a percentage of net sales versus last year's adjusted fourth quarter results. For the full year 2013, we delivered operating income of approximately $1.2 billion with an operating margin of 18%, which was equal to last year's adjusted results.","Turning to Page 12. Our fourth quarter earnings per share was $1.07, down 4% versus last year's adjusted EPS of $1.12. Earnings per share for the full year of 2013 was $2.58, up 4% versus adjusted 2012 EPS of $2.47, driven primarily by improved operating income and a lower worldwide effective tax rate partially offset by a slightly higher share count.","Page 13 summarizes acquisitions, integrations and other costs related to the HIT acquisition. We incurred integration costs of less than $1 million in the quarter and about $5 million for the year, which are down significantly from 2012 when we made the acquisition.","Now let's turn to cash flow on Page 14 of the slide presentation. Cash flow from operations for the year was $698 million, a decrease of $577 million compared to 2012. The decrease was driven primarily by higher working capital usage, which included the $138 million payment of a previously accrued litigation judgment, partially offset by higher net income. Investing activities were down significantly compared to 2012, which included our acquisition of HIT. Accordingly, we increased our share repurchases in 2013, and we ended the year with $1 billion of cash on the balance sheet, so we continue to have plenty of flexibility.","Page 15 summarizes 2 key components of our capital investment framework: Our dividends and share repurchases. In 2013, Mattel returned almost $1 billion to shareholders. Dividends continue to be a key driver for Mattel's total shareholder returns. Another important component of our framework is share repurchases. In 2013, we repurchased 11 million shares at a cost of $469 million. Mattel will continue to deploy excess cash consistent with its long-standing capital investment framework, which includes investing in our business, paying a top quartile dividend, repurchasing shares and executing targeted mergers and acquisitions.","So in summary, we're very disappointed in the fourth quarter where we planned to grow and came up short. But we're encouraged by the fact that despite the quarter, we were still able to grow for the year. Our mix of strong brands, our international infrastructure and our diverse global customer base remain a proven formula that consistently delivers superior cash flow and continues to be a strong foundation to deliver top third to top quartile total shareholder returns. We'll continue to look to grow our business consistently, grow it profitably and deploy the cash generated in value-enhancing ways to reward our shareholders.","That concludes my review of the financial results. Now we'd like to open the call to questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Drew Crum of Stifel.","Andrew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So Bryan, you guys fell short of the 6% to 8% operating profit growth target you've set out. Can you just comment on your expectations or how you feel about achieving that growth level in 2014? And then secondly, can just you talk about where you are with the turnaround for Fisher-Price? This is something you guys have been asked for the last couple of years. Kind of assess what worked and what did not work in '13 and what the plans are for '14.","Bryan G. Stockton","I'm not going to give you any specific guidance as it relates to 2014. You're right. Our long-term goal was to deliver a 6% to 8% profit growth, and that drives our TSR model so that we deliver the upper third to upper quartile TSR. The way that we think about that is we have a variety of levers to pull. Revenue is a lever. Gross margin is a lever. The middle of the P&L is a lever. And we approach every year a little bit differently trying to get an understanding of where we think opportunities are on each of those particular levers. Now if I look at 2013, we obviously thought that revenue was going to be a stronger lever for us. We made steps in investments and advertising and inventory and things of that nature to do that. So we still feel good about that. Kevin, do you want to add anything to that?","Kevin M. Farr","Yes, thank you. I think as you mentioned, Drew, that our 2013 results were below expectations. So I think we need to execute better in 2014. And I think near term, a key focus will be to improve our domestic POS and working through retail and company-owned inventories and really making our advertising and trade spending working harder for us next year. And as we develop our annual financial plan, we'll balance those key P&L levers that Bryan talked about across our business to achieve these goals.","Bryan G. Stockton","So let me address the Fisher-Price question, Drew. Clearly, we're disappointed with Fisher-Price in 2013, and frankly, it's frustrating to me because I've seen isolated examples of us getting the strategy and the marketing execution right. But we just haven't been able to see consistently across the brand. For example, Fisher-Price Friends did well, driven by Thomas and HIT, as well as the Octonauts, for example. Some of our emerging market, products did very well. We had success in Laugh & Learn products. So there are some pockets, but the -- I just think there's so much potential for this brand when we get it right. And I think the example I'd use is probably China. In China, Fisher-Price was just named the top baby brand in 2013 by Parents Magazine, which I believe is the #1 magazine for parents in China. As you know, we've been investing in Fisher-Price, the brand, for the last couple of years pretty heavily, and we've seen our Fisher-Price business grow in double digits. So we feel very positive about that. And the good news is China is a country where they're relaxing the one child policy. So I see us doing well in China. We just need to figure out how we export what we've done there to more countries and more categories. Now as we -- as I reflect back on what we said on the third quarter call, we said it's all about improving POS for Fisher-Price. We plan to grow. We -- again, we put the promotional programs and built the inventory. We thought we had the consumer engagement plans and -- but we just came up short. Now having said that, we've talked a lot about the new advertising and packaging and things like that, and the consumer testing we've done does suggest that it's stronger. I think what it comes down to is the product and our execution just didn't work as well as we had hoped in the fourth quarter. We didn't have enough differentiation in our products. Some of the marketing and promotional programs that we activated at retail didn't seem to work as well as we would have liked. Interesting for both Barbie and Fisher-Price, those 2 brands, I hesitate to use the word over-indexed, but they are pretty retail promotion heavy brands when I compare the activity that retailers work with us on, on those brands compared to the other brands in the portfolio. So I think that may have had some impact on Fisher-Price POS. And when we look at Friends, we had a tough quarter from a comp standpoint. We were comping essentially year 1 of Jake and Dora's 10th anniversary, as I mentioned in my comments. So we still think we can leverage this brand globally. We've proven that we can do it in some markets. We've got to really work hard this year on getting our innovation right, tweak the marketing message and continue to really push our Friends business, which we think still has a fantastic portfolio of brands. We're excited about our partners. We're excited about Thomas. We spent a lot of time last year focusing on improving execution, and we bored you with stories about Televisa in Mexico and getting to the PBS network feed. So we have, I think, some positive things to think about on Fisher-Price. But it all boils down to better innovation, better marketing, better sales execution.","Operator","The next question is from Greg Badishkanian of Citigroup.","Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So Bryan, I know Mattel never manages for a quarter, and sometimes that helps or hurt you in any one particular quarter. And there were a lot of changes in terms of the holiday -- for the holiday, the consumer shopping patterns. So which issues do you think were isolated just to the fourth quarter? And which of those issues are going to carry forward into 2014? Just kind of thinking about fourth quarter and how much -- what type of run rate we should be thinking about for next year?","Bryan G. Stockton","I'd start first with the toy category. We feel good about the toy category. It performed well especially relative to history. And I think there were a lot of concerns about toys this year with the launch of a couple new video game platforms and a variety of other things. So we felt pretty good about the toy category performance. So I would say that's -- I don't know if it's a tailwind, but it's certainly not a headwind. Our brands, we feel good about. We invested a lot in the brands, and so we think there's a lot of good opportunity there. Online, we think, is really important. We've talked a lot about that channel and the investments we made there. Our American Girl online business continues to grow, and I know Kevin has talked to you about our investment in a project we call Launchpad, which improves our omni-channel capabilities with American Girl. And I think as we see consumer shift back and forth almost seamlessly between in-store and online, that's going to be a really important investment for us. So I think those things are going to be things that are positive for us. I would also say we spend a lot of time every year really reflecting on lessons learned for us. Our promotional spending and advertising did not work as well as we would have liked. We're just spending a lot of time, as you can imagine, now reviewing that. As I mentioned, we're going to be working with our retailers and trying to understand from their perspective what else is going on that could help us. And I think the other thing that is good that we can look forward to is we're -- I think, we're doing a pretty good job of connecting. We're connecting with Fisher-Price moms. We know that. We're connecting with girls with Barbie and Ever After and Monster High. We're connecting with boys on Fisher-Price. I think the challenge for us this year is to grow from connection to conversion. And that is, I think, something whether it's in-store conversion, if there are going to be fewer feet going in-stores in 2014, which we don't know, but we need to figure out how we convert those feet more sharply. Online, we need to figure out how we're going to get better conversions.","Kevin M. Farr","Yes. I think on that, I think the consumers' path to purchase is evolving, and I think that's here to stay, Greg. I think what we're going to do is sit down with retailers to really look at what -- how we optimize our advertising spend and our trade programs to basically connect with consumers and convert and get more lift out of that spend, existing spending.","Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","How long do you think that'll take you to kind of work out a strategy and implement?","Bryan G. Stockton","Well, the good news is, we've got a lot of smart people looking at this, and we've got very strong relationships and partnerships with our retailers around the world. So everybody's working on it now. Our intention would be to work on the lessons learned from 2013 and implement in the fall of '14. And if we can implement something before that, that would be great.","Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then just one other question. Inventory levels were up a bit -- at retailer up a little bit in terms of what you hold on your books. In the first half, how much are -- will you need to assist your retail customers to sell some of that inventory, so looking at kind of the margin impact of increased discounting at the retailer and you're kind of helping them with that?","Kevin M. Farr","Okay, Greg, let me take that one. I think I'd step back for a second, say, makes sense for me to answer your question to comment about retail inventories, and Mattel-owned inventories at year-end 2013. With respect to retail inventories, as always, we encourage you to speak with retailers. That said, with respect to retail inventories, we've got better information in the U.S., so consider this directional. We estimate retail inventories are up slightly versus last year, low single digits. We've got pockets of challenges by both brand and retailer. We also have pockets of inventory challenges in certain international markets. And as always, we're going to work with retailers in the near term to optimize sell-through by developing retail programs to work through inventory over the first few quarters. We expect the higher retail inventories will modestly impact our overall 2,000 shipments in the first few quarters. If we turn now to our Mattel-owned inventories, as you know, we plan to grow and build the inventory accordingly. And due to declines in sales in the fourth quarter, we ended 2013 with more inventory than we planned where year-over-year inventories increased by about 22% or $104 million to $569 million. Given the size of Mattel, this is a relatively minor amount on a full year basis. And as Bryan said, our inventory, our Mattel-owned inventory is in relatively good shape. So we're currently developing program to optimize the sale of Mattel-owned inventory over the next few quarters. As such, we'd expect higher Mattel-owned inventory levels during the first 2 quarters of 2013 -- or '14 versus '13, and we don't expect the shipments of Mattel-owned inventories to have much of an impact on 2014 gross margins.","Operator","The next question is from Tim Conder of Wells Fargo Securities.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Thank you, Kevin, there for that additional color. So I may just -- could you expand on a couple of international areas where you have some pockets of inventory, one? And then, Bryan, on Fisher-Price core, the international opportunities, what, I guess, are some specific things you guys are doing to tap that? Granted Fisher-Price is more heavily skewed currently towards North America and therein lies the opportunity in the developing and emerging markets. But what are some specific initiatives that have been put in place there in the last year that you're planning to roll out here in the near term?","Kevin M. Farr","Yes, with regard to what international markets, I'm not going to get into the specific markets, but it's in various mature markets around the world.","Bryan G. Stockton","So regarding Fisher-Price, Tim, I think the -- there's a couple of things on Fisher-Price. Number one, I go back to the reorganization we put in place a couple of years ago when we went to the global brand teams and the North America division. And one of the things that we've seen that has worked quite well is the global brand teams, as we said, are spending less time in the United States and more time outside of the United States. So on Fisher-Price specifically, the team went to China and understood how important sleep is. It is much more important to Chinese moms than it is to moms in America, for example. And so we have this product called the Soothe & Sleep Seahorse (sic) [Soothe & Glow Seahorse] that when we show it to moms, they thought it was fantastic. We did a lot of work on that from a cost standpoint, benefit standpoint, to hit the right price point and deliver the right benefits. It was a terrific product to -- from a either in-store promotion or advertising standpoint, and it was a huge success. Now I can't tell you the number of units we sold, but it was quite high and almost in our days with Elmo, almost Elmo like, it was huge. So we like that a lot, and we're going to continue to do things like that in more countries.","Kevin M. Farr","Yes. And I think with respect to that, to the Seahorse, I think we really resonated on the marketing message to mom that not only did they help mom sleep better, but it helped the baby sleep better. And if the baby slept better, it obviously would do better in development and learning, and that really resonated with consumers. So I think tailoring that marketing message on the Seahorse to what consumers looked at, the benefits of that product it got them to buy and buy significantly and deep into this particular product. So doing that in areas across the Fisher-Price line is a great opportunity for us in 2014.","Bryan G. Stockton","And I think the Seahorse is a good example. It's a fairly basic product. It's not a complicated, high-tech kind of thing. And I think sometimes we forget that's what's really important in a lot of these developing markets, is something that is a little simpler and more focused. So we're going to do that. Obviously, we focus a lot on our merchandising in-store making sure we have the right mix of products in-store in these markets. And we're going to continue to invest in these markets in terms of advertising. And I think the other opportunity for Fisher-Price is, recall that our shares at Fisher-Price are quite low outside the United States in a couple of other markets. So we think there's an opportunity for us to go from a low share to a higher share if we get all the basics right.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then last question, gentlemen, your strategic growth investments that you talked about here also, is there any way -- just ballpark-ish, what percent of those are somehow mobile or tablet linked, related? Any way to sort of give us some color on that?","Bryan G. Stockton","Yes, Tim, I don't know that we necessarily think of it that way. When we think about -- looking at consumers across of all brands, we focus on can they watch it on a mobile phone, a tablet, any kind of pad, a computer, a screen, on DVD, Netflix. So we really think that our content needs to be available almost regardless of platform. So that's sort of where we start.","Kevin M. Farr","Yes. And I think with respect to that, when you look at our new franchises for 2013 and we just launched Max and we launched Ever After High, and we're making significant investments in content, which are going to be delivered whenever and wherever consumers want to view it, including mobile. And I think also with regard to our investment with regard to Launchpad, as I said in my remarks, we're going to have enhanced capabilities to market digitally and also distribute content. And we're also spending a lot more time distributing our content on Netflix and get pretty good traction there. So I think the additional capabilities at Launchpad will bring to us both from a digital marketing perspective and also to enhance our ability to connect with consumers on a multi-channel basis for American Girl and over time, across Mattel, our important capabilities are coming up in the middle of 2014.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Kevin, if I may, one thing there just to clarify. How has Max and Ever After High, or Bryan, how does that go here initially versus your expectations?","Bryan G. Stockton","Sure, Tim. Let me start with Max. I would say we're pleased with Max Steel. As we talk about our entertainment initiatives, we really talk in terms of we're happy with singles and doubles. And if you look at Max's performance in Latin America where it was truly a relaunch of the brand, our business in Latin America was up double digits, so we think the Latin American consumer responded to the new Max very well. Just based on that alone, I'd say we would qualify that as a single. I'd say we have some selective markets in Europe where we got some pretty good placement. The brand is gaining traction. Now if you look at the United States, where a lot of folks on the phone live, you would say, \"Gosh, it doesn't look successful.\" And we'd say, well, our challenge in the U.S. has been getting the boys engaged with the brand, and that's been a challenge due to the, I'd say, the penetration that we're getting on the content. We need to figure out a way in the U.S. and some more markets how we can expand boy engagement. And we've got some ideas on that. Recall that Max was not built on a single season in Latin America, and we did a lot of things to create the brand. So we like that. And for example in the U.S., Max is now on Netflix, so that's a great way for us to get more boy engagement. So we like where we are. Again, I would say it's a single. Ever After High, I know you're all tired of me saying this. It's too early. If I look at the actual timing of the launch of Ever After High last year versus the launch of Monster High, it's a couple of months later when you look at whether it's -- when it got in-store or when the book dropped and things of that nature. But what we like is a couple of things: Number one, we like the girl engagement that we see so far. We track girls online and the amount of time they're spending, and so the engagement with girls looks very encouraging. We're also pleased with retailers' support. Recall with the timing of this, the retailers portend to be, I would say, more promotional in nature as we were a little late to get in for the -- to be in line and on shelf. But we've got, we think, terrific support lined up for 2014. So I think the real thing that we're going to focus on is we're encouraged that we've got connection with girls. Now we have to work on conversion, and that's really what we're looking at for '14.","Operator","Next, we have a question from Sean McGowan of Needham & Company.","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Just have questions generally regarding share. So if you look at NPD data for the fourth quarter and holiday season, it doesn't look like the industry was down as much as Mattel was. So what are the categories -- well, first of all, that suggests that it -- whatever the reasons you're citing in traffic and online and whatever else is not really industry wide. So what is it that made Mattel underperform? And what are the categories in the industry that are doing well? How quickly can you get in those?","Bryan G. Stockton","As we take a look at our performance, obviously, we did not grow as fast as the category did, so you can do the math on share on that as well as we can. But what we try to do when we grow share, it seems when we create innovation and news in the category, the category grows. Our brands grow. I would point towards our doll portfolio strategy as an example of that where we've been fundamentally driving a lot of the category growth through the combination of Barbie and Ever After High and Monster High and Disney Princess and American Girl, for example. So when we do that well, the category grows. When the category grows, that's generally when our shares grow. So that's why we're spending so much time, while we need to make sure we have the right innovation in the product. We're connecting with the consumer digitally, television, whatever. And from a promotional and retail standpoint, we need to make sure we're executing well, we're spending our money well. So that seems to work, we think, well. Now there are a couple of pockets. For example, electronics was growing this year. Arts and crafts grew. We do some arts and crafts, for example, at American Girl. We don't have a big entry on that. Electronics has always been a tough 1. We found that competing in hardware is not something that we're particularly good at. There are a lot of people who do very, very well. Interestingly, I know tablets got a lot of play early on the season. As we look at the NPD data on tablets and remember, we can track kids' tablets on NPD. It looks like overall tablets were flat. What did happen is the less expensive, more highly promoted tablets were a success and looks to us it was at the expense of higher price perhaps more feature-ladened tablets. We don't have access to a lot of information on, I'll say, the more adult-like products like an iPad mini for example. But at least in terms of tablets and kids, it didn't seem to have much impact. And one of the things that we like about our Radica brand is it does tend to do electronic toys, and we're going to continue to focus on that. So it was an interesting year in toy. We think we're still well positioned. We got a great portfolio of brands and customers and countries. We didn't execute as well as we would have liked to. We're going to continue to invest in our cores because we always talk about we're going to grow through our core brands. We're going to grow through creating new brands like Monster High and Ever After High. We've got tremendous partnerships with people like Disney and Warner Bros. and Nickelodeon. And we're going to continue to invest in international. So there's a lot for us to work on to have our business grow and I think capture the opportunity we see in front of us.","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","If I can drill a little deeper on preschool, this is now going into the 6th year, I guess, or more of so-called birth dearth, and now you've actually hit the markets -- the age range for traditional toys. But preschool obviously has been hit the hardest on that. So can you talk a little bit about what you think is happening with your share in preschool and infant products?","Bryan G. Stockton","Sure. I'll start with what I mentioned earlier. We think that some of the, I'd say, the more tactical things in marketing that we hope would have a better impact, things like improved connection with moms, packaging, that would help us. But again, with hindsight being 20\/20, as we look at the innovation in our product line relative to competition out there, frankly, we just didn't have the innovation. And that's what's hurt our share in Fisher-Price. And again, we were very disappointed in that. And you can imagine the team in Buffalo in New York is working very hard to amp up our innovation for 2014. But what I would also tell you is remember, we are a global company. We think globally, and so when I mentioned China, for example, with the one child policy being loosened there, we like where we are from a positioning standpoint in China. We're a strong brand. I mentioned we're #1 in Parent Magazine there. We should see some growth in the birthrate in China, and there are awful a lot of people there. So we think these emerging markets and developing markets are really the wave of the future for Fisher-Price. As we always say, we have to take care of North America, which is the home of Fisher-Price. We can't turn our back on that, but we're certainly going to try to replicate with more frequency the Soothe & Sleep Seahorse (sic) [Soothe & Glow Seahorse] kind of success that we saw in China.","Kevin M. Farr","And so I think, Sean, the birth rate is impacting us in mature markets, but I would say that, that should be offset by innovation, better connection and conversion with mom. And I think in addition to higher birth rates outside of the U.S., I think the real driver of our Fisher-Price business and we've said this many times, is the opportunity with regard to the emerging markets and the developing markets of more families becoming middle-class families and having more discretionary income. I think that's a big growth opportunity for us in Fisher-Price as we said and Thomas as they're underdeveloped outside the U.S.","Operator","The next question is from Gerrick Johnson of BMO Capital.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Now that 2013's over, with the benefit of hindsight, did you realize the accretion you were expecting from the HIT acquisition?","Bryan G. Stockton","Yes. I -- we love the HIT acquisition and for a couple of reasons. We always say we want to buy the right brand at the right price at the right time, and we believe we did that. We spent an lot of awful time last year on Thomas, doing a couple of things. Number one was improving execution in the marketplace. That was very good, and we've talked about, again, PBS and Televisa. We prepared for the launch of Wood, and we're very pleased with our Wood results. That's primarily, historically been kind of a North American product. And we know based on the popularity of that product, there's global opportunity for us to expand in wood. Also, recall that moms tell us that wood is sort of the entry point into the brand, so it was really important for us to do that well. So we like where we are. And we're continuing with the rest of the other brands that we have in the portfolio of trying to understand what we can do with them, whether it's Mike the Knight or Fireman Sam. So we've got a lot going on there. And we've got just tremendous people. They're fantastic storytellers, and I think one of the things we're also looking at is using some of that talent to help us, for example, on Fisher-Price and see how we can bring their storytelling talents to bear on brands like Little People for example.","Kevin M. Farr","Yes. I think, also the other brand that we like a lot in that portfolio is Bob the Builder. And I think with regard to that, that's an opportunity for us as we look to the future.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And this may be more of a Toy Fair question, but I'll ask now anyway. So I'm hearing a lot about marketing and promotion as reason for weak POS. But the hottest toy product this year was Rainbow Loom from Choon's Design out of Nowhere, Michigan. They don't exactly have a huge marketing budget, no content, but it was new, innovative and yes, low tech. So what I'm getting at here is could there be more of a development and innovation problem rather than a marketing one? Has there been any sort of change in your product development? Is content and entertainment the answer? How do you fix the innovation problem?","Bryan G. Stockton","Yes, Gary, I was hoping we've been more clear with that in our comments. As we look particularly at Fisher-Price and Barbie, for example, we need to amp up the innovation. It's clear. When we like at, for example, Barbie, the Dreamhouse was a fantastic toy. It's the best Dreamhouse we've ever done, and I can go through all the gotchas and gimmes that it has. But it was a fantastic product, and it sold extraordinary well because it was an innovative product. So we know when we innovate, we do a better. So we are working on innovation, particularly on Barbie and on Fisher-Price and across all of our brands. So that's important to us, also the marketing. What's clear to us is the landscape is changing. We need to understand how and literarily we're going through what do you want to spend on, where do you spend it and when do you spend it. Those are really the way that we're thinking about marketing. So it is both, and I'd hoped we had been clear. Maybe we weren't.","Kevin M. Farr","Yes. And I'd reiterate that for the categories that grew like youth electronics and also with regard to arts and crafts, it was basic innovation in arts and crafts with the Rainbow Loom and I think with regard to even the youth electronics with regard to a couple of products in that category. So we also agree with you with regard to product innovation and just as important as market innovation.","Operator","The next question is from Michael Kelter of Goldman Sachs.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I want to ask, so your gross margins have been great for the last few years and including in this quarter, and a good part of that seems to be a newfound pricing power that you have with 20% cumulative pricing from 2008 to present based on prior disclosures. So I guess my question is, is it possible that some of your recent weakness in the core brands is because you've taken pricing too far given the environment and getting the gross margins up is maybe at the expense of sales?","Bryan G. Stockton","I would say we've been very deliberate in how we think about pricing. We think about the innovation in a product. We think about the branding in a product, and so we spend a lot of time thinking about how that works. And I'd say probably the best example of that, frankly, is the Dreamhouse. That was, frankly, a $150 toy, and it was fantastic. It was the #1 selling Barbie item we've had. So I think our lesson learned in the toy business is if you have a great toy, it's really that not price sensitive. So I go back to we were short on innovation because of some of the changes in what's going on at retail. I think some of our promotional spending was not as effective. As we've been saying here, if store traffic is down 15%, it's hard for an end cap to work as hard in 2013 as it did in 2012. So there's a lot going on in terms of where we are in share. But I would say in terms of pricing, we spend a lot of time on it. We've been very focused on gross margins through cost reduction, through mix management and being very mindful of how we price. Remember, pricing is the last thing that we do. We look at our basket of costs. We try to offset it through other cost reductions, and when you go through all that, the remainder is essentially what we try to price to cover.","Kevin M. Farr","Yes. And I think from a broader perspective, I think that we are living in a play share environment, and costs are going up. And I think if you looked across categories, you'd see that prices have gone up over the years, and that's true for the toy category, too. So I don't believe our issue is our pricing. As we said, I think some of it has to do with product innovation and marketing innovation.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And how should we be thinking about gross margins in 2014 in light of the excess inventories that are entering the year? Should we be expecting or prepared for, at least, gross margins to be down since you'll have reduced absorption at the plants?","Kevin M. Farr","I think with respect to gross margins, we don't give guidance. I think we are operating in an inflationary environment, but we are pricing for that inflationary environment mid-single digits. We took the pricing increase effective January 1, 2014. And I think what we've said earlier today, consistent with our goal for the year to deliver top quartile TSR of 6% to 8% in operating profit, gross margin's an important element in that equation. And assuming the mix continues, coupled with low volatility in costs and foreign exchange, we expect gross margins of low- to mid-50s in the near term.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then the other thing on margins, one thing you did give guidance on was at your Analyst Day that SG&A would be up modestly in 2014. Is that still what you're thinking, that it's going to be up this year? Or have you adjusted and found ways to possibly reduce G&A in 2014?","Kevin M. Farr","Yes. Again, Michael, we don't give guidance. We evaluate SG&A spending in the context of delivering annual operating profit growth of 6% to 8%. We've got 2 tailwinds heading into 2014, our second quarter 2013 asset impairment charge of $14 million. And we're targeting flat spending on strategic growth initiatives, which have been increasing over the last few years, but they're now largely embedded in our current cost base. We also have a headwind in incentive compensation, assuming we achieve our targeted levels of bonus payouts in 2014. We didn't pay out the target level bonuses this year because we're very disappointed in our fourth quarter results and disappointed in our full year results, although we did grow and delivered good profits. In the fourth quarter, we saw similar momentum in our current O.E. 3.0 cost savings initiatives as we exceeded our $50 million goal for the year, which is consistent with our recent increase of total savings targets for the program by $25 million to $175 million accumulative savings by the end of 2014. We see additional opportunities in O.E. 3.0, so we're going to continue to lean into this program in 2014.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And lastly, if you don't mind, if you could just take a minute to talk about Monster High POS trends in the U.S. and then because you said you have them around the world. Is it -- is there any reason to believe that Monster High is kind of peakish at this point, either domestically or elsewhere? And how are you gauging the risk that it could fall into decline versus transitioning into an evergreen?","Bryan G. Stockton","Yes, Michael, we're pleased with Monster High. We don't get into a lot of brand specifics in terms of POS numbers. But what I would tell you is that Monster High in the fourth quarter, as well as for the year, had strong double-digit increases in POS, both in the U.S. and in international. And recall that it's about 60% international and that's good. It's now about $1.5 billion brand globally, so we think that's good. Now one of the challenges we have with Monster High is it is now a very large brand, and as you can imagine with the law of large numbers, it's going to get increasingly difficult to post huge POS gains. But we really like where we are of $1 billion -- $1.5 billion of business at retail, growing at a nice POS clip, we think is a good place to be. So it was successful last year. We're going to continue to invest in it this year. We've got great programs, great characters, more accessories, so it's a brand that we like and we'll keep investing in.","Operator","The next question is from Felicia Hendrix of Barclays.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Bryan, can we just stick on that point of Monster High for a second? And when you talk about strong double-digit POS in the quarter, are you talking about the entire brand or just the dolls because I'm not sure that's what the NPD data was showing? So can you parse through that?","Bryan G. Stockton","Yes, when I'm talking about Monster, I'm talking about the brand is up double digit. And it's up in dolls, and it's up in consumer products. So we like where it is.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just to move on actually to the real meat of my main questions, with the industry evolving and you mentioned in all of your -- the releases that you put out this morning, suddenly there were more sales through the e-commerce channel. Can you just remind me of how much your retail channel goes through online and if you're working to increase your distribution there because clearly, that's where the consumer is headed?","Bryan G. Stockton","I don't think we really give out a number on that. But I would tell you is the -- I think the estimates for the toy industry are somewhere around mid-double digits of teens, like 14, 15, 16, somewhere in that range. And again, we have invested heavily in this channel. We were one of the early people in it. We continue invest. And when I say invest, it's promotional dollars with the retailer, but it's also getting the products right and the packaging right for that. Again, I always go back to the early days when we went into grocery drug and we did a lot of special programs. We're doing that here. That's a trend we see around the world, and we're going to continue to partner with retailers for products and digital images and links and all the stuff that you really need to do to be effective in that channel.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, great. And then my final question is on marketing. You guys, I think, laid out pretty well how you're not happy with how you marketed your products in the quarter for best season and promotions and how you have to rethink that. And through last Investor Day, you talked about Fisher-Price and how the marketing programs there really got brand awareness increase at -- with the moms, but it didn't compel the moms to kind of get up and buy the product, and your evolving it there. For a mature, leading toy company, those comments just seem a little curious to me because you should be on the cutting edge of your marketing and promotions and kind of have your finger on the pulse of what the consumer wants. And just wondering how -- when you -- has something changed in your -- in the marketing trenches? Or do you feel like the company used to keep up better with the times? Again, is -- in the leadership position that you're in, wondering if you could address that.","Bryan G. Stockton","Sure. Well, if you think about marketing, it covers a whole variety of things. And if I look at Fisher-Price in particular, we spent a lot of time focusing in on getting the brand positioned properly with moms, not just here in the U.S. but again, on the China example. And that requires a lot of work from an advertising standpoint, whether it's television, print, digital, you name it. And I do feel like we're connecting with moms well. I think particularly what was a challenge for Fisher-Price for the year and particularly in the fourth quarter, again, we invested a lot of money in Fisher-Price for inventory and promotions and in-store promotions with retail. Fisher-Price, like Barbie, is a pretty heavily promoted product at retail. And as consumers spend less time in stores, and there were fewer consumers in stores, we believe that Fisher-Price and Barbie may had been more impacted by a reduction in shopper traffic than some of our other brands. So when I look at that, that's why I say we really need to take a step back, take a look at what happened, what do we think consumers are going to be doing next year because, I think, this is a surprise not just for us but probably other companies in the toy business and other companies in general. But we're going to take a look at how we manage that next year so that we get conversions digitally online and we get better conversion in-store.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And just final question on China and Russia, you're doing really well there. I think you've done a good job in the past kind of laying out for us where the upside is there. Just wondering where -- and this might not even be the right way to look at it, but where are you in terms of the low-hanging fruit there -- I know -- in both of those markets? I know there's a lot more white space to penetrate, but does it get harder at some point? In other words, when are you anniversary-ing the easy growth in those kinds of markets?","Bryan G. Stockton","Well, having spent 8 years as the head of international in both of those markets, I don't know that even the low fruit is easy growth. It takes quite a bit to establish a solid distribution base and to gain scale in those markets. And I would say that we're still in the early stages of development in those markets in terms of getting scale with customers, scale with our advertising, scale of product. So I can't give you the, I think, the answer you're looking for, but what I would tell you is that we still see a lot of growth opportunity in both of those markets, and the growth is going to come through expanding into new cities, geographies in those markets. It'll come as more modern retail trade develops in those markets. It'll come as our brands grow and we get continued expansion of engagement and conversion, which we have proven, I think, to do well in both markets. So we're pleased with it. There's a lot of work ahead of us. Kevin, do you want to add anything?","Kevin M. Farr","Yes, and I'd just add also, I think, as I said earlier, as the emerging class grows and I think also as that emerging middle class continues to have more discretionary income because even in places like China and Russia, their per capita spending on toys is timing compared to what we see in mature markets. So I think there's a lot of growth over the near term and longer terms to really drive growth for us in those markets.","Bryan G. Stockton","Yes, so basically it boils down to distribution gains and per capita spending. Those are really the 2 keys.","Operator","The next question is from Linda Bolton-Weiser of B. Riley.","Linda Bolton-Weiser - B. Riley Caris, Research Division","I was wondering in terms of your kind of balance sheet and share repurchase plans, do you think you would tend to get even more aggressive on that front given that your stock is down? Or would you tend to hunker down and protect your balance sheet and maybe not be as aggressive on that front? You did an awfully lot of share repurchase in 2013. So can you give us some feel for going forward on that?","Kevin M. Farr","Yes. I think, Linda, we've got a pretty good history of deploying capital. And when I look at it, we've got a long-standing capital investment framework. And as you know, a very important part of making our top third to top quartile TSR is effective capital deployment to hit that top third to top quartile. So we intend to continue to deploy that excess cash in our historical capital investment framework to make share repurchases and targeted acquisitions. We'll continue to be disciplined and opportunistic in deploying to ensure enhanced shareholder value.","Linda Bolton-Weiser - B. Riley Caris, Research Division","Okay. And then given that you've got sort of these near-term challenges, do you think you would consider even additional cost-cutting programs? You compare yourselves sometimes to the Colgates and Procters of the world, and those companies will usually step up and even add additional programs to their cost cutting when they're facing headwinds. Is that something you would consider? Or are you just going to kind of stay the course with O.E. 3.0 that you've got in place right now?","Kevin M. Farr","Yes. I think I said earlier in the fourth quarter, we saw some momentum in our current O.E. 3.0 cost saving initiatives. We exceeded our goal for the year, which was $50 million by about $10 million. And we have already upped the program late last year by $25 million to $175 million of cumulative savings by the end of 2014. We do see additional opportunities in O.E. 3.0, so we'll continue to lean into this program into 2014.","Linda Bolton-Weiser - B. Riley Caris, Research Division","Okay. And then just finally, I know that you're still shooting for that 6% to 8% operating profit growth long term. I think you said that, Bryan, but did you clarify whether you think you can get to at least 6% in 2014?","Kevin M. Farr","I'll take that question, Linda. It's -- we don't provide guidance, but we're still targeting our long-term top third to top quartile TSR. And as our 2013 results were below expectation, we need to execute better in 2014. So it is our goal. Our near-term focus to achieve that goal is to improve domestic POS, work through retail and company-owned inventories and as I said before, make our advertising and trade spending work harder for us next year. As we develop our annual financial plan for 2014, we're going to balance the key P&L levers across the business to achieve these goals. So clearly, it's a focus both in the near term and longer term to deliver 6% to 8% operating profit on an annual basis.","Operator","Our last question will be from Stephanie Wissink of Piper Jaffray.","Maria C. Vizuete - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","This is actually Maria Vizuete on the line for Stephanie. We're just wondering if you can talk a little bit about your efforts in improving packaging and how that's resonating, whether that's in the Fisher-Price brand or what we seem to be seeing in the American Girl brand with more touch-and-feel packaging and play displays?","Bryan G. Stockton","Our packaging effort's really focused in 2 areas. If I think about Fisher-Price, it was to improve our impact at shelf. And in the United States where we have quite a bit of shelf space, the old package worked just fine, but it did not work well internationally. And so we really worked hard given the growth opportunity in international to get the packaging right there. So a lot of the efforts we have are to make sure we have the impact on the shelf. We're also spending a lot of time on trying to improve our packaging from both a cost and environmental standpoint. A large part of what we're doing in O.E. 3.0 is trying to figure out how we can use less packaging. Again, we think that's good from an environmental standpoint, and it's good from a cost standpoint. And then it should be good from a consumer ease-of-opening standpoint. So those are really the 2 areas that we focus in on.","Maria C. Vizuete - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Great. And then if I could just sneak one more, I'm sorry. Can you just provide us with maybe the longer-term operating margin goals for international within the emerging markets, maybe just where it is today and where you're plan is for the future?","Kevin M. Farr","Yes, again, I think, what's consistent for us is across the company, we're looking to improve our operating margins. We're in the 15% to 20% range as a percentage of net sales. Right now we're at 18%. Our goal each and every year is to sequentially improve that through sales leverage and tight control of expenses and dropping that to the bottom line. And I think that's true both for the mature markets and developing and emerging markets. And I think part of it is in the emerging markets, it's probably a little bit below that level. But as we gain scale, we'd expect to deliver higher margins over time, consistent with the company average. And I think when we look at markets like Russia and China that have scale that's even bigger than any market around the world, we see opportunities over the longer term to really improve our overall company margin with those margins driving it, in those countries.","Drew Vollero","Okay.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Drew Vollero, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Vollero, please begin.","Drew Vollero","Thanks, Janine. As you know, this morning, we reported Mattel's 2012 fourth quarter and fiscal year-end financial results. We provided you with a slide presentation to help guide our discussion today. The slide presentation and the information required by Regulation G regarding non-GAAP financial measures is available on the Investors and Media section of our corporate website, corporate.mattel.com.","In a few minutes, Bryan Stockton, Mattel's Chairman and CEO; and Kevin Farr, Mattel's CFO, will provide comments on the results, and then the call will be open for your questions.","Certain statements made during the call may include forward-looking statements related to the future performance of our overall business, brands and product lines. These statements are based on currently available information, and they are subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties, which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.","We describe some of these uncertainties in the Risk Factors section of our 2011 annual report on Form 10-K, in our 2012 quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and in other filings we make with the SEC from time to time, as well as in other public statements. Mattel does not update forward-looking statements and expressly disclaims any obligation to do so.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bryan.","Bryan G. Stockton","Thank you, Drew, and good day, everyone. For those of you who know me, my personal professional mantra is \"happy, never satisfied.\" And as I reflect on my first year as CEO, I believe that is an appropriate summary of how I feel. As I look back on 2012, we continue to remain positive about the toy industry and feel good about how it performed throughout the year and in the all-important holiday season.","In a year where the industry was challenged by strong economic headwinds and a light entertainment mix, we saw it grow globally again. The growth in the emerging and developing markets in Eastern Europe, Latin America and Asia more than offset slight declines in the mature markets, such as the U.S. and Europe.","And as we've been saying all year, innovation is a key driver to growth, and where the industry had innovation, it grew, particularly in the dolls and for preschool and construction categories, as defined by NPD. And as we've seen every year, the consumer showed up in the fourth quarter to buy toys for their children and grandchildren.","I was also pleased with Mattel's performance for the year. We had our third straight year of sales growth, with record sales for both the total company and our international division, having eclipsed the $7 billion in gross sales for the first time. We had growth in all regions for the quarter and the year, including the North America division and across all of our international regions, including Europe, Latin America and Asia, as we grew share in the U.S. and Euro 5 , according to NPD as well.","As I mentioned before, Mattel has the best portfolio of brands, countries and customers in the toy business. Looking at our brands, the performance of our Girls portfolio was simply outstanding. We gained share and grew the fashion doll category globally. We can do this because I believe we have the most competitive and attractive brand portfolio in the toy industry, with power brands like Barbie, Monster High, Disney Princess and American Girl.","The big news in the fourth quarter and in 2012 is that Monster High continues to exceed all expectations, becoming a truly global property, with revenue larger in international now than in North America, just like Barbie. In 3 short years, Monster High has become a $1 billion brand at retail and does not seem to be slowing. Even more amazing is that during that same time period, its growth has been almost purely incremental to our portfolio, with Barbie sales higher in 2012 than they were when Monster High was launched in 2010. In fact, according to NPD, Monster High ended the year as the #2 doll property in the world, behind only Barbie.","Speaking of Barbie, in 2012, again, it's not only the #1 fashion doll in the world, but it remains the #1 property in the toy category , according to NPD. In 2012, despite the significant growth of Monster High, Barbie was able to maintain global share, although shipments were down slightly. We successfully extended the brand into new play patterns, like construction, through our partnership with MEGA Brands, and further into digital, with the hit toy, Photo Fashion Barbie.","Disney Princess also delivered another solid year of growth, driven by the success of the hit Disney movie, Brave.","And finally, American Girl continued to show strong growth, delivering another record year of sales despite a tough economy.","Throughout 2012, Fisher-Price continued its transition and rolled out mom-directed campaigns in support of the strategic repositioning of the brand. Fisher-Price continued to grow and grew faster outside the U.S., a key strategy for the business. In fact, Fisher-Price grew share globally, according to NPD data. We were particularly pleased with the growth in Fisher-Price Friends, which showed extremely strong performance during the quarter and the year.","We also saw a strong performance within our Imaginext and Little People brands, due to the added focus placed on these lines. We will continue to apply what we've learned over the course of the year to the entire Fisher-Price portfolio in 2013.","Not only did Hot Wheels sales grow for the quarter and for the year, but we also grew share in the U.S. and Euro 5, according to NPD. We continue to boast strong performance on our core vehicle, track sets and play sets businesses, which augurs well for the health of the brand and its future performance.","Our Games business also performed well by delivering innovative products in a category that faces industry-wide challenges.","I was also happy to see how the Mattel organization responded to the macroeconomic challenges in 2012 and how we worked with our customers in a disciplined manner to balance sales, POS and inventory. I was particularly happy to see how well we managed the holiday season and adjusted our retail promotions to align with consumer trends. On a worldwide basis, we are comfortable with our current assessment of our global inventory levels, although like every year, there are pockets of inventory by brand and by country. Here in the U.S., inventory was down versus 2011.","Looking at the results with our top 6 retailers in the U.S., our shipments, POS and inventory were well aligned, especially in the fourth quarter, with overall retail inventories ending the year down mid-single digits. This is due in part to the creation of the North America division, which was established to help us better align with our retail customers. We also did a good job in 2012 working through the integration of our new global brands team organization, as well as the on-boarding of the wonderful talent at HIT Entertainment.","From an internal perspective, the organization experienced quite a bit of change in 2012: Structural, process, people and cultural. And I was very pleased with the capacity of the organization to accept and execute these changes successfully in order to move Mattel forward. Even with all this change, we were voted, for the sixth consecutive year, as one of the 100 Best Companies to Work For by Fortune Magazine. This is a great testament to our focus on nurturing and developing talent to help unlock their potential.","And what I'm most happy with is that all of these accomplishments led to great results that rewarded our shareholders. We ended the year with a total shareholder return of 37%, placing us in the 86th percentile of the S&P 500. We achieved our fourth consecutive year of gross margins at or above our long-term goal of at least 50%, achieving gross margins of 53%, driven by a favorable Girls portfolio, Operational Excellence 2.0 savings and manufacturing efficiencies.","Sales growth and margin expansion allowed us to achieve a second year of operating profit above $1 billion and an adjusted operating profit margin of 18%, that is trending up and well within our long-term margin performance range, all of which resulted in an adjusted EPS of $2.47, up 13% over the prior year. These outstanding results generated significant cash, with operating cash flow of $1.3 billion, which allowed us to continue to deploy capital in a very disciplined way.","We started 2012 by announcing a 35% increase on our dividend and are beginning this year by announcing another dividend increase of 16% for 2013, raising our annualized dividend to $1.44 per share. I believe this growth in the dividend is a good indication of our confidence in our business going forward.","And we invested in our future with the acquisition of HIT Entertainment and its incredible organization and portfolio of brands, like Thomas & Friends.","Overall, I feel we continue to make great progress on our goal to deliver consistent growth, expand margins, generate deployed cash and deliver strong TSR.","Having said that, I do believe we need to continue to focus on innovation to drive better POS performance. The good news is, we did have many of the industry's biggest hits for 2012. In fact, according to NPD, we had 7 of the top 20 toys. Our brands and our organization have proven they can innovate, not only in toys, but also in consumer engagement and retail execution to drive POS. Even though I'm pleased with our share growth, we can do better overall, especially here in the U.S.","In 2012, our North America POS was slightly negative for the year and slightly positive in the fourth quarter. I believe we should be striving toward mid-single-digit POS growth. This company can and should perform above and beyond the category growth rate.","In essence, while I'm happy, I'm not satisfied with our U.S. consumer takeaway and look to do better in 2013. Looking toward 2013, my second year as CEO, we see continued growth in the industry and plan to grow at Mattel. And while I recognize we have a great portfolio of brands, countries and customers to work with, we must continue to work hard to innovate, to keep pace with what kids want and deepen our consumer engagement. Our core brands are well positioned for growth, as we see continued momentum in our Girls portfolio, Hot Wheels, Fisher-Price and Thomas & Friends. Barbie will bring expanded content to its highly successful Barbie Life in the Dreamhouse digital series, which will also include new and innovative promotions and products. Monster High is planning to grow by bringing new content and innovation to its entire toy and consumer products footprint. Disney Princess will benefit with the fall release of the movie Frozen. And American Girl will continue to expand its retail footprint and build on its Girl of the Year series with its latest doll, Sage. Hot Wheels will continue to leverage its successful Team Hot Wheels theme and launch an entirely new brand campaign that would be complemented by new content, toy innovation and new category opportunities. We plan on growing Fisher-Price in 2013, as the work we have been doing to refocus the brand and leverage its international opportunity should begin to pay off. Thomas & Friends should continue to grow as we roll out new content and deepen our consumer engagement with moms and kids globally with new digital content and promotions, especially in Latin America.","While we'll speak with you more about these brands next week, above and beyond the core brand momentum, we have a strong pipeline of new incremental properties coming to market in 2013. Consider the following. Our new Thomas wood line is starting to ship this spring. We're launching our newest franchise, Max Steel, with an animated series and a significant digital engagement investment this spring, followed by toy and consumer products launches in the fall. Our Mike the Knight toy line, which will complement the very popular animated series, will be launched globally in the fall. We have a more robust entertainment portfolio overall, that includes Warner Bros. Superman, DreamWorks Animation's Turbo. And we're very pleased that Disney has planned a global theatrical launch of its Pixar Cars-inspired property, Planes, this summer. We'll benefit from a full year the very popular Jake and the Never Land Pirates, as well as Disney's latest hit, Sofia the First. And finally, we'll see another franchise launch by year end, so stay tuned.","In the end, it will all be about execution, and I believe we've demonstrated in 2012 that we have the brands and the organization to execute and move Mattel forward. And as always, we look to grow the financially disciplined way, a proven combination that will continue to deliver for our shareholders.","I look forward to speaking with you next week about 2013 and delivering another great year to our shareholders. And now, I'd like to turn it over to Mattel's Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Farr. Kevin?","Kevin M. Farr","Thank you, Bryan, and good morning, everyone. Throughout 2012, we focused on 3 global strategic priorities: Consistent growth; continuous improvement to operating margin; and generation of significant cash flow to allow for disciplined, opportunistic and value-enhancing capital deployment. I'm pleased to report that we've made meaningful progress along each of these dimensions over the past year.","As I review the year, what stands out most to me is the strength of our business model to generate cash and our strong cash position. In 2012, we generated about $1.3 billion in cash from operations, deployed $1.4 billion of cash in 2012 and ended the year with over $1.3 billion in cash. This strong position gives us the flexibility and financial strength to continue to grow our business and reward shareholders.","As we've done in the past, we continue to deploy our cash in value-added ways. First, by reinvesting in the business to grow our core brands, create new franchises, expand our international presence and by driving effectiveness and efficiency in the business through investments, including IT infrastructure. Specifically, the $685 million acquisition of HIT Entertainment in February gave us our fifth core brand, Thomas & Friends, and an organization ready to deliver, whether it's leveraging heritage brands, like Bob the Builder, or developing new ones, like Mike the Knight. Our retail expansion of American Girl in Houston, Miami and St. Louis have been big winners for us, with all 3 stores outperforming expectations today.","Our investment in our new subsidiary in Russia is off to a very strong start in growing this market. And our IT investments have positioned us for future growth and given us the capabilities to manage our cost base more effectively. We're upgrading American Girl's e-commerce infrastructure to drive further growth and leverage it to support our other core brands. This technology allows us to better align with how consumers are buying products today, while improving Mattel's overall global capabilities to market digitally.","We're also investing in a new product life cycle management system to improve our design, development and manufacturing processes, while providing greater cost transparency. When fully implemented, this system should help us to continue to deliver against our gross margin target by improving design and toy value and helping to offset future input cost increases.","In addition to positioning Mattel for future growth through targeted investment in our business, we're also focused on returning significant cash flow to our investors, starting with dividends. As a company, we believe strongly in using dividends to return funds to drive total shareholder returns.","In our earnings release today, we announced a substantial increase in our quarterly dividend, from $0.31 to $0.36, which results in an annualized dividend of $1.44. The 16% increase in the dividend is slightly above our growth in adjusted earnings per share of 13% for the year and consistent with our payout ratio of 50% to 60%. We have continued to provide double-digit growth in our dividends to shareholders over the last several years.","From 2009 to 2012, our adjusted EPS has grown 70%, and our dividends have increased by 65%. Our targeted strategic investments and increased dividends are possible because the business operated well over the course of 2012.","Balanced growth across our portfolio and between domestic and international regions enabled us to exceed $7 billion in annual sales for the first time. This increase, combined with our fourth year of gross margins at or above 50%, resulted in adjusted operating profit of $1.16 billion. Our adjusted operating margin is now at 18% of net sales, an improvement of 140 basis points relative to the prior year.","Adjusted earnings per share grew 13% for the full year to $2.47, the fourth consecutive year of double-digit EPS growth. As Bryan noted, the drivers of our strong performance over the year were twofold. On the top line, it was the strength in our Girls portfolio, particularly Monster High and American Girl, and Fisher-Price Friends, that helped us to reach our new record level of sales.","The middle of the P&L is anchored by solid gains in gross margin, which resulted from a combination of favorable foreign exchange, improved mix, better-than-expected savings from manufacturing efficiencies and O.E. 2.0 savings programs, benefits from HIT's licensing business, lower royalties and our pricing action, partially offset by increased input cost.","Our fourth quarter results reflected many of the same factors. Our balance sheet continues to be in excellent shape, inventories and accounts receivable are down, and our year-end cash position is very strong. That gives Mattel the financial flexibility to continue to execute our business and to fund additional growth opportunities.","Now let's move to Page 4 of our slide deck. You can see that our worldwide gross sales are up 6% for the quarter and up 3% for the year. NPD data shows that Mattel gained share in the U.S. and Euro 5. Notable drivers included Monster High, Fisher-Price Friends, American Girl and Hot Wheels. As Bryan told you, overall, we are comfortable with the level of our worldwide inventories, both at Mattel and our retail partners. There are always pockets of inventory that vary year-to-year by brand and country. But here in the U.S., retailers have been tightly managing inventory throughout the year. Our POS has been essentially in line with shipping, and our retail inventory ended the year down mid-single digits.","Going into 2013, we continue to focus on ensuring we get the right products to the right place at the right time to best serve our retail partners and consumers.","Now let's turn to Page 5 and 6 of the slide presentation to review sales by brand. Worldwide sales for Mattel Girls and Boys brands were up 5% for the quarter and 2% for the year. Our Girls products performed well. Monster High was the clear standout, and Disney Princess was up for the full year. Hot Wheels had a solid year, particularly domestically.","Our Entertainment business saw the expected decline in Cars 2 sales as we moved from the 2011 theatrical release year, though this was partially offset by sales of Batman. And we delivered good growth in Games, driven primarily by Angry Birds.","Worldwide sales for Fisher-Price brands were up 6% for the quarter and 4% for the year. Fisher-Price Core was down slightly, while Fisher-Price Friends was up double digits in the fourth quarter and the full year, driven by the success of Jake and the Never Land Pirates and our franchise in HIT Entertainment, including Thomas & Friends.","American Girl continued to deliver strong results, with sales in the fourth quarter up 13% and sales up 11% for the year. Our 2012 Girl of the Year, McKenna, and American Girl retail stores, continued to drive growth for our brand.","Our international business, as seen on Page 7, showed growth across all regions for the quarter and the full year. The solid growth in Europe is encouraging in light of the economic headwinds that continue in the region. Latin America has exceeded the $1 billion milestone in annual gross sales, with a strong fourth quarter despite the continuing unfavorable foreign currency environment. And our Asia Pacific region continues to be a source of great opportunity for Mattel, delivering double-digit growth in both the fourth quarter and the full year.","Now let's review the P&L, starting on Page 8 of the slide presentation. For the fourth year in a row, Mattel has delivered gross margins at or above 50%. The fourth quarter gross margin rate, at 54.3%, was up 40 basis points to 53.9% in the fourth quarter of 2011. This improvement related to favorable mix, better-than-expected savings through our manufacturing efficiency and O.E. 2.0 savings programs, the benefit of HIT's licensing business, our pricing actions, partially offset by increased input costs, which were less volatile than the prior year, and higher customer benefits.","For the full year, gross margin was 53.1%, which was up by 290 basis points versus the prior year. About 150 improvement was related to favorable foreign exchange. And the remaining balance in the improvement was driven by improved mix, better-than-expected savings through manufacturing efficiency programs and O.E. 2.0 savings programs, benefits from HIT's licensing business, lower royalties and our pricing action, partially offset by increased input costs, which were less volatile than in the prior year.","As seen on Page 9 of the slide presentation, adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses increased in the fourth quarter by 100 basis points to 19.6% of net sales. The increase for the quarter primarily reflects HIT Entertainment's ongoing SG&A and integration costs, as well as higher employee-related expenses and higher incentive and equity compensation cost. HIT-related expenses represented 80 basis points of net sales.","For the full year, adjusted SG&A expenses increased by $127 million, or 150 basis points, to 23.9% of net sales. This increase reflects higher employee-related expenses, higher incentive and equity compensation accruals as we exceeded our target level of performance, additional SG&A and incremental costs from the HIT acquisition and integration, which was partially offset by net savings from O.E. 2.0 initiatives of $39 million, plus the positive impact of foreign exchange. HIT organization, acquisition and integration costs represented 110 basis points of net sales for the full year.","As I mentioned earlier, our strategic investments include the opening of American Girl retail stores, the implementation of IT infrastructure that will enable us to better manage our product life cycle and a new office in Russia to better serve that region. For full year 2012, our incremental strategic investments were about 1\/4 of the $127 million increase in SG&A, excluding the litigation charge. For your reference, we've also included historical summary of our incremental legal and settlement-related costs in the Appendix of this slide presentation.","Page 10 of the presentation summarizes the performance of our 2-year Global Cost Leadership initiative and a summary of our progress on the Operational Excellence 2.0 program. As you can see, O.E. 2.0 cumulative sustainable cost savings of $187 million exceeded our original goal for the program of $150 million. For the fourth quarter of 2012, we recognized O.E. 2.0 gross savings of $14 million, including $11 million of structural savings and approximately $3 million in legal savings. For the quarter, $8 million of gross savings are included in gross margin and $3 million are in advertising, with a $1 million investment in SG&A. We invested approximately $4 million in the program, which resulted in net savings of $10 million for the quarter.","For full year 2012, we recognized O.E. 2.0 gross savings of $93 million, including $53 million of structural savings and approximately $40 million in legal savings. For the year, approximately $55 million of gross savings are in the SG&A line, including legal savings, $27 million in gross savings, including gross margin, and $11 million of gross savings are in advertising. For the full year, we invested about $16 million, resulting in net savings of $77 million. As I said, we realized $187 million of sustainable cumulative savings by the end of 2012, exceeding our original plan by 25%.","Looking forward, we're now launching our O.E. 3.0 initiative, which we will estimate will deliver $125 million of sustainable savings by the end of 2014. We're finalizing the program as we speak, and at Toy Fair next week, I'll provide you with a more up-to-date discussion of the program's parameters.","Turning to Page 11, for the fourth quarter, adjusted operating income was $511.3 million, representing 22.7% of net sales, down 40 basis points from last year. For the full year 2012, we delivered adjusted operating income of $1.16 billion, with full year operating margin expanding 140 basis points to 18% of net sales. By delivering strong gross margins and sales gains, we continue to achieve our long-term operating margin targets of 15% to 20%.","Turning to Page 12, the adjusted fourth quarter earnings per share were $1.12, up 5% versus $1.07 in the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share for full year 2012 was $2.47, which was up 13% versus the prior year of $2.18, primarily driven by improved operating margin, partially offset by higher interest expense. Adjusted earnings per share include the impact of HIT acquisition and integration expenses, which represents a negative $0.05 impact on earnings per share.","Excluding the impact of litigation charge, our worldwide effective income tax rate for full year 2012 was approximately 20%. This was lower than previous expectations due to better-than-expected geographical mix and favorable resolution of tax audits. Looking forward to 2013, we expect that our income tax rate will be approximately 22% to 23%, assuming no changes to current tax laws.","Page 13 summarizes the acquisition, integration and other costs related to the HIT acquisition. Fourth quarter HIT-related integration costs were $4 million, with full year HIT acquisition and integration costs of $24 million.","Now let's turn to cash flow on Page 14 of the slide presentation. Cash flow from operations for the year was approximately $1.28 billion, an increase of $611 million compared with $665 million in 2011. The increase was primarily driven by lower working capital usage, and we ended the year with $1.3 billion in cash, well above our long-term goal.","In 2012, we continued to execute our capital deployment framework. We deployed $1.4 billion in 2012 by investing in growth initiatives, including the acquisition of HIT Entertainment for $685 million in the first quarter and $219 million of capital expenditures for the full year, returning $500 million to shareholders through dividends of $423 million and share repurchases of $78 million.","In summary, we're targeting consistent performance year in and year out, and we view 2012 as another strong year. We are encouraged by the flexibility our strong financial position gives us as we enter 2013. We will continue to look to grow our business, grow it profitably and deploy the cash generated in value-enhancing ways to reward our shareholders.","This concludes my review of the financial results. Now we'd like to open the call to questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Sean McGowan of Needham & Company.","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","First, can you give us a little bit more clarity on exactly what you saw, POS domestically, as well as outside the U.S.? Was it down, was it up? You know, the industry seems to be down a bit in 2012. How did you guys perform?","Bryan G. Stockton","I'll start with we're pleased with our share performance overall. If we look at the toy category in general, we were pleased with it, particularly in the U.S. in the fourth quarter. And we think the performance of the toy category was particularly encouraging, especially in light of, I think, the, I'll call it the 1-2-3 punch of a declining GDP, fiscal cliff anxiety on the part of consumers and also a decline in consumer confidence. So from a category standpoint, we felt pretty good about that. And in Europe in particular, very difficult consumer and economic situation. The fact that the category was down a couple points was encouraging. And frankly, if you take Spain out, which is probably one of the most challenged economies, the category is only down about 1 point, I think. So we felt good about the category in terms of POS. Our analysis shows that if you look at the Entertainment-heavy year, I'll call it, for 2011, that probably contributed 1 point or 2 of growth to the category in '11. So overall, we feel good about the category. Our performance, we feel good about, from a POS standpoint, as I mentioned, share grew. In the U.S., POS was positive in the fourth quarter. If you strip out the impact of Cars 2 on us, it was a little bit more positive for the year and for the quarter. So we liked that. So we felt very positive about it. And our shares in Europe grew over the 2012, so we think our position is pretty strong leaving the year.","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. When you were going through the list of things that you have coming up in 2013, do you guys not have the rights to Monster U?","Bryan G. Stockton","We do, Sean. That's on the list.","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And could you tell us -- I mean, the cash flow from operations really strong in the quarter, ended the year with more cash than expected. But the buyback, not as robust as it's been in the past. What are your thoughts on that?","Kevin M. Farr","I'll comment on that. Over the last 3 years, Sean, we've repurchased over $1.1 billion of stock, including $78 million in 2013. And if you look at 2012 repurchases, we're lower, principally due to the acquisition of HIT in the first quarter for $685 million. But as you mentioned, record revenues and operating margins and tight management of working capital exceed -- equal to record cash flow from operations. And as you know, we collected a substantial portion of that cash flow in the -- late in the year. And based upon our consistent historical discipline deploying excess cash over the last decade, you know that, over time, as we look forward, we'll deploy cash consistent with our framework. So over time, you can expect that we'll deploy our excess cash consistent with our capital investment framework. The target is year-end cash of $800 million to $1 billion and debt to total capital of about 35%. And deploying cash for dividends and share purchases is essential to achieving total shareholder returns in the top third to top quartile in the S&P 500.","Operator","The next question is from Tim Conder of Wells Fargo Securities.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","A couple of things here, to follow on the cash question, you've kept that above the $1 billion here now for 3 years. And granted your -- the HIT acquisition at this point last year had not closed, but obviously, now it has and you're sitting at $1.3 billion, you did -- you've raised the dividend, you've repurchased some stock. I guess, kind of talk to us why you're sustaining it above that high end of your framework, number one. And then sort of in relation to that, you give the 50% to 60% payout ratio, yet you've kind of kept towards the lower end of that range. Is that sort of the intent, still, going forward?","Kevin M. Farr","Yes. I think I'd answer the second one first. When you look at the payout ratio, we're really looking at it versus 2012 actual EPS. So when you look at our dividend payout ratio for the increase today of 16% to -- from $0.31 to $0.36, which translates into a $1.44 dividend, if you look backwards, based upon adjusted EPS, that's about 58% payout ratio. With respect to -- going to year-end cash, again, as I just mentioned, we did purchase less shares this year, principally due to the acquisition of HIT. And also, the cash flow reflected the fact that we collected that cash late in the year. And if you look at the balance of $1.3 billion this year, yes, we've been over that $1 billion range the last 2 years. That has included pre-funding of debt at the end of 2010, I think, of about $250 million. And when you look at 2011, we pre-funded the acquisition of HIT, which included about $600 million that was on the balance sheet at the end of the year. So if you back those amounts out of 2010 and 2011, we'd be back in that $800 million to $1 billion range.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, okay. And then if I may, Bryan, with Barbie, you guys have -- you got it dialed in, the last several years, you had a good run here with Barbie. I guess, do you feel comfortable with the good -- a good problem of tough comps, do you feel comfortable with ongoing growth here? And you already talked about Monster High. But from that perspective, and then I guess, as it plays into also, the gross margin, with the tough comps on Barbie, Fisher-Price looking to grow, do you feel comfortable kind of sustaining slightly above it, it appears, that 50% long-term goal?","Bryan G. Stockton","Tim, when we think about Barbie, we always think about Barbie in the context of our total Girls portfolio. And our total Girls portfolio has had quite a run over the past couple of years. We've been growing the category. Our share has been growing. Monster High, as you know, has been an incredible success. It's now a $1 billion brand at retail. Disney Princess grew double digits last year. So when thinking about Barbie's performance, we're actually pretty pleased with what I would call a solid year. Per share of the total toy category was flat. If you take out the impact of currency in international, Barbie shipments for the year were essentially flat, and we think that's quite a performance, given all the activity that we've been generating around the brand. As we look to our plans for next year, I'm not going to give guidance on growth on Barbie, but what I can tell you is that we're pretty pleased with the programs. I mentioned Barbie Life in the Dreamhouse in my comments. That's something that has taken off and has pleased us in terms of the engagement with girls, particularly older girls. And because of the success of that content, we're now building on that, and we'll have a more complete promotional and toy line around that. I think, Kevin, maybe comment on your gross margin question.","Kevin M. Farr","Yes, Tim. 2012, we delivered operating income of 11% and operating margin of 18%, excluding the impact of the litigation charge. And we delivered gross margins of at least 50% for the last 4 consecutive years. And our goal is to grow operating income 6% to 8%, which is consistent with delivering top third to top quartile TSR over time. As we said, we've got many levers that we can use to work towards achieving growth in our operating income and essentially expanding our operating margins. And as I told you in November, assuming the mix tailwinds continue in our portfolio of brands, coupled with lower volatility in input costs and foreign exchange, we could see gross margins above 50% over the near term. And this approach aligns with delivering top third to top quartile TSR.","Operator","The next question is from Drew Crum of Stifel, Nicolaus.","Andrew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I want to go back to the cash topic. Can you talk, Kevin, a little bit about the working capital benefit you saw, how sustainable that is? And in terms of accounting for this litigation charge, you accrued it in the fourth quarter, when does the cash outflow occur with that?","Kevin M. Farr","Okay. So let me just cover the second one first. The cash outflow, I would expect would be 2013, but that's still subject to working it through the court system. So second, with regard to the working capital, I think that's more or less -- some of it is timing with regard to accrued liabilities, and some of it is a onetime. So when we look at the cash flow generation from the business, I think it is very strong. It's -- are delivering operating margins of 18% of net sales, delivering strong cash flow. And again, working capital, over time, as our -- we grow our business, should be a slight reduction in our cash flow from operations. But we did see great cash flow this year as we tightly managed our working capital.","Andrew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And Bryan, can you talk about the American Girl business in a little more detail? Obviously, a very strong 2012, an acceleration of top line growth. How are you feeling about 2013? What are some of the key drivers for that business? Is this level of growth sustainable?","Bryan G. Stockton","Well, I would say again, I'm not going to give guidance on the growth of American Girl. But I would tell you, if you look at what's made this brand successful over the last few years, it's been really 2 things: One has been the continued expansion of our retail footprint; and then secondly is really continuing the strong relationship we have with girls through both our historical dolls and also our Girl of the Year. Last year, McKenna was a great success for us in terms of Girl of the Year. We had 3 stores open up. So we think that's really been a positive formula for us. As we look at 2013, we're going to continue to build on expanding stores. We've announced one location, and stay tuned for perhaps more news on that later. And the new girl, Sage, seems to be off to a pretty good start. It's early, it's just February 1. But I think if you look at the core of what this brand has done well, and that's delivered growth pretty consistently, that formula works well, and we would expect that formula to continue to deliver what it has historically. So we're looking forward to it.","Andrew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then 2 last quick ones for me. Can you guys comment on how HIT performed against the revenue guidance you gave at the beginning of 2012, I think it was $150 million? And then secondly, just in terms of protocol with respect to this new franchise launch, do you intend to announce a new franchise at the end of '13? Or will you have new product on shelves at the end of 13?","Kevin M. Farr","Yes. I'll cover the first one, which is we're pleased with the performance of HIT with respect to acquiring these great brands and actually working to integrate it into the company, as well as to get brand awareness in regions like Latin America. So we've accomplished a lot in 2012 to set us up for growth on a global basis, consistent with our acquisition model in the future. So with respect to providing details, we really don't provide that level of detail of HIT, so I'm not going to give you more details with respect to revenues.","Bryan G. Stockton","Drew, regarding the new franchise, we keep sort of teasing you all, but we'll have an announcement sometime later in the year, and I think I'll leave the news to that level of detail at the moment. But if you look at, historically, how we've been able to successfully grow and create these new franchises, we've launched them with content. In the case of Monster High, it was a lot of webisodes and storytelling through that medium. We talked about Max Steel, launching the content and all the digital engagement this spring with the toy line and consumer products coming out in the fall. So I think we've been following a pretty solid model in terms of creating the demand and the characters and the content, then fill that demand with toys and consumer products. So we'll be able to tell you more later in the year on the new franchise. But I would look at the models we've used in the past and let that be your guide.","Operator","The next question is from Gerrick Johnson of BMO Capital Markets.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","What kind of price increases are you implementing for this year? And also, can you remind us what you implemented last year at this time, and did those stick, meaning did you end up having to give some of that back later in sales allowances or promotions?","Kevin M. Farr","Okay, so Gerrick, I think when we look at 2013, we continue to operate in an inflationary environment with a lot of volatility as the economy slowly recovers and input costs continue to rise. As you know, we look forward to continuing to work on manufacturing efficiency programs, O.E. 3.0, cost savings programs, to offset as much as we can. But as we look at our last lever, which is pricing actions for 2013, to sustain gross margins above 50% in the near term, we've implemented this low single-digit global price increase effective January 1, 2013. If you look at 2012, we did a mid-single-digit price increase. And overall, that stuck. I'd like to note, though, that we did have higher sales adjustments in the fourth quarter and full year. But sales and margins were up, and we managed the business appropriately. This was about everyday execution. And we did thoughtful retail promotions, aligned shipments with POS to optimize our inventories and retail inventories. And given economic concerns, we saw a more challenging environment when it came to consumer demand as the holiday approached, and we shifted our resources to support retail program levers. The best time to talk to consumers, as you know, Gerrick, is in the holiday season, and we adjusted our everyday execution accordingly. And we'll continue our disciplined approach in managing our business and striking the right balance between shipping, POS and inventories. As you can see for the full year, we delivered strong gross margins of above 53%, which was consistent with our 4-year track record of delivering gross margins at or above 50%.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. Very thorough, Kevin. On Asia -- one more question for you. On Asia, 27% growth, would you consider that same-store sales gains, if you will? Or are there new doors or new countries that you're opening, that you weren't in before? And then the impact of China, if you could discuss that, on your results in the fourth quarter.","Bryan G. Stockton","Sure. Well, we're pleased with our business in Asia. And I would say it's a combination of a number of factors. Number one, we have been investing in our brands, particularly in countries that have great scale potential, like China and India. So if you look at Barbie and Fisher-Price in particular, you see those brands very well represented, and consumers are really getting engaged with those brands. So we're trying to create demand by getting girls to understand what fashion doll play is all about, by they getting moms to understand that infant preschool toys can, in fact, help your child develop. And Fisher-Price is the best choice to make if you want to buy an infant preschool toy. So we're making marketing investments. As you can imagine, a lot of the retail partners that we have in China in particular, and throughout Asia, are expanding the number of stores. So we do have some growth there. But it's really a combination of factors: New distribution, store growth, but I would say brand investment is something that's been pretty consistent that we've been doing, particularly in China and India, over the last 10 years.","Operator","The next question is from Linda Bolton-Weiser of B. Riley Caris.","Linda Bolton-Weiser - B. Riley & Co., LLC, Research Division","'s","I was just curious about -- you had talked, sort of SKU reduction initiatives a while back. And we haven't heard much mention of it. Is it still something you're focused on, and can you report on any progress on that? Or do you actually think it's not as much of a priority? I mean, you've certainly had good sales growth without it. I guess that would be my first question.","Bryan G. Stockton","Linda, we're constantly looking at our product lines in terms of what's the right balance of the offering to the consumer, how do we have the right presence at retail, what's the right way to make sure that we provide differentiation across our retail customers. So we're constantly looking at our SKU lineup. We like productive SKUs. Our customers like productive SKUs. So we're always looking at trying to figure out what we can do to make our SKUs profitable and growing. If I look at Fisher-Price, for example, as I'd say a living, breathing example of SKU management, we spend a lot of time really focusing in on what are the segments of the business that really support the mom positioning. And so that's why, for example, last year, we've put a lot of emphasis behind Little People and Imaginext because those are 2 products lines that really support the brand positioning quite well. And you probably saw us put a little less emphasis on maybe a few other lines that we might have traditionally supported at Fisher-Price. So we think that's a way to really focus our marketing support, focus our engagement, have more productive SKUs, both for us and for our retailers. So it's really become more of a, I call it, a way of life here, as opposed to a special project.","Kevin M. Farr","Yes. And I'll just add to that. I think as we look at O.E. 2.0 and again, with O.E. 3.0, it's really about productivity of SKUs. And we're looking for opportunities as we focus on strategic growth investments and strategic areas to grow, to really first look at reallocating resources from SKUs that aren't performing well to areas where we can focus in on product categories or product lines with greater productivity. So that's a continuous evolution of really constantly managing this area, as Bryan has indicated.","Linda Bolton-Weiser - B. Riley & Co., LLC, Research Division","Can I ask a second question?","Bryan G. Stockton","Of course.","Linda Bolton-Weiser - B. Riley & Co., LLC, Research Division","You had mentioned -- you had made some reference to the creation of the new North American division. And I'm kind of interested in hearing a little bit more about that and how -- like what the positive effects of that are, because it seems like that could have really long-term benefits to growth.","Bryan G. Stockton","Well, if I start with the reason of why we put that in place, it's, number one, we wanted to get decision-making closer to the consumer and to the -- our retail partners here in the U.S. And that's why we decided to have a group that was really more focused on the commercial side of the business, more akin to how we ran the international business. So the U.S. organization now looks just like the French organization or Chinese organization or Mexican organization, in terms of how they deal with our customers and consumers. That then freed us up to also have our global brand teams, so teams on Barbie, Monster High, Hot Wheels, Fisher-Price, Thomas, et cetera. They are now spending more time focusing on what they can do to build brands outside of the U.S., because prior to the last year or 2, they were really more focused on developing products for the U.S. As we've said, we expect international to grow. We'd like it to become about 60% of our overall revenues. And to do that, frankly, we needed to spend more time and attention with our brand groups outside of the U.S. Having said that, I did mention that I expect our POS situation in the U.S. to continue to improve over the next few years. It's really about everyday execution. And I was really pleased at how well the North American division did, I would say in the holiday season this year. I mentioned earlier that it was a little choppy this year. Consumers were concerned about the fiscal cliff. Consumer confidence went down. We now know the GDP was shrinking. So you can imagine in a backdrop like that, consumers would likely be a little more retail promotion-sensitive than they might be advertising-sensitive, for example. So we took that in consideration in working with our retail partners. And that's the kind of thinking that I think we saw come out of the North America division because they're so focused on our customers and execution that we made the right choices across all the things they can do to create demand, to have a successful year. So I could probably talk about this forever because I'm very excited about it. But that's -- that would be my top line, Linda.","Linda Bolton-Weiser - B. Riley & Co., LLC, Research Division","And can I just sneak in one last one on -- I think you said we're going to hear maybe about another global brand platform to be developed, this year we'll hear about it. Do you think we'll hear about it in the first half or the second half of the year? And then secondly, you had mentioned a while back that you had some agreement with Stan Lee for some kind of development of something. Is that agreement still in place and is that a future thing we'll hear about at some point?","Bryan G. Stockton","Can you repeat the second part of your question? I couldn't quite hear it.","Linda Bolton-Weiser - B. Riley & Co., LLC, Research Division","In terms of your agreement with the developer or creator of the Spiderman and all of those, I think his name is Stan Lee. I think you had announced something a while back that you had an agreement with him, his organization, to develop a new brand platform. Is that agreement still in place?","Bryan G. Stockton","Well, let me answer the second question first. We're still working on developing a relationship and what we're interested in doing and what they may be interested in doing. So as soon as we have something substantive to tell you about, I'm sure we'll be more than happy to share that. But I'd say it's still a work in progress. As it relates to our announcement on our new property, it could be in the first half, it could be in the second half, it could be a Boys property, it could be a Girls property, so stay tuned.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Kelter of Goldman Sachs.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So Bryan, you had said in your prepared remarks that you weren't happy with U.S. consumer POS takeaway. So I guess I'm curious what you'll be doing differently in '13 and beyond given that? I mean, I know you have some new product lines, but every year, there's some new stuff. So what will you be doing differently to change the trajectory?","Bryan G. Stockton","Well, let me build off the answer that I gave Linda regarding the North America division. I think this is going to be the first full year that we have the organization in place. We've got some new leadership in place there that we're very excited about. I think our customers -- the feedback that I've received so far are very positive on how we're working, we're bringing our toy group and our consumer products groups together in this new organization. So I think they've had a year to sort of get their feet wet on how we can do this. And so this year, I think -- I frankly expect even better execution and partnering with our retailers from an execution standpoint. From a consumer standpoint, I think we're going to have great consumer engagement. Particularly in the digital area, we've been making a lot of investments, both in -- whether it's websites, digital gaming, other ways to engage. If I think about digital with toys, we had a terrific success with Barbie, Photo Fashion Barbie. And one of the things that I think we learned very well this year is that when we think about digital amplification of play patterns, we need to try and do more work in terms of doing that within core play patterns, the more traditional play patterns, and we think that worked. So I think there'll be more consumer engagement and better execution. And that's what gives me confidence that we can expect more out of our U.S. business.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And the sales adjustment line, the trade spend, you addressed it a little earlier. I just wanted to follow up on that because it was up about $40 million versus the run rate of the past several years' fourth quarters. Was that all late year discounting in response to slow sales early in the Christmas season? Because it seems like a big number, especially in light of the fact that Barbie, Hot Wheels and Fisher-Price were all still down in the U.S. even despite the increase in spend there.","Bryan G. Stockton","Yes, Michael, let me start, and I'll have Kevin fill in the gaps here. I think when -- the way we look at sales adjustments under 2 perspectives. The first one is, it's one of the many levers that we pull, whether it's advertising, consumer promotion, retail promotions, et cetera. And when we look at the year, our sales were up, our shares reported by NPD was up, our inventory was down, our gross margins were up, our operating profit was up, our TSR was up, so we think overall, all those various levers that we pulled delivered a very solid year, particularly for our shareholders. The second one is, I keep going back to the 1-2-3 punch that we believe consumers were facing. It's GDP shrinking, consumer confidence was waning pretty badly, as you recall during the fourth quarter, and there was a lot of discussion about the fiscal cliff and worries about taxes going up, frankly, for everyone at the beginning of the year. So that's that 1-2-3 economic punch. And if you think about what would you do to think about how to engage consumers and support our retail partners, you would think in that environment that consumers will be more sensitive to retail promotions. And so as I said, our North America division made that choice. We had some international countries also make that choice in markets where we thought there was a lot of pressure on consumers. So it was a conscious decision on our part to shift our mix a little bit, given the environment. Kevin, do you want to add?","Kevin M. Farr","Yes, just to add to that, we did a mid-single-digit price increase for the year, and our gross margins improved by 290 basis points. And we did execute in the holiday season when consumers are coming out. We wanted to sell-in and sell-through products. And I think we were very successful in aligning our shipments and our POS and ended the year with our inventories being in good shape, and overall, retail inventories being in good shape. And some of that increase related to the growth programs around the world, where retailers met their growth programs and received customer benefits for that.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then one last, just a very quick clarification. When you mentioned that POS was slightly negative for the year and slightly positive in the fourth quarter, does that include the accretion of HIT, meaning organically, were you down a little bit more than that?","Kevin M. Farr","Really, the accretion of HIT relates to the licensing business, and that's really excluded from the POS numbers we're giving you, because that's really consumer products. We're giving you POS on the toy products.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And on the -- like the Thomas toy products, I guess what I'm asking is, is that both in the year ago and in the current? Or is it only in the current, because you didn't own it a year ago?","Kevin M. Farr","No, it's in both. Because of the Fisher-Price license, we were distributing the die-cast and plastic for -- since 2010, so it's been in the base since 2010.","Operator","The final question will come from Greg Badishkanian of Citi.","Alvin C. Concepcion - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","This is Alvin Concepcion on for Greg. I just wanted to see if you could discuss or quantify your retail inventory position in Europe and any other international markets would be helpful. And then secondly, how do you feel about the industry retail inventory levels in the United States at the end of the year?","Bryan G. Stockton","So let me start with really thinking about the U.S. I think on all fronts, you should probably talk to our retail partners first. Most of them just finished their fiscal years yesterday, and so I'm sure they're busy doing that. But I really don't want to get into trying to predict what's going on at retail. I would tell you that we're feeling pretty good about our situation at retail. As I mentioned, in the U.S., our inventories are down. International, we feel like we're in pretty good shape. Obviously, there's some markets that are up and some markets that are down. But overall, we feel pretty good about our inventory position.","Alvin C. Concepcion - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great. And then are you noticing any difference in terms of core brands versus Entertainment properties, in terms of how inventories are at retail?","Bryan G. Stockton","No, not really. I think retailers have demonstrated over the last couple of years that they're buying what's selling, and so we're, I think, in pretty good shape across our portfolio.","Kevin M. Farr","I think I would just add to that, retailers for the last several years have been tightly managing inventories, retail inventories. And as we looked out at the end of '11 to '12 and looked at our first quarter, we saw that retailers continue to tightly manage inventories in the first half of the year, as our retail POS in early in the year was leading and our shipments were lagging. So I think it's a phenomenon where they're going to tightly manage retail inventories, consistent with their historical practice of being very tight about it on a global basis.","Drew Vollero","Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Drew Vollero, Senior Vice President of Corporate Strategy and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Drew Vollero","Thanks, operator. As you know, this morning, we reported Mattel's first quarter financial results. We've provided you with a slide presentation to help guide our discussion today. The slide presentation and the information required by Regulation G regarding non-GAAP financial measures is available on the Investors & Media section of our corporate website, corporate.mattel.com.","In a few minutes, Bryan Stockton, Mattel's CEO; and Kevin Farr, Mattel's CFO, will provide comments on the results, and then the call will be opened for your questions.","Certain statements made during the call may include forward-looking statements related to the future performance of our overall business. These statements are based on currently available information, and they are subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties, which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.","We describe some of these uncertainties in the Risk Factors section of our 2011 annual report on Form 10-K and in our 2012 quarterly reports on Form 10-Q as well as in other filings we make with the SEC from time to time. Mattel does not update forward-looking statements and expressly disclaims any obligation to do so.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bryan.","Bryan G. Stockton","Thank you, Drew, and good morning, everyone. Last week marked my 100th day as Mattel's Chief Executive Officer. During those first 100 days, I shared with you Mattel's plan to achieve consistent long-term growth and continued strong financial performance. We're aligning behind 4 key initiatives: plan for growth, structure for growth, nurture our talented and accelerate an already innovative culture. I'm pleased to say that after the first 100 days, we made some great progress towards achieving these goals. ","Let me touch on some of these areas, starting with plan for growth. As we've told you before, Mattel will focus on 4 key growth strategies: growing core brands, building new franchises, optimizing our entertainment partnerships and expanding our international footprint. The big news with core brands is the addition of our newest core brand, Thomas & Friends. I'll discuss our plans for Thomas in a few minutes.","We're also continuing to extend our core brands. We recently announced 2 multi-year global licensing partnerships for Barbie and Hot Wheels-themed products, a license with MEGA Brands to develop construction toys and a license with Crayola to develop Barbie and Hot Wheels-themed arts and crafts products, including an app that turns the iPad into an interactive coloring book.","In our Entertainment business, we're very excited to have recently extended the Disney Princess license for North America and Latin America and have expanded the scope to include emerging markets such as Eastern Europe, Turkey, Greece as well as the Middle East and Africa. Disney Princess has been a strong performer for Mattel and is a solid fit within our Girls portfolio. And earlier this year, we announced the renewal of a multi-year global licensing partnership with Nickelodeon to develop toys based on Nickelodeon's preschool programs. ","We're also growing internationally. We're driving our international growth by making disciplined, strategic investments in infrastructure and brand building. As you'll recall, we made a long-term strategic investment in Brazil, and it paid off in a big way. Brazil is now our second largest country in sales after the U.S. We\u2019ve made great progress in both India and China. And earlier this year, in line with our emerging markets strategy, we transitioned from a distributor model to a wholly owned Mattel subsidiary with the opening of our office in Russia. We'll apply levels of investment and discipline into Russia consistent with the opportunity, and we believe we are well positioned for growth in this important BRIC country.","To support our plan for growth, we're also structuring for growth. The newly created North America division and global brand teams have been up and running since January 1. Our North America division now has a team of people fully dedicated to running the commercial part of our business. This brings decision making much closer to consumers and customers in this important geography. ","Our global brand teams are now sharply focused on global brand building and product design to better meet the unique needs of consumers and customers by geographic region. Forming global brand teams and applying the international subsidiary-like approach to North America enables us to focus resources to grow the business more rapidly.","But even with the best plan and structure, it all comes down to people. Nurturing our talent is the key focus at Mattel. Earlier this year, I appointed Jean-Christophe Pean to lead our newly formed North America division. Jean-Christophe has been with Mattel since 1998 and has successfully served in a variety of key leadership roles, including Senior Vice President and General Manager of Asia Pacific and Vice President and General Manager of the U.K. I'm confident that Jean-Christophe will leverage his extensive global sales and marketing experience to lead and grow this important aspect of Mattel's business.","Last week, Ellen Brothers announced her plan to retire from American Girl at the end of the year. We thank Ellen for the outstanding job she's done over the past 12 years, leading the American Girl team to achieve the $0.5 billion sales mark, and congratulate Ellen on her planned retirement.","Jean McKenzie, Senior Vice President of marketing at Mattel, has been named Ellen's successor. Jean has a proven track record in brand-building in the areas of literacy, learning and girls' toys. While Jean has worked for companies such as Disney and Gateway Learning Corporation, the owner of the award-winning Hooked on Phonics brand, she also knows a lot about Mattel. In fact, early in her career, Jean was the general manager of the Barbie brand. ","During the next 5 months, Ellen and Jean will begin making the leadership transition. Jean will assume the leadership role of American Girl on September 1, and Ellen will remain on as an adviser until the end of 2012. ","We've made some really good strategic progress in the first 100 days. Now let's switch our focus to the quarter. While Kevin will provide a more detailed financial review, from my perspective, the quarter played out pretty much as we had anticipated. We carried over momentum in our portfolio of brands and countries into the first quarter. Through February 2012, we gained overall NPD toy category share across the U.S. and in Europe with Barbie and Hot Wheels gaining share in both regions. Monster High is doing extremely well globally and is now the #2 fashion doll year-to-date February in the U.S. and in Europe according to NPD. And we're sold out in many markets. This quarter also marked American Girls' seventh consecutive quarter of growth.","We continue to see growth internationally. For the quarter, we saw growth across all regions. Our Latin American business is doing particularly well as it has for the last few years. And our European business continues to perform well, despite the stiff economic challenges there, gaining NPD share through February. ","Complementing our growth focus is an emphasis on costs and gross margins. For the quarter, gross margins were consistent with our long-term goal of about 50%, and we remain on track to deliver our Operational Excellence 2.0 savings target of $175 million. ","That said, we know we have work to do in North America and with Fisher-Price. In North America, our shipping volume declined versus last year, primarily driven by 2 key factors: first, a decline in Cars shipping volume; and second, cautious retailer ordering patterns. Let me touch on each.","More than half of the U.S. shipping decline is attributable to the timing of last year's Cars 2 movie launch. As we discussed, Cars 2 was and will be a first half tail -- headwind for us as retailers were gearing up for the movie launch last year in the first and second quarters. That said, Cars continues to be a great success as an evergreen property, selling well over-the-counter and gaining NPD share in the first 2 months of 2012, both in the U.S. and Europe. Retailers were particularly cautious in their first quarter ordering patterns in the U.S. For the quarter, shipping lagged our POS as retailers reduced inventories. In fact, inventory at our top 4 U.S. customers fell mid- to high single-digit levels. Brands like Barbie experienced some of the most significant gaps between shipments and consumer takeaway.","Despite that, we continue to have the toy brands that consumers choose more often. Barbie, Hot Wheels, Monster High and Cars all gained NPD share in the U.S. through February 2012.","Fisher-Price remains a work in progress as we continue to execute our strategy to transition and globalize the brand. Overall, Fisher-Price shipping was flat for the quarter, which includes the benefit of licensed revenue from HIT Entertainment. International results at Fisher-Price were up 8% for the quarter, and we continue to see a big opportunity for the brand outside the U.S.","We continue to make good progress combining the HIT business with Mattel. The core leadership team at HIT is now in place and working under the direction of David Allmark, Executive Vice President of Fisher-Price, who's focused on driving the business forward. Growing Thomas continues to be a top priority, and we're excited about the opportunity to bring together all of the Thomas toy platforms, including die cast, plastic and wood. We're making good progress to successfully transition the wood business from the current licensee to Mattel in 2013.","Smart investments are already being made to roll out an enhanced product portfolio with new play patterns and characters, improved content to drive better brand engagement and align with our key broadcast partners around the world for better placement. We believe that better broadcast placement for Thomas in Latin America and other regions presents a great opportunity to drive brand awareness and sales. ","While Thomas was the centerpiece of the acquisition, we're encouraged by the opportunity to create value from other brands in the HIT portfolio. Mike the Knight, for example, was launched on Nickelodeon in the U.S. in February 2012 and is already one of the top 25 shows for 2- to 5-year-old kids across all channels in the U.S. Mike is broadcast internationally on top channels like CBeebies in the U.K., TF1 in France and Super RTL in Germany and has been receiving excellent ratings. Much more to follow on HIT, but we continue to be excited about the opportunity to build the business on a global basis. ","As you know, we consider the first quarter to be spring training for the toy industry. We believe we\u2019ve struck a good balance between strategic and tactical execution in the quarter, making progress on both fronts. We continue to have momentum in many key areas, and we're focused on improving our performance in a couple of areas like North America and Fisher-Price. We're well positioned with the best global brands, growing share and strong margins and cash flow to deliver another solid year of financial performance.","And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Mattel's CFO, Kevin Farr, for the financial review of the quarter. Kevin?","Kevin M. Farr","Thank you, Bryan, and good morning, everyone. As Bryan pointed out, our strategic goal is to grow consistently over time and continue to deliver strong financial performance along the way. To do this well, Mattel will utilize its best-in-class portfolio of brands, countries and customers.","In the first quarter, the portfolio helped to balance results as worldwide revenues were down 2% despite the North American region falling 9%, with solid growth internationally helping to offset a very cautious domestic retail environment.","From a brand perspective, core brands like Barbie and Hot Wheels were down mid-single digits, but were partially offset by the strength of American Girl and Monster High. Mattel's portfolio should continue to generate significant cash flow, and we need to invest these funds into the right places. We are poised to do that in 2012 as we started off in the first quarter by closing our acquisition of HIT Entertainment on February 1. We are currently developing expansion plans for both Thomas and selected brands -- HIT brands, and we'll share the highlights with you as the year progresses. Strategically, we are encouraged with the global opportunities to leverage the Thomas brand and other HIT brands in the years to come. ","Additionally, we're investing in proven business models that have generated value-enhancing growth for Mattel. Recently, we announced the opening of 3 new American Girl stores in St. Louis, Houston and Miami in 2012. To date, American Girl retail stores have proven to be a profitable way to expand our brand. ","And as Bryan mentioned, in the first quarter, we expanded our international footprint by opening our new Russian office. Similar strategies in Latin America and Asia have been smart investments. ","But the key to realizing the potential of a strong portfolio or sound investment ideas is execution. Mattel has executed well over the last few years and continued to do so in the first quarter. ","In the marketplace, we continue to execute well, and we are winning with consumers. Through February, we continue to gain NPD share both in the U.S. and Europe. We're also gaining share in our key brands like Barbie, Hot Wheels and Monster High to name a few. And our execution in the middle P&L remains sound as we continue to deliver results consistent with our stated margin objectives despite the challenging cost environment and economic uncertainties.","Gross margins for the quarter were 51%, 130 basis point higher than last year. We also continued to tightly manage costs and delivered incremental growth savings of $36 million under our Operational Excellence 2.0 cost savings initiatives. Since 2009, our cumulative gross savings are now over $350 million.","The balance sheet remains strong as we tightly managed accounts receivable, which was down by $15 million, and inventories, which were $3 million lower.","That said, as is always the case at this time of year, there is more work to do in certain areas of our portfolio. In North America, the newly created North America division will be keenly focused on marketing and retail execution. For the quarter, Bryan shared that shipping lagged POS as retailers reduced their inventories. By the end of the quarter, inventories at our top 4 customers were lower by mid- to high single digits.","Looking forward, we expect our North America division to build an even tighter connection with our key customers with the objective to grow our business in 2012 and beyond.","So now let's go into the detail around some of our results for the first quarter. Starting on Page 4 of our slide deck, you can see that our worldwide gross sales are down 2% as growth in our international region of 7% was offset by a 9% decline in our North American region. As Bryan said, about half of the decline in North America is attributable to the timing of last year's Cars 2 movie launch, and the balance related to U.S. retailers tightly managing their inventories. ","Turning to Page 5 of the slide presentation, you can see the brand perspective on sales. Worldwide sales for the Mattel Girls & Boys Brands were down 4% for the quarter. Barbie sales were down 6%, up against a tough international comparison of plus 23% and a challenging retailer market in the U.S., but consumer takeaway remained positive.","Hot Wheels was down by 5%, facing the same international and domestic challenges as Barbie. ","Monster High continues to drive our other Girls business while Disney Princesses remains a strong evergreen property, but is lower in 2012 due to the 2011 success of the global theatrical release, Tangled.  ","Also worth noting is our Games and Radica business performed well in the quarter. ","Worldwide sales for Fisher-Price brands were flat for the quarter, helped by the inclusion of the licensing revenues from the HIT Entertainment acquisition. Good performances in Disney properties were offset by declines in other brands. ","American Girl continued to deliver strong results with sales in the first quarter up 4%. Our Girl of the Year, McKenna, is performing extremely well as is the My American Girl line. We continued to see good momentum in our retail operations.","On Page 6, we highlight the performance of our North American region, which includes American Girl and our North America division, which consists of operations in the U.S. and Canada. Overall, sales for the region were down 9% due to lower shipment of Cars and as retailers focused on adjusting their inventories in the quarter. As we said earlier, Cars was a headwind for the quarter, and we expect that will continue for the first half of the year. As we've previously indicated, we continue to expect Cars' seasonality and our total company seasonality to return to more historical levels in 2012.","Our international business, as seen on Page 7, continues to improve with growth across all regions for the quarter. Despite some foreign exchange headwinds, we continue to see considerable strength in Latin America, particularly with Brazil and Mexico, and continue to be encouraged with performance in Europe in light of the economic climate. Asia Pacific continues to deliver strong double-digit growth, although off a much smaller base. ","Now let's review the P&L starting on Page 8 of the slide presentation.","For the quarter, gross margin was 51%, an improvement of 130 basis points from last year. The favorability is primarily due to pricing, foreign exchange and O.E. 2.0 savings, which were partially offset by higher product costs. As expected, the HIT acquisition also had a positive impact in margins in the quarter.","As seen on Page 9 of the slide presentation, for the quarter, selling, general and administrative expenses increased approximately $12 million to $347 million. Acquisition and integration costs for HIT Entertainment were approximately $16 million. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expense was 37.4%, up 234 -- 230 basis points compared to the prior year's rate of 35.1%.","Excluding the impact of HIT acquisition integration costs, SG&A expense was lower in absolute dollars by about $4 million or 35.6% of net sales. As expected, savings and litigation expenses and the absence of a 2011 settlement chargers was key drivers. We continue to provide an updated historical trend summary of our incremental MGA and recall-related legal and settlement costs in the Appendix.","Page 10 of the presentation summarizes the performance of our 2-year Global Cost Leadership initiative and continuing efforts on our ongoing Operational Excellence 2.0 program. For the quarter, we delivered incremental Operational Excellence 2.0 gross savings of $36 million, and we're on track to deliver the $175 million in cumulative savings by the end of 2012.","Turning to Page 11. Operating income in the first quarter was $28.7 million or 3.1% of net sales, down 80 basis points compared with last year's first quarter. The decrease in operating income was driven by lower sales and the acquisition and integration costs associated with HIT Entertainment, which were offset by higher gross margins and lower legal spending.","Turning to Page 12. Earnings per share for the quarter were $0.02, which includes a $0.04 charge in the quarter for HIT acquisition and integration expenses. Slightly lower sales, HIT acquisition integration costs and ongoing HIT SG&A were partially offset by higher gross margins and reduced legal spending. In addition, higher interest expense and a slightly higher tax rate also impacted earnings per share for the quarter. ","As you know, the acquisition of HIT Entertainment closed on February 1. Today, we wanted to provide some additional information that will help you to better understand HIT's top line and bottom line impacts to our business in 2012. We previously told you on a historical basis, HIT Entertainment generated about $180 million in annual revenues with about a 40% EBITDA margin. For 2012, we anticipate revenue should be lower due to 2 major factors: first, the Fisher-Price royalty payment on plastic and die cast products will no longer be recorded as revenue, but as a reduction to royalty expense; and second, 2012 will only include 11 months of operations.","We expect both of these adjustments to lower revenues by $30 million to $35 million for the year, and we continue to expect that the acquisition should not have a material impact on our business in 2012, but should be accretive to our business going forward. We expect operating profits for the business this year to be offset by acquisition and integration costs and intangible amortization as well as interest expense.","Page 13 outlines both the estimated integration and amortization expenses. We highlight both the actual costs incurred in the quarter and estimated annual costs Mattel expects to incur in 2012 as a result of the acquisition. Neither of these charges was incurred by the business in 2011. For the quarter, acquisition and integration expenses were $16 million, and we expect these expenses to total between $25 million and $30 million for the year. These expenses include acquisition costs, consulting fees and severance in IT infrastructure costs. In addition, we'll also incur about $1 million in expenses related to the amortization of intangibles. For the year, we expect these expenses to be about $5 million to $6 million.","We discussed cash flow on Page 14. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $172 million compared to cash flow used for operations of $42 million in the first quarter of last year. The improvement is primarily due to changes in working capital and reduced tax payments. ","Capital expenditures for the quarter were $38 million, down $7 million from last year, primarily due to the timing of expenditures for tooling.","In addition, we repurchased approximately 700,000 shares of stock in the first quarter. ","So to recap cash flow for the first quarter, we increased capital deployment for the acquisition of HIT Entertainment and our higher quarterly dividend payment, which were partially offset by the improvement in operational cash flow, lower capital spending and fewer share repurchases. As a result, our cash on hand at the end of the quarter was $785 million, down $264 million from the prior year's first quarter.","Looking forward, we continued to have a strong balance sheet and a business that generates consistent cash flow, which we will continue to deploy to enhance shareholder value. ","Today, we announced our second quarter dividend of $0.31 per share, reflecting the annualized dividend of $1.24 per share, which represents a 35% increase to 2011's total dividends.","We remain committed to our capital deployment strategy to maintain $800 million to $1 billion in year-end cash, to maintain a year-end debt-to-capital ratio about 35% and to return excess funds through dividends and share repurchases.","In 2012, we expect to end the year with cash and debt levels consistent with our framework, and there will be 3 key drivers for cash deployment in 2012: the acquisition of HIT Entertainment for $680 million; an increased dividend payout through an annualized dividend of $1.34, which will return approximately $430 million back to shareholders; and capital expenditures of about $215 million to $225 million, reflecting increased investment in company growth initiatives. The balance of excess cash will be deployed over time opportunistically for share repurchases and targeted acquisitions.","Taking all that into account for 2012, we expect this strategy to result in a reduction of the number of shares repurchased this year as compared to the prior year.","So, in summary, the quarter played out much as anticipated. We continue to have momentum in many of the same key areas that drove our strong financial performance in 2011 and remain committed to executing our plans in key brands like Fisher-Price and with key retailers here in North America. We believe our fundamentals are strong, and the investments made this quarter will allow us to continue to create consistent value for our shareholders.","That concludes my review of the financial results. Now we'd like to open the call to questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Greg Badishkanian of Citigroup.","Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great. Guys, so just wondering, in terms of retail shipments and sell-through, can you talk just a little bit about how your retail compares to the overall industry? Are you a little bit leaner? Or are you about the same?","Bryan G. Stockton","It's Bryan. I would start off by saying we believe we're carrying over the momentum that we created last year into the first quarter. Our shares grew both in the U.S. and in Europe as measured by NPD. We grew about 200 basis points in the U.S. and a little over 100 in Europe. So we've got good consumer momentum, and that's the first place we always struggle when we think about where we are with inventories. As we described to many of you back in February, we said that inventories for the industry appeared to be better than they were the prior year, but still a little bit high and that we believed we were in pretty good shape on inventories. Our unit inventories were just slightly below the prior year, and the feedback from our customers was that other than the usual spots here and there, that we were in pretty good shape. So I can't comment on the competition, but I -- we continue to believe that we\u2019re pretty well placed in inventory. We're going to continue to work with our customers both here in the U.S. and in international to balance out that whole balancing act between making sure we got the right inventories at level to meet our POS needs.","Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Good. And if let's say shipments matched POS, if they were kind of in line with each other and sort of the inventory reduction at retail, would you have had positive shipment growth this quarter? Or how would you have categorized that?","Bryan G. Stockton","Well I would say based on where we are with share, we grew share in a toy category that was declining a little bit in both the Europe and U.S., so it's hard to tell exactly what it would have been. But we think from a share standpoint, we've got the momentum despite a soft category. So it's hard to tell.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sean McGowan of Needham & Company.","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Two questions, one on Cars 2. I seem to recall in the transcript this morning, I actually verified of it [ph], last year in the first quarter, I remember Bob saying that the Cars 2 impact in the quarter wasn't really that significant, that some retailers were buying it, but it was really going to be more of a second quarter event. So the question is could you reconcile that? And does this mean that Cars had -- in the quarter fell below the sort of normalized \"non-movie year level\"? It's a product that sells well even when it's not in the theaters. So is that the case? And then second, if you could be more specific on the previous question, exactly what was the point-of-sale performance year-over-year for those accounts, where you have that data?","Bryan G. Stockton","Sean, it's Bryan. I'll start first with Cars and ask Kevin to fill in a couple of the comments as well. One of the challenges we always have in the first quarter is the law of small numbers, and although Cars may not have seen that large in the first quarter relative to what we shipped overall last year, it did have an impact on our quarter year-on-year performance this year. So in the grand schemes of things at Cars, was it a huge deal? No. As you look at quarter-to-quarter comparisons, it did have an impact primarily on the U.S. You want to add anything to that, Kevin?","Kevin M. Farr","Yes, I'd say that yes, we did ship -- go ahead, Sean.","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Did you think it was just falling down back to the level that it would be in a non-movie year? Or did it go down even more?","Bryan G. Stockton","It's hard to tell right now, Sean, because it's so early. We're just now beginning to count the numbers coming up here in the second quarter. What I'd tell you is that Cars grew share again in both Europe and the U.S., and so we're seeing solid momentum continuing on Cars. So we'll have to get through the second and third quarters. But right now, we're feeling positive about Cars.","Kevin M. Farr","Yes, I think with regard to Cars' shipping level in 2012, it's similar to what we shipped in 2010. So it is at the pre-movie level. Again with Cars, we did do some shipping in the first quarter last year relative to the growth last year. It wasn't substantial. But as we said before, our first half shipments of Cars last year were 50% of the volumes that we usually do, and as we look at 2012, it's going to be more normalized where the first half will be about 1\/3, consistent with Mattel's general trading patterns. And then with regard to your question on POS in the quarter, it was flattish for the quarter in 2012.","Operator","Our next question comes from Felicia Hendrix of Barclays.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I wonder if we could just step back and look at things a little bit bigger picture because you said in the release and Bryan also in your prepared remarks, that the first quarter played out as expected. Obviously, there was, however, a big delta between your expectations and what the Street was looking for. So maybe just to help us all get onto the same page, I'm wondering if you could perhaps discuss with us what the biggest surprises you saw in the quarter from a revenue perspective were, if any. And then you did say that half of the decline was due to Cars 2, half was a decline -- and then is it fair to assume that half of the -- the other half of the North American decline was fully driven by the U.S. retailers being more conservative? Or is there anything else?","Bryan G. Stockton","Sure, Felicia. It's Bryan. Let me start with, in terms of our expectations for the quarter, we don't give guidance. But I think what we've tried to communicate is that we have brand momentum that we have built up particularly on -- in the fashion doll area, Barbie, Monster High, Disney Princess, for example. Cars 2 was doing well. And we talked about beginning to see some encouraging signs on Fisher-Price. Now from a brand standpoint, we still saw that in the first quarter. So that certainly wasn't a surprise. International growth was very consistent with what we've seen. Latin America did well. Asia did well. We were very pleased, frankly, with Europe, given the challenges there, both from a retail standpoint and an economic standpoint. We did talk about the challenges in the U.S. We talked about the headwinds with Cars. I would say based on where we started the quarter, retail inventory reductions might have been a little more drastic than we might have thought. But I don't believe there were any big revenue surprises other than probably that.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Before we get some other follow-up, just with that, so is that changing how you might be thinking about the rest of the year, maybe assuming that the retailers will continue to be conservative?","Bryan G. Stockton","Not really. We've said for the last couple of years given the economic challenges here in the U.S. in particular and Western Europe as well, the retailers have been cautious. We expect them to remain cautious particularly as it relates to inventory. Our job here is to create demand but with our core brands and by extending our brands like Barbie into some new categories. So we're going to focus on our job, which is trying to create demand for our brands and work with our customers to make sure we strike that challenging balance between making sure we're shipping enough to the supply the inventory levels that they need at the right time to support POS.","Kevin M. Farr","Yes, and I'd just add to that I think the POS with regard to Barbie, with regard to Monster High, with regard to Cars are -- have momentum, and retailers are going to tightly manage inventory in 2012 just like they did in 2011. But they're going to buy the products that consumers are buying. And the good news is that we've got the same brands that were creating the momentum in 2011 that delivered value for Mattel, continue to have momentum in the first quarter of 2012.","Bryan G. Stockton","Yes, I would also add as a final note, and we'd encourage you to speak with retailers directly, but from where we're watching, it seems like retailers this year are being a little more aggressive in reducing the inventory carryover from year-on-year than they were a year ago. So we would view that as a positive thing because that'll clear the shelves up for more spring goods.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, so you did highlight that Barbie point-of-sales was good. So as we interpret the numbers that came out, North America down 9%, is that just all attributable to the tighter inventories?","Bryan G. Stockton","Well, about half of it is Cars 2.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","No, I'm talking about Barbie.","Bryan G. Stockton","And about half of it would be retailer inventory reductions, which would go pretty much across-the-board on most brands, including Barbie.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. But I'm looking at a Barbie North American decline of 9%. That was my question I was relating to. That wouldn't have Cars 2 impact.","Kevin M. Farr","Correct. Again, I think what's occurring is that there's been a -- the POS is positive, so that there's -- and shipping is negative 9% as you said, that inventories have gone down high single digits as a result of that.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Just one last final. Just on Easter, was there any impact to your results that we could think about?","Bryan G. Stockton","It's a little early to tell. We haven't seen the NPD data obviously yet. Easter was earlier than last year, but it was still in April, and it will be very interesting to see what consumer shopping patterns were this year. As you'll recall, for Christmas last year, the shopping came very, very late. So it'll be interesting to see what the NPD data tells us.","Operator","Our next question comes from James Hardiman of Longbow Research.","James Hardiman - Longbow Research LLC","Just to briefly close the loop here on the North American decline. Is it safe to say, as I think about the second quarter, that Cars 2 was a much bigger part of the sell-in during last year's second quarter and so it's going to be -- have an even larger impact in a negative direction during this year's second quarter compared first Q? And then, conversely, is it also safe to assume that ship-in is going to more approximate sell-through in the second quarter that ultimately those inventory reductions are a thing of the past?","Bryan G. Stockton","Yes, I think that's right. I think when we looked at Cars last year, the big shipping quarter was the second quarter for Cars relative to the second quarter of 2010. And as we've said before, when we looked at our shipping volume for Cars last year, it was about 50\/50 first half, second half where normally it followed Mattel's shipping patterns, which is about 1\/3 sales in the first half, 2\/3 in the second half. So that's correct. And I think your comment with regard to -- look, it's hard to tell with regard to retailers. Are they going to continue to manage down inventories? But at some point in time, when you got products selling and you got momentum with regard to consumer takeaways, retailers are going to have to buy, and at some point, they're going to buy what's selling. And it should come in sync with shipments should equal sell-through.","James Hardiman - Longbow Research LLC","Very helpful. And then just briefly on the O.E. 2.0 savings, how should we think about the cadence as we work our way through the year? It looks like basically 2\/3 of the legal expenses have already -- you've already seen those savings. Those are sort of the easy ones to model. How should I think about the cadence over the rest of the year? What are the major line items of things you're going to be getting savings from? And what are the time frames around those events?","Kevin M. Farr","Yes, I think you've got it right on legal. With respect to legal fees, to date, we've realized $65 million of our cumulative savings, total of $75 million. And again, we were still at trial in the second quarter of last year. So we should expect that some in the second quarter and the balance in the rest of the year. With regard to the structural initiatives, the remaining savings should occur over a quarterly basis, pretty much similar to what we experienced in the first quarter.","James Hardiman - Longbow Research LLC","Great. And then just one last housekeeping question here. On the HIT acquisition, I mean, you\u2019ve basically given us, I think, most of the parts. If we were to assume that the operating profit contribution is offset by all the integration expenses and the interest expenses, you've given us sort of the integration expenses, that $30 million to $36 million. What's the delta -- the incremental interest expense that you're expecting to pay as a result of HIT this year?","Kevin M. Farr","Yes, let me just go through it so we make sure that we've got all the pieces. So as we said, we don't expect to have a material impact in our results in 2012, which should be accretive starting 2013. In 2012, we expected operating profits from the HIT business to be offset by acquisition and integration costs of $25 million to $30 million, purchase accounting adjustments including amortization of intangibles is about $5 million to $6 million and financing costs of about $25 million. And we expect it to be increasingly accretive in 2013 and beyond due to elimination of acquisition costs and substantially lower integration costs, the addition of the Thomas wood business in '13, cost synergies and the retention of the Thomas die cast and plastic business from 2015 onward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Carroll of UBS.","Robert W. Carroll - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just following up a little more granular on HIT during the quarter. Would you be able to break out what the gross margin would have been excluding HIT?","Kevin M. Farr","Well, I'm not going to give you that level of detail. But when you look at what drove the improvement in the first quarter gross margin of 130 basis points, it really was the -- primarily due to the price increases, foreign exchange and cost savings from O.E. 2.0 program, partially offset by higher product costs and freight and distribution expenses. As we said, HIT also had a positive impact on gross margins for the quarter. And note that the positive impact to HIT will be smaller as the year progresses due to the relative size of HIT's business to Mattel's overall business. So most of the improvement or the majority of the improvement came from price increases and O.E. 2.0 savings and ForEx to offset input costs.","Robert W. Carroll - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So if you look at Slide 8, those -- as those are tiered, that's in terms of relative contribution?","Kevin M. Farr","No.","Robert W. Carroll - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then, I guess, has the change or I guess the delta in POS versus shipments, I mean has that caused you guys to change any sort of internal production schedules for the remainder of the year? Or I mean, is it just a function of you guys kind of building out the inventory more to support what you think the demand is still going to be throughout the year?","Bryan G. Stockton","Rob, it's Bryan. No, it really hasn't. As you, I'm sure, noted, our inventories -- our own inventories were down for the quarter. And we worked very hard in the fourth quarter last year and the first quarter this year to try to balance out the entire supply chain starting with our own inventory and working with our customers to see what was needed at the store level. So it hasn't impacted anything that we're doing. We're continuing to try to support the momentum that we have, particularly in fashion dolls. We have, I think, a lot of strong plans for Barbie and Monster High this year. So we're going to be really focusing in on trying to make sure we have the right levels of inventory in the right areas, so that we can have strong execution in that all-important holiday season.","Kevin M. Farr","Yes, and I'd just add to that I think as we enter 2012, the same as we've thought about in 2009, 2010 and 2011, our expectations are that retailers will continue to tightly manage inventories. That occurred in the first quarter. It was a little bit more challenging than expected with regard to that. But I think with respect to the full year, again our expectation is they're going to manage inventories. And they want to grow their business, and we want to grow our business, and they're going to buy what's going to sell through, and we're producing to reflect that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim Chartier of Monness, Crespi and Hardt.","James Andrew Chartier - Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co., Inc., Research Division","Two questions. The first, can you talk about the POS for Fisher-Price during the quarter? And then second, you mentioned great progress in China and India. Could you give us a sense of how big those markets are and what great progress entails in terms of what you're doing specifically in those markets?","Bryan G. Stockton","Jim, let me first start with Fisher-Price. We've always said that Fisher-Price is a work in progress and that last year, 2011, was a transition year. We said that this year would continue to be a transition year for Fisher-Price. And the reason for that is we spent a lot of time last year working on retail execution and trying to find the right positioning for the brand. And that's why -- how we came up with the new campaign, the Joy of Learning, which we launched on television back in October. So we carried that over into this year. Our focus this year on Fisher-Price is to do many of the same things, which is number one, focus on retail execution. We think the North America division will really have a stronger focus than we had last year on that. And then secondly, we're trying to deepen the relationship we have with these new moms by taking that campaign and extending it digitally with a global Fisher-Price website that will be coming out in the next few months and working on delivering the message at store level as well. So when you look at Fisher-Price's POS globally, it continues to grow and be strong in international, particularly in markets like Latin America and Asia. Here in the U.S., frankly, it was a little softer than we would have liked to have seen. But we think of this as a brand that responds differently than a typical kid's brand. This is more of a mom's brand. And it doesn't respond one flight of advertising, and all of a sudden, the trend is fixed. This is a work in progress. We've got a lot of work ahead of us, but we remain encouraged by what we're seeing. As it relates to what we're doing in terms of China and India, one of the things we always talked about in international is gaining scale. And in China, we've had scale for some time. At the beginning of last year, we were completing the transition of going from our managed distributor model to a wholly owned subsidiary model in China, which enabled us to hire more people to call on customers locally, enable us to have a much tighter bond with the consumer in China and work even more closely with key customers like Wal-Mart and Carrefour, for example, in China. So we have scale. Our businesses continue to grow there. It's been a pretty steady growth for us. We like that. We always talk about building the business in China on a brick-by-brick basis. We think a steady approach will work well over time. That's the same approach that we took in Brazil that seems to have worked out quite well for us. India is also an interesting market for us. In terms of development, it's a few years behind China. But we believe we now have scale in India as we're able to promote our products almost all year long. The Barbie brand has been very successful there. I think we shared one of the things that we've done there, which is partnering up with a very famous Bollywood actress, Katrina Kaif, there. We produced a doll in her likeness. She did the commercial for us. So that's what we're doing in India to keep scale and to grow the business and to really try and align our brands with local culture. So we're pleased with our progress in both countries.","Operator","Our next question comes from Drew Crum with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Andrew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So Bryan, I have a couple of questions on the fashion dolls business. I wonder if you could first comment on any thoughts you have in some of the changes and the competitive dynamics in that category and how that may or may not have impacted your business during the period. Also, could you discuss the contrast and performance for Other Girls when you look at North America versus international? And then finally, in your preamble, you talked about Disney Princess adding a couple of new markets there. When did that happen? And just remind us again what initiatives Disney Princess has in 2012?","Bryan G. Stockton","Okay, that's a great question. It will probably take us half an hour to answer. There's a lot of good stuff going on there. So let me start first with fashion dolls. The fashion doll category has been a very positive category for the toy industry in general. It's been growing, and we believe the fashion doll category has been growing because of a lot of great initiatives in there. We think we have a number of those great initiatives, beginning with Barbie, and Barbie had a very successful last year, as you know, from our results. We're expecting a lot of positive things to happen with Barbie this year. I think we showed you the fashion photo doll, which we expect is going to be very big. As I hope you will all be registered for the Barbie party and vote for Barbie for president. She's announced her candidacy there. But she's also -- we have 2 great movies this year for her DVDs. Barbie in A Mermaid Tale 2 is doing very well, better than last year's DVD and sales. And this year, we have her first musical in 7 years called the Princess & The Popstar. So when we think about Barbie, I think there's a lot of good programming out there to continue that momentum. Monster High continues to do extremely well in every country in which we compete. I think we've told you about the insight that we had there about girls being anxious about some of their \"flaws\" to use their term, and we tapped into that and continue to. That brand is all about being relevant and having storytelling and having characters that girls can relate to. So as we think about Monster High this year, we're going to have actually about 4 hours of television programming on, which is, I think, about 3x more than we had last year. And obviously, we'll continue with the whole webisodes, which is what we launched this brand with. And on Disney Princess, this is an interesting year for us because we are comping Tangled last year, which as you'll recall, launched in the U.S. in November. The DVD dropped in the first half. And the movie was actually launched internationally in 2011. So we're comping that. We're very pleased with Brave. Brave is going to be, we think, a very interesting movie. We've got, we think, a strong but focused line on Brave. We're having the Cinderella 50th anniversary edition DVD coming out. We're supporting that. So we're excited about all of that activity. As you know, the fashion doll business attracts a lot of competition, and we're used to that. We've had that for a number of years, so we're always focusing on what our brands need to do to stay at the forefront of girls' minds. There are a couple of new initiatives that are out there. I would say it's too early to determine any kind of impact on our business. But we feel very confident in our programming for this year and are anxious to execute what we've got. As it relates to Disney, it's really a market-by-market kind of situation as this contract now unfolds. I think the most important thing about the expanding the relationship is we've always had the mantra to partner with the best and to be the best partner. And every time we get the ability to extend our partnership with brands into new countries, we think it's a reflection of the commitment we've made to Disney and our other partners to try to help build their brands globally. So we're very excited about that.","Kevin M. Farr","And just to add to Monster High, I think we've stated before the brand is bigger outside the U.S. than inside the U.S. But we are seeing good momentum around the world, including the U.S.","Andrew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Got it. Okay. And one last one for me, just a quick one. $400 million of debt that's -- which is current on the balance sheet. Can you remind us, Kevin, when the timing of that payment or payments flows? And are there plans to repay or refi that debt?","Kevin M. Farr","Well, I think with regard to -- if you look at our current balance sheet with regard to having a strong balance sheet of $800 million to $1 billion and a debt total -- debt-to-total capital of 35% is our target. We're currently at 37%. So our balance sheet's in good shape. About $400 million is due in 2013, and our expectation would be to continue to refinance that as our debt-to-total capital right now is around where we'd expect it to be next year after refinancing it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Linda Bolton-Weiser of Caris.","Linda Bolton-Weiser - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of longer-term kind of strategic questions. The addition of HIT Entertainment has added to your gross margin. So the idea that you want to maintain a gross margin of at least 50% over time, I mean, do you think you should adjust that a little bit because you're getting kind of a boost just from including HIT? And then secondly, with regard to American Girl and just the transitions there, do you have any thoughts about long term how many retail stores you could have in the U.S. for that? I mean, are you thinking 20, 30, 50, 100 like just in a very long-term sense? And then finally, are you still on track for plans to launch a new brand platform in 2013?","Bryan G. Stockton","Linda, let me start first with gross margins, and I'm sure my partner, Kevin, will chime in on this one as well. We always talk about trying to achieve our long-term goal of about 50%. We're still comfortable with that. We're in an environment of costs, whether it's commodity costs, labor costs, transportation costs. They're still pretty volatile, and so we're going to stick with our long-term target of 50%. Obviously, we're going to work very hard to deliver play value against that. We're very comfortable with that. Regarding American Girl, we're excited about the continued prospects for American Girl. We're not going to announce how many stores we're going to have long term. I would tell you that we have taken a very measured and disciplined approach on expanding the American Girl retail storefront. The reason why is we recognize that we have a very precious jewel here. And we need to be very mindful of making sure that we don't over store the environment with American Girl. So we look at that on a continuing basis, and we're looking forward to the 3 stores opening this year. But we'll continue to be very mindful and disciplined in terms of how we think about that. And in terms of a longer term launch in terms of another franchise, we're continuing to work on that. We're not quite ready to announce what it is and when it's going to be. But we're using Monster High as inspiration here internally to think about how we apply that recipe of insight, storytelling and product line to other parts of our business. And we're looking forward to sharing that when we're ready. Kevin, any more comments on the margin?","Kevin M. Farr","No. I think, Linda, we do target gross margins of at least 50% for the full year of 2012, and we did benefit from the inclusion of HIT in our gross margins in the first quarter of 2012. But as I said, that positive impact will be smaller as the year progresses due to the relevant side of the HIT business to Mattel's overall business. If we look forward, we do have opportunities to grow the HIT business and our overall licensing business for Mattel brands, including Barbie, Hot Wheels and Fisher-Price, which should have a positive impact in gross margins looking forward. But we\u2019ll also have a great opportunity to grow our Fisher-Price toy business on a global basis since it's underdeveloped outside the U.S. And the Fisher-Price brand has good margins for its category, but they're lower than our average of around 50%. So as we look forward, our focus is to continue to target and deliver gross margins of about 50%. There will be things that will help us. There'll be things that work against us as we grow. But overall, we're comfortable with the 50% target, which we delivered for the last 3 consecutive years.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Michael Kelter of Goldman Sachs.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask about the industry at large. You guys are clearly gaining share, and most of your brands are doing pretty well, but it's within the context of what appears to be somewhat of a shrinking pie. And I wanted to understand, yes, the macro is choppy, but most of their discretionary categories seem to be doing relatively well, yet toys are down low to mid-singles. And when you take out, for example, LEGO, I mean, the toy industry is running down 5% to 10% right now in the U.S. Is there something maybe more secular to it? Or if not, why do you think it's down so much? And what's going to it turn around?","Bryan G. Stockton","Michael, it's a great question, and we\u2019ve thought about this because obviously we are -- we like a robust toy category. It helps all of us in the industry. At this point, we don't see anything from a macro basis that would lead us to believe that there's some secular change in the toy industry. It's been growing, particularly outside of the U.S., despite a lot of the economic challenges. Inside the U.S., it's always been a little bit slower growing than it has been even relative to places like Western Europe. But we haven't seen anything in terms of consumer spending or retailer commitment that would lead us to believe that there is some major change. Having said that, if we look at our own information and think about what happened in the industry of 2011 as we carried over quite a bit of product, and by we, I mean the industry. As we look at our business, there's less activity in what we would call closeouts this year than last year. I don't know if Mattel was representative of the industry. But our inventory situation, we believe, is not quite in the same place as others. We believe it's more favorable. But we suspect that there's probably less promotional activity in the area of closeouts this year than last year, and that would potentially impact the industry. Certainly, I mentioned earlier in the call the timing of Easter. Even though Easter was earlier this year than last year, we really need to take a look at NPD data and understand the timing of consumer spending for Easter. Again, recall this year, for the holidays, the spending for toys came later than many of us thought, and again, we need to see what NPD tells us. But again, top line is we don't see anything from a macro standpoint that would lead us to believe there's an issue with the toy industry in the U.S.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And in Europe where you guys held up really well, is that -- is there a possibility that, that was just a follow-through from a really strong Christmas, and now looking forward, Europe's going to be as choppy as maybe the headlines suggest it should be? Or do you think you guys will be able to grow through kind of choppiness over there?","Bryan G. Stockton","Michael, we've worked very hard in every country around the world to try to grow our businesses. Europe has been probably one of the more challenging areas, not just from a consumer standpoint, but from the level of caution that retailers take towards the business. And again, that's why we focus so much of our time and energy on building brands. If we can build the brands, as we've proven, people will want to buy Barbies even under difficult economic conditions. People will want to buy Fisher-Price because it represents quality and good value and what moms are looking for in toys for their babies and infants. So we view our job as we've got to create a value to weather those stormy times.","Drew Vollero","Thank you. There will be a replay of the call available beginning at 11:30 a.m. Eastern time today.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, David Zbojniewicz, \u200eVice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Zbojniewicz, you may begin.","David Zbojniewicz","Thank you, Latif. And good afternoon, everyone. Joining me today are Margo Georgiadis, Mattel\u2019s Chief Executive Officer; Richard Dickson, Mattel\u2019s President and Chief Operating Officer; Kevin Farr, Mattel\u2019s Chief Financial Officer.","As you know, this afternoon we reported Mattel\u2019s 2017 first quarter financial results. We will begin today\u2019s call with Margo, Richard and Kevin providing commentary on our results and then we will take your questions.","To help guide our discussion, we have provided you with a slide presentation. Our discussion and our slide presentation will reference non-GAAP financial measures, such as gross sales, adjusted gross margin and adjusted gross profit, adjusted selling and administrative expenses, adjusted operating income\/loss, adjusted earnings\/loss per share and constant currency.","Our earnings release also includes non-GAAP financial measures. The information required by Regulation G regarding non-GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release and slide presentation.

","These statements are based on currently available information and they are subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ from those projected in the forward-looking statements. ","We describe some of these uncertainties in the risk factors section of our 2016 annual operating report on Form 10-K, our 2016 quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and other filings we make from the SEC from time to time as well as in our other public statements.","Mattel does not update forward-looking statements and expressly disclaims any obligation to do so. ","Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Margo.","Margaret Georgiadis","Thank you, Dave. And welcome, everyone, to our call. We plan to cover a lot today, but let me start by saying that I\u2019m truly honored to lead this iconic company. This is a company with a deep purpose to inspire the wonder of childhood as the global leader in learning and development through play. ","We have an opportunity to shape the next generation children that are more creative, collaborative, confident, resilient, and open to all life\u2019s possibilities.","I have spent my first 60 days deeply understanding what's working well and where we must improve to deliver stronger performance and capitalize on our many opportunities. We\u2019ve been undertaking a wide-ranging review of our business and are leaving no stone unturned as we look at actions to drive revenue, improve profitability, and create long-term value for our shareholders.","This work is still ongoing and I will report back to all of you with more details on our strategies and plans at an investor event we will host in New York in mid-June.","In the meantime, I'll give you my thoughts on the first quarter, the remainder of 2017, and some of my early observations about the opportunities for Mattel that will drive future growth.","So, let\u2019s start with the first quarter. Our first quarter results came in below our expectations. Gross sales in the first quarter were down 15% and gross margin came in at 37.9%. We view these results as unacceptable relative to what Mattel is capable of.","Going into Q1, which is a seasonally light quarter, we expected lower revenue and gross margin because of the retail inventory overhang coming out of the holiday period, a lighter entertainment slate, declines in our doll portfolio, a few foreign exchange adjustments, as well as some other factors.","What we did not expect was a prolonged impact from the retail inventory overhang and the resulting slower pace of retail reorders.","These lower-than-expected sales had a material impact on our ability to efficiently absorb our supply chain fixed costs. I should note that the retail inventory overhang was essentially isolated to North America and a few markets in Europe, while Latin America and Asia-Pacific continued strong growth.","In addition, we decided to proactively take action on a few ancillary brands to clean up our own inventory, and as a result incurred a higher obsolescence expense. Clearly, we are disappointed with our first quarter results and recognize we have a lot of work to do to improve execution across our portfolio.","At the same time, we remain very encouraged by our progress revitalizing our core brands, which continue to win in a very competitive marketplace.","POS, which we track at wholesale, shows Barbie, Hot Wheels, and Fisher-Price all continuing their positive trends in the first quarter. And as I mentioned earlier, emerging markets continue to demonstrate strong growth and long-term potential, particularly Asia-Pacific and Latin America.","We are confident we have worked through most of our inventory issues and we should begin to see the benefits of scale and our cost savings programs as we move forward.","I also want to be fully transparent about a few areas for improvement. For example, we have not fully regained the loss of momentum in American Girl and have a lot of work to do to capture the full potential of this incredible brand. ","And Monster High, which was in recent years a large and highly profitable business, continues to be a drag on our results.","As the company's new CEO, it is my responsibility to ensure we are clear about what's working and what's not working and ensure we effectively manage through these issues and set an aggressive, but realistic path forward.","In light of our Q1 results, we are updating our expectations for the full year. We now expect full year revenue growth to be in the mid-single-digit range and adjusted operating margins to be flat as compared to prior year.","We will have a better picture of how the year will shape up, based on the initial response to Cars 3. We are very excited to reintroduce this iconic Disney franchise to a whole new generation of consumers.","The film\u2019s staggered worldwide release schedule begins late this quarter, which should give us the ability to see how customer takeaway is tracking and adjust to retail expectations going into the holidays.","We are continuing to invest in our business to deliver on our growth initiatives and we remain focused on optimizing resources to provide the financial flexibility to support growth investment and fund our capital deployment initiatives, including the dividend. ","Kevin will expand on this guidance and capital deployment later during the call. Over the last two months, my team and I have focused on building a roadmap to accelerate our progress against our five strategic priorities, which we believe will meaningfully grow the business.","We will have much more time to share during our investor meeting in New York, but let me take a moment to quickly frame up some of my thoughts on each priority now.","First, our core brands have a large opportunity to unlock growth by transitioning to multidimensional systems of play that integrate physical and digital worlds. Our global scale and accessible price points offer us a unique position to deliver these connected systems.","The value propositions for each system will center on big ideas that millennial parents and kids care deeply about and leverage compelling content and experiences to create ongoing conversations and deep relationships.","These next generation power brands will extend toy purchases and unlock adjacent revenue streams in areas such as content, gaming, licensing, and experiences.","A great example of this systems approach is Hot Wheels. Hot Wheels were designed to ignite and nurture the creator and challenger spirit that lies within every kid to help them reach their true potential. There are endless possibilities with connected track and construction systems, technology-enabled cars, gamification and communities of passionate fans.","We already have great response to new products, such as Hot Wheels AI and our Hot Wheels Games. The future is about integrating digital across our product lines and unlocking more expansive levels of play and community experiences, both for individuals and even teams.","Fully developing the potential of these next generation power brands requires embedding a new set of capabilities across our business. We\u2019re hiring new talent, upgrading our technology infrastructure, and forming new partnerships to accelerate our progress.","Turning to our second strategic priority, we are strengthening how our toy box can significantly increase our innovation pipeline. We are proud of the progress we have made with our licensed entertainment partnerships.","At the same time, we want to create more differentiated partnerships, based on deep consumer and category insights, tech-enabled designs, best-in-class manufacturing, and strong global distribution. We also see a big opportunity to develop a more robust content co-creation model.","In addition, we are building a growing pipeline of tech-enabled products that capitalize on new play patterns, allow us to extend beyond traditional toy age ranges and serve as the inspiration for more creative uses of technology throughout all of our brands.","Third, given the enormous untapped potential, we want to increase our momentum in emerging markets with tailored product lines and strategic partnerships. Our recently announced partnerships in China with Babytree, the largest online site in the world for new moms, and Alibaba will allow us to accelerate our strong growth in China.","Working with these leading partners, Mattel can more quickly become the thought leader in learning and development through play and reshape the engagement model for parents and kids in the most mobile and digital first region of the world.","We plan to leverage this model to expand more quickly and efficiently across other top Asian markets, such as India and Indonesia.","Fourth, our commercial team is always been a strength to Mattel, with our early move to a global model and heritage of deep local market insight and entrepreneurialism. At the same time, we can strengthen the performance of our top brands across markets, by driving tighter standards for category development and retail execution, particularly omni-channel and e-commerce.","As part of this, we need to continue to upgrade our capabilities in areas such as digital engagement and commerce, merchandising differentiation, demand forecasting and inventory management. Each of these is critical to staying in step with the shifting consumer preferences and our retail partner needs.","And finally, we remain committed to continuous cost improvement across our business. In addition to our existing $240 million program, we already see incremental opportunities to operate more efficiently. We're looking at new ways to capture value in areas such as SKU rationalization, more expansive automation, and optimizing our manufacturing to enable our strategy, both owned and outsourced.","Let me end by saying our first quarter results are disappointing and not a reflection of the significant potential we see ahead. As we continue to carefully evaluate the business and update our strategic plans, we recognize we have a lot of work to do to successfully position Mattel for the future, but we see a clear path to driving sustained top line growth and regaining operating margins of 15% plus over time.","Throughout my career, I have set and delivered on aggressive, yet achievable expectations in fast paced and competitive environment. I am confident I can do that here again at Mattel.","I am excited to work with the talented team across Mattel to win in the marketplace and deliver on our mission and long-term objectives, and I'm particularly excited about the partnership with Richard. And I want to thank him for his support during my on-boarding process.","I look forward to meeting you, our investors, and providing updates on our progress at our investor events in June.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Richard.","Richard Dickson","Thank you, Margo. Clearly, the first quarter results were disappointing. And given the impact on the results, I thought it would be important to provide more color on retail inventory. ","When you look at our sales by region, you can clearly see that the retail inventory overhang was essentially isolated to North America and Europe. Asia-Pacific and Latin America saw minimal impact, with Asia-Pacific sales up significantly.","And now that most of the inventory issue is behind us, we should begin to see sales reflect the real underlying momentum of the business, as we pivot to the second quarter and build towards a strong second half.","The impact of the inventory overhang was also felt across several of our key core brands, even those that continue to have strong consumer takeaway. Barbie unfortunately is the best example of how this played out in the quarter.","Despite solid Q1 POS in both regions, Barbie sales were down significantly in North America, while actually up mid-single digits internationally. And as you look back on the prior year for additional context, we had Barbie POS building throughout 2016 with retailers increasing shelf space and promotional support. Retail confidence and retail inventory going into the holiday season was justifiably high.","And while POS remained strong in the holiday, the significant category slowdown in December, combined with the seasonally light first quarter, simply meant there was no need for retailers to reorder and take additional inventory. For the most part, this situation was also duplicated with Fisher-Price and Hot Wheels. ","Now, to be fair, not all of our brands were impacted to the same extent or for the same reason. Mega retail inventory is high and impacted reorders, mainly due to some bets on licensed properties which didn't meet performance expectations.","And while expected, American Girl sales slowed due to some comps and the phased launch of our new contemporary characters line.","We clearly have work to do and remain focused on getting it right. And as we look ahead, let me take a few moments and share some tangible progress that demonstrates why we believe we\u2019re on the right track.","As you know, we had good business momentum in our key core brands coming into 2017. And our internal analysis, which is tracked at wholesale, shows this trend continuing in the first quarter.","Key core brand POS remained positive, with Barbie, Hot Wheels and Fisher-Price all achieving solid mid-single digit growth.","So, let me share with you a few specific examples of what consumers will see this year with these brands. Let's start with Barbie. There are three areas that we\u2019re focusing on in 2017 that make me feel confident with this brand.","The first example is the buildout of our basic fashion doll lines with greater choice of ethnicity, size and scale. Barbie\u2019s fashionista segment continues to exceed expectations both with consumers and garner industry recognition, winning Toy of the Year in the Doll of the Year category, an award Barbie ironically has never won until now.","The second example is the way we\u2019re leaning into content with the brand. Barbie is moving beyond the standard DVD business model and into specific episodic content for younger and older age Barbie girls, episodic content that will be available across the entire spectrum of digital distribution, allowing girls to engage with the brand whenever and wherever and however they want.","And the third demonstration of Barbie\u2019s resilience and category expansion has been our efforts in recapturing the hearts of younger girls. We\u2019re continuing our successful rollout of Dreamtopia, with the specific purpose of expanding Barbie\u2019s open ended play pattern into the fantasy realm and attracting the younger girl.","This line has done well and will be supported this year by new content and distributed in a new way, premiering on YouTube Kids with amazing placement and support from YouTube.","With Fisher-Price, we have seen steady growth and are continuing our work in reestablishing the brand\u2019s roots as the premier child development company. As consumers engage with this brand, they'll see a more simplified message, products that offer real solutions to today's parents, packaging changes that call out the developmental benefits more clearly and increased digital consumer experiences.","Our baby gear, infant and preschool lines will get a boost from a new innovative product lineup and new marketing campaigns focused on sleep solutions, child development and active play.","One area I'm particularly excited about is how we continue to effectively leverage technology at Fisher-Price. In 2017, you will see the third generation of the hit line BeatBo, a second year of the successful [indiscernible] and this year's innovative product Moby [ph].","The progress we're making here is real and we believe there is significant opportunity for this brand globally. With our strategic partnerships with Alibaba and Babytree in China coming online, we are setting the foundation for accelerated growth in the Asia-Pacific market over the next few years, a business model we will look to repeat in other markets around the world.","Now, let me briefly touch base on Hot Wheels. At the beginning of 2015, we told you this brand was the sleeper in our portfolio and you could already see we have begun to wake this brand up with annual sales outpacing the industry and growing at an average rate of 8% annually for the past two years.","We made some strategic investments in the product, content and digital, focusing on the basics \u2013 cars, tracks and playsets. And today, all our tracks and our playsets are able to connect to each other.","This year, we are building on this with tracks and vehicles that combine construction play with vehicle action, expanding the depth of fun kids can have with Hot Wheels. All of this allows a child to build out his own world with multiple purchases over time. And we continue to infuse technology into product lines by expanding our very successful remote control and AI platforms with new and innovative product offerings. ","So, it\u2019s fair to say we have been making some tangible progress with our key core brands. Now, American Girl and Thomas are work-in-progress, but you\u2019re beginning to see a new brand architecture and content executions coming to life.","Moving on, while our licensed entertainment portfolio endured some tough first quarter comps, we anticipate real progress in the second quarter and throughout the year. We are the lead toy licensee on four big box office theatricals \u2013 Cars 3, Justice League, Fast and Furious and Wonder Woman. All four target a different audience and toy consumer, giving us the opportunity to expand on multiple toy aisles.","And more importantly, from a strategic point of view, these theatrical events are coming out from different, highly successful entertainment companies \u2013 Universal, Warner Bros., and Disney \u2013 demonstrating a significant improvement in the depth and breadth of our licensed entertainment partnerships.","These partnerships, as well as our key relationships with Nickelodeon and WWE, move well beyond 2017, presenting additional opportunities to grow in the future.","Let me end my remarks by saying we believe there is significant untapped potential in our core brands and our licensed entertainment partnerships. And while we continue to make real progress, focusing on the basics of investing in the future, Margo and I recognize we must step it up and become relentless around innovation, content, digital and consumer insights.","I'm truly energized to have Margo join our team. Already in the short time she has been with the company, she has made immediate impact on our strategic thinking, our operational execution and our culture.","Since we\u2019ve had the benefit of working together previously, we are moving quickly to take action to accelerate growth, improve profitability and create long-term shareholder value. And we\u2019re looking forward to sharing more on this at our upcoming investor day in June.","And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin.","Kevin Farr ","Thank you, Richard. And good afternoon, everyone. My plan for today is to provide a little more insight into the first quarter, but focus mainly on its impact on our full year expectations.","But before I go any further, I want to remind everyone that unless otherwise noted, I\u2019ll be referring to gross sales in constant currency in order to provide better visibility into the underlying topline trends.","And in order to provide more transparency in the fundamentals of the business, I\u2019ll also reference some adjusted financial results that exclude non-recurring executive compensation and severance related to our business transformation.","As always, reconciliation to GAAP numbers are provided in our press release and the slide deck.","So, let\u2019s walk through the P&L beginning with the top line. Gross sales were down 15% as reported and in constant currency. Going into the quarter, we knew we would be challenged by tough license entertainment comps, continued softness in some of our girls properties, lower licensing income, Easter timing and our retail inventory overhang coming out of the holiday season.","What we didn\u2019t expect was the prolonged impact from the retail inventory overhang and the resulting slower pace of reorders by retailers. With sales in North America and Europe particularly impacted, however, we were encouraged by strong performance in Asia-Pacific and continued momentum in Latin America.","Moving on to other P&L drivers, our reported gross margin for the first quarter came in significantly lower than expected at 37.9%. During the quarter, gross margin was primarily impacted by an additional obsolescence related to the discontinuation of certain product lines from some of our ancillary brands.","Reduced absorption of supply chain fixed costs due to lower sales, an unfavorable currency impact and lower licensing income. These headwinds were partially offset by pricing and our cost savings initiatives.","A number of these factors should not carryforward in the remainder of the year, but will impact full year gross margins.","As planned, advertising was flat as a percentage of net sales in the first quarter. And we remain disciplined with SG&A as we\u2019ve continued to aggressively reduce costs, while balancing strategic investments. Adjusted SG&A was down approximately $13.1 million or 4% year-over-year for the quarter. The majority of the year-over-year SG&A savings came from our successful efforts to tightly manage our overhead spending.","Our tax rate for the first quarter was 22.3%, including discrete items.","Finally, adjusted EPS for the first quarter was a loss of $0.32 compared to the prior year loss of $0.14.","Now, turning to our balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the quarter with $382 million in cash, $218 million lower than the first quarter of 2016, due to a higher working capital usage and, as expected, our own inventory was up year-over-year partially due to lower Q1 sales and to support our new licensed entertainment launches throughout the year. And the continued positive core key brand POS trends we\u2019re seeing on a global basis tracked internally at wholesale.","Overall, we're comfortable with our inventory, both owned and at retail, as we enter the second quarter with a later Easter and a June launch of Cars 3.","Receivables were also up, primarily due to country and customer mix as well as later sales in the quarter.","And we continue to deploy capital in a discipline manner to both manage the business and reward shareholders. As expected, capital expenditures were up as we continue to make investments to grow the business.","After reinvesting in the business, dividends remain our first priority. Our Board recently declared the second quarter dividend of $0.38 per share, which is flat compared with the second quarter of 2016. ","Now, moving to our full year 2017 outlook, the first quarter results have set us back. And as a result, we now expect to be below the full year financial outlook that we provided in February.","We now expect growth to be in the mid-single digits with adjusted operating margin as a percentage of net sales to be flat to full year 2016 due to higher revenues, which are expected to be offset by higher SG&A and slightly lower gross margins.","We still expect strong revenue growth to come from incremental licensed entertainment portfolio, including Disney's Cars 3, our key core brands, our strategic investments in emerging markets \u2013 particularly China and Russia \u2013 partially offset by continued declines in Monster High and Ever After High.","Looking at our other P&L levers, year-over-year we expect to see sales adjustments roughly flat to last year, a year-over-year decline in gross margins due to the obsolescence expense in the first quarter, continued mix challenges and higher royalty expense due to our upcoming entertainment display. These will partially be offset by strategic pricing and the successful execution of our cost savings initiatives. We expect to achieve our $120 million gross cost savings target for the year.","As for advertising, we continue to expect to be on the low end of our historical range of 11% to 13% for the full year. We\u2019re also continuing to tightly manage adjusted SG&A, while balancing our investments in emerging markets and technology.","We will continue to focus on our cost savings initiatives, which will be more than offset by higher incentive accruals versus 2016 if we achieve our targeted performance metrics for 2017.","Incentive compensation is an important tool for employee retention, which is essential to deliver on the turnaround and position the company well for the medium to long term.","As for tax rate assumptions, we still expect a full year tax rate, including discrete items to be 21% for 2017, assuming no changes to existing law. Also, we\u2019ve adopted a new accounting standard last year related to stock-based compensation, which may impact the tax rate going forward.","In terms of cash flow in 2017, we still expect significant cash flow generation, topline growth, sustained operating margin and improved inventory management.","Our capital deployment framework still targets $800 million of cash at year-end. And while we expect to come in slightly below that target, we still believe we\u2019ll have sufficient flexibility to continue investing in the business and supporting the dividend, which remains a priority going forward.","Mattel\u2019s Board of Directors will continue to evaluate the dividend on a quarterly basis, while taking into consideration the development of Margo\u2019s strategic roadmap to support and accelerate the company\u2019s strategic priorities and path to growth.","The roadmap will also include capital allocation priorities, to invest in the business to drive future growth and capital deployment including the dividend.","We\u2019ll know a lot more on how we are set up for the full year after the second quarter. We\u2019ll have better reads on POS for entertainment properties, including launch of Cars 3, our key core brands, as well as our challenged brands like Monster High.","As we think about Q2, we expect high-single digit revenue growth, with one third of the incremental volume expected Cars 3 to support the launch of the theatrical release in June, a sequential improvement in gross margins due to scale versus the first quarter of 2017, but below the gross margin rate in the second quarter of 2016, and adjusted operating income is expected to be slightly better than the second quarter of 2016 due to higher revenues being offset by lower gross margin.","Looking beyond 2017, we remain committed to growing the business, expanding margins and rewarding our shareholders.","I look forward to continuing these discussions at our upcoming investor day in June. ","With that, we\u2019ll now open the call for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jaime Katz of Morningstar. Your line is open.","Jaime Katz","Hi. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking my calls. Or good afternoon. First, can you tell us sort of if you feel you\u2019re largely complete with the \u2013 get working through the inventory overhang or is there some more that we should think about going through the second quarter and potentially even hanging into the third quarter?","Margaret Georgiadis","Thank you, Jaime, for the question. We do believe that we worked through it. And, Kevin, would you like to share anything else?","Kevin Farr","Sure. I think \u2013 let me just take you through it. I think we originally expected the impact to be 1% or 2% of full year sales. And it turned out to be the impact was closer to 2%. The retail inventory overhang was highly concentrated in North America, as we've already stated.","Now, if you look at year-to-date through Easter, POS for key core brands were up mid-single digits, and the retail inventory in North America is down by 3% year-over-year, which is pretty normal for this time.","So, while there\u2019s still a few isolated pockets of inventory, the overhang is largely behind us.","Jaime Katz","And then, can you talk about your longer-term goals? I know you are still holding to the 15% to 20% for operating margins, but does this move the ability to capture that even farther out than maybe we originally anticipated?","Margaret Georgiadis","We have a lot of work to do to successfully position Mattel for the future, but we do see a clear path to driving sustained top line growth and the operating margins of 15% plus over time. The exact timing will depend on a number of factors that will be addressed by the ongoing strategic review, and we will provide a roadmap of action sets to get there at our investor day in June.","Jaime Katz","Thank you. I\u2019ll jump back into the queue.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Handler of MKM Partners. Your line is open.","Eric Handler","Yes. Thank you for the question. Actually, two things. First, Kevin, just a housecleaning thing. When you talk about operating margin being flat year-over-year, is that versus the 10.3% operating margin last year or I think that 10.3% was negatively impacted by an item, so it was really 11-point-something?","And then secondly, for Margo, I guess as you look at this business and the opportunities that you have with technology and some of the creative initiatives that you have, why do you feel it\u2019s so important right now or at least why does the board think it's so important right now to maintain the dividend? It doesn't seem like investors are really rewarding you to have a 6% dividend yield. It's way above what the S&P dividend yield is. ","Wouldn\u2019t it be better to preserve cash and maybe increase the investments into some of your new initiatives and try to revive revenue growth by adding to the investment line?","Kevin Farr","Okay. I\u2019ll start with the first question, Eric. It\u2019s 10.3%. That is correct. That\u2019s the right thing to compare it to.","Margaret Georgiadis","And, Eric, on your question about the dividend versus investing, we are deeply in the middle of the evaluation of our business and I don't want to presuppose any outcomes at this point. The company has had a long-standing capital allocation framework and the board continues to evaluate it every quarter as usual. Ultimately, this is a board level decision and we will follow up when appropriate.","Eric Handler","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next call comes from the line of Arpin\u00e9 Kocharyan of UBS. Your line is open.","Arpin\u00e9 Kocharyan","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I have a couple actually. If you could give a little bit more color on retail sales, a bit more in detail, what exactly was Q1 POS up companywide?","And then, obviously, March was a \u2013 you had a huge shift in Easter. How much of that \u2013 if you excluded out comps, that would be great. If you could share, three weeks into April, what does that number look like year-to-date. And then I have a follow-up.","Margaret Georgiadis","So, Richard, I know you covered some of that earlier. Why don\u2019t you go back and then we can make sure that we cover all your questions, Arpin\u00e9.","Richard Dickson","Sure. From a POS perspective, and as you know, we track POS at wholesale. It shows Mattel is slightly down as a whole in the quarter, excluding Disney Princess, which is primarily due to a tough license entertainment comp and some toy box brand. ","The global POS, both in \u2013 actually North America and international on core brands, as I mentioned, Barbie, Hot Wheels, Fisher-Price, is up single digits, and in some cases, in international up double-digits.","Arpin\u00e9 Kocharyan","That is the year-to-date number?","Richard Dickson","That was through March 30.","Arpin\u00e9 Kocharyan","Is there anything you could share on Barbie in term of retail sales in North America and international, what it looks like either through year-to-date or as of Q1?","Richard Dickson","Yeah. As I mentioned, Barbie sales both in North America and international are up single digits performing as to expectation. And if you recall, actually last year, we had a strong performance as well from a POS perspective in the first quarter.","Segments continue to do well, such as Fashionistas, which I mentioned, Dreamtopia, our state segment is doing well. We have some areas of weakness within the Barbie portfolio for this quarter on entertainment, which as we move forward and I explained in my upfront, our content strategy is evolving and we\u2019re pretty excited about what the back half represents in terms of a new form of content, new ways of distributing it.","But generally speaking, we\u2019re pleased with the POS progress, both domestic and internationally.","Arpin\u00e9 Kocharyan","That\u2019s very helpful. And then, on Disney franchise, I know that there was remaining inventory that you guys shipped in Q1 last year. But I believe that was not material. Is there a way \u2013 could you quantify what exactly that was last year that was shipped? There was some remaining inventory that you had some grace period to ship.","Richard Dickson","Yeah. I think it was de minimis from our shipping perspective. There was quite a bit of consumer takeaway, though, in the first quarter last year. As we shipped in the fourth quarter of 2015, those sold through, a lot of them in 2016 first quarter.","Arpin\u00e9 Kocharyan","Okay. Okay, thank you. And then, on the top line guidance, seems like Q1 down double-digit. That implies the rest of the three quarters have to be up at least sort of 9%, 10%.","As you stand here today, do you feel like some of the chunkier items you were expecting prior to Q1 still stand? For example, Cars 3, about $300 million. And what do you expect from DC Super Hero Girls?","Margaret Georgiadis","We continue to feel confident in the worldwide sales for the Cars movie of $300 million. And as we think about the sales guidance, part of the revision is driven by the inventory overhang impact, moving from 1% to 2% of full year sales impact as stated earlier. And part of it is that we are really being very careful this year, striking the right balance between sales and inventory build, given the experience we had last year in Q4.","Arpin\u00e9 Kocharyan","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Gerrick Johnson of BMO Capital Markets.","Gerrick Johnson","Hey, good afternoon. On the inventory obsolescence, how much was written down and what lines and properties were those?","Kevin Farr","I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to get into lines and properties, but it was ancillary brands that we discontinued. And besides the obsolescence, when you look at the impact to the quarter, obsolescence probably had the biggest impact on the decline in margins, followed by scale and then forex. ","Gerrick Johnson","Okay. Can you give us a dollar amount on that?","Kevin Farr","It was about $6 million.","Gerrick Johnson","Okay. On Toys \"R\" Us\u2019 call on Thursday, they said, \u201cwe will work down inventory for the remainder of the year.\u201d How does that square with you guys saying that your overhang is behind you guys? Is Toys \"R\" Us is just overloaded in other products from other companies and how does your position look there?","Richard Dickson","Yeah. I can\u2019t speak to Toys \"R\" Us' comments. I can speak about our business overall and certainly our relationship with Toys \"R\" Us is very strong. As we\u2019ve said on total, the inventory challenge that we've had going into the quarters is largely behind us. There are pockets of specifically inventory and retailers that we\u2019re working through, but on the whole, nothing significant.","POS remains solid and is pretty consistent with what we\u2019ve seen. And as we move forward, again, as Kevin suggested, all the data suggests that the inventory challenges are behind us.","Gerrick Johnson","Okay. Thank you, Richard.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Conder of Wells Fargo. Your question please.","Timothy Conder","Thank you. Any specific geographies \u2013 and again, you said largely have the inventory overhang cleared up, but where would you say that there may be some little pockets remaining to be mopped up? Question one.","And then related to cars, just want to make sure we\u2019re on the same level here. So, you're still confident \u2013 that $300 million incremental, is that above whatever cars did for Mattel in 2016? Just a clarification on that.","Kevin Farr","Yes. That is correct. And with respect to inventories, we\u2019re pretty well cleaned up in North America. Little bit of pockets and there\u2019s a couple of countries in Europe.","Timothy Conder","Okay, okay. And then, Kevin and Margo, you both sort of alluded to the \u2013 managing the inventory a little bit better. How much of the overhang and discounting that we saw in Q4 and then native to then in Q1 here was due to, let\u2019s just say, more competitive issues versus maybe more internal inventory working capital planning, any issues from an internal perspective?","Richard Dickson","No. I think as we talked about at the year-end, we set [indiscernible]. We built the inventory and then we needed to ship it in the period of time that consumers are out to buy toys. And so, that\u2019s what\u2019s happening in the first quarter, is the overhang from that.","Timothy Conder","Okay, okay. And just keeping item here, any tentative date, location there in New York for the planned investor day?","Margaret Georgiadis","Margaret Georgiadis","We\u2019re finalizing the details for that and we want to announce it shortly. Mid-June.","Timothy Conder","Mid-June. Okay, great. Thank you.","Timothy Conder","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Swartz of SunTrust. Your question please.","Michael Swartz","Hey, good evening, everyone. I just wanted to follow-up on the obsolescence charge in the quarter. Kevin, I think you said it was $6 million impact. Are you now fully reserved? In other words, we shouldn't expect any additional costs from that going forward?","Kevin Farr","Yeah. I think this was a special event where we dropped some product line. And as we look out to the rest of the year, we really don\u2019t \u2013 anticipating doing that again. And we think with regards to obsolescence expense overall against our inventories, that\u2019s [indiscernible] stated at the end of March.","So, yeah, I think this is one of those one-time items that we don\u2019t expect to see in the balance of the year, along with forex.","Michael Swartz","Okay. And then second question, I think, Margo, you had mentioned that American Girl lost some of its momentum. And understanding the strategy in the past year, so has been to introduce some new brands into the wholesale channel. I guess how do we think about that business over the next \u2013 in the near term and longer-term about how you actually grow and regain some of that momentum?","Margaret Georgiadis","So, first of all, American Girl maintains an incredibly passionate groups of users and so we are very excited about this brand and its potential, not just in the US, but internationally as well.","Specifically, what I was referring to is the ability for us to grow this franchise as you can see from our numbers, both last year and in the first quarter of this year. We are not yet meeting the kind of growth expectations that we would love to have for this franchise. And therefore, we are deeply looking at our product line strategy, how we\u2019re building our relationships with our customers. We have a new team there that started not too long ago and they have a lot of great plans for the brand. But we did want to fully disclose and in the spirit of transparency that we still believe that\u2019s a work-in-progress.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Felicia Hendrix of Barclays. Your line is open.","Felicia Hendrix","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. And as always, appreciate your comments and color on the quarter. Big picture question here, because listening to everything so far on this call and especially in the prepared remarks, I\u2019m just having a problem seeing the forest for the trees.","So, Richard, to go back to something that you said, at the end of your prepared remarks, you said that you must step it up. And I'm just trying to understand what that means since we've all had the impression that you\u2019ve been stepping it up pretty aggressively over the past two years.","And, Kevin, we seem to be getting into a trend here where management talks about results that you didn't see coming. So, for those of us who want to be more open-minded that Mattel can get back on track, how do we have confidence that the company is in the right place to execute the roadmap that Margo laid out?","And, Margo, you said you're confident that you can deliver on aggressive expectations. How much needs to change at Mattel for you to achieve those expectations?","Richard Dickson","So, I'll take a stab at going first on this one. So, as I mentioned in my conclusion and that you\u2019re picking up, this is a business about momentum and about sort of the long view as it relates to product development and our process. At the same time, we\u2019re living in a digitally savvy world where our consumer is able to digest information at the speed of lightning here.","We obviously need to continue to stress innovation as part of the heritage of the company, but in a more pronounced and aggressive way, the way we build product, the way we think about approaching our consumer, new waves of engagement, content is essentially the absolute ingredient, if you will, to narrate to consumers how our product is connected. So, we\u2019re working tirelessly to develop new and interesting ways to tell new stories with our brands.","And consumer insights, while we are incredibly pronounced and skilled in it, you can never essentially rest on it. We constantly have to listen to our consumers, react very quickly to trends. And so, I don't necessarily think that this is anything that we haven't done. However, I do believe that with the learnings that we have and the momentum that we now see, we can get even more pronounced. We spent a lot of time in the beginning, if you will, sorting through and listening to our consumers and trying to essentially put back together these core brands and reignite our relationships in the entertainment community.","I think what we\u2019ve displayed is we've done a good job of that and we\u2019re starting to see scores on the board. Now that we do have a little bit momentum, it's really time to step it up and start to dial up what we\u2019re learning, stop some things that aren\u2019t working. And with Margo's introduction here and ability to help us from a strategic, cultural and operational perspective, cut through some stuff, we\u2019re going to make a lot more progress.","Kevin Farr","I\u2019ll just say, it is pretty challenging to predict a business that\u2019s so seasonal. I think as you look at our outlook for today that we\u2019ve updated, as Margo indicated, we have a desire to be more disciplined in our sales projections, ensure that we don\u2019t overbuild inventory, given our experience next year. So, I think we have a high level of confidence in the outlook that we\u2019re giving you today.","Margaret Georgiadis","And in the spirit of trying not to be redundant, I am in complete alignment with what Kevin and Richard were saying.","As I\u2019m coming in new, this is really a great company, but we\u2019ve had a couple of resets, particularly in our doll portfolio. And that has really forced us to accomplish some good things, which is we\u2019ve reinvigorated our focus on our core brands and all the work that Richard has started over the last couple of years is beginning to move us in the right direction.","But Richard and I are both extremely aligned on the opportunity to truly step on the gas. We have the right positions for these brands. So, the opportunity is to take a little bit more risk to transform them faster is what\u2019s going to enable us to move into that future that we want to see. ","We have all the element in place today. But we do need to challenge ourselves from a cultural perspective. We need to modernize our infrastructure. We need to lean harder on the things that we know have always made this company incredible \u2013 innovation, collaboration and now we have to add to that speed. Because when we add those things together, as we talked about exploring the wonder of childhood with our users, we also need to do that with ourselves. We have to really ask the tough questions and make the tough decisions.","When we think about the consumer insights and data, the consumer is really moving quickly. This is a very long cycle business. And so, we have to begin to challenge the way we think about designing, developing and launching our products. And today, we are still doing it very much the same way we did many years ago. And so, we\u2019re really beginning to challenge ourselves.","As Richard said, to think differently about what is really right for the consumer, what do they really want from us, how do we engage them in a much deeper conversation than how retail often has historically just driven just the two launch periods. And retail has actually decided to work with us on that as well because they are trying to get closer to the consumer. So, those efforts are very aligned.","In addition to transforming our brands and our product, we also have the opportunity to leverage technology across our business. As Kevin referred to, this is a very complicated business. 60% of our products are new every year. And being able to use data to really understand consumer demand and to predict that more accurately going into the back half of the year is very important and I think we can do a better job of how we do that, both by right-sizing our sales expectations as we come through this transition, but also as we use next-generation indicators of demand.","Felicia Hendrix","So, Margo, just from your vast experience that you've had, how long does it take to change a culture to adapt to current trends?","Margaret Georgiadis","No, I come from the world where leadership starts from the top. And Richard and I have worked very hard in combining our management teams together and really setting a very proactive approach to how we want to work differently together. And we\u2019re already seeing great response from the team.","I think one of the most important reasons that we\u2019re right-sizing the guidance, given what the overhang that\u2019s come before us in Q1 is that we want to set this business up to last for the long term. We want to do it right this year and we want to be set up for the future. So, we\u2019re continuing to invest aggressively in our business in Asia where we see the growth opportunity as well as in our new brand opportunities. And I think if we put too much pressure on the sales lever right now, we run the risk of running into some of the same challenges we did last year. So, that\u2019s what we really want this year, to be the one where we write it and really run. And that\u2019s why we feel excited to come spend time with the investors in June, to share with you the excitement we have about the future of this company, both sales and profitability. And we think you'll be very excited about what we have to share.","Felicia Hendrix","I definitely look forward to that. Thank you for all of that. And just \u2013 Kevin, if you could help us understand, on the balance sheet, accounts receivable increased 8% year-over-year. Your sales are down 15%. So, can you help reconcile that?","Kevin Farr","Yeah. I think that\u2019s a factor of country risk \u2013 or country mix and also customer mix in different markets as well as we saw later sales in the quarter. Those are the three drivers in the increased in accounts receivable.","Felicia Hendrix","So, when you say country mix, do you mean shipping more, say, internationally?","Kevin Farr","Yeah. Selling more in Russia, China where the trade terms are different and longer.","Felicia Hendrix","And so, was the bigger driver that versus the timing?","Kevin Farr","Yeah. Those two would be bigger than the timing. The timing was part of it.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay. All right. Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Linda Bolton-Weiser of B. Riley. Your line is open.","Linda Bolton-Weiser","Hi. Thank you. Can you talk a little bit about the mix effect on your margin projection for the full year? That\u2019s a very important factor. And I guess, with Monster High now being managed as part of toy box, is that something that will imply maybe a greater \u2013 like an acceleration of decline, like it may kind of decline faster? And if so, can you girls portfolio be up this year? And can you get your margin target even if the girls portfolio does not grow this year? So, the mix factor is a big important part of it. So, can you just comment on that and sort of the continuing decline of Monster High?","Margaret Georgiadis","So, let me start. And then Kevin or Richard, feel free to jump in.","There is no question that the decline of Monster High has been a really challenge for us the last couple of years. We just want to be very transparent about that. At the same time, we've made a lot of progress with both Barbie and expanding Barbie, as Richard shared several of those important examples earlier. And we've also launched new doll properties in the toy box with a lot of success, working with Warner Bros. and WWE. And those are both very successful franchises.","We are continuing to look at ways in which we can reinvigorate the Monster High business because it has a really deep and passionate following the consumers. But it\u2019s often very challenging in these cyclical brands. When they start going in those wrong directions, you have to be able to invest and reposition them.","And so, one of the reasons, they went into the toy box \u2013 because that's really what the toy box is about. The toy box is about creating new brands, reinvigorating brands. It\u2019s all about partnerships. And so, we felt that it was important to have it in a place where it would get the right management attention versus our core brands. Those are evergreen brands that have very persistent sales year upon year, have a much more expansive range of categories that they participate in and experiences. And therefore, the approach that we take to managing them is different than a more content driven franchise, which is really what Monster High was for us, is what catapulted it to success in the beginning. It became a viral success overnight. And then, we just weren\u2019t able to find that right [indiscernible] to tap in to where we wanted to be.","I don\u2019t know, Richard, if you want to add anything.","ROETTGEN:","No, I think that really says it all. Just to sort of fill in a little bit of a blank, it still is a very powerful brand for us. Girls, as mentioned, are still attracted to the brand. We are coming out with additional new content on YouTube, new series launching in August, and we continue to evolve and align advertising and promotional spending accordingly.","There are a lot of things working both in content and in product and again trying to maximize the things that are working for us, and work harder and essentially eliminate the things that aren\u2019t.","Kevin Farr","Let me just follow-up on gross margin for the quarter. It was down due to a number of factors, including additional obsolescence expense as we talked about, a reduced supply chain fixed cost absorption due to lower sales, low licensing revenue and forex, as well as a few other factors. That explains about 75% of the 680 basis point decline. ","When you look at mix, the impact of mix was slightly negative versus the prior year. And it really is related to our doll portfolio declines.","Linda Bolton-Weiser","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian of Citi. Your line is open.","Greg Badishkanian","Yes. Thank you. Just on American Girl, the momentum \u2013 you talked about not having that momentum. Is that at the company-owned stores or is that the third-party retailers that you\u2019re using? Is that where maybe the momentum isn\u2019t where you\u2019d like it to be? And when you talk about momentum, is that versus the fourth quarter trend or just generally where you\u2019d like that brand to be in terms of sales growth at retail?","Richard Dickson","Greg, it\u2019s Richard. So, as you know, the first quarter is historically a very small quarter for American Girl. And the decline in the brand, as mentioned, was partially due to timing. We have a new phase rollout of new contemporary. Tenney and Logan specifically were rolled out in the first quarter and we\u2019ve got a new character coming out. Her name is Z.","In the second quarter, there was some frankly mixes in the business with our girl of the year this year versus last year. All of this was an expected decline. The impact actually of the decline was partially offset by WellieWishers and expanded distribution. So, there is a story within the story itself. But ultimately, I think the takeaway here is that there is work to do. We are applying some of those strategies in place. We\u2019re excited about the contemporary doll rollout. It\u2019s doing very nicely for us.","And so, we\u2019re going to be rolling out some new content with Amazon, starting in June actually. We have a new story coming out, American Girl story about summer camp. We\u2019ve got some great initiatives also on YouTube, digital content. And we\u2019ll continue to take some good swings at revitalizing the American Girl franchise.","Greg Badishkanian","And then, just finally, earlier you mentioned improving your e-commerce and omni-channel capabilities. So just, how should we think about the incremental levels of spend and how quickly you can see a sales benefit from those initiatives?","Richard Dickson","So, e-commerce is, obviously, a huge growth engine for us. We continue to perform \u2013 in fact, outperform the industry as it relates to e-com. The fastest-growing distribution channel at Mattel. We were the number one toy manufacturer online coming out of the holiday. We continue to partner both with our bricks and mortar partners that have become arms as well as pure plays online. Mentioned Alibaba and Babytree as one. But we\u2019re really building on these omni-channel partnerships to not only offer the best shopping experience, but also great product as well.","We\u2019re going to continue to invest in the space, both in capabilities as well as CRM and our salesforce partnerships. So, it is an expanding channel for us. We think that we're actually leading in the industry and we will continue to think about it as a digital first opportunity.","Greg Badishkanian","Great, thank you.","David Zbojniewicz","Operator, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Yes, sir. Our question comes from the line of Michael Ng of Goldman Sachs. Your line","is open.","Michael Ng","Thanks very much. I have one for Margo and one for Kevin. Margo, in the discussion about the dividend, I think it was mentioned that the board would take into consideration your strategic roadmap. Was that alluding to potential investment to set up Mattel for sustainable long-term growth? So, the question is, now that you\u2019ve been on the job for a couple of months, where you do see some of the performance gaps in areas where some investments could potentially yield some high returns?","And for Kevin, I think at Toy Fair, you mentioned that you're expecting strong growth for Fisher-Price in 2017. Is that still the case? And any color you can give around the strength of Wheels will be helpful as well?","Margaret Georgiadis","Let me start with your first question, Michael. Thank you. ","So, as I shared earlier, as we go through the in-depth evaluation of the business and how we want to invest to grow the business going forward, as I shared back in February, I still believe we have significant financial flexibility within our existing envelope to fund our growth initiatives. At the same time, we will evaluate all opportunities for growth and how we make those trade-offs.","And the company wants to ensure that we are constantly balancing our capital allocation framework that we\u2019ve always had with those opportunities for growth. And we will be sharing that with the board as well as following up with the investments community in June.","Richard Dickson","It\u2019s Richard. Just to expand a little bit on your question related to Hot Wheels, it is, as I mentioned in my upfront, one of our exciting core brands that continues to deliver outpacing the industry. We have lots of great new promotions, product and content that we continue to roll out. The strong momentum on YouTube particularly, as subscribers have grown double-digit even on the quarter, we\u2019re on track to hit some significant expectations. We\u2019re looking at all sorts of ways of expanding the brand, which we\u2019re looking forward to sharing more of that in June.","And I would complement the same type of profile with Fisher-Price. As we continue to get more pronounced in child development, we\u2019re really developing an incredible curriculum with talent in our organization around development \u2013 cognitive, social, emotional, physical development with product line architectures that support it and a communication system with moms and dads around the world, leveraging, obviously, a digital first approach to it.","So, lots of great ingredients that ultimately, we\u2019ll share with you more in June. ","Margaret Georgiadis","I think just to specifically answer your question, I think we\u2019re expecting Fisher-Price to have solid growth this year.","Michael Ng","Okay, thank you very much.","A - David Zbojniewicz","Thank you. There will be a replay of this call available via webcast and audio beginning at 8 PM Eastern Time today. The webcast link can be found on our investor page.

Welcome to the Mattel, Inc. second quarter 2017 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, there will be a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Whitney Steininger. Ms. Steininger, you may begin.","Whitney Steininger - Mattel, Inc.","Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me today are: Margo Georgiadis, Mattel's Chief Executive Officer; Richard Dickson, Mattel's President and Chief Operating Officer; and Kevin Farr, Mattel's Chief Financial Officer.","As you know, this afternoon we reported Mattel's 2017 second quarter financial results. We will begin today's call with Margo, Richard, and Kevin providing commentary on our results, and then we will take your questions.","To help guide our discussion today, we have provided you with a slide presentation. Our discussion and our slide presentation will reference non-GAAP financial measures such as gross sales, adjusted gross margin and adjusted gross profit, adjusted selling and administrative expenses, adjusted operating income or loss, adjusted earnings or loss per share, and constant currency. Our earnings release also includes non-GAAP financial measures. The information required by Regulation G regarding non-GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release and slide presentation, and both documents are available in the Investors section of our corporate website, corporate.mattel.com.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that certain statements made during the call may include forward-looking statements relating to the future performance of our overall business, brands, and product lines. These statements are based on currently available information, and they are subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. We describe some of these uncertainties in the Risk Factors section of our 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K, our 2017 quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and other filings we make with the SEC from time to time, as well as in our other public statements. Mattel does not update forward-looking statements and expressly disclaims any obligation to do so.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Margo.","Mary Margaret Hastings Georgiadis - Mattel, Inc.","Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining our call today. I would also like to thank those of you who attended or listened in on our Investor Day last month. We were pleased to walk through our new strategy and provide additional detail on our business and future growth drivers.","On today's call, I'll briefly cover our second quarter performance, which was broadly in line with our expectations. Following that, I'll provide an update on our progress on the plan we outlined at our Investor Day. Richard will then provide additional business updates, and Kevin will walk you through the numbers in more detail. And then as always, we'll take your questions.","So let's turn to the second quarter and our results. In constant currency, worldwide net sales were up 3% in the quarter and gross sales were up 2%, in line with the expectations we shared with you in June. I'll unpack the quarter in terms of the major drivers. First and most importantly, our key power brands, Barbie, Hot Wheels, and Fisher-Price, are performing well. Consumer takeaway at retail continues to show momentum, with global POS tracked at wholesale up for each of these brands.","Core toys across these evergreen brands continue to sell well, with strong second quarter performance from key items like Hot Wheels basic cars, the world's best-selling toy.","Hot Wheels track sets and play sets also sold well at retail, as we focus on improving attachment rates to grow our play systems. In particular we are pleased with our recently launched Hot Wheels Track Builder System Stunt Box. This system of play combines the magic of Hot Wheels cars and tracks with construction via smartly integrated MEGA Bloks products and has been a huge hit with consumers across our retail partners.","Other top performers include the extremely popular Barbie Fashionista line, which was recently augmented by an expansion of our iconic Ken line. The buzz around Ken has been great, and early reads tell us consumer takeaway is strong. And the brand's Career lines, which deliver on Barbie's You Can Be Anything messaging by enabling kids to imagine themselves in a diverse range of professions, has shown strong performance in the U.S. and globally.","That said, key brands POS outpaced shipping in the quarter. This was driven by tight management of our inventory levels at retail, and to a lesser extent by the shift to e-commerce, which as a channel carries lower inventory. However, given our strong POS momentum across key power brands, we expect shipping to align with retail sales over time.","Turning to our Entertainment business, the headline here is Disney's Cars 3 film, which debuted in U.S. theaters on June 16. While still early, I can tell you shipping for Q2 have been generally in line with our expectations, although early POS has been at the lower end of our plan. We are working closely with our partners at Disney to develop activations to enhance consumer demand around the film and DVD release as we approach the holiday season.","Offsetting strength in our key power brands is the continued disappointing performance in American Girl and Thomas and MEGA, particularly in North America. Richard will expand on this performance and our turnaround plans in a few minutes.","We are encouraged by our momentum as we progress through the year. Our key power brands remain solid. We are addressing challenged areas, and we are taking the right steps to enter the holiday season with tight alignment around inventory and demand.","I'd like to now turn to our strategic growth plan for Mattel, which we articulated last month at our Investor Day event. The goal of our strategy moving forward is clear, to future-proof Mattel and deliver enhanced sustainable growth. Although it's only been a few weeks since we presented our strategy to you in New York, we are moving quickly across multiple areas and wanted to share an update on progress.","First, we are laser-focused on building our power brands into connected 360-degree play systems and experiences. To this end, we have already begun to implement a consistent consumer-centric approach for our power brands. As I mentioned at our Investor Day, historically we have managed each of our brands separately and in different ways. Going forward, we are structuring our organization to manage all power brands within a common framework aligned against our new strategy and supported by more focused capabilities and resources.","We also launched in-depth consumer journey assessments to deepen our engagement programs with our consumers across channels and to enhance our ability to sell through broader systems of play, with an initial focus on Hot Wheels and Fisher-Price. These are both brands with significant unlocked direct-to-consumer engagement potential.","Additionally, we continue to build strength in key emerging markets like China, where we are taking big steps to establish Mattel as a trusted leader in learning and development through play. For example, to capitalize on China's $30 billion early education and training market, we have launched joint ventures with two outstanding partners, Babytree and Fosun, to establish learning centers in both suburban and high-traffic commercial settings, enabling us to cover the full market opportunity.","We are also acting quickly to reshape our operations to enable our strategy and become leaner, faster, and smarter, with progress in each key area. We recently launched a top-to-bottom effort to reshape our commercial organization to better capture market opportunities, simplify our processes, and ensure consistent execution across geographies, with an emphasis on developed markets. This will also allow us to reallocate investments to high-priority areas like omni-channel.","To drive our IT transformation, last week we brought on a new Chief Technology Officer, who comes to us with extensive experience in driving superior business results through better data-driven decisions, including work in telecommunications, higher education, and data security. He is working swiftly to put together a set of prioritized investments to drive efficiency and improve decision-making across our enterprise.","In addition, our new CTO has extensive experience in software platform development and integrating legacy technology with modern forms of computing such as AI and IoT. We are moving all of our technology-related product and services efforts under this new IT organization, with a focus on creating a best-in-class scalable platform for our connected products and services.","In addition, our global supply chain organization recently implemented a new centralized team dedicated to bringing our technology-enabled products to market. This team will leverage a customized project and platform management process to improve speed to market, create appropriate data testing programs where needed, and ensure standardization in hardware, software, and firmware to drive both consistent quality and efficiency across all of our connected products.","And importantly, we are moving at full speed to reignite our culture and energize our teams. We have quickly increased engagement by holding monthly town hall sessions, where employees around the world are encouraged to ask tough questions, share successes, and hear updates directly from our leaders. And we are implementing new programs to unleash innovation throughout the company with events like Makers' Fairs that encourage and reward employees to come up with great product ideas that challenge the status quo. At a recent Innovation Fair at our Fisher-Price campus, our employees showcased more than 50 new inventions, from toys designed to help infants build fine motor skills to an app development kit for older kids. The ideas were stellar and inspiring.","To summarize, we're hard at work executing against our strategy. And while we clearly have a lot of work ahead of us, I'm proud of the enthusiasm and focus with which everyone at Mattel has embraced our new direction. I'm very optimistic about our future growth potential. I look forward to keeping you updated on our progress in the coming months.","On a final note, I'd like to take a moment to thank Kevin Farr for his many years of service to Mattel. After 25 years with the company, 17 of them as CFO, Kevin is moving on to his next chapter. His deep knowledge of our business and our industry has been extremely valuable. And on a personal level, I deeply appreciate his help in bringing me up to speed quickly as I undertook my role. Kevin, on behalf of everyone at Mattel, I thank you for your dedication and for all of your contributions.","With that, I'll turn it over to Richard.","Richard L. Dickson - Mattel, Inc.","Thank you, Margo. I'd like to provide more specific updates for several key components of the business that Margo touched on in her review. I'll be focusing on what is driving success, how we're addressing challenges, and how we've translated insights, learnings, and innovations into a strong plan as we approach our most important period of the year.","Margo shared that our key power brands, Barbie, Hot Wheels, and Fisher-Price, are demonstrating momentum and strong consumer demand. This is particularly important because they are not only our largest brands, but also the pilots for new strategic initiatives and best practices. I'll start with Barbie and three of the brand's key product lines, core dolls, accessories, and the expansion into younger girls with Dreamtopia. While each of these lines are showing double-digit POS increases, tracked at wholesale, Barbie sales declined in the quarter due to a tough year-over-year comparison with the renewal of our universal content distribution agreement last year.","Let's take a closer look of what is driving POS strength. Dolls are growing worldwide, driven by strength in the U.S. The enhanced diversity of the line is driving brand relevance and encouraging incremental purchase. These dynamics were extended by the relaunch of Ken in June, which is already performing well. And the 1 billion-plus impressions we've generated to date also shows that the brand continues to be an important voice in the cultural conversation.","The fast-growing accessories line leverages our system play strategy, offering a wide range of products that bridge Barbie dolls with a complete Barbie world. This is typically a volume driver for the brand in the second half, and we have a strong lineup, including the third-generation Dreamhouse, the latest DreamCamper, and the new and innovative DreamHorse. Dreamtopia expands the age range of the brand to younger girls, integrating dolls, content, and play sets with age-appropriate and mom-friendly themes and values.","Our demand creation strategy for the line leverages next-generation content and media. Its launch on YouTube Kids generated 6 million views in just six weeks and was also the number one video viewed in the U.S. in May.","Considering the overall strength of the brand pipeline and the pace of implementation of our new strategies, I am confident about Barbie's momentum going into the back half of the year.","Like Barbie, Hot Wheels is showing strong year-to-date POS growth across most lines. With lean retail inventory levels as we enter Q3 and continued brand momentum, we expect shipping to align over time. The Hot Wheels business is driven by three key product lines, diecast cars, tracks and playsets, and character vehicles based on licensed entertainment. Let me walk you through some highlights that demonstrate the brand's momentum.","Diecast cars, the number one SKU in our industry, continued to show steady POS growth, even with the launch of vehicle-focused theatrical releases like Cars 3, demonstrating the brand's ability to maintain its staying power. Diecast cars are the core of the Hot Wheels brand, though as many fans will tell you, the cars are just the beginning. As Margo shared earlier, we are encouraged by the demand for track sets and other accessories. We are excited about the second half lineup, including an innovative RC Racer that expands the brand's technology range and the Super Ultimate Garage, which delivers great play for kids and an important storage solution for moms.","Additionally, licensed entertainment represents a major growth opportunity for Hot Wheels, and we expect a strong slate of second half entertainment-based products, including Star Wars: The Last Jedi, to perform well.","Fisher-Price continues to demonstrate solid consumer demand at retail, with POS up high single digits for the year and growth coming from all lines of the business across most regions. The Fisher-Price business is focused on three product lines, baby gear, infant and newborn, and preschool, which includes Think & Learn.","Let me share some Fisher-Price highlights. In baby gear as well as infant and newborn, the continued POS growth is being driven particularly by international. We expect performance in the U.S. to improve in the second half as a result of upcoming TV launches and incremental retail promotions. While we anticipate continued margin and share pressure from competitors in the second half, we will be counter-programming with a new infant product lineup. Highlights include the Smart Stages Puppy relaunch and the On-the-Go Baby Dome, the winner of the Best New Product award from the Juvenile Products Manufacturers Association.","In preschool, we are focused on the number one priority of today's parents, stimulating play patterns to encourage learning and development. The Think & Learn Smart Cycle, exclusive to Amazon, reflects a new approach to retail mark partnerships and marketing. This product has breakout potential, bringing app-based learning and role play to life with a physical play experience that stimulates kids' minds and bodies.","In June, I shared the challenges and turnaround plans for the MEGA, American Girl, and Thomas brands. While we are making important changes this year, we expect to see improved momentum over time. On MEGA, while we experienced softness in the U.S. due to increased competitive advertising and value players, we were pleased to see Q2 POS gains in Latin America and Europe. This fall, we are launching new core products as well as licensed lines like Pok\u00e9mon. We will also be implementing new strategic marketing and focused promotion.","On American Girl, we are continuing to stabilize the business, implementing the plan I shared during Investor Day. This includes restoring the brand's premium positioning with a renewed commitment to quality and packaging and product, the rollout of new CRM digital tools, and our new flagship store, which will feature bold new experiences, new aesthetics, opening this November in New York.","Our Thomas business remains challenged, due in part to competitive pressure in the preschool space from powerful content creators. New initiatives are underway, including an expansion of the brand through our System of Play strategy, a renewed emphasis on licensed partnerships, and two new opportunities, toddlers and girls. There are also significant new products, notably the Thomas Super Station, which is highly innovative and launching at a great price point. Much of the demand creation plan is weighted to the back half of the year, the brand's key selling season.","Looking beyond our largest owned brands, I'd like to turn to the important licensed entertainment products and new brand development from our innovation pipeline. The Cars 3 product launch is our licensed entertainment highlight year to date and an example of how Mattel is better leveraging our global scale and execution capabilities on behalf of our entertainment partners. And while Cars 3 POS performance is a bit slower than anticipated in the U.S., as Margo noted, we are working closely with Disney to support and enhance consumer demand for the back half of the year.","Recognizing the continued declines from Monster High and Ever After High, we launched Enchantimals in June. Enchantimals is an all-new Mattel franchise inspired by important cultural and toy trends. Enchantimals leverages a digital-first strategy targeting girls and moms with an immersive brand experience that will continue through the back half of the year.","In closing, our key power brands, Barbie, Hot Wheels, and Fisher-Price, are performing well and showing continued POS momentum. Other areas of our business are more challenged, and we're taking the right steps to stabilize and improve their performance over time. As we enter the back half of the year, our focus is on relentless execution to drive consumer demand. That means maintaining our focus on strong retail partnerships, top toyless (21:34) placements, ensuring we have the right space commensurate with brand volume and aligning shipping with POS.","A focus on digital, we've increased our digital investment 1.5 times as a percentage of our overall media mix. Digital enables us to better focus on where kids and parents are consuming and shopping and significantly increases our retail digital conversion, and a focus on primetime placement, capturing millennial family co-viewing occasions, which are increasingly important purchase drivers in our business. The Toy Box season two is launching in the U.S. this fall and will build to a pre-holiday finale to drive commercial potential. I look forward to updating you on our continued progress next quarter.","And now, I'll turn it over to Kevin.","Kevin M. Farr - Mattel, Inc.","Thank you, Richard, and good afternoon, everyone. My plan for today is to walk you through our second quarter results and discuss potential headwinds and tailwinds for the remainder of the year. But before going any further, I want to remind everyone that unless otherwise noted, I'll be referring to net and gross sales in constant currency to provide better visibility into the underlying top line trends. And to provide more transparency into the fundamentals of the business, I'll also reference some adjusted financial results that exclude non-recurring executive compensation and severance related to our business transformation. As always, reconciliation to GAAP numbers are provided in our press release and slide deck.","So let's walk through the P&L, beginning with the top line. In the second quarter, net sales were up 2% as reported and up 3% in constant currency versus the prior year. Gross sales were up 1% as reported and 2% in constant currency.","From a brand perspective, sales growth in the second quarter was driven primarily by Cars 3, and partially offset by continued declines in Monster High and Ever After High, continued softness in MEGA, American Girl, and Thomas, and a decline in Barbie due to a tough year-over-year comparison with last year's renewal of our content distribution agreement with Universal. Excluding last year's licensing revenues from the content distribution deal, Barbie was up low single digits on a global basis for the quarter, with global POS up double digits.","Looking at the business by region, we were pleased by the broad-based strength of our international segment this quarter, with gross sales growth of 6% as reported and 8% in constant currency and POS up low double digits. More specifically, we saw sales acceleration in the quarter in our Latin American business. We also saw sequential improvement in our European business and continue to see strength in key emerging markets like China.","International growth was partially offset by declines in North America. Gross sales in North America were down 2% as reported and in constant currency. For the quarter, POS for North America was up mid-single digit. While we faced some short-term headwinds in the second quarter, it's still early in the year, with the majority of the business for the year still in front of us, and we remain focused on executing the strategies we laid out for the organization. Exiting the first quarter, the retail inventory overhang from the 2016 holiday period have been addressed.","While global POS continued to outpace shipping in the second quarter, the high single-digit POS momentum of Barbie, Hot Wheels, and Fisher-Price year to date resulted in leaner retail inventories versus the prior year as we entered the third quarter. The combination of strong POS and leaner retail inventories gives us confidence that shipping will align with POS over time.","Moving on to the other P&L drivers, sales adjustments were 8.8% in the quarter versus 9.1% in the prior-year period. Our reported gross margin for the second quarter was 41%, down 430 basis points versus 45.3% in 2016. During the second quarter, gross margin was primarily impacted by increased royalties due to the higher sales of our licensed entertainment properties, unfavorable mix due to a shift away from our higher-margin doll business, lower licensing income, and slightly elevated product costs due to timing of year-over-year cost savings programs. Strategic pricing partially offset these headwinds.","There was steady important in our gross margin rate from first quarter, as we continue to gain scale with revenues increasing sequentially in the second quarter. Additionally, we incurred a lower obsolescence expense in the second quarter and saw a very little impact in ForEx as compared to the first quarter.","Continuing on, as planned, advertising was down slightly as a percentage of net sales for the second quarter. We remain disciplined in SG&A. Adjusted SG&A was up approximately $12 million or 4% year over year for the quarter, driven primarily by employee costs related to merit increases, investment in the expansion of American Girl, including the new store opening in New York City this fall, as well as continued investments in China growth. Finally, adjusted EPS for the second quarter was a loss of $0.14 compared to the prior-year loss of $0.02.","Our year-to-date tax rate was 22.8%, including discrete items. Excluding discrete tax items, our tax rate was 21.6% year to date, which is consistent with our expectations for the full year.","Now turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, receivables were up $123 million year over year, primarily due to the later sales in the quarter as well as country and customer mix with longer sales terms. We expect two-thirds of the increase in receivables to be collected in the third quarter.","And as expected, our owned inventory was up year over year, partially due to lower year-to-date sales and to support the continued positive global POS trends we're seeing for Barbie, Hot Wheels, and Fisher-Price, and our licensed entertainment launches throughout the year. Overall, we're comfortable with our inventory, both owned and at retail, as we entered the third quarter.","We ended the second quarter with $275 million in cash. Year-to-date cash from operations was negative $549 million, down $308 million year over year, due to lower net income as well as heightened levels of receivables and inventory. More specifically, the year-over-year decline in cash flow from operations was driven primarily by lower net income of $77 million, higher accounts receivable of $126 million, and higher Mattel-owned inventories of $13 million.","And as I said earlier, while our key power brands showed continued momentum, American Girl, Thomas, and parts of our innovation pipeline are performing below our expectations. In light of these challenges and our plans to continue to invest in our business as well as in our new strategies, we may not have sufficient flexibility under the current debt-to-EBITDA ratio of our credit facility at the end of the third quarter of 2017. Accordingly, we intend to amend the ratio under the credit facility before the end of the third quarter, and we are highly confident we'll be able to do so. At June 30, 2017, Mattel was in compliance with its debt-to-EBITDA ratio.","We continue to deploy capital in a disciplined manner to both manage the business and reward shareholders. As expected, capital expenditures were up in the second quarter, as we continue to make investments to grow the business, including the increases in automation as well as to build a new American Girl store in New York City.","Our second priority after investing in the business is to continue to reward our shareholders with a dividend. As announced at our June Investor Day, our board declared a third quarter dividend of $0.15 per share compared to $0.38 per share in the third quarter of 2016. The dividend was right-sized to facilitate the strategic investments Margo presented last month, increased financial flexibility over time, and strengthen our balance sheet.","Our third priority will be to evaluate as appropriate strategic partnerships, M&A opportunities, and share buybacks, as we seek the highest available returns on our capital. And while we continue to target a year-end cash balance of about $800 million, we expect to come in below our target again this year. However, we believe we will continue to have sufficient liquidity to invest in the business.","To position ourselves for a strong 2018, our overarching goals for 2017 are to exit the year with POS momentum overall, particularly in our key power brands, and to end the year with clean retail and Mattel-owned inventory levels.","And as I said at our Investor Day in June, we recently completed a rigorous strategic review with Margo and the senior leadership team. We made some tough calls to temper our revenue expectations to low single digits for the full year. While we began 2017 expecting top line growth in the mid to high single digits for the year, our low single-digit expectations reflect lower sales for Thomas, American Girl, and MEGA, which represents about half of the reduction of our full-year revenue outlook, as well as the impact of lower sales from our fragmented innovation pipeline, which we're rebalancing and refocusing for the rest of 2017 for improved productivity.","As we look ahead, we continue to target low single-digit sales growth for the year and expect the growth in the second half to be driven by: incremental licensed entertainment portfolio, including Disney's Cars 3 and Warner Bros. Justice League; our key power brands, Barbie, Hot Wheels, and Fisher-Price; and our strategic investments in emerging markets, which will partially be offset by continued declines in Monster High and Ever After High.","Additionally, we expect second half sales to be more weighted towards the fourth quarter, as consumers continue to buy later, which reflects the timing of our promotional efforts and marketing spend, the timing of our new product launches, and how retailers are likely to tightly manage inventory leading up to the holiday season.","We expect continued gross margin headwinds in the second half versus 2016 due to lower licensing income, including last year's franchise licensing agreement to expand American Girl into the Middle East, and mix royalties due to more entertainment-based properties, including Cars 3. However, we do expect sequential margin improvement in the second half of the year compared to the first half of the year due to the seasonal scale of our revenues relative to the first half of the year. The unfavorable year-over-year mix impact will be less severe in the second half since the weighting of Cars 3 revenue as a percentage of total Mattel revenue will be substantially less in the second half of the year than the first half of the year.","And while we've already begun making progress on the strategies presented at Investor Day, we continue to focus on running the business and ensuring very strong execution in the upcoming holiday season. Additionally, we remain committed to continuous cost improvement with our two-year $240 million cost savings initiative, led by our global supply chain organization, which will help offset inflation, labor rates, and product costs.","As a point of clarification from Investor Day, over the medium term we expect the cumulative incremental investment in our strategy of around $250 million to $350 million. Our goal is to partially offset our strategic investments over time by freeing up an additional $150 million to $200 million as we reshape our operations and seize savings via commercial realignment, supply chain transformation, and the future benefits of IT transformation process to optimize critical business decisions. As for the timing of our strategic investments, we're still working through the exact phasing of some of the investments. When we complete this work, we'll provide milestones against which you can measure our progress.","Before I close, I'd like to address the recent announcement of my departure from Mattel and CFO transition. Having spent over 17 years on the leadership team here, it's time for me to pass the baton. However, I do plan to stay on board in the interim to ensure a smooth transition. I'm excited about the new strategy and confident that the new leadership team will both transform Mattel and regain our leadership in the industry. It's truly been an honor and a privilege to be part of this great company, and I will truly miss all the very talented people at Mattel.","With that, we'll now open the call for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. You may begin.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, thank you for taking my question. Kevin, can we start on this point you made about the credit revolver covenants? And in your comments, it seemed like you thought that there would be some flexibility. But if there's not, that's obviously not a good outcome. So can you help us feel comfortable with this?","Kevin M. Farr - Mattel, Inc.","Yes, I think it's pretty simple. We're highly confident that we can amend the ratio under the credit agreement before the end of the third quarter. We've been talking to our lead bank, and we're highly confident that we will be making that amendment.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, thanks. And, Margo, a bigger picture question for you, something that we get asked all the time. You laid out very nicely and clearly at the Investor Day your roadmap and your plans to get this company on its right foot. Obviously, that's going to take time. And I think it would be unfair to hold you to a timeline, but we do get asked often how long this turnaround might take or how long your objectives might take to actually start being seen by the investment community.","Mary Margaret Hastings Georgiadis - Mattel, Inc.","So thank you for the question. We do want to be as transparent as we possibly can, which was the approach we had to pull that Investor Day as soon as I started, as we practically could. The transformation is significant and comprehensive because we are remapping the company for the future, reshaping our brand, our commercial supply chain organization so we can deliver the vision that we've laid out. It will take time to put all those steps together and reposition them. And as we have the roadmap that we can share back with you, which should happen in the next coming months, we will absolutely be as transparent as we can about the timeframe.","Hopefully, as you look forward, you will begin to see a truly differentiated company that's set up to win in a future where kids are really acting very differently than they have in the past. So we're excited about that. And obviously, the now multiple years of consistently strong POS for our key power brands should give you the confidence. These are the brands that anchor our company, and we have plans to sustain that momentum going forward.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, thanks, and my final question. Just with the weaker than expected POS for Cars, is $300 million still your goal?","Richard L. Dickson - Mattel, Inc.","It's Richard. Shipping for the second quarter has been generally in line with our expectations, although as noted, the early POS has been a bit at the lower end of our plan. As mentioned also, we had solid performance internationally. But we will continue to carefully align production to our evolving outlook, and we're working carefully and closely with Disney to activate all the support systems and enhance consumer demand around the film as we approach the holiday season.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So to interpret, are you maybe backing off from that prior objective a little bit now given what you've seen?","Richard L. Dickson - Mattel, Inc.","No, we're still on track for our goals. And as I mentioned, international is strong. The U.S. has started off a bit soft, but we anticipate as we drive the back half, with the partnership with Disney and the execution of retail, we're on track to deliver our plan.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay.","Kevin M. Farr - Mattel, Inc.","I think with regard to the $300 million, I think at this point we don't think we're going to exceed the $300 million, but we're tracking it closely, and we're going to build what we think we can sell. I think we've got some good results outside the U.S. We're going to track the U.S. closely. And if it's slower, we'll build lower and we don't expect it to be substantially lower than the $300 million.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, thanks for the clarity. I appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. You may begin.","Michael Ng - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great, thanks so much for the question, maybe just a follow-up to Felicia's question. I thought \u2013 I was wondering if you could just elaborate a little bit on the activations that you're implementing with Disney in the second half to improve POS for Cars.","Richard L. Dickson - Mattel, Inc.","We're working very closely with Disney. We have incredible marketing and promotional programs throughout the world. They're fully supporting the activation of the Cars 3 franchise, both in our aisle and outside the aisle. Retailers continue to support the franchise, which has been over a decade's worth of well-known, if you will, performance around the world. And so as we drive towards the DVD launch and various other promotional plans around the world, we're confident in the execution. And then, as I mentioned, our close partnership with Disney and our retailers are driving towards the planned performance through the end of the year.","Michael Ng - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And just on Hot Wheels, the double-digit POS growth for the brand was pretty impressive. I was just hoping that you could elaborate a little bit on the disconnect between the POS and the sales decline in the quarter. I think it was just particularly stark. I think this is the first time Wheels has declined in three years. Thanks.","Richard L. Dickson - Mattel, Inc.","In general, the disconnect between our POS and shipping in the second quarter is largely North American related. And as we've stated, POS outpaced shipping in the quarter. It was driven by tight management of our inventory levels. And again, as Margo mentioned, to a lesser extent the shift to e-com, as that channel continues to carry lower inventory levels. The short-term disconnects between POS and shipping are not unusual in our business and they typically align over time, and the trends are obviously different across markets. And we are enjoying POS momentum across all of our key power brands, and we are expecting the shipments to align with retail over time.","Michael Ng - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay, thanks, and just a quick follow-up for Kevin on the covenant for the credit agreement. What's the actual ratio where the covenant becomes an issue, and where do you think you can negotiate that up to?","Kevin M. Farr - Mattel, Inc.","With regard to the current covenant, we renegotiated it in the second quarter to 3.75 times. And at the time of the June amendment, we did not have Q2 actual results. When we look at the timing of revenues in the second half, which currently we see more of that shifting from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, so given our 2Q performance and the shift in revenues, we want to make sure we have sufficient flexibility on the current debt-to-EBITDA ratio of our credit facility at the end of the third quarter of 2017.","We're still looking at that. We've talked to our lead banks, and we haven't determined what we're going to take that ratio up to, but it will be higher than 3.75 times. And accordingly, we're going to attempt to amend that in the third quarter, and we're highly confident that we can get that amendment based on the discussions with banks.","Michael Ng - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Arpin\u00e9 Kocharyan with UBS. You may begin.","Arpin\u00e9 H. Kocharyan - UBS Securities LLC","Hi, thanks. It seems like the outlook for full year in terms of sales is unchanged, up low single digit. That still implies mid to high single-digit growth in the back half, with some tough comps ex Disney Princess, I guess in Q3. As you look at the business today, I guess what gives you confidence that type of growth is attainable? And then I had a follow-up.","Kevin M. Farr - Mattel, Inc.","I think, as you said, we are sticking to our low single-digit growth for the year. And when we look at the drivers, first, we've got POS momentum in our key core brands, and we're looking at incremental licensed entertainment portfolio, including Disney's Cars 3 and Warner Bros. Justice League, as I said, our key power brands of Barbie, Hot Wheels, and Fisher-Price, and our strategic investments in emerging markets, which again I think will be partially offset by continued declines in Monster High and Ever After High.","Arpin\u00e9 H. Kocharyan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Margo, when we last saw you at the Analyst Day, there was a bit of uncertainty surrounding the reinvestment plan, and I understand not much has passed since mid-June. But perhaps you could give us an update on that reinvestment plan. Specifically, what could hit P&L from OpEx perspective, and what could be under CapEx at least for this year? How much do you plan to spend?","Mary Margaret Hastings Georgiadis - Mattel, Inc.","So, Arpin\u00e9, as you know, we just hired our new CTO last week, and one of the biggest investment areas is our IT infrastructure. So he is undertaking a full review over the next 30 days. We actually have a board meeting at the end of August, and we're planning to try to expedite our decision-making around the way in which we want to pace and optimize those different investments. So as soon as we have that information, we will get that to you as quickly as possible.","Arpin\u00e9 H. Kocharyan - UBS Securities LLC","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Conder with Wells Fargo Securities. You may begin.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you. Kevin, just a little bit more clarification on the credit agreement relative to commercial paper. If you could just remind us, on a seasonal basis, the industry generally uses commercial paper, but just the mix as we roll through the year of the commercial paper, revolver usage, and just if you could give us a little bit of that.","And then, Margo, Kevin, Richard, whoever wants to take this, on the inventories by year end, it would appear that, due to increasing e-commerce and so forth, but also maybe due to as you're looking to tighten up the overall demand forecasting, production planning, you really want to exit this year extremely clean with inventories. And would that potentially against Cars 3 set you up for some potential revenue growth in 2018?","Kevin M. Farr - Mattel, Inc.","Okay, let me first take the revolver versus commercial paper. We haven't really accessed the revolver since 2009. We basically have great liquidity in the commercial paper markets, and the revolver is a backup facility to those commercial paper markets.","Regarding inventories, again, I think what we're really looking at is to tightly manage our inventory, both our owned inventory. We want to end the year clean with regard to retail inventories. So as I said earlier, we've made the tough decisions really right now as to what we expect to sell in the second half based upon our POS trends. And what we're trying to do is ship in what's going to sell through, and then we want to end the year with clean inventories at retail as well as our owned inventories.","I think with regard to the Cars question, we're going to wait and see what happens with regard to the release of the DVD and streaming on-demand, and we will adjust accordingly our production in the back half of the year to support revenues in 2018 if there is more revenue that we generate because of the strong POS around the globe.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And, Margo, again, we appreciate everything that you outlined, and I think from a broad perspective very well done in June, and that there are a lot of moving parts. The CTO, you just described the hire, what's going on there. You said I think earlier that over the roadmap turnaround I guess timeline over the coming months, should we anticipate something maybe 90 days from now or on the Q4 call as far as maybe that mix of OpEx, CapEx, and the cadence over as we look out into 2018 and maybe that goes through early 2019? I guess would that be a third quarter, fourth quarter potential to get a little bit of that timeline?","Mary Margaret Hastings Georgiadis - Mattel, Inc.","So we are very committed to providing transparency around the transformation plan. So what you can definitely expect us to do is on every call to give you an update on specific actions that we've been taking and the progress that we're making against the areas that we outlined against in the transformation, which is why even on this call, even though it's been such a short amount of time, we wanted to share some of the specific actions that we've already taken in just the last few weeks since we saw you in New York.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, okay. Last question would be your power brands you've been very, very clear on, but some other brands that maybe have not been as prominent and just focusing the organization's resources and attention. Could we see some of the owned brands over a period of a few years here just basically bleed those down and then toss them in the vault here for few years? Is that a reasonable assumption?","Richard L. Dickson - Mattel, Inc.","As we've always said, we are continuing to innovate in our core brand portfolio. The key brands of those, obviously Barbie, Hot Wheels, and Fisher-Price, are gaining more momentum. Certainly we have our challenged brands that we've talked to you about in terms of American Girl, Thomas, and MEGA. And our biggest challenge has been Monster High. And as I've mentioned, we're driving innovation in our girls' portfolio, with Enchantimals being a new brand for us that we're excited about. We've introduced obviously other new brands and inspiring new girls' play patterns based on insights with Super Hero Girls and most recently announced with WWE a new line of World Wide Wrestling female figures, so there's a lot of innovation that we're working on both with our own IP and with our licensed partners. An example, of course, is Jurassic as we move forward. But ultimately, we have a strong innovation pipeline and plan, and we will continue to update you accordingly.","Mary Margaret Hastings Georgiadis - Mattel, Inc.","Maybe to add to the question, I think we definitely see tremendous growth opportunities in our power brand franchises. So we will be investing heavily behind those as the new initiatives evolve. Obviously, the top three are firing on all cylinders across the globe, so we're going to step on the gas there. For the ones that are in turnaround, we're going to ensure we have great turnaround plans for them in place, so that they can realize their full potential, like Thomas and American Girl because these are amazing franchises that we can revitalize and are taking every action we can.","I would then think about we have a portfolio of more category-oriented brands which we bring to market at retail, and they play a very important role in different markets for different reasons. And so we do believe in those brands, but we want to make sure that we're thinking about our category strategies, and Richard is spending a lot of time with his team really thinking about strategy for the girls' category, the vehicles category, the games category. These are all categories we've performed well.","And then we're working on optimizing our licensed partner portfolio. Our entertainment partners are incredibly important to our business, and we really value the quality of relationships we have with people like Disney, Universal, and Nickelodeon. And what we're working with them on is how can we think as innovatively as we can about how we can develop new franchises together so that we can maintain a deeper pipeline of those great story-driven brands.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Very helpful, thanks, Margo.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Linda Bolton Weiser with D.A. Davidson. You may begin.","Linda Bolton Weiser - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Hi, thanks. So when you talk about the return to premium positioning of American Girl, can you explain a little bit more what that means because it implies that WellieWishers has cannibalized the positioning So is it something regarding changing WellieWishers or something there? How do you intend to reestablish the premium positioning of American Girl? Thanks.","Richard L. Dickson - Mattel, Inc.","Sure. I think it references back to our investor conversation. And the primary effort that we have right now is investing in the product and the product experience as well as our own retail store experience and online experience. We have made significant strides and changes in recent days, if you will, to ensure that the premier positioning of the brand from a product perspective is enhanced as well as looking at our retail experiences. And most notably, you'll see it in our New York City flagship, a real new aesthetic, new experiences to go with that, and ultimately a great product presentation that is more reflective of the premier positioning of the brand itself. We will be able to share a lot more with you and invite you to the store, of course, to see it for yourself, and we can certainly walk you through some of the exciting changes that we're making on that brand.","Mary Margaret Hastings Georgiadis - Mattel, Inc.","And your specific \u2013 it's Margo \u2013 question on WellieWishers, that's been a very successful franchise for us, and it's been a wonderful way to introduce many, many more girls to the franchise that shares all the values of the original American Girl dolls. And so we're excited about the potential of that franchise, and we have been pleased with being able to offer expanded distribution for that franchise as a way to help people more understand the power of the American Girl story.","Linda Bolton Weiser - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Okay. And can I just ask a question about the upcoming holiday season? Thinking about happened last year at Christmas with the retreat of consumer demand after Black Friday and then the discounting that occurred into the Christmas period, is there anything that you would do differently this year if the same kind of slowdown were to occur? You did share pretty significantly the burden of the promotion with the retailers last year. Is there something you would do differently if the same scenario were to play out again?","Richard L. Dickson - Mattel, Inc.","I think that obviously this year and probably subsequent years going forward, an increased focus on the omni-channel execution. We are driving an increased amount of digital presence as we execute our promotions online and drive consumer demand. We have learned a lot in this space and the idea of the seamless shopping experience for the consumer. We are driving tight alignment between our shipping and POS expectations with our retail partners. And as you know, the back half of this business with bricks and mortar is particularly important in terms of block and tackling both in-aisle space, incremental space, those top toy lists, and ensuring that we have the right product, price, and promotion happening when the ducks are flying. So we are driving what we know how to do very well, which is to execute against this category at retail and working on all the learnings to improve our performance.","Kevin M. Farr - Mattel, Inc.","I'd just add to that. I think with regard to making those tough calls we talked about to temper our revenue expectations for the year, we're doing that right now. We're looking at year-to-date POS, and we're aligning our full-year revenues with regard to what we think POS is going to be for the balance of the year, so we went from mid-to-high single digits to low single digits. And I think that's going to be a big part of execution in the fall that we ship in what's going to sell through, and then we end with clean retail inventories as well as our owned inventories in our warehouses.","Linda Bolton Weiser - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Okay, thank you",".","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's Q&A session.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to your host, Drew Vollero, Senior Vice President of Corporate Strategy and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Drew Vollero","Thank you, Stephanie. As you know, this morning, we reported Mattel's 2013 third quarter financial results. We provided you with a slide presentation to help guide our discussion0 today. The slide presentation and the information required by Regulation G regarding non-GAAP financial measures is available on the Investors and Media Section of our corporate website, corporate.mattel.com. In a few minutes, Bryan Stockton, Mattel's Chairman and CEO; and Kevin Farr, Mattel's CFO, will provide comments on the results and then the call will be open for your questions.","Certain statements made during the call may include forward-looking statements related to the future performance of our overall business, brands and product lines. These statements are based on currently available information and are subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties, which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. We describe some of these uncertainties in the Risk Factors section of our 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K, and our 2013 quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and in other filings we make with the SEC from time-to-time, as well as in other public statements. Mattel does not update forward-looking statements and expressly disclaims any obligation to do so.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bryan.","Bryan G. Stockton","Thank you, Drew, and good day, everyone. As many have heard me say before, we refer to the first half of the year in our business as the preseason and the second half of the year as the season. Overall, the season got off to a good start. I'm pleased with our performance in the third quarter, as sales grew, margins expanded, the balance sheet got stronger and we returned more capital to shareholders. I'll build out each of these points in a few minutes, but first, I'd like to provide a brief overview of what we're seeing from an industry-wide perspective.","Globally, the toy industry looks much like it has over the last decade or so. According to NPD, the U.S. toy business, which is about 1\/4 of the global market, is slightly up this year. The Western European markets, which comprise about 1\/4 of the global toy market, are flat, and we view that as a positive sign given the region's economic challenges this year. Both these numbers are pretty consistent with the historical rates of growth for both regions. While NPD does not provide syndicated data for the rest of the world, our internal analysis would suggest that remaining toy markets are growing at mid- to high-single-digit rates, again, consistent with historical trends. As we look across the NPD toy categories, growth rates continue to vary. Overall, the faster-growing categories in the toy space are fueled by innovative products and brands. All 3 of Mattel's core NPD categories, dolls, vehicles and infant\/preschool, are growing in the U.S.","To continue my assessment of the industry, let me make a couple of comments about the retail environment. Overall, it looks a lot like it has over the past few years. Retailers had been cautious, and they remain cautious. They continue to order based on what's selling. Their goal, like many companies, including Mattel, is to deliver better performance with less inventory. To date, we're seeing the toy industry and retail performing much as it has been over the past few years. As such, we're confident that the holidays are coming, Christmas will once again arrive on December 25, and this year, there will be more presents under the tree from Mattel than from any other toy company in the world.","Now let me turn my comments to our results in the third quarter. We have a good quarter overall, and I'm pleased with where we are as we head into the holiday season. On the sales side, we grew revenue in every region of the world. The key drivers of our global growth largely fall into 3 categories: our Girls portfolio, Fisher-Price Friends anchored by Thomas & Friends and several successful new launches.","First, as we've discussed before, Mattel's Girls portfolio features the top 4 best-selling doll brands in the world: Barbie, American Girl, Monster High and Disney Princess. We're committed to managing the portfolio to drive category growth. In the quarter, our Girls portfolio had its 16th consecutive quarter of growth. We continue to be very excited about the strength of Monster High, American Girl and Disney Princess. Monster High had another standout quarter, with strong growth in both the U.S. and international markets. Engagement continues to be impressive, with a monstrous response to the new theme song, which has racked more up than 1 million downloads since its launch in June. We continue to see millions of fans engaging with our content, downloading videos and sharing their freaky experiences on social media, further highlighting their passion for this amazing franchise.","American Girl also continues to fire on all cylinders by growing 20% in the quarter. Strong sales, both online and at retail destinations, fueled brand growth. Disney Princess also had solid performance, driven by the launch of Sofia, which I'll speak about in a few minutes. Overall, Barbie performed better in the third quarter, with worldwide shipping up 3%. The key driver for Barbie performance was our international region, which was up 6% for the quarter, driven by the strong initial launch of Barbie's fall entertainment line. Barbie shipments in the U.S. were down 1%, reflecting continued POS softness in the U.S. However, this also represents an improvement from the first half of the year.","A second important driver of Mattel's third quarter worldwide growth was Fisher-Price Friends, which ended the quarter up 14% due in large part to our friends from the Island of Sodor. Thomas had a strong performance in the quarter, and we continue to see more opportunities to expand this brand. Last month, we launched the newest Thomas movie, King of the Railway, and early numbers look fantastic. In its first week, King of the Railway raced to become the #1 children's nontheatrical new release in the U.S. according to Nielsen VideoScan. The DVD reached #1 on the kids and family bestsellers on Amazon.com, and was a top 5 video in the iTunes kids and family category. Fisher-Price Friends also got a nice boost from BBC's Octonauts toy line, as well as from our successful launch of Bubble Guppies with our partner, Nickelodeon.","Finally, the third top line driver that helped fuel sales growth in the quarter was our success at executing a number of new launches. As I said before, our goal of new launches is to hit the singles and doubles that will deliver consistent, sustained growth for our business over the long run. As I look at our batting average this past quarter, I'm very placed with our progress. This summer, the latest Disney Pixar movie, Planes, took flight and this exceptionally toyetic property has exceeded our expectations around the world. With another Planes movie slated for 2014, we believe this brand has the potential to become another fantastic evergreen property. The initial launch of Disney's Sofia the First has also exceeded our expectations. We know the princess play pattern is universal, and the Sofia characters seem to be resonating well with consumers. We're also pleased with the rollout of the Thomas Wood line, which is the main entry point to the brand for most consumers. We see this line as a strategic building block for our Thomas franchise, and we continue to execute this brand well in both specialty and mass channels.","In the quarter, we also launched our second franchise, Max Steel. As many of you know, Max Steel is Latin America's #1 action hero and we're excited to be bringing him to the world market. In Latin America, Max has seen strong growth this year. In our new launch markets, including the U.S. and Europe, Max is building awareness and momentum through immersive consumer engagement that includes television programming, webisodes, digital support and more.","Our newest franchise, Ever After High, the latest addition to our Girls portfolio, had a very strong exclusive debut at Justice stores in the U.S. Starting in the fourth quarter, the line will be shipped to major retailers in 14 markets around the world. We will also launch later in the fourth quarter to support the holiday release of Disney's new Princess movie, Frozen. We hear good buzz about the movie, and of course, we're always excited by entertainment featuring not 1 but 2 princesses. Disney plans to begin releasing the movie in the U.S. and other select markets around the world at the end of November and will complete their global theatrical rollout early next year. So overall, we feel like we're off to a good start with these launches. We see them not only as important top line drivers in 2013, but important brands for the Mattel portfolio for 2014 and beyond.","Let me finish the top line discussion here and talk about Fisher-Price. Like many of our brands, performance of Fisher-Price also improved in the third quarter when compared to the first half of the year. Total brand shipping was flat in the quarter, with Fisher-Price Friends up 14%, offset by core sales, which were down 3% globally. Fisher-Price Core continues to see strong gains in key branded segments like Laugh & Learn, Little People and Imaginext. This strength is being offset by weakness in Baby Gear and our decision to move away from lower margin, less brand differentiated segments. That said, recent Fisher-Price POS trends are improving in both the U.S. and international markets as we see promotional product and consumer engagement plans coming together. There's more work to do here, and the brand remains a work in progress.","Kevin will cover in detail our P&L, which continues to be strong. However, I'd like to briefly touch on 3 elements: our expanding margins, consistent return of capital to shareholders and our strong balance sheet. Operating income was up 8% for the quarter, driven by higher gross margins and modest overhead leverage. Additionally, in the quarter, we returned $373 million to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. Our balance sheet is also in great shape. Cash on hand is higher, and our inventory is up just 1% year-over-year. As we move forward, the goal is to deliver another strong year in 2013 and we know we need to execute well in the all-important fourth quarter.","As I've outlined here, we had good momentum in important areas of our business: our Girls portfolio, our Fisher-Price Friends business and our many new product launches. And we had growth in every region of the world in the third quarter. And the growth in some of our emerging markets is particularly exciting. As retailers continue to focus on inventory, they're buying what's selling and we remain focused on driving both POS and shipments. To date, this year, our POS has been mixed, with international markets delivering year-over-year gains for Mattel. Our objective in the fourth quarter is to build on that POS momentum in international. POS is down mid-single digits in the U.S. year-to-date, and our focus remains on improving POS trends on key brands like Barbie and Fisher-Price. As you may know, more than 50% of the POS in the toy business occurs in the fourth quarter, and our teams around the world are focused on executing their plans and programs to maximize both sell-through and shipping.","To wrap it up here, as we look to the holiday season, we once again have a strong lineup of innovative products for the fall. In fact, again, this year, Mattel has shown that when you innovate, you grow as we have more than 80 different toys represented on top-rated holiday lists globally. As you know, innovation is a critical element for success in the toy business and these lists remind us that we have tremendous talent here at Mattel. It is now our job to ensure flawless execution in these final 3 months to ensure that we deliver another successful year of growth for the company, our employees and our shareholders.","And now I would like to turn it over to Kevin Farr, our CFO, to give you more insight into our financial performance. Kevin?","Kevin M. Farr","Thank you, Bryan, and good day, everyone. As Bryan pointed out, we continue to make good progress this year as we remain focused on our company objectives: to consistently grow the business, to maintain financial discipline and to deploy the cash we generate effectively to reward our shareholders.","In this quarter, I was very happy to see improvement on a number of operating metrics. For the quarter, sales momentum continued and was up 6%. Our gross margins improved in the quarter and is up 90 basis points year-to-date. We improved our SG&A spending leverage, even with our continued strategic investments to grow our business. And we saw good flow-through resulting in a 23.9% operating margin in the quarter. This strong operating performance, coupled with a favorable tax rate due to discrete period tax items, resulted in EPS of $1.21, a 16% improvement over last year. And while we had a very solid quarter, we recognize the need to continue to execute in the fourth quarter in order to deliver another year of strong growth to our shareholders.","Now before I start reviewing the slide deck with you, I want to highlight a couple of key items in the P&L and touch on our capital deployment strategy. First, we continue to see strength in our gross margin. Our peak production season is behind us, and while there's been puts and takes in our input costs, our overall basket of costs for the first 9 months of 2013 are fairly consistent with what we had initially planned for 2013. And while there's still a number of factors outside of our control that can impact gross margin, including volatility in input and foreign exchange, we will continue to actively manage manufacturing efficiency and O.E. 3.0 cost savings programs, and we expect to benefit from favorable mix related to growth in our doll portfolio and our pricing actions taken at the beginning of the year. So currently, we believe that we're in good shape to deliver gross margins in the low to mid-50s range over the near term.","I also wanted to briefly touch on our SG&A spending, which remains in line with our expectations that we outlined with you at the beginning of the year. While spending is up, I continue to like the quality of our SG&A as we invest in strategic growth initiatives, some of which will generate tangible benefits this year. For example, in the fourth quarter, we will launch our third franchise, Ever After High, at our mass retail partners in 14 countries, and we'll open our 16th American Girl store in Palo Alto, California.","Next, I want to highlight that in third quarter 2013, our EPS reflected a $0.05 per share tax benefit as we realized discrete period tax items, primarily related to the reassessment of prior year's tax liabilities based on the current status of tax audits and enacted tax law changes. As a result, for full year 2013, we currently estimate that our annual effective tax rate, including discrete period tax items, will be approximately 19% versus 18% in 2012, but down from the near-term expectation of 22% to 23% that we had previously communicated.","Finally, I want to touch briefly on capital deployment. As you know, we study capital deployment very closely since our business consistently generates strong cash flow, and the return of that capital is an important part of our total shareholder returns. Mattel has a strong history of returning capital to our shareholders. Last year, we returned a significant amount of capital to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We also deployed cash to invest in strategic growth initiatives, like the acquisition of HIT. In 2013, consistent with our historical capital investment framework, we expect to pay dividends of about $500 million based upon our annualized dividend of $1.44 per share, which is up 16% versus 2012. And we continue to buy back our shares opportunistically, with year-to-date share repurchase of 9 million shares at a total cost of about $387 million. In the quarter, we purchased 6.1 million shares at a total cost of about $259 million. Looking forward, we'll continue to be disciplined and opportunistic in deploying our cash to enhance shareholder value, while maintaining a strong balance sheet with targeted year-end cash of $800 million to $1 billion and debt to total capital of approximately 35%.","Now let's turn to the slide deck. Starting on Page 4, you can see that our worldwide gross sales are up 6% for the quarter and 5% year-to-date. We saw continued strength in our international region, which was up 9% in the quarter, and improvement in the North American region, which was up 3%. Our Girls portfolio saw growth in all of its major brands, Barbie, Monster High, American Girl and Disney Princess, and we continued to see growth in Fisher-Price Friends. And retail inventories are down slightly, which puts us in a good position to deliver another solid holiday season.","Turning to Page 5 of the presentation, you can see the brand perspective on sales. Worldwide sales for Mattel Girls & Boys Brands were up 8% for the quarter and 7% year-to-date. Barbie shipments improved in the quarter, and we saw strong growth in Monster High and Disney Princess, which includes its new animated series, Sofia the First. Hot Wheels was down 2% for the quarter and year-to-date. We saw solid growth in our entertainment line, driven by Disney Planes and our own Max Steel. As Bryan mentioned, we're pleased with the year-to-date performance of Max in Latin America, and the brand continues to build an audience here in the U.S. and other countries around the world.","Worldwide sales for Fisher-Price brands were flat for the quarter and down 2% year-to-date. Key brand drivers include continued strength in Fisher-Price Friends, especially with our own Thomas & Friends and Mike the Knight. Solid performance from our Disney licenses, as well as our new Octonauts and Bubble Guppies licenses, and we saw improved shipments in Core Fisher-Price as compared to the first half of this year, driven by our Little People, Imaginext and Laugh & Learn brands. Our American Girl Brands have yet another great quarter, with sales up 20% and up 22% year-to-date.","On Page 6, we highlight the performance of our North American region. Overall, sales for the region were up 3% in the quarter and up 2% year-to-date. For the quarter, growth was driven by continued strength in our Girls portfolio, including American Girl, as well as our Fisher-Price Friends business, which was partially offset by Wheels, Games & Puzzles and Fisher-Price Core.","Our international region, as seen on Page 7, grew 9% this quarter and 7% year-to-date. For the quarter, all of our regions grew in U.S. dollars. We also continue to see strong results in emerging and developing markets like China, Russia and Eastern Europe, as well as Mexico. And Brazil and India had strong sales, which were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency.","Now let's review the P&L, starting on Page 8 of the slide presentation. I've already talked to you about gross margin performance for the third quarter. For the quarter, gross margins improved by 10 basis points to 53.8%, driven by improved mix due to the continued strength in the performance of our Girls portfolio, savings from O.E. 3.0 initiatives and our pricing actions, partially offset by increased input costs which were offset by unfavorable foreign exchange and increased logistics cost. Year-to-date, the gross margin of 53.3% is up 90 basis points over last year, consistent with our goal of delivering gross margins in the low to mid-50s range over the near term.","And I've also already talked to you about our SG&A expenses, as seen on Page 9, which continue to be consistent with our expectations. About half of the $17 million increase in third quarter SG&A was due spending on strategic growth initiatives, with the balance of the increase in spending primarily related to higher employee-related costs, principally merit and benefits. For the quarter, SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales was 18.6%, a 30 basis point improvement over the prior year.","Page 10 of the presentation summarizes the performance of our company-wide cost savings initiatives and the continuing efforts on our ongoing Operational Excellence 3.0 program. For the quarter, we delivered incremental O.E. 3.0 gross savings of $15 million, and we remain on track to deliver a full year target of around $50 million in gross savings.","Turning to Page 11. Operating income in the third quarter was $528 million or 23.9% of net sales, a 40 basis point improvement over last year's third quarter. The improvement in operating margin was driven by higher sales, improved gross margin and slightly lower SG&A as a percentage of net sales.","Turning to Page 12. Earnings per share for the quarter were $1.21, an increase of $0.17 or 16% compared to the prior year. The increase in EPS was driven by higher operating income, lower nonoperating expenses and a lower tax rate due to favorable discrete period tax items and a slight decrease in share count. The impact of foreign exchange in the quarter was a negative $0.05 per share and a negative $0.10 per share year-to-date. As I said previously, we currently expect the worldwide effective tax rate for the year to be about 19%, including discrete tax items. And assuming no tax law changes, we believe that the tax rate for the foreseeable future will be around 22% to 23%.","Slide 13 outlines the HIT integration and amortization costs Mattel incurred in 2013 and the first 9 months of 2013. For the quarter, acquisition and integration expenses were $2 million, down $1 million compared to the third quarter of 2012. For the full year, we expect these expenses to be about $7 million compared to $24 million in 2012.","We discuss cash flow on Page 14. Year-to-date, cash flow used for operations were $321 million compared to $101 million last year. The increase is primarily due to higher working capital usage, partially offset by higher net income. Cash used for investing is significantly lower than last year, when we acquired HIT for $685 million. Capital expenditures are up slightly to $179 million. Year-to-date, we repurchased 9 million shares of stock at a total cost of $387 million. And we continue to pay our quarterly dividend of $0.36 per share, which represents year-to-date cash payments of $372 million. Our balance sheet remains strong. Our cash on hand at the end of the period was $406 million, up $124 million from the prior year. And our debt-to-total capital ratio was 36.5%, up slightly from 36.3% in the prior year but consistent with our targeted rate of 35%.","Today, we announced our fourth quarter dividend of $0.36 per share, a 16% increase over the prior year. In July, we also announced that we increased our share repurchase authorization by $500 million and we have $463 million remaining under this authorization as of the end of the third quarter. As I said, we remain committed to our capital investment framework and expect to end the year with cash and debt levels consistent with our targeted levels. As a reminder, we've enhanced our level of disclosure in our 10-Q and 10-K filings for consolidated and segment revenue. You'll find the schedules that outline these enhancements, including the quarterly information that we provided this morning. We also posted these schedules on our corporate website in the Investors section under the subheading, Financial Information.","So in summary, we made good progress this quarter. Our performance to date is consistent with our long-term financial goals for sales and operating profits. As we enter the all-important fourth quarter, our goal is to deliver another year of strong financial performance to our shareholders. As we look ahead, we remain keenly focused on growing our business consistently, growing it profitably and deploying the cash generated in value-enhancing ways to reward our shareholders.","This concludes my review of the financial results. Now we'd like to open the call to questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Greg Badishkanian with Citigroup.","Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","First question is just, as you guys had talked about last quarter, you saw an improvement in Fisher-Price Core, Barbie and you saw that in the third quarter. How much left in terms of incremental improvement do we have over the next few quarters? Or do you think it'll kind of be a steady state for the next few quarters at this point?","Bryan G. Stockton","Greg, it's Bryan. We're feeling, I think, encouraged by what we're seeing on both Barbie and on Fisher-Price. As we think about Fisher-Price, we like the fact that global shipments were flat for the quarter, with Fisher-Price Friends up about 14% and Core down 3%. As we think about the overall portfolio of Fisher-Price, we always think about Friends and that business seems to be doing pretty well. We like what we see in both Mike the Knight and in Thomas. Some of the partner brands that we've got there with Disney and Nick and BBC are doing well. So that part of the Fisher-Price portfolio has positive momentum, both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. As we think about the core business, we saw an improvement compared to the first half and there's a couple things that we like when we look at Fisher-Price. The first thing is really a couple of the segments like Imaginext and Little People and Laugh & Learn are doing pretty well. International -- and recall international is an important part of the Fisher-Price growth plan, it's only about 1\/3 of Fisher-Price revenue for us globally so international is a key part, and we're seeing POS improve as we get some of the new programs and packaging out there in international. So we like that. The biggest challenge we have on Fisher-Price is really in the U.S. We need to improve consumer takeaway on the core business. We're really focusing on that in the fourth quarter as the new packaging and promotional programs and some space expansion come into play. So but we feel like we have more work to do on Core in the U.S. more specifically. But our plan is still on Fisher-Price to plan to grow that business overall. Again, we've got good momentum on Friends. It's taking longer than I think any of us would have liked to get the core business turned around in the U.S. in particular. But having said that, we've got about 50% of the industry in our POS ahead of us, so we're committed to executing. So I'd say that's a pretty good summary of how we feel about Fisher-Price. As it relates to your question on Barbie, again, we feel pretty good about the shipments, they were up 3% for the quarter. That's a similar story in terms of international. As you recall, international represents 2\/3 of Barbie global revenues. And we see some progress in international, shipping was up 6%. It's up 2% for the year in international. POS trends in Barbie are improving. We talked about the launch of the new fall video, which is having a positive impact. And it goes back to the U.S. The shipments are improved from the first half, they're still down 1%. We think one tailwind that we saw in the U.S. is, as we talked about at the second quarter, there was some promotional spending that we shifted into the second half. Some of that spending was executed in the third quarter and that, obviously, was a bit of a tailwind. But we're also dealing with the Barbie POS softness in the U.S. that kind of offsets a bit of the tailwind on shipping. So we would say in the U.S., Barbie shipping and POS is pretty well aligned and we got to focus on executing the same programs we're doing in international. So progress on both, more work to be done on both, but we're feeling better than we did at the end of the second quarter.","Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Good, good. And just another question. Inventory, U.S. inventory was down. I think retailers seem to be managing inventory levels a lot more aggressively. And just wondering when you talk to your retail customers, has there been much of a change over the last month or 2 in terms of their outlook for the holiday? Or is that pretty consistent with a few months ago?","Bryan G. Stockton","Well, I would start with the notion that retailers are really working hard to reduce inventories is not a new idea. That's something we've been working with them for the past couple of years. As you recall, in 2012, we were able to get our inventory retail down sort of mid-single digits. We're running at about that rate this year. We like that. It keeps the product more fresh at retail, helps inventory turns at retail. That's good. Mattel, as well, is also working on reducing our inventories, we were pleased, quite frankly, that even with all the new launches we have in place, our inventory is only up about 1%. So we like that. As we talk to retailers, everybody is focusing on executing well. As you know, we always suffer the pre-Christmas jitters, both at retail and here on the vendor side. But we think that the toy industry looks good. In the U.S., it's up marginally. It's kind of flat in Europe. So we think the outlook for toy is actually quite strong.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gerrick Johnson with BMO Capital Markets.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I'd like a little bit more clarity on your point of sale. I think you said down mid-single digit U.S. Was that year-to-date, or in the quarter? And with shipments up slightly in the U.S., is there anything to be concerned about with that disconnect?","Bryan G. Stockton","We look at POS on a year-to-date basis, generally, because there's all sorts of puts and takes depending on the timing of promotional programs and holidays and things of that nature. So when we look at our POS and shipments, we would say across most of our brands and most of our countries, it's pretty well aligned on a year-to-date basis. We think that's a good place for us to be, as we go into the all-important fourth quarter and we focus on execution. It means we're in balance, even with retail inventories down mid-single digits. So we like where we are.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And can tell you us a little more about Playground Productions? I think that -- you did mention it in your preamble, but maybe you could tell us a little bit about it now.","Bryan G. Stockton","Well, sure. As you know, we're spending a lot more time creating content, and that's a fundamental part of our brand-building strategy. As we look at successful brands in the toy industry at the moment, they tend to be the ones that have great consumer engagement, whether that's through television or movies or webisodes or any other kind of consumer engagement. And it's just our fancy term for a group we have internally here at Mattel that is producing terrific programs like -- things like Max Steel, for example. But it's not a studio in the purest sense of the word. It's a fancy term for a group of highly talented people here at Mattel that have been employees for a number of years. And they do a terrific job, as you can see, by all the content that we've been producing. And you look at Monster High, Ever After High, Max Steel, they're just doing a terrific job.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And I just want to sneak one more. Are you seeing changes in the way retailers are managing their inventory risk, meaning, less FOB, more domestic fulfillment? Any changes in how they are getting fulfilled this year?","Bryan G. Stockton","Not really. Every year, as we look across our customers around the globe, there's always changes at some customer somewhere, who wants to try something a little bit different. But as we look across our portfolio of customers, we're not seeing a growing trend one way or the other. But we partner with our customers every day to make sure that we optimize the execution of the flow of inventory and merchandising and driving POS. So overall, I would say no. And I'm sure there's an example somewhere out there, where somebody's made a change but, overall, for Mattel, it's not material.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim Chartier with Moness, Crespi and Hardt.","James Andrew Chartier - Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co., Inc., Research Division","Two questions. I just wanted to confirm, you still expect to grow Fisher-Price sales overall in 2013?","Bryan G. Stockton","Yes. What we said is we plan to grow Fisher-Price. And when we talk about planning to grow Fisher-Price, overall, that's a combination of Friends, which is our owned properties like Thomas and Mike the Knight, as well as our license partners like Nickelodeon and Disney. And our -- also our Fisher-Price Core business. As we look at our Fisher-Price business, we've got momentum on the Friends business, both our own properties and our licensed properties, so we like that a lot. We are also working hard on the execution of Fisher-Price Core. As I'd mentioned, we like some of the momentum we're seeing in international, that's the key to Fisher-Price growth in the future. It's taken longer on the core part of the business in the U.S. to get that business turned around. It's all about POS and in-store execution and working hard to make sure we get everything lined up. We've always said it was a second half plan for Fisher-Price Core. We had the new packaging in place. We have new promotions and new space. But if you look at Fisher-Price overall, year-to-date, we're down about 2%. So it's -- we've got some work ahead of us to pull ahead, but it's our plan, and we're working really hard across both parts of our portfolio to do that.","James Andrew Chartier - Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co., Inc., Research Division","And then just I know it's early, but can you compare the response to Ever After High relative to kind of Monster High at this stage in terms of, I don't know, YouTube downloads or other engagement with the consumer?","Bryan G. Stockton","Well, it's difficult to compare, because Monster High was such a shocking thing to all of us, the way it took off. We would say based on what we've seen in terms of the response at Justice stores, not just on the toys, but on consumer products and the engagement overall, we like what we see. But it is just way, way too early. Shipments on this brand don't really start until later this quarter. So we like what we see, but it is pre-preseason for Ever After High.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jaime Katz with Morningstar.","Jaime M. Katz - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Can you guys talk a little bit about what is resonating in, I guess, Europe and Asia Pacific specifically? And what you see as sort of the growth opportunities longer term for those businesses? It kind of looked like Latin America was sort of the drag in international. So I'm curious maybe what you're up in Asia Pacific like that made that work well outside of what we already know?","Bryan G. Stockton","Sure. Why don't I take you on a little tour around the world here. Let's start first with Europe. We like where we are in Europe. We think a couple things are happening there. Number one, we're executing well with all of our retail partners on our core brands, as noted with our Barbie performance, as well as launching new brands like Monster High and some of our partnered brands. We've also invested, we think, very wisely in Russia as a part of Europe and that's growing quite well. We've been trying to leverage our scale in core brands in Russia, so we like what we're doing there. And it's really about building momentum and leveraging our brands and our opportunities there. And as you look at Europe, what is most encouraging is that as you look across every market, it's positive across almost every market. And so it's not 1 or 2 countries driving it. It's pretty broad scale performance. As we think about Latin America, we've always loved Latin America. As you know, it's about $1 billion business for us. It's been growing. It continues to grow. POS continues to grow there. Our shipments are up there. The 2 key markets in Latin America are Brazil and Mexico, and we continue to see POS grow there. And we are really strong in fourth quarter execution in both of those markets. As you recall, those are 2 very, very seasonal markets. In Brazil, one of the issues that everyone is dealing with is the currency impact. And even with that, we feel quite positive about Brazil. So we think there's still more opportunity for growth in Latin America, particularly in the 2 anchors of Mexico and Brazil, and so we're quite positive about it. Asia, I think is a couple things going on. Number one, like Russia, we've been investing pretty heavily in China, and we're seeing good response. We've built that business, the foundation, or as I look to call it, brick by brick, focusing in on our core brands and core customers and really making sure we build a sustainable business in China. We've got the scale there that now we're beginning to be able to leverage things like advertising investments in China, and that seems to be paying off, so we like that. The Australian market, which we include as a part of Asia, has been going -- undergoing some changes in how retailer promotional programs have been tying. Traditionally, that's a very strong market for retailer toy promotions in the summer, and that seems to be evolving for less focus on the summer and more focus on the fall. So we're seeing some improvements there as well. But we like Asia. India is continuing to do well for us. We've been there for a while and continue, again, to invest in our core brands there. So outside of North America, Europe is doing well, great execution. Latin America is doing well, great execution and growth. And Asia is doing well, because it's new and growing. We've been there for a while and we're investing.","Jaime M. Katz - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","And then can you talk a little bit about the Wheels business and whether or not you guys are looking to maybe put some marketing dollars behind that to sort of reengage the consumer, since it looks like, was that a couple quarters of weak performance?","Bryan G. Stockton","Well, we like where we are in the Wheels business. We think we're well positioned with Hot Wheels, with some innovation in the fourth quarter, with things like the Car Maker, which is a really interesting and innovative new item. So we like where we are. And we really think about wheels in terms of everything that's sort of diecast. We have to look at Hot Wheels, we have to look at Cars. And, of course, Planes is really taking off, pun intended. And that appears to be some nice new incremental business for us everywhere where that brand has been launched. So if we look at our overall diecast business, we like it. Hot Wheels has solid momentum, again, with the Car Maker and some other new things. So we think we're well positioned to execute well in the fourth quarter and feel good about that business.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tim Conder with Wells Fargo Securities.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just a couple here. Bryan, a little bit more color, if you could, on Barbie. I know you commented on POS year-to-date in the previous -- answer to the previous question. But it appears on the NPD that, that had weakened quite a bit in the third quarter. Can you maybe kind of give us a little bit of color there? Was that primarily older product versus what you've now shipped in during the third quarter? Was that due to that bleed down of the old product? Or was there something else going on? And then the second question is Girls. Monster High, as you said, continues to do well. But you would think that, at some point here, the rate of growth is going to start to slow but still grow. So can you kind of comment on Monster High, Barbie, Disney Princess, how you see that growth going forward here as the Monster High growth comes down but still progresses?","Bryan G. Stockton","Sure. Well, let me start with Barbie POS. I'm really not going to get into a discussion of Barbie POS specifics and by month and by good product, old product, in between product. But what I would tell you, as I mentioned earlier, when we look at POS and shipments, because of timing and promotional programs, we tend to like to look at it on a year-to-date basis. And again, I would tell you that our shipments and POS are pretty well balanced, and we've gone through about 50% of the POS here in toys. And we had the next 50% ahead of us in the fourth quarter. So we like where we are. We've said we've got some positive momentum at Barbie international, we like that. We know that there's still soft POS in the U.S. In the U.S. we're addressing that through more space, better merchandising, some solid promotional tie-ins with our retail partners. We have 2 movies, A Pony Tale launches on October 22. That should be a terrific movie with a camper and a terrific remote-controlled horse that I know that girls are going to love around the world. So we're all about execution on Barbie in the fourth quarter, and we'll see where we end up. And again, we know that the big challenge is here in the U.S. The other question I think really talkies about our doll portfolio. And we like where we are in our doll portfolio. We have the leading brands of dolls between Barbie and American Girl and Monster High and Disney Princess. And obviously, with launching Ever After High, we have high hopes that, that, too, will become a solid success. And as we think about that portfolio, obviously, just as you manage your portfolios, we want the portfolio to grow, and we would like for all brands within that portfolio to grow. But as you look at the impact of new initiatives on the sales of other brands, we know that, that -- they have impact. If I pick on Monster High, for example, to try to get more specific to your question, we're still seeing the Monster High consumer base grow. We think that's very good, as that consumer base grows. It's obviously going to have some impact on other brands in the doll category, including in our own category. So we think Monster High, we can plan on that to continue to grow. We're in a solid place for the fourth quarter. And as we look at the other brands, as we said, particularly and, I guess, I'll answer this question expecting it to come up, as it relates to the impact on Barbie, again, as that base grows, we know it's having some impact on Barbie, but it's just really hard to quantify what the impact is on Barbie or other doll brands. In the case of Barbie, it's pretty simple. The Barbie business, whether you look at it on a Q3 basis or year-to-date basis for 2013, is larger than it was in 2010, which was, as you'll recall, the base year for the Monster High launch. So Barbie is bigger than she was with Monster High launch. Monster High is huge. Monster High is driving the category. So we are pleased to have the top 4 brands. And we love all 4, and hope we have a fifth one to love with Ever After High.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And it sounds like, Bryan, you're not too concerned that as Monster High growth rate starts to slow, but again, still growing, you're not too concerned about the Girls business on a go-forward basis?","Bryan G. Stockton","Well, I would tell you, Tim, that we feel there's still opportunity for Monster High to continue to grow. And what's driving that is, again, we see more growth in that base. And it's such a fantastic property to create new stories and new characters, so we like that. Ever After High is just launching, as I mentioned. It's beginning to take hold in Justice. At Disney, we have Sophia, which is really doing well. We like that a lot. Frozen, the movie launch is quite late to have a lot of impact on this year, but we think Frozen, like, as you'll recall the Tangled movie, should have some positive impact on us in the following year for us, 2014. And then there's American Girl, and we don't talk a lot about American Girl, but we sure love it. It's a $600 million business. It's growing strong double-digits. We have another store opening in Palo Alto here in a few weeks. And the growth in that brand is strong across the portfolio, whether it's portfolio of dolls or portfolio of locations or portfolio of channels. So we feel really quite positive about our Girls business.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Kelter with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I guess, first thing, there's a pretty big delta right now between your sell in and your sell through in the U.S. And you've touched on a few things, but I was hoping you could maybe walk us through the drivers of the delta in a little more detail?","Bryan G. Stockton","Sure, would love to do that. We really think about a handful of things, as we look at how our shipments and POS and inventory are shaping up. As I mentioned, we -- as we look at our POS and shipments, we believe we're pretty well aligned across brands and across countries, again, as you look at them on a year-to-date basis. And we think that's probably the most reflective way to look at our POS and shipments. And we feel good about that even in the face of retailers managing inventory quite closely. And as you know, when they do that, they tend to buy what's selling, and that's why we feel pretty good. They're buying what our POS is driving, and that's why we feel pretty good about that alignment. Again, our inventory is down at retail, about single -- mid-single digits. Our inventory is down, we like that. And I think another thing that we think about with Q3, as I mentioned, we had a number of new launches. And when you look at those new launches, they're having an impact as we begin to gain more space and get these products on the shelf at retail. So we like the early signs of success on these new launches. So I would say that's kind of a handful of things, as we think about why we feel pretty good about the balance of the shipments in POS, why we're -- we believe, we're well positioned at the end of the third quarter to execute well in the fourth.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then kind of a related question, I mean, you said on the -- U.S. POS is down roughly mid-singles year-to-date. And as I understand it, it's actually decelerated as the year has unfolded and maybe a little lower than that now. And it sounds like on the call, it sounds like you're treating it as business as usual, whereas I'd have expected a major sense of urgency to turn things around. And so I guess my question is what are you doing to adapt and adjust to what's going on in POS? Are you stepping up trade spend heading into Christmas? Are you reducing orders from some of the manufacturers you use in China? Are you pulling back on discretionary expenses? Are you doing things differently? Or you just kind of have faith things will come in, in the end?","Bryan G. Stockton","Well, I would probably argue with your premise that our POS is decelerating. We're a global business, and we sell toys all around the world, not just in the U.S. And the U.S. is only about 1\/4 of the world's toy market. It's about half of our sales. So as we look at our POS, we tend to look at it globally, not just with the U.S. The second thing I would say in terms of why we feel good about the fourth quarter is if you look at the shelf space gains we have, and this is a U.S. comment as well as an international comment. The level of support we're getting from retailers, if you look at the, I'll call it, the informal ratings of our products that we get on all the hot toy lists, and as I mentioned in my comments, we have 80 products on different lists from around the world. You look at the quality of the marketing efforts that we're putting in. The advertising is across the board, better than it was last year. Our spending levels are quite strong, including in the U.S. So I think we're well positioned to execute well in the fourth quarter. And again, we've said the POS is a little softer than we'd like in the U.S., but we have 50% of the industry and us ahead in POS. And the fourth quarter is what this business is all about. And I, frankly, think we execute as well, if not better, than anyone else in the industry.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then just kind of a quick one here. Have you seen any impact to the industry or yourselves from the recent government stalemate? And I asked -- Wal-Mart maid some comments yesterday at their Analyst Day about seeing an impact to consumers. They weren't specific to toys at all, but as the largest toy company in the world, hoping to get your read on things.","Bryan G. Stockton","Well, it's difficult to say. If you watch television, you're not sure if you should be happy or sad. It depends on which 5-minute segment of what network you're watching. But what we would say is the toy industry has been pretty resilient, if you look at the challenges over the last 5 to 6 years. Recall in the fourth quarter of 2008, the wheels came off the bus, particularly in the U.S. In 2009, it happened in Europe. And as we always take a look at, every year, there's always something that happens in the industry. Hurricanes, dock strikes, U.S. politics, and we always seem to get through it. But again, if there's a short-term issue with U.S. politics, hopefully -- I think most Americans hope that will get taken care of, and we can get back to business. But this is a pretty resilient industry. And one thing we've learned, and I've been in this business 13 years and many of you have covered it a lot more than that, Christmas always comes on December 25. And there's always toys under the tree for kids. And we're proud of the fact that there are always more Mattel toys under trees around the world than any other company.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And last thing, can you just maybe talk us through the key sales drivers, not for Christmas or the next couple months, but for 2014 and '15, either movies or other things we should be thinking about that are going to help propel you forward?","Bryan G. Stockton","Well, sure. I think if you think about what we've been talking about, the first thing we love is our core businesses. And I'll start with Barbie and Fisher-Price. Those 2 businesses, we've been talking about, trying to make some progress on them for '14. We expect to make more progress on that. Our doll portfolio is, really, I think, one of our key strengths. We have the top 4 brands in the world in dolls, all are performing well. We're launching a fifth with Ever After High. So we like where we are with that. With Max Steel, we have some new launches with that going on. But from an entertainment standpoint, we have a number of things going on with Planes, and again, what I would call the post-year effect of Frozen. But we'll review this in a lot more detail at our Analyst Meeting, which we hope we'll see you at in a couple weeks. But we feel quite positive about the '14 and the opportunities to grow.","Operator","Our next question comes from Linda Bolton-Weiser with B. Riley.","Linda Bolton-Weiser - B. Riley Caris, Research Division","I was wondering, in the Fisher-Price business, you had mentioned that there was some exit of some low-profitability areas. I wonder if that could be quantified? Does that make a material impact, causing some of that 3% decline in the core Fisher-Price? Or is it just too small to measure? And then my second question is on Max Steel. Maybe I'm just reading too much into your comments, but it just sounded like you were a little muted on your initial commentary about Max Steel. Is it just too early? Or is it getting a maybe slower start than you had thought? Or can -- maybe you could give just a little more color on Max Steel?","Bryan G. Stockton","Sure, I'd love to comment on both. On Fisher-Price, we've had a number of categories and products, and I'll pick on one as an example. For example, Grow To Pro, which has been a number of outdoor toys that haven't really been as attractive as perhaps we'd like. And we're really trying to focus our toy line on Fisher-Price on 2 things: things that support the developmental nature of the brand and the advertising; and frankly, things that are attractive from a gross margin standpoint. So I'm not going to get into quantifying how much it is. But I think if you look at the Fisher-Price display this year versus the Fisher-Price display in past year, you would notice that we've got a more focused line and a line that better reflects what we're doing with Fisher-Price. On Max Steel, I wouldn't say I'm muted. I would just say we recognize the fact that this is a television property. It's not a movie property. As you know, movie properties tend to have a big bang, and then they kind of disappear. And we're essentially using the same formula outside of Latin America that we built this brand within Latin America, which is with, I would say, more ongoing support, whether it's promotional support or DVDs, et cetera. We like what we see with Max Steel in Latin America at the moment, the engagement of boys with the brand is quite strong. Again, the new product is just hitting shelves there, so it's a little too early to make a call. But I recall the POS, quite encouraging in Latin America. So we think all the work we've put into Max Steel at minimum is going to help make us a stronger and better business in Latin America. Outside of Latin America, when you look at other countries like the U.S. and Europe, for example, where we have pretty strong content placement, we see, I would say, brand engagement, what looks like the early days of Latin America, and we like that. Product is just getting to the shelves, and I think we'll have a good year, but it's not going to be movie-like. And then, frankly, we have some markets, and I'll mention the U.S. as an example, where we have some more work to do, in terms of content. We've been working very hard with Disney, for example, to strengthen the availability of Max, and it's been recently stripped on Disney XD, so we like that. But again, with Max Steel, like we did in Latin America, it's not any one thing. It's a number of engagement points with Max Steel. So we like where we are. We've never said it's going to be a big-bang movie. It's going to be a slow build. And that's what built that business to be the #1 action figure brand in Latin America, and that's what we like.","Operator","And our final question comes from Drew Crum with Stifel.","Andrew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Bryan, I wonder if you could comment on your expectations for Ever After High as you sell it into retailers and what their plans are as far as placement? Is your expectation to grow the fashion doll category with this? Or do you cannibalize against some of the other properties? I wonder if you could comment on that. And then on the Fisher-Price side, how far along are you in terms of shipping Thomas Wood globally, as well as Mike the Knight?","Bryan G. Stockton","Sure. Let me start with Ever After High. I'm going to go back to the comment I made earlier about our doll portfolio. And we work very hard, as you would expect, being the leading doll company in the world to understand what girls are doing and where whitespace exist. And we've talked about sort of the key insight on Ever After High being that girls wanted to sort of rewrite their history. They don't want to feel like their lives are preprogrammed for them. So it's a different play pattern. It's a different mindset than things like Monster High. And that's why we are believing that this could be potentially incremental. Again, we want to grow all of our brands in the doll portfolio, whether it's Barbie or Disney Princess or Monster High or American Girl, and now, Ever After High. So that's the objective. We look for whitespace and try to fill it. Now as it relates to, and as I mentioned before, when we have a new launch, it's hard to imagine these new launches not having an impact on the sales on some of our other brands. But we really think about this as a portfolio. We want to grow the portfolio. Ideally, we like to have all brands grow. But there could be, at any a given moment, some movement of sales between brands. But we like where we've been. The doll portfolio has been growing for 16 consecutive quarters, and we like that quite a lot. And the category has been growing high-single to low-double digits in most of the world. So I would say, as we think about our doll portfolio, the strategy is working, and we want to keep working the strategy. As it relates to Fisher-Price, and specifically, on Thomas and on Mike the Knight, we launched Thomas Wood back in January. And this is an interesting one for us, because it's a good product for both mass and specialty. And we've had a good reception from retailers on both. We like it a lot. It's what we call the entry point into the brand, because moms love the wooden toy, and it's a great way for kids to play with Thomas. So I'm not going to get in the specifics of Wood, but we really like where we are. And we think it's a great opportunity to grow the brand. And Wood, in particular, in international, because Wood is, I would say, highly concentrated in the U.S. and a handful of other markets. And as we expand the Thomas brand, you're probably tired of me talking about the great work we've done with Televisa in Mexico. But as we extend and expand the content and availability, wood will continue to grow globally, as well as the plastic and diecast pieces as well. And on Mike the Knight, we like where that brand is going. Again, it's all about content placement, and the toys will follow. So we're happy with Thomas. There's a lot of opportunity, whether it's in China and Asia or Brazil and Mexico and Latin America or Russia, in Europe. We think there's a lot of opportunity.","Drew Vollero","Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to hand the conference over to your host, VP of Investor Relations David Zbojniewicz. Sir, please go ahead.","David Zbojniewicz","Thank you, operator, and good afternoon everyone. Joining me today are Ynon Kreiz, Mattel's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Richard Dickson, Mattel's President and Chief Operating Officer; and Joe Euteneuer, Mattel's Chief Financial Officer. As you know, this afternoon, we reported Mattel's 2019 full year and fourth-quarter financial results. We will begin today's call with Ynon and Joe providing commentary on our results and then we will provide time for Ynon, Richard and Joe to take your questions.","To help guide our discussion today, we have provided you with slide presentation. Our discussion, slide presentation and earnings release referenced non-GAAP financial measures, including gross sales, adjusted gross profit and adjusted gross margin, adjusted other selling and administrative expenses, adjusted operating income and loss, adjusted earnings and loss per share, earnings before interest, depreciation and amortization or EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow and constant currency. Please note that the sales figures reference on this call will be stated in constant currency.","The information required by regulation G regarding non-GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release and slide presentation, and both documents are available in the Investor Section of our corporate website corporate.mattel.com.","Before we begin, I like to remind you that certain statements made during the call, may include forward-looking statements related to the future performance of our business, brands and product lines. These statements are based on currently available information and they're subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.","We described some of these uncertainties in the Risk Factor section of our amended 2018 annual report on Form 10-K. Our 2019 quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, our earnings release and the presentation accompanying this call and other filings we make with the SEC from time to time, as well as in our other public statements. Mattel does not update forward-looking statements and expressly disclaims any obligation to do so except as required by law.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Ynon.","Ynon Kreiz","Thank you everyone for joining Mattel's fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings call. Our results reflect significant improvement across the business as we continued to make consistent meaningful progress on our strategy to transform Mattel into an IP-driven high-performing toy company.","We remain focused on execution and are well on our way to achieve our goals, to restore profitability and regain top line growth in the short-to-mid term and are on track to capture the full value of our IP in the mid-to-long term. Mattel exceeded its 2019 guidance significantly improving profitability and stabilizing the top line, a major accomplishment after five years of revenue decline. Key highlights of the 2019 full-year financial performance compared to last year include the following.","Gross sales were flat as reported, including a negative $92 million foreign exchange impact, and up 2% in constant currency. Adjusted gross margin was 44.9% a 480 basis points improvement. Adjusted SG&A was reduced by $86 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $453 million, an increase of $253 million, or 126%. Adjusted EPS improved by $0.85.","Operating cash flow was a $181 million, an improvement of $208 million, and we achieved positive free cash flow for the first time in three years, an improvement of $244 million. In addition to the strong financial performance, we made significant progress in reshaping our operations and strengthening the balance sheet. We successfully completed the structural simplification program and reached $875 million of run rate savings exiting the year, exceeding our savings target by $225 million.","As part of the capital light program, in 2019, we closed three owned plants in Mexico, China and Indonesia; and we recently announced the closure of our manufacturing operations in Canada by the end of 2020. In addition, we refinanced our next two debt maturities, improving our near to medium term liquidity in giving us additional financial flexibility. Looking at full year gross sales in constant currency, we grew in five of the six categories where we operate. These include dolls and vehicles where we are a global leader as well as Action Figures, Building Sets and Games where we are a challenger.","And while our Infant, Toddler and Preschool category was down, we stabilized the largest component of the category Fisher-Price Core. We also performed well in the fourth quarter and grew in four of the six categories. As expected, gross sales were down 3% as reported including a negative $12 million foreign exchange impact and down 2% in constant currency. From the perspective of our three operating segments, we increased full year gross sales in constant currency in both North America and International, while the American Girl segment declined as expected.","The latest market share data demonstrates Mattel's strong top line performance across the breadth of our categories and operating segments. According to NPD, Mattel remained the number one global toy company in 2019. We outperformed the industry and increased global market share in the all important fourth quarter. This speaks to the power of our brand portfolio, product innovation and global commercial execution.","Moving to 2019 category performance, dolls sales declined 5% in the fourth quarter but ended the full year up 2%. The fourth quarter decline was primarily driven by American Girl. Barbie continued to demonstrate its resonance with consumers and its competitive edge and grew 3% in the quarter, making it the ninth consecutive quarter of growth. For the year, Barbie sales grew 9% to $1.2 billion, achieving the highest full year gross sales in the last six years.","Barbie continues to perform very well with almost all product lines showing growth versus last quarter and last year. As expected, American Girl declined in the quarter and the year albeit at a slower rate than in 2018. We continued to execute on the key pillars of the brand transformation strategy, which includes evolving American Girls website into a digital flagship, creating unique and ownable retail experiences at the flagship retail locations, developing more robust product line architecture, and implementing a revised content strategy.","We look forward to sharing more detail on the American Girl strategy next week in New York at Toy Fair. The Infant, Toddler and Preschool category was down 9% in the quarter and 10% for the year, primarily due to the decline of Fisher-Price Friends. Fisher-Price and Thomas & Friends was down 3% in the quarter and for the full year, a significant improvement from last year's 13% decline. We saw continued improvements and stabilization of Fisher-Price Core, which was flat in the quarter versus a decline of 12% in the same period last year, and was down less than 1% for the year versus a decline of 10% in 2018.","In North America, Fisher-Price core grew by 2% in the fourth quarter and was flat for the year. We achieved this positive momentum, thanks to the success of new innovative product lines and key marketing initiatives such as the Let's Be Kids brand campaign that has been very well received. As expected, Thomas & Friends continued to be challenged. The brand celebrates its 75th anniversary this year and we strongly believe in this multi-generational franchise and its value as a global IP. We are actively working to simplify the product range, as we step up the turnaround initiatives.","The vehicles category continued to grow and was up 1% in the quarter and 6% for the year. Global sales were driven by another record year for Hot Wheels, which eclipsed its prior all time high in 2018, when we celebrated the 50th anniversary. Hot Wheels sales were up 8% in the quarter and 14% for the year. Growth was driven by multiple product lines, including basic cars and our new Monster Truck line, which had a strong inaugural launch year.","Matchbox also grew in the quarter and the year, as we continue to build out the vehicles portfolio. It's worth noting that Matchbox was recently inducted into the national authority hall of fame. Overall, Vehicles category growth was partially offset by the expected declines of this is cars and universal Jurassic world vehicles post the movie launch years.","Action Figures, Building Sets and Games are challenger categories together grew 10% in the quarter and an impressive 15% for the year. Each of the three categories finished up double-digits for the year. Actions figures did very well driven by Toy Story 4. Mattel's innovative product line and partnership with Disney's Pixar led Toy Story to finish the year as the number two industry growth property in 2019 per NPD.","The Jurassic World line went down in a non-movie year continues to perform and is establishing itself as the year round evergreen Dinosaur Line in the toy aisle. Building sets delivered another strong quarter and growth year. The MEGA turnaround plan is working with a combination of product innovation, competitive pricing, and expansion of global retail distribution.","Games continued its strong growth with shows up double digits both for the quarter and for the full year. 2019 mark the fifth consecutive year of worldwide growth and the sixth consecutive year of growth in North America. Globally UNO finish the year as the number one card game property and the number one growth card game property per NPD. The UNO mobile app has more than 85 million downloads since it's launched a year ago and over 1 million daily players.","Beyond the financial performance, we are proud that our product innovation has been recognized by the industry. Barbie was named marketer of the year by Ad Age and Creatable World was named as one of Time Magazine's best inventions of 2019. We also received 12 prestigious toys of the year award nominations from the Toy Association. This marks the highest number of nominations for the Company ever and demonstrates that Mattel continues to lead the industry in pushing the boundaries with compelling toys and experiences that will bring to the market.","Moving into operating segment performance, we delivered strong results in both North America and International, with growth in every region compared to 2018, where North America declined 1% in the fourth quarter it grew 1% for the full year and international was flat in the fourth quarter and grew 6% for the full year.","North America performed well considering the competitive landscape, especially in the holiday season. According to NPD, Mattel gained market share overall an online in the fourth quarter and remain the number one toy company in the U.S. for 26 consecutive years.","EMEA our largest international region continued to perform exceptionally well and outpace the industry while European retail in general continues to face challenges. Our sales increased 2% in the quarter and 8% for the full year. According to NPD, Mattel gained share in Europe in both the fourth quarter and the full year.","Latin America sales were off slightly for the quarter down 1% and up 5% for the year. We gained share and maintained our number one leadership position for the fourth consecutive year according to NPD.","Asia Pacific was down 1% in the quarter and up 3% for the year. We continue to make progress in China and across the region. We are seeing promising momentum in Australia, one of our key Asia Pacific markets where we gain market share for the full year according to NPD.","As part of how we think about the future, we have been designing and restructuring an organization that is flexible, dynamic, and better able to respond to changing market conditions and exogenous factors that affect Mattel as well as the industry as a whole.","With that in mind, in addition to the strong commercial performance in 2019 we have continued to make significant progress in reshaping and upgrading our operations. The structure simplification program has been a resounding success, significantly outperforming our original targets. But before my concluded the program at the end of 2019 its benefits will have a lasting impact on our business.","Taking a look at what we achieved in less than two years. We delivered over $875 million in run rate savings, $225 million, or 35% more than our original targets. We reduced non-manufacturing workforce by 29%. We cut capital expenditures by more than 60% from $297 million to $116 million, which was our lowest level of CapEx in more than nine years. But we still made strategic investments of more than $150 million in the period.","We made transformative improvements in our supply chain, including the implementation of an automated online ordering system, optimizing minimum or the fun it is, and using new predictive algorithms to improve demand and supply forecasting. We have also made progress towards reducing complexity in the system and eliminating unproductive SKU's. We expect a 30% SKU reduction by the end of the year.","As a result, over the two years Structural Simplification period, adjusted gross margin improved 710 basis points to 44.9%, adjusted operating income improved by $359 million, adjusted EBITDA increased by $327 million, adjusted EPS improved by $0.90, cash flow from operations improved by $209 million, and free cash flow improved by $389 million. We also continue to make strong progress in 2019 or now mid-to-long term strategy to capture the full value of our IP.","During the year, we announced five additional theatrical films and now have a total of eight movies in development in partnership with major studios, highly regarded talent and leading industry players. These are Barbie and Hot Wheels with Warner Brothers, View-Master and American girls with MGM, Magic 8-Ball with Blumhouse, Barney with 59% and Valparaiso Pictures, Major Matt Mason with Paramount, Tom Hanks and Akiva Goldsman; and Masters of the Universe with Sony and an additional partner as part of a new structure, we will share more details in the coming weeks.","In the fourth quarter, we announced a second animated adventure series with Netflix, He-Man and the Masters of the Universe. This is in addition to the previously announced series Masters of the Universe Revelation. And today, we're happy to announce the Thomas & Friends children series will be available on Netflix in the United States starting this March. In the coming quarters, we expect to announce additional film and television projects in line with our strategy.","We also recognized our responsibility to be a global corporate citizen and positive environmental stewards, which is a priority for the entire organization. Last spring, we established an environmental sustainability council dedicated to actively advancing our sustainability efforts in several areas, including materials innovation. In late 2019, we announced a new sustainability goal to achieve 100% recycled, recyclable or bio-based plastics materials in both product and packaging by 2030.","We are already making progress towards this goal, we recently announced two lines of Mattel's iconic products, Fisher-Price, Rocket Stack and three Preschool building sets by MEGA Blocks, all made from sugar cane based plastics and packaged in 100% recycled or sustainably source material. Expect more to come in this area.","In closing while we continue to make strong progress in restoring profitability, this was also an important year in terms of sales performance. We managed to deliver top line momentum, maintain our global leadership position for the full year and increase our market share in the fourth and fourth quarter.","We have achieved this with a 29% smaller workforce while reducing capital expenditures by more than 60% compared to where we were less than two years ago. This is a major accomplishment and speaks to our renewed operational excellence, the quality of our assets and the resilience of the organization.","Before I turn the call over to Joe, I would like to briefly comment on the coronavirus. As you're aware, the situation remains Floyd and we're monitoring any developments closely, thoughts are we those affected and we're taking all necessary actions to protect the health and safety of our team around the world.","With that Joe will now cover the financials in more detail and provide guidance for 2020.","Joe Euteneuer","Thank you, Ynon, and good afternoon everyone. I would like to provide more detail on the fourth quarter results and summarize the full year performance before moving on to our 2020 full year guidance.","As Ynon said we did very well in 2019 and exceeded our guidance significantly improving profitability and stabilizing the top line. We performed well in the fourth quarter and grew market share in this highly competitive period. For the year gross sales were flat as reported and up 2% in constant currency and as expected gross sales for the quarter were down 3% as reported and down 2% in constant currency.","Turning to POS, excluding TRU for both the quarter and full year, total Mattel worldwide POS was flat. To give you a little more color on POS for our power brands, I'd like to share the following highlights. Barbie POS was up high single digits in the quarter and double digits for the year. In North America, Barbie POS was up low single digits in the quarter and up high single digits for the year.","Meanwhile, internationally Barbie POS was up double digits in the quarter and up double digits for the year. This marked the 15th consecutive quarter of international POS growth for Barbie. Hot Wheels global POS was up double digits in the quarter and up high single digits in the year. In North America, Hot Wheels POS was up double digits in the quarter and up mid single digits for the year.","Internationally, Hot Wheels POS was up double digits in the quarter and up double digits for the year. This marked more than 15 consecutive quarters of international POS growth for Hot Wheels. Fisher-Price core global POS was flat in the quarter and down high single digits for the year. In North America, Fisher-Price core POS was up low-single digits in the quarter and down high-single digits for the year. We are encouraged by the improved performance in the fourth quarter compared to the first three quarters. And internationally Fisher-Price core POS was down low-single digits in the quarter and down mid-single digits for the year.","Moving on to retail inventory, compared to the prior year, retail inventories were higher. We expect this could have up to a mid-single digit impact to our first quarter sales. We believe that this inventory consists of healthy carry forward product. The expected impact to the first quarter sales has been reflected in our full year revenue guidance that we will talk about shortly. Fourth quarter reported gross margin was 48.4% of net sales, an increase of 180 basis points versus the prior year.","Adjusted gross margin was 48.9% of net sales, an increase of 230 basis points versus the prior year. For the full year, reported gross margin was 44%, an increase of 420 basis points versus the prior year. Adjusted gross margin was 44.9%, an increase of 480 basis points versus the prior year. These significant improvements in reported and adjusted gross margin for the quarter and full year are directly attributable to Structural Simplification and accelerated savings from capital light, partially offset by product cost inflation.","Moving onto advertising, fourth quarter advertising expenses totaled $227 million or 15.4% of net sales. This compares to 13.5% in the year ago period. The year-over-year increase was due to strategic advertising investments in the quarter, as we discussed on the third quarter call. For the full year, advertising expenses were $552 million, or 12.2% of net sales in line with our guidance. Reported SG&A for the quarter was $418 million, an increase of $20 million versus the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by a $26 million asset impairment charge and higher merit expenses, partially offset by Structural Simplification savings.","The asset impairment was a non-cash charge related to the continued declining performance of our American Girl retail stores albeit at a slower rate of decline. We also incurred an additional $3 million of expenses associated with the inclined sleeper product recalls in the quarter. For the year, we incurred $10 million of recall related expenses in SG&A and a total of $38 million across the P&L, before taking into consideration the $30 million to $35 million of revenue reduction.","Adjusted SG&A for the quarter was $384 million, a decrease of $9 million versus the year ago period. Structural Simplification savings were partially offset by higher merit and other in period expenses. For the year, reported SG&A was $1.4 billion, a $119 million decrease versus the prior year. The decrease was driven by Structural Simplification savings, lower severance and restructuring expenses, and the absence of the 2018 TRU liquidation. These were partially offset by higher incentive and merit expenses, asset impairment charges, and recall related expenses.","Adjusted SG&A for the year was $1.3 billion, a decrease of $86 million versus the prior year. Similar to the fourth quarter, Structural Simplification savings and the absence of the 2018 TRU liquidation were partially offset by higher incentive and merit expenses and other in period expenses. For the quarter, reported operating income was $68 million, a decrease of $38 million versus the prior year. This decrease was due to lower sales and higher advertising and SG&A expenses partially offset by gross margin improvements.","Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $109 million, a decrease of $2 million versus the prior year due to lower sales and higher advertising expenses, partially offset by gross margin improvements and lower SG&A expenses; and for the full year reported operating income improved by $274 million to $39 million compared to last year's reported operating loss of $234 million.","Adjusted operating income for the full year improved by $269 million to $156 million compared to last year's adjusted operating loss of $113 million. For the year, the increases has been reported and adjusted operating income were primarily driven by higher gross margin and lower SG&A expenses, partially offset by higher advertising expense. For the quarter, adjusted EBITDA was $185 million flat to the prior year.","Structural Simplification and capital light savings were offset by higher strategic investments, lower scales, product costs inflation and other SG&A expenses. For the full year, adjusted EBITDA was $453 million. A significant improvement more than doubling last year's adjusted EBITDA of $200 million. Structural Simplification and capitalized savings and the absence of the 2018 TRU liquidation were partially offset by product cost deflation, strategic investments, higher incentive compensation and merit expenses.","Moving to taxes, last year, we discussed the challenge and estimating our full year tax expense, given the changes in the U.S. and global tax laws and the impact of valuation allowances primarily against U.S. deferred tax assets. In 2019, we benefited from favorable discreet one-time tax items including the release of foreign valuation allowances and the reassessment of certain tax liabilities.","As a result, our 2019 tax provision was much lower than anticipated with $9 million booked in the quarter and $55 million booked for the year. Please note that going forward our overall effective tax rate may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to the level and mix of income or losses in our foreign jurisdictions and due to the full valuation allowance on our U S deferred tax assets.","In terms of cash flow and balance sheet as Ynon said the main highlight for the year is that we achieve positive free cash flow for the first time since 2016, improving by $244 million versus the prior year. Operating cash also ended the year positive, finishing at $181 million or an improvement of $208 million.","Additionally, net accounts receivable held steady at 57 days sales outstanding, which is flat versus last year. Owned inventory continued to decrease down $47 million versus the prior year. We continue to work to optimize inventory levels with our retail partners. And capital expenditures, which totaled the $116 million for the year, decreased 24% compared to $152 million last year, primarily as a result of reduced tooling costs. These savings were achieved while still investing in the business.","We ended the quarter with no short-term borrowings under our ABL credit facility, and finally our previously announced refinancing of our two debt maturities and the extension of our ABL maturity date, significantly improved our near-term liquidity giving us additional financial flexibility going forward. Our next step maturity is now not until 2023. The primary reason for our significant improvement and profitability has been the success of our Structural Simplification program, and while we have concluded the program.","We will continue to make progress and reshaping our operations and benefit from the run rate savings realized to date and going forward. For the year, we realized $366 million of P&L savings with $333 million of debt reflected in our adjusted EBITDA. Over the two year program, we delivered $875 million in run rate savings, $225 million more than our original goal and $21 million more than the $854 million of run rate savings, we reported on our third quarter call.","In 2019, we accelerated the execution of a portion of the capital light program and realized $15 million of savings in the 2019 P&L. We will continue to share key developments as they are executed subject to competitive and confidentiality considerations. In the fourth quarter, we continue to make strategic investments to grow the business and improve future profitability. For the full year, we invested $88 million of which $63 million or 73% impacted operating expenses with the remainder as CapEx.","Investments in the quarter were primarily related to advertising investments and IT transformation initiatives. Over the two year program, we invested $151 million out of a target of $170 million on strategic investments. This was approximately split 35% on IT investments, 15% on digital advertising, 15% on local business investments and the remaining 35% on other investments such as product innovation and content development.","Closing out my 2019 remarks, it is clear that we've made substantial progress across all key financial metrics, and we expect this momentum to continue into 2020. Before we move on to 2020 guidance, given the dynamic circumstances of the coronavirus, please note that the guidance we are going to share with you today excludes any potential impact of the coronavirus on our results.","Now turning to our 2020 guidance, for the full year, we expect gross sales as reported to grow 1% to 2.5% including a minor foreign exchange impact, margins to expand as we continue to reshape our operations and benefit from our Structural Simplification and capital light programs, adjusted EBITDA to grow to an expected range of $575 million to $600 million, and operating and free cash flow to continue to grow along with our cash balance.","Let me provide some more detail on our 2020 guidance assumptions. The 1% to 2.5% sales increase is driven primarily by mid single digit growth in our own brands, partially offset by declines in licensed brands. At a higher level, our category assumptions in constant currency are as follows. We expect continued growth in the Dolls category, driven primarily by Barbie as the brand continues to innovate and build momentum globally coming off the 60th anniversary.","We are planning to expand the rest of our Doll portfolio with a number of new offerings throughout the year. The growth in the category is forecasted to be partially offset by American Girl. We are looking to reduce the rate of revenue decline at American Girl in 2020 as we continue to turn the business around. We expect continued growth in the vehicles category driven primarily by hot wheels, momentum as well as matchbox, which should benefit from this year's Top Gun Maverick, Die-Cast license.","The growth in the category is projected to be partially offset by declines in entertainment licenses. We expect the Infant, Toddler and Preschool category to be down slightly versus the prior year Fisher-Price Thomas and Friends is forecasted to be up driven by growth in Fisher-Price core, the largest component of the entire category. This is expected to be partially offset by a smaller decline in Thomas.","Fisher-Price Friends is planned to continue to decline as we choose to exit underperforming licenses within the portfolio, and we expect our combined Action Figures, Building Sets and games categories to be down slightly. We anticipate Action Figures to be down as a result of Toy Story 4, moving further away from its theatrical release and the end of our DC Action Figure license, offset partially by growth from Minions and Minecraft.","We expect to see solid growth in Building Sets as we continue to refine and innovate the line architecture, optimize pricing and continue to expand our global retail distribution. Game is forecasted to be up as we innovate and introduce new games and continue to leverage our existing portfolio. And finally, we will be launching our plush business within this challenger category with licenses for Minions, Disney, Pixar, and Star Wars, including the much anticipated Baby Yoda.","Turning to the rest of the P&L, sales adjustments are forecast to be in line with the prior year on a percentage basis. We expect adjusted gross margin for the full year to be 150 to 200 basis points higher than the full year of 2019. This improvement will be driven primarily by realization of the remaining run rate savings from our Structural Simplification program and incremental savings from our capital light program as well as a reduction royalty expenses.","These benefits will be partially offset by product cost inflation of about a 100 basis points and the negative impact of foreign exchange. Advertising expenses are expected to be flat as a percentage of net sales versus the prior year and within our normalized range of 11% to 13% Adjusted SG&A is projected to be lower year-over-year by approximately $30 million to $50 million.","The primary drivers of the year-over-year improvement are the realization of the remaining run rate savings from our Structural Simplification program, as well as lower planned incentive compensation. As we reset our operational performance targets for 2020 these favorable impacts will be partially offset by annual merit and benefit increases, along with general inflation.","With expected revenue growth, margin expansion, and lower SG&A expenses, we forecast adjusted operating income for the full year to significantly improve versus the prior year. Looking below operating income, we expect interest expense to be relatively flat to 2019. Tax expense for the year is expected to be approximately $75 million to $100 million, reflecting better operational performance and assuming no discrete tax items compared to 2019.","In order to help build your as reported models, let me provide the following information. Depreciation and amortization is expected to decrease as a result of our Structural Simplification and capitalized efforts over the past few years. Share-based compensation is also expected to decrease to approximately $50 million.","Severance and restructuring expenses are planned to be roughly flat at $60 million, as we continue to reshape our operations. Costs related to our 2019 inclined sleeper product recalls will be included in adjustments between EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, which is consistent with last year.","In summary, we expect our adjusted EBITDA to increase from $453 million in 2019 to range of $575 million to $600 million in 2020. The primary drivers are the realization of $92 million of carryover structural simplification savings from 2019, approximately $50 million of capital light savings as well as revenue growth and lower incentive expenses, partially offset by inflation increases, merit expenses and the negative impact of foreign exchange. This marks a significant increase over 2019 and another indication of our commitment to restore profitability.","Turning to the balance sheet and cash flows, capital expenditures are forecasted to be up year-over-year. We expect networking capital to be roughly flat compared to 2019, and we expect operating cash flows to continue to improve and we project a second consecutive year of positive free cash flow. This increasing cash generation will improve our financial standing, including strengthening the balance sheet, improving our leverage ratios and giving us additional financial flexibility.","You should consider the following factors that will impact quarterly phasing of expenses, but will not impact for your guidance, starting with advertising expenses. As a result of a system implementation to track advertising at a greater level of detail during the interim periods, we have improved visibility into the anticipated timing of advertising expense. As a result, we expect to see a moderate shift in advertising expense to the second half of the year from the first half of the year.","Incentive compensation is planned to be lower in 2020. As we have in prior years, we will continue to adjust the incentive accrual each quarter based on our expected performance for the full year. Given our more consistent results in the past few years, this may result in a higher accrual during the first two quarters. As a result, we expect to see an increase in SG&A of approximately $15 million to $20 million in the first and second quarter due to this change but lower overall for the full year.","Additionally, you should consider the following factors that will impact the quarterly phasing of our 1% to 2.5% full year revenue growth. As I mentioned before, the increase in our retail inventories could have up to a mid-single digit impact to our first quarter sales, but the full year impact has already been reflected in our full year revenue guidance. We also have a later theatrical release date for the Minions movie compared to last year's Toy Story 4, which is expected to decline post its theatrical release year.","I want to reiterate that the guidance we just provided excludes any potential business impact of the coronavirus. With that said, here's what we currently know. While consumer sales in China are currently being impacted, given that our in-country revenues represented only 2% of total Mattel revenues in 2019 the potential impact of loss China consumer sales on the Company should be limited.","As it relates to our supply chain while none of our manufacturing is located in the Wuhan province the ability of the manufacturing workforce to return to work after the lunar new year holiday is being impacted by government guidelines. Mattel's factories, and those are third party vendors were originally scheduled to resume production on February 3rd, currently manufacturers are being advised to not resume production until February 17th.","At this point in time, we do expect production delays in Q1, which may impact first quarter results, but remember that historically Q1 is a seasonally small quarter for both production and revenue. We haven't placed a global team that is actively working on contingency plans to mitigate the potential impact to our supply chain, customers and employees.","We are taking steps to minimize this disruption including resourcing priority SKUs, balancing owned inventory across geographies, and optimizing transportation. The full magnitude of the impact of the coronavirus on our full year results will be primarily determined by the duration of the outbreak. We will continue to assess this fluid situation and update you as appropriate.","In closing, in 2019, our methodical execution of our strategy to restore profitability generated significant improvements across key metrics, including margins, operating income, EBITDA and cash flows. Our 2020 guidance reflects a continuation of these improvements. We are extremely pleased with our results to-date and are very proud of the efforts made by the Mattel team.","With that, I'll turn it back over to Ynon.","Ynon Kreiz","Thank you, Joe. In conclusion, 2019 was an important inflection point in our turnaround. We stabilized our top line after five consecutive years of revenue decline, continue to significantly improve profitability and achieved positive free cash flow for the first time in three years. We are very encouraged by the consistent progress the Company is making and expect to continue to build on this momentum.","We remained focused on the execution of our multi-year turnaround strategy to transform Mattel into an IP driven, high-performing toy company and create long term shareholder value. I look forward to seeing many of you next week at New York Toy Fair and sharing additional details on our strategic roadmap going forward.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Michael Ng of Goldman Sachs. Your question please.","Michael Ng","Thank you very much for the question. I just have two. The first is on the $15 million of capital light savings for 2020. Does that just account for the factories that you guys have closed this year including the Canadian factory or do you expect more to come? And then second, just as a bigger picture question, where do you see your mid-to-long term EBIT margins going over the next few years? Thank you.","Joe Euteneur","Sure. In regards to your first question on the factories, the $50 million includes the three factories we've already shut down. There's partial savings from Canada, but the full savings won't happen until 2021 when it's fully shut down. And then on the next one in regards to margins, you see the improvement we made in 2019 getting to basically 45% and talking to you about another 150 basis points to 200 basis points improvement going into 2020, we are on that trend to try to get it up to the high 40's as much as we can. So we've said that consistently, and I think you've seen the progress to date.","Michael Ng","Thank you, Joe.","Ynon Kreiz","And Michael, I would add that we said before that we're looking to restore historical performance levels for the Company. We haven't put a timeline on it, but this is the direction that we're heading towards.","Operator","Your next question comes from Drew Crum of Stifel. Your line is open.","Drew Crum","Just your commentary on retail inventory, any brands or regions you can speak to where you're seeing elevated levels? And then separately, you're making progress with operating cash flow and projecting further improvement for 2020. Can you remind us or discuss what the priorities for use of cash are going forward?","Joe Euteneur","Yes, sure. In regards to retail inventories, we're very comfortable with our retail inventory position given our POS. There's really not any -- we've been -- we have such great partnerships with our retailers that we have all good inventory out there so not really any one pocket. In regards to -- your second question was in regards to investments?","Drew Crum","Uses of cash.","Joe Euteneur","Yes, uses of cash. I mean, look, the big things is we have continued to invest back into the business, full automation. Ynon has mentioned what we've done in supply chain, we've talked to you about what we've done for our designers, global procure to pay things like that. In addition, second thing is we want to continue to try to de-lever the Company and try to get back to investment grade. So, I think, those would be our two primary uses of cash in the short-term.","Operator","The next question comes from Tami Zakaria of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Tami Zakaria","Hi, thanks for taking my question. So my first question is more bigger picture. Could you share your thoughts on the outlook of the U.S. toy industry? And do you think the toy industry can grow in 2020 following a couple of years of this line? And then my second question relates to POS. Could you provide some color on POS trends that you're seeing quarter-to-date maybe for some of your major brands like Barbie and Hot Wheels?","Ynon Kreiz","Yes. Hi, Tami, this is your first call. So welcome. So, our view on the industry is that the fundamentals going forward remain very solid. The industry was down in 2019. There were a few specific factors that impacted the year. The first one happened in the first half where we comp the 2018 Toys \"R\" Us liquidation that drove the first half of '19 down 6%. The third quarter was up, driven primarily by Toy Story, our own toy story and some other hot properties. Fourth quarter was down -was down 3%. And the reason for that, we believe, was driven primarily by the shorter holiday season as well as a smaller number of new big launches.","So, this is really what's impacted 2019. If you look at some of the research out there and to be fair, it's not -- it's as of June or July of last year, so it's not completely current, but [indiscernible] put out a pretty comprehensive study that we refer to. They looked at 32 countries that make about 80% of the global industry. They've done in storage checks, in region analysis, they talk to retailers, to consumers. They look at micro economic data. They have insights for various constituencies and they say, they think that the industry will continue to grow at 4.6% CAGR for the next five years. They did not obviously factor the coronavirus. So, you got to put an asterisk on that, but fundamentally, we believe the industry is in a solid position and we expect it to continue to grow.","Richard Dickson","Tami, this is Richard. Again, welcome to the call. I'll pick up the POS question that you had. You know, overall we outperformed the industry and increased global market share in the fourth quarter. We really were very pleased overall in our portfolio with POS. There were some real stars of course Barbie really had a fantastic year in POS as well as Hot Wheels. These are two of our key brands that have had consistent momentum. But across the board we're feeling consumer takeaway, very strong, very confident in our lineup of 2020, and certainly our performance in '19. So, we look forward to sharing a lot more detail with you strategically and in the gallery where you\u2019ll really see the products coming out for 2020 and we can answer more questions there specifically.","Operator","Next question comes from Arpine Kocharyan of UBS. Your line is open.","Arpine Kocharyan","I have two very quick ones. Could you help me understand, why is inventory at retail up, if shipments were down in Q4 versus POS that was flat? Then I have quick follow-up.","Joe Euteneuer","Sure. So look, first and foremost, our sales were in Q4 as expected as we talked to you about it on the third quarter call. And if you go back Ynon's remark, he discussed the fact that we've made tremendous amount of investments in our supply chain, which leads to better forecasting that better forecasting accuracy has led to our inventory declines. And given the partnerships that we have with our retailers on joint business plans, we believe the inventory levels at retail are at the right levels given the POS that we have to-date.","Arpine Kocharyan","Okay. That actually takes me to my follow up which I think was asked, but I'm going to try to ask it again. Any additional color you could provide on a POS so far into the quarter? And I'm also particularly interested in sort of how you're going to potentially navigate what could be a supply chain disruption in terms of Easter volumes, whether that product is already at your warehouses, or how are you going to navigate that going into -- looking into sort of early April and prior to that obviously cause you need to ship the product prior to that?","Joe Euteneuer","Right. So look, we haven't really given any guidance in regards to how January is doing etcetera. You know at Toy Fair we'll talk to you about strategically. But look, we've had great performance exiting 2019 and we believe 2020 is going to be a good year. In regards to the disruption with the coronavirus, I mean, look, it's still -- it's a wait and see. The 17th is the beginning of next week. We can see a production starts. If it doesn't, then we have - looking for alternative plans. So we just have to give you an update that once we have more information.","Arpine Kocharyan","Okay. And then I have a very, very quick follow-up. I just wanted to look a little bit closer at the top line guidance. I think Toy Story is obviously tougher comps by my calculation, at least about two points of headwind year-over-year. And then you're obviously guiding Fisher-Price will continue to decline, but decline less for the year. Doesn't that mean that you need better than 2% to 3% increase in dolls and vehicles combined to get to around 1% or 2% growth for the year? I guess could you dissect a little bit that math?","Joe Euteneuer","Well, look, I think you're trying to get to the unbundling of it, but remember the own brands that we have, we gave you the guidance that they'd be up mid-single digits. And what that means is what you pointed out, which is on the licensed properties those are the ones that are creating the negative impact. A great example would be Fisher-Price Friends. We've said that we've been exiting some of those non-performing licenses. So if things like that, that's creates a negative drag. But when you look at the own brands, they're delivering solid mid-single digit growth.","Ynon Kreiz","And this is a really important point that our own brands are expected to perform well, mid-single digit growth of our own brand is a very good foundation and we're very happy with that to get started. And I would refer you onto Slide 28 in the deck, we broke out in pretty good detail the various components of the gross sales drivers and we are set well to achieve this in 2020.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Condor of Wells Fargo Securities. Your question please.","Tim Condor","Thank you and gentleman thank you for the more detailed guidance. I think everyone appreciates that and looking forward to the 21. And then maybe a little bit more color on this three or so type of outlook if you would. From that perspective, I want to focus on the capital light. I know again there are sensitivities and negotiating things within governments and a lot of -- a lot of things from that perspective, political things and considerations. But, how should we look or think about where your end game is? In the press release with MEGA, you talked about that some areas, and you've alluded to this before, maybe in die-cast that it makes sense to keep it. Can you kind of maybe buck it a little bit more what you're maybe thinking about keeping and maybe the potential where you see additional EBITDA savings, what that a range or something on that number could be from capital light? And then I have one other follow-up.","Joe Euteneuer","As we said, we're making transformative changes in our supply chain. The concept is to be able -- is to simplify modernized and design a more progressive, more flexible, more adaptive, more mobile, infrastructure. That would allow us to optimize markets conditions and our own requirements.","We do have a plan we're executing towards the plan, as you noted, we haven't disclosed a plan for different reasons, but you can see that the, we are tracking well at this point we have closed or consolidated four plants and more is coming. And with that we also said that some in some cases without being dramatic about things we think of you and in certain situations we would retain certain capabilities that are unique, such as the Hot Wheels factory as one example.","We're not going to be able to share more detail, but you can rest assured that we are making progress you will see more savings, more benefits coming through $50 million already expected based on the actions we already announced in 2020 and there will be more benefits, as we will come our way and you have to bear with us and see the progress in the making.","Tim Conder","Okay. And then maybe back to some of the previous questions on the build for 20 specifically in Dolls owned. Whoever wants to take this, maybe Richard, I don't know, Barbie, how are -- what do you planning with Barbie to go against obviously a great run that Barbie's had here and then of course frozen, I think we'll have a pretty good year in 20, given that it's only kind a came out in Q4. But just any color around that gentleman could be helpful I think for most people?","Richard Dickson","Tim, thank you for asking that question, we are incredibly proud of the work that we've done on Barbie. As you know, this is now going to be our ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth and in fact it's the highest sales number that we've had in six years. So we are confident in the foundational programs that we built for Barbie and are continuing to grow upon strength. This year was a terrific year for Barbie and as you all know, it was one of the most competitive doll years out there.","Certainly entertainment driven and as usual, highly competitive with new doll entries and certainly the customers voted on Barbie. Most our segments performed exceptionally well obviously the diversity and inclusivity from fashion Easter's continues to be an incredibly important pop culture conversation. It's not only generating a lot of purpose but profit, we're incredibly proud of the career segment aspiring girls to be anything they want to be.","And the innovation that we've proven that we can do with Barbie, not only from a marketing perspective but from a product perspective is really being highlighted now. We introduced a new blockbuster item called Color Reveal and it's continuing to generate incredible excitement. So we've got great buzz and great momentum going into 2020 the right way. I'm really excited to show everybody what we're doing in Toy Fair. I hope you'll all be there because we'll expose all of our exciting products and strategic narratives.","Tim Conder","And then just as a little derivative, I apologize, BTS. Any comment on how that did in 2019 for the Company?","Richard Dickson","Yes, BTS was an exciting launch for us. It actually performed well in the context of our expectations if anything, It also proved the speed and nimble reaction that we could have as an organization going after the right pop culture narratives, speed to market with incredibly, exciting looking dolls. We are continuing with BTS as lots of other news that will come down the pike, but we were pleased with BGS and our overall portfolio performance. As we move away from some of the year-over-year comp issues, 2020 is poised for meaningful growth and a great new innovative product pipeline that you'll see in Toy Fair.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Gerrick Johnson of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Gerrick Johnson","Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. Couple of product questions, I guess, for Richard here. First, a couple, I call them where riskier launches were Hot Wheels ID and Creatable World, maybe you can comment on how those performed? And then Baby Yoda, you're very quick to have push available for presale in Disney, shopdisney.com. And I wasn't aware you had a Star Wars plush license. Can you talk about how you executed on that product line?","Richard Dickson","Sure. Gerrick. First let me just take a victory lap share on Hot Wheels. This brand is continuing to perform. 2019 was the biggest Hot Wheels year ever. It's the sixth consecutive year of POS growth both in the U.S. and globally. This is a story of complete innovation both from our marketing and demand creation perspective, as well as product and the digital demand creation evolution that we've had moving more of to linear and from linear to digital has proven incredibly successful.","We've done experiential marketing with the Hot Wheels Legends tour introducing Monster Trucks as a new segment with a live experience will show and a variety of other really exciting narratives for Hot Wheels that has proven incredibly successful. Some of the great new product that we introduced in '19, like Hot Wheels Mario Kart toy line was the biggest new license launch, since Star Wars in 2015, we're going to continue to surprise consumers and all of you with the product that we have lined up that you'll see as we move into Toy Fair for 2020, so lots of really great momentum to build upon for Hot Wheels.","Moving to a Creatable World, which as you know was a really another very big milestone moment for the Company, again, kind of proving our leadership in the doll category. We got over 2.3 billion impressions with the narrative of Creatable World and over 90% of that was positive. We felt really good about the leadership statement that we made with Creatable World and it had pockets of exceeding expectations in some cases and meeting expectations in others. We're continuing to refine and define this new and exciting play pattern and segments and you'll hear a lot more about that as well as we get to Toy Fair.","Last, but certainly not least is the child, which of course we call Baby Yoda. A really thrilling moment for Mattel to be first in the marketplace with this incredibly innovative design, amazing, obviously toy, the speed of which our design development and entire team reacted to the product, working very closely with our partners, proved itself again as Mattel only can do. We're really excited about now with Baby Yoda and the child, but the entire plus category overall, not only with Star Wars, but with other partners that will reveal at toy fair we're really on a roll with it and I can't wait for you to see it when we get there.","Operator","Thank you our next question comes from Linda Weiser of D.A Davidson. Please go ahead.","Linda Weiser","Hi, sorry if I missed it, but did you guys give us specific capital spending guidance number for 2020? And also, even if you were to significantly increase your free cash flow in 2020, it still wouldn't put a very big dent in your sizeable debt load? Is there any group of maybe some smaller brands that are not growing that you would consider divesting to be able to use proceeds to accelerate debt pay down? Thanks.","Joe Euteneuer","So, the answer to your first part of your question, if you go to Page 31 of the deck we sent you, you see that we have capital expenditures and around the $125 million to $150 million range. In regards to properties, we are very confident in our portfolio of IP. And so, we don't think that there's anything right now that would do that. And remember, when you're thinking about our EBITDA debt load, there's two things; one, the cash that we'll be generating, so you'll start being able to do a net debt calculation; and second, the growth of EBIDTA that brings down our leverage ratio.","Ynon Kreiz","Another way, we talked about it before in with every day that goes by, we are improving our profitability and improving our cash position. We're ready drove very significant improvement in leverage ratio. That will continue to get better this year. And as we said before, as it stands, we don't have any debt maturities until March of 2023, and that maturity is $250 million. So, we have a lot of flexibility in the short to midterm, let's call it, and getting on stronger financial footing with every day that goes by.","So, there is no reason to sell any of our assets. These are growth drivers, including the declining properties they're all growth drivers and we're turning them around. Don't forget that just a little over two years ago Barbie was in decline and it's just reached its highest year in revenue off to sit, you know, in the last six years. So we believe we're sitting on a treasure trove of our assets of Greg IP. And this will be part of our success in the mid to long term. So we executing diligently and then we'll see the results in the numbers.","Linda Weiser","Great. And can I just follow-up on the coronavirus issue. Our understanding is that when the workers traveled to the factory locations that they actually do need to be quarantined for two weeks after their arrival date. So is it really two weeks past February 17th that production is going to start? Thanks.","Richard Dickson","To the best of our knowledge in talking with us there that no production would start on the 17th and we only actually have people in the factory, you know, getting things ready, et cetera. So you, you staggered in, so yes right now we're planning on starting on the 17th unless the government puts out another guideline.","Operator","Next question comes from Eric Handler of MKM Partners. Your line is open.","Eric Handler","Thank you very much. I have got two questions. First, MEGA seems to just have a really good stride last year and I want you to, you know, when you look at the action figures building sets a game segment, if you just parsed out MEGA last year, what would that growth be for that business? And what sort of drove that growth, how much of that was licensing? How much of that was just sort of the core block business. And I'll follow up with a second question after you answer this.","Richard Dickson","Thanks, Eric. It's Richard. Thank you for recognizing that momentum that we've got in MEGA. It's been a great turnaround story as we refocused and established ourselves as a true challenger, and taking that challenge, your mindset and position driving a really right product at the right place in order to regain share in the construction category."," Just as a reminder, the turnaround plan really focused on setting up the right inventory to get those increases in POS and we delivered, 2019 was a good year in the construction category for us with MEGA and we will continue that momentum as we build upon strength in 2020. There is a great new campaign that we're going to be revealing for you and everybody else in Toy Fair that is going to really identify MEGA with a point of difference that we're pretty excited about.","The licensing piece of MEGA while we don't break out the specifics of it continues to be an important part of the brand. Halo game launch ramp-up is really one of the key brands for us. We've got some great momentum of course in Pokemon, and then some new innovation that you're going to see in the MEGA Blocks category with something called PICA Blocks, which is a great new product that's going to have specific content and media around it.","So look, we can talk a lot about MEGA, I would rather save a lot of it when I walk you through the gallery and share our strategic point of view and we get to choice there but all going in the right direction.","Joe Euteneuer","And just to add to that in regards to your question on growth. We did say -- I did say in my prepared remarks that each of the channels or categories grew double digits last year in 2019. And in parentheses I can say that a lot of it goes back to the core strategy of running the Company by category as a holistic portfolio. We'll talk about that more at Toy Fair, but this is driven by this new structure we're able to grow each category which with its own dedicated strategy, leadership team and brand that solidify the momentum.","Eric Handler","Now, in contrast to MEGA, we still have a lot of issues with Thomas. And I'm wondering is there anything structurally that has changed in the play pattern? We're trained it just like consistent, very consistent patterns for kids, particularly boys. And I'm just trying to figure out what is changed there that has kept that's what was seemingly a very strong brands just on a downward path for the last several years.","Richard Dickson","Yes. Thanks Eric. Truth is, and we've shared this, the Thomas trend is a self inflicted wound. We have acknowledged a frankly a challenge with this brand, particularly in association with how we drove product. The good news is in 2019, we saw early signs of progress as we rolled out a singular core system of play, just a playback case study. One of the reasons why Thomas business to some extent fell off the track, no pun intended, was because we had variations of track play, and also moved away from the depth of characters in merchandising.","We're getting back to a singular core place system we're doing great strong engagement with content that continues to resonate with kids around the world and we're strengthening our retail presence and merchandising assortment at retail. All of this has been working progress in 2019 we did see in the new single track system in the fourth quarter, some great POS lift in single digits on that segment. With that as early signs of momentum, we're going to accelerate that progress into 2020.","In addition to that, we have the catalyst of Thomas his 75th birthday, which we have some great proven track record of celebrating birthdays with momentum around our brands, some terrific new product interacted engines that will bring the choice to life. And last but not least, we're excited to move the Thomas content in the U.S. to Netflix. So a great series of good strong lineups, both product and strategies for 2020 and we'll get a little bit more into detail in New York when we see you.","Eric Handler","So just as one last follow-up. That means you're moving away from Nickelodeon toward Netflix?","Richard Dickson","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from Felicia Hendrix of Barclays. Your line is open.","Felicia Hendrix","Joe, I know you've said throughout this call that your inventory levels are fine, but in your prepared remarks, you also just mentioned that there'll be higher inventories in the first quarter. So I just wondered if you could specifically talk about what's driving that and can we extrapolate that to your sales potentially being down in the first quarter to kind of comedy for that higher inventory?","Joe Euteneuer","Yes I think what -- my caramel was that the fact that the inventory in the first quarter could have a on1% to 2% impact on revenue in the quarter. So yes.","Felicia Hendrix","So what's driving that higher level? Is that just kind of building for the rest of the year or is that something else?","Joe Euteneuer","Well, what do you mean? As far as the mid single digit growth of all of our own brands, you know, we're talking about mid single digit growth. So yes, if I'm getting your question right.","Felicia Hendrix","Well you're saying there's just going be higher levels of inventory in the first quarter. I'm just trying to understand what exactly is going to be deciding that?","Joe Euteneuer","Yes, because we expect to be up mid single digit to our first quarter sales. So, I think that's, that's the biggest reason.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay. So, it'll match.","Joe Euteneuer","That's, that's the hope. That's what we're hoping right now. That's what we're telling you. We're going to have to update you on in regards to the virus, but that's still an unknown. We have to come back to you on that.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay, great. I just want to clarify that. And then just with Barbie, with your sector growth in Barbie and 2020s, just wondering how we should think about that in terms of domestic and international substance, domestic, kind of domestic was down this quarter, which was not surprising given what was going on the environment, but just if you could just kind of help us think about how to model that for 2020?","Joe Euteneuer","Yes. Felicia, I think we've proven now that it's not a question of if Barbie's going to grow. It's more about our philosophy is how high and how fast. We're very confident in the programs that we have in place for Barbie. We're going to share a lot more of that detail for you to give you the same type of confidence when we get to toy fair, but certainly the past nine, nine consecutive quarters, and of course this year in particular with such a competitive landscape should give people more confidence. But we'll share a lot more of that detail with you when we get to toy fair.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay. But it sounds like you'll see return to growth in 20 domestically for Barbie?","Joe Euteneuer","We will actually continue growth in Barbie, we did grow in Barbie.","Felicia Hendrix","I mean, your shipments were down in fourth quarter.","Joe Euteneuer","And for year for Barbie, we performed very well and we had expected essentially the same performance that you saw in the first half and second half in the context of the plans for Barbie. And as usual, this is our long-term proposition. We're going to be going to our 61st year. So we tend to look at Barbie with a long-term view.","Felicia Hendrix","Yes. Okay, great. And then just Joe, you've done an extraordinary job this year in terms of your cost savings program and kind of showing upside for that almost each quarter. In terms of just the little bit that's left in 2020, is it getting harder to show upside or do you think that, we could see some of more of the same.","Joe Euteneuer","You mean in regards to cost-savings or.","Felicia Hendrix","Yes, cost saving.","Joe Euteneuer","Yes, so, right now, we concluded the structural simplification programs. So we ended up at $875 million on an original $650 million program. And through 2019, we'll have $797 million of that affected EBITDA and we have another $92 million that'll affect 2020. So, the carryover into 2020 is about $92 million. And then in capital light, we did get the acceleration in the period of $15 million and then we'll have another $50 million of savings associated with capital light.","Felicia Hendrix","Right, I just wanted to carry over it is what it is. We shouldn't expect that to somehow kind of","Joe Euteneuer","Yes, we've concluded the program etcetera -- now just because we've concluded the program doesn't mean we're not calling after more savings, but the formal program that we've been pitching you on, we're now done. And listen, just to clarify the previous from remark, because I think, I thought about what you said, we are going to have a mid-single digit impact to Q1 results as a result of where the inventory is at year end going into the first quarter. So I just wanted to make that clear.","Felicia Hendrix","Right. And that's how I was asking it and I think is it still impacts is an offsetting. I just really, we should talk about this offline cause I'm not sure.","Joe Euteneuer","Thank you, Felicia. And on that note, we have time for one more question or a set of questions, but those that don't have time to get the questions put on the table now. We'll be happy to address it after the call.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of William Reuter of Bank of America. Your line is open.","William Reuter","Just one question on your capital allocation, your guidance implies pretty strong free cash flow and you've talked about debt reduction, but there isn't any pre-payable debt in your capital structure at this point. So I guess, I'm curious whether you would repurchase your 2023 notes in the open market. And then related to that, you talked about investment grade, I guess, will you focus on getting to investment grade before you would do shareholder friendly stuff like share repurchases or large onetime dividends something like that?","Joe Euteneuer","Yes, sure. I mean, look, we will always use the most efficient use of our cash. And remember the one thing at year end, the large debt becomes callable, so that does happen in December. So yes, look, those are all the things you mentioned are things that are on the table, but we have to continue to grow the Company and then we'll evaluate the best use of our cash on a going forward basis.","William Reuter","Great. Thanks for sneaking me in. Appreciate it.","Ynon Kreiz","Okay. Thank you. So I just went to summarize, make a few closing comments, and thank you all for the question. This call run a little longer given that it's a fourth quarter, a big year. We also gave your guidance. There's no comment of Toys Fair, but it's fair to say that 2019 was an important point, important inflection points for the Company. In our turnarounds, you saw methodical execution of our strategy. It is working.","We have achieved significant improvements across key profitability metrics including growth, margin, operating income, EBITDA, EPS. And importantly, we achieved free cash flow positive, which is a big point in the turnaround. We also increase revenue in constant currency and global market share in the fourth quarter, which was very competitive and at the same time retain a global leadership position for the year.","We also continue to make progress in capturing value from our IP with five new film projects announced, three television series with Netflix, and a lot of activity in our franchise management team. So all in all, I would say, we are very proud of the accomplishments of the Company, of the team, around the world. Our 2020 guidance reflects continued momentum and we hope to share with you more as we go forward.","Thank you and I'd like now to turn the call over to Dave for very last closing comments.","David Zbojniewicz","Thank you, Ynon, and thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. The replay of this call will be available via webcast and audio beginning at 8:30 PM Eastern time today. The webcast link can be found on our Investor page or for an audio replay, please dial 404 537-3406.

At this time, all participants' are in a listen-only mode, later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference; Mr. Martin Gilkes, Head of Investor Relations. Mr. Gilkes, you may begin.","Martin Gilkes","Thank you, Andrea, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me today are Chris Sinclair, Mattel's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Richard Dickson, Mattel's President and Chief Operating Officer; and Kevin Farr, Mattel's Chief Financial Officer. As you know, this afternoon we reported Mattel's 2016 third quarter financial results. We'll begin today's call with Chris, Richard, and Kevin providing commentary on our results, and then we'll take your questions.","To help guide our discussion today, we have provided you with a slide presentation. Our discussion and our slide presentation will reference non-GAAP financial measures, such as gross sales, adjusted selling and administrative expense, adjusted operating income and loss, adjusted earnings and loss per share and constant currency. Our earnings release also includes non-GAAP financial measures. The information required by Regulation G regarding non-GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release and slide presentation, and both documents are available on the Investors section of our website, corporate.mattel.com.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that certain statements made during the call may include forward-looking statements relating to the future performance of our overall business, brands and product lines. These statements are based on currently available information and they are subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.","We describe some of these uncertainties in the Risk Factors section of our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, our 2016 Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and other filings we make with the SEC from time-to-time, as well as in our other public statements. Mattel does not update forward-looking statements and expressly disclaims any obligation to do so.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Chris.","Chris Sinclair","Thank you, Martin, and welcome everybody, thanks for joining us today. As usual, I will lead things off with a brief perspective on the quarter and the full year, and then Richard and Kevin will each provide some additional details. And as Martin pointed out, we'll open things up at the end for any questions that you might have.","All right, so let me begin by saying that in the quarter we continue to make some very good progress across all of our strategic priorities. We were especially encouraged by the momentum of our top client. Our positive consumer takeaways aligning nicely with shipping. This increases our confidence as we get stuff for the holiday season and as we look to deliver on our challenging 2016 top line objectives.","Now also encouraging is the fact that our positive top line results were very broad based. We continue to see real strength in our core brands with Barbie, Fisher-Price, Thomas and Hot Wheels, all growing. And the results also reflected a number of turnaround initiatives at American Girl including the first full quarter of Walt [ph]. The initial set of our expanded distribution strategy and the signing of a new international licensing opportunity. We also saw some excellent traction in our Toy Box with our games and entertainment properties and with MEGA Brands.","Our geographic performance was also broad based and we continue to perform especially well in the priority emerging markets like Russia and China; markets which are setting up extremely well for continued rapid growth.","Finally I'd like to highlight the effectiveness of our commercial team which is performing superbly and making some very real gains in space of merchandising and in building broader strategic partnerships with many of our key customers. So on balance, a lot of very good progress and performance which is helping to drive the top line.","Shifting to the middle of the P&L, we also made good progress this quarter and we do remain on-track to deliver on our cost targets. We've been realizing some very significant supply chain savings and efficiencies. Despite some very aggressive targets, our efforts to streamline and prioritize SG&A spending are also progressing well.","As pointed out previously, the offset of course continue to be negative foreign exchange and some unfavorable shifts in our brand mix which have pressured our gross margins. And we expect these factors will remain a challenge as we navigate through the balance of the year. Kevin is going to provide a little bit more perspective on this short.","To sum up, our third quarter results provided some very solid momentum as we entered the holiday season and they reflected encouraging progress across many fronts. As we look ahead, the picture for the year is largely the same as what we've previously outlined. We have solid topline momentum, that's being aided by great customer support and well developed consumer programs. Additionally, foreign exchange should begin to moderate some and we'll continue to push through cost savings to offset any mix effects. We'll also be working to achieve our aggressive SG&A cost.","Overall, I'd say that our strategies continue to gain traction and are helping us to drive the top line to right size our cost structure and to fund investments in brand building, commercial excellence, emerging market expansion and our exhibit [ph].","While we always have to caution that we have a lot of work ahead with a critical quarter to still execute. I'm proud of the progress that we've been making and I remain very optimistic about the year and our future, something we hope will shed a little bit more light on when we host our Analyst Day event early next month.","With that, let me now turn things over to Richard to highlight some of our top line progress and our and core initiatives. Richard?","Richard Dickson","All right, thank you, Chris. As Chris mentioned, we are pleased with the quarterly results as we build solid momentum going into the important holiday season. Our work on core brand positioning refreshed products marketing, renewed licensing executions and surgical retail execution globally is obviously paying off.","Our third quarter results clearly demonstrate significant progress on overcoming this year's revenue challenges with worldwide gross sales essentially flat at actual and up 1% in constant currency. As you know, POS is the true parameter of a brands success with shipping ultimately aligning to it overtime. And our turnaround efforts focusing on consumer demand creation and better global commercial alignment are clearly gaining traction.","Excluding the impact of Disney Princess, Global POS continues to be up mid-single digits for the quarter and year-to-date, with solid results across the majority of our brands. And gross sales excluding Disney Princess are aligned to POS with sales in constant currency up low-double digits for the quarter and up single-digits year-to-date. Our third quarter momentum is very broad based reflecting continuing end in some cases accelerating growth across the number of brands, licenses, and geographies.","So let me briefly touch on some specifics starting with our core brands and let's start with Barbie which continues to exceed our expectations. With Global POS up in the high-teens for the quarter and gross sales in constant currency is up 17%. Year-to-date, POS is up high single-digits with gross sales in constant currency up 14% reflecting increased retailer confidence in the brand as they restock and expand our recent shelf space. Barbie is playing an incredibly fast-moving trend based business which requires us to be nimble and act like a leader but think like a challenger. We knew going into this year that our Barbie strategies had to work almost perfectly, so far they have. We're seeing very broad based performance from the new styling in our Fashionista line, the I Can Be segment that exemplifies the brands positioning and to our new Dreamtopia that is capturing imagination of younger girls.","Now orchestrating all of this simultaneously is quite an accomplishment and we are particularly pleased with the significant turnaround in our international results. For the quarter, Barbie's International POS was up mid-teens and gross sales in constant currency are up 16%.","Fisher-Price, with its renewed emphasis on the early childhood development continues to grow with gross sales in constant currency up 8% in the quarter and up 7% year-to-date. Global POS remains solid with very strong POS internationally. We continue to build strength in our baby business, especially in key international markets and we're seeing a nice turnaround on our Friends business driven by Nickelodeon.","Hot Wheels, which is a likely a concern for some of you this quarter given the Star Wars comp continues to do well. With gross sales in constant currency up 3% in the quarter and up 6% year-to-date. POS trends remains solid with global POS mid-single digits in the quarter and double-digits year-to-date.","Thomas remains strong as we accelerate growth in international markets with global gross sales in constant currency up 6% in the quarter and up 3% year-to-date. POS remains particularly strong internationally. And despite its impressive numbers, as it does remain top three fashion doll brands globally, we continue to have our challenges with Monster High. The new DVD that essentially kicks-off the reboot of the brand came out recently and is being supported by product offerings that emphasize the core characters and the origin story but watching the performance with this brand closely during the holiday period.","And finally, American Girl, where we saw solid turnaround in the quarter. While we did see solid results from our recent introduction of the WellieWishers line and the introduction of our latest historical character Melody. The third quarter results really reflect the impact of our strategies to expand the brands distribution. This includes the initial shipping to support our new exclusive store within the store partnership with Toy [ph]. Our new retail execution as well as the new franchise licensing agreement to expand the brand into the Middle East. We're very excited about all of the strategies now in place to provide new ways for girls and their families to engage with the brand and look to see continued progress in the fourth quarter.","Briefly moving onto the Toy Box. The key driver in the third quarter here is MEGA with gross sales and constant currency up 6% in the quarter and up 23% year-to-date, primarily driven by continued international expansion. Separately continued success with our Warner Brothers DC Universe executions are evidenced by our DC Superhero Girls results and continuing strong demand for our Batman versus Superman products. And the Toy Box organization has also been busy developing and recently sharing with our retail partners a number of exciting new products that will support the strong lineup of entertainment properties coming out next year including Wonder Woman, Justice League, an additional content for DC Superhero Girls from Warner Brothers, Universal with Fast and Furious and Minions, and of course, Disney with Cars 3.","The third quarter results provided glimpse to the power and breadth of our portfolio and how this organization and properly align and given the right resources can achieve great things. I continue to believe that our success this year will largely be a function of Mattel's ability to overcome a unique and significant revenue gap. Yes, a number of headwinds remain but we are meeting this head-on and moving forward with a lot more confidence and purpose. We will continue to build on our progress and create major new opportunities for growth in 2017 and beyond. I'm looking forward to continuing this discussion in a few weeks here at Analyst Day at Mattel.","And now I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Farr. Kevin?","Kevin Farr","Thank you Richard, and good afternoon everyone. Overall our third quarter results with shipping better aligned with positive POS which positions us well to execute the fourth quarter and deliver our challenging top line objectives for the year. We continue to focus on managing the P&L, leveraging sales and POS momentum and cost savings initiatives to help offset continued Forex headwinds and short-term calendars [ph].","Before going further, I want to remind everybody that unless otherwise noted, I'll be referring to gross sales in constant currency in order to provide better visibility into the underlying topline trends. And in order to provide more transparency into the fundamentals of the business, I will also reference some adjusted financial results that exclude certain non-recurring items related to the acquisitions of MEGA, Fuhu and Sproutling; as well as severance related to our business transformation and cost saving initiatives. As always, reconciliation to GAAP numbers are provided in our press release and the slide deck. So let's briefly get into some of the details. As Richard said, our third quarter top line results demonstrate significant progress. Third quarter gross sales were up 1% constant currency and despite a significant Disney Princess comp essentially flat on a reported basis.","On a year-to-date basis POS pro-sales are now flat and constant currency are down 3% as reported. We did see great sales acceleration in the quarter to our Asia Pacific business, we also saw sequential improvement and our challenging Latin American business along with very strong growth in key emerging markets like China and Russia. And excluding Disney Princess, the underlying trends are even more compelling. Other revenue stories due to better commercial execution as we invest with the retail partners to turn the business around. Sales adjustments were 9.1% in the quarter versus 9.6% in the prior year.","Our reported gross margin in the third quarter came in as expected at 48.5%, while Forex represented less of a headwind than in the first half of the year, it was still the major driver of the year-on-year decline. Unfavorable mix was also a headwind as our less accretive businesses continue to grow at a nice cliff [ph]. We continue to partially offset these headwinds by strategic pricing and our successful cost savings initiatives.","Moving beyond gross margin, much like sales adjustments, our advertising rate was lower in the quarter as we moved closer to 12% for the year. And we remained disciplined in SG&A with adjusted SG&A down approximately $5.2 million or 2% year-over-year for the quarter. Year-to-date, adjusted SG&A was down by $48.3 million or 5%. Our continuing efforts to aggressively reduce costs, particularly in SG&A are reflected in quarterly results and are helping to offset the additional SG&A related to our recent technology acquisitions and increase incentive accrual in the quarter as year-to-date we're attracted to higher incentive payout as compared to the prior year.","Importantly, we are still on-track to deliver at the high end of the $250 million to $300 million range for our two-year funding at our future cost savings program. We delivered approximately $31.4 million in gross savings in Q3 and $108.3 million year-to-date. Finally, adjusted EPS for the third quarter was $0.70 per share or $0.68 per share as reported.","Now turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the first nine months of the year with $297 million of cash, in-line with our expectations and about equal to last year as we continue to tightly manage working capital. As expected, we did issue $350 million of long-term debt in the quarter which we'll use to repay $300 million of long-term debt maturing in November. The additional funds will be used for general corporate purposes. The timing of the issuance is a reason why interest expense for the year will be slightly higher than last year. Not surprisingly, owned inventory and balance sheet was up year-over-year as we positioned the business to deliver in the fourth quarter.","Finally, we continue to reward our shareholders by deploying capital in a disciplined manner and maintaining the dividend. As expect, capital expenditures were up slightly as we invest in incremental dye cast [ph] capacity to support growth in our business and labor saving automation technologies. And dividends remain our first priority after re-investing in the business, with the board declaring a fourth quarter dividend of $0.38 per share which is flat compared to fourth quarter of 2015.","Looking ahead as Chris said, as we enter the fourth quarter, we don't see any significant changes to our full year 2016 outlook. We have a lot of work to do to execute the fourth quarter, and our focus remains on delivering operating profit by balancing our top line and managing the middle of the P&L. As expected, the unfavorable impact of Forex did lessen in the third quarter which we believe will continue. And giving our third quarter results, our revenue outlook has not changed. We gained confidence with our results to-date and believe we are well positioned to meet our challenging 2016 revenue objective of relatively flat net sales and constant currency.","At the same time we work hard to achieve a full year gross margin of about 48.5%. This continues to be important area of focus as we still face Forex mixed headwinds but we do expect to be in the range with this target. It means that we need to achieve a fourth quarter gross margin rate around 51% which is a challenge but well within the ranges we have achieved in the past. The sequential improvement in gross margin is supported by incremental volume, improved mix and stronger trends in our Girls properties with American Girl, Barbie and DC Superhero Girls; a smaller Disney Princess impact and by incremental flow-through from our supply chain and other cost savings initiatives.","Now shifting to the other lines of our P&L, we'll continue to manage both advertising and SG&A for achieving our operated profit goals. Specifically with advertising, we expect to continue to move to the mid-point of our 11% to 13% guidance. We also expect continued progress in SG&A, likely finishing the year closer to low end of our $55 million to $65 million savings range for adjusted SG&A. As a reminder, we set very aggressive targets here at the beginning of the year including the full absorption of incremental overheads from our first quarter acquisition of Sproutling and Fuhu, which were not contemplated when we set our original savings targets and expected higher accrual for incentive compensation assuming we hit our performance targets. So a lot of tightening and cutting on the cross front as we work hard to achieve a full year adjusted SG&A of about $1.4 billion.","As an additional note on the P&L, I also wanted to remind you of our tax rate assumptions. While the year-to-date tax rate has been positively impacted by some discrete tax items, we still expect a full year tax rate including discrete items to be around 21% for 2016 and beyond assuming no changes in current tax laws. Our tax rate including discrete items for the fourth quarter is expected to be about 24%. And finally, we expect our fourth quarter diluted share account to be slightly above our third quarter of 344 million shares.","Turning to our balance sheet; we expect to end the year within our targeted range of $800 million to $1 billion in cash as we will continue to take the advantage of working capital. Looking beyond 2016, we expect to see ongoing brand momentum driven by the rollout of new initiatives. Continuing tailwinds related to our strategic investments in emerging markets, and benefits related to leveraging the technology acquisitions across our portfolio. We also have the tailwind and topline revenues from a much more robust entertainment display including the Cars 3 Movie in 2017. And as previously stated, we remain diligent in our efforts to approach more normal operated margins of 15% to 20% in 2017 and beyond. And 2018 brings additional revenue and profit growth with [indiscernible] like Toy Story 4, Jurassic World in our entertainment line-up. I'll look forward to provide more details at Analyst Day in a few weeks.","In closing, let me repeat what Chris and Richard have already said. We are very pleased with the progress reflected by our year-to-date results and while we still have a lot of work to do, we believe we are poised to deliver a solid holiday season and a solid year for our shareholders.","We'll now open up the call to questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian with Citi. Your line is now open.","Greg Badishkanian","Great, thanks. It seems like you've had some pretty consistent POS in that what's called positive mid-single digit range excluding Disney, how should we think about fourth quarter and are there any issues that could derail that momentum?","Richard Dickson","Greg, it's Richard. I think we are quite pleased obviously with the POS thus far this year, particularly on core brands. We're seeing more attraction, actually and the international markets accelerate as we had a good run this year in the U.S. and we continue to be quite confident in our go-forward, the commercial group has done a brilliant job executing promotional space, additional advertising, online presence as well as our own media strategies which will end up in the fourth quarter. So we think we're poised to continue the momentum and certainly recognize that this is where the ducks lie if you will but we're excited about our programming being executed.","Greg Badishkanian","And also there is a press release put our very recently, maybe Richard could you provide some more color on the Toy Box Series and maybe that the opportunity from Mattel from a branding or product sales perspective, what's the opportunity of that series for you?","Richard Dickson","Sure. So we were -- thank you for asking that question, actually we're very excited about our partnership with ABC since launch what is going to be a new Toy Show television reality series called the Toy Box. In partnership with ABC, it will be an exploration frankly of the trials, tribulations and excitement around what it means to be a Toy inventor. And frankly, the entertaining process that most of the world doesn't get to see, what it takes to actually bring a creative idea to market. So we're really thrilled with the idea of the concept and certainly the details of the show will be revealed as the show gets launched in 2017. We are at this point in [indiscernible] working through our international distribution rollout of the channel and it will air in 2017 as the date will be announced soon.","It also is a great opportunity for us to highlight that. When we started the division called the Toy Box, we reiterated that it was about invention, creativity and the idea of sort of a free flow back to the origins of the company; and I think the television show named Toy Box is going to do just that and it represents the new platform for us to find great new product and ideas around the world in an entertaining new way for the consumer and the company.","Greg Badishkanian","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Arpine Kocharian with UBS Investment Bank. Your line is now open.","Arpine Kocharian","Thank you, thanks very much. Richard, I wanted to address Barbie, this comes very -- this comes in above expectations in terms of sort of a double-digit growth for the quarter, just trying to understand how your customers are thinking about the brand heading into Q4? Are you seeing considerable shelf-based increase? And then I have a follow-up question on DC Superhero's; if you were to seize the opportunity for you in the back half of this year, could you -- anything you could give us in terms of quantifying what that brand could mean this year? And then I have a quick follow-up.","Richard Dickson","Sure. So the first question related to Barbie, so the back half year -- our shelf space gains in Barbie are commensurate with our performance with POS and with performance comes additional space assuming you have the retail credibility and relationships to get that space and we are quite pleased with the increments that we have in the back half and with the momentum that we had continue to have all year. We're quite confident that we'll be able to maintain this great trend with the Barbie brand.","As you also recall, international was little slow to catch up to the U.S. as we execute much of our program work in the U.S. first and we're seeing the buildup if you will and reaction as our programming product marketing in international that has had some terrific POS results, frankly across the world and we anticipate that that will also continue. Most pleased with the three segments that we've been talking about in marketing, the Fashionista collection which of course has the new scalps and shapes; the I Can Be segment which of course is the career aspirational segment of the brand that we focus a lot of advertising demand [ph]; and as I mentioned Dreamtopia, a new segment to capture younger girls.","Not only has the POS been improved but also our brand equity scores have improved significantly and in particular with girls of younger mom -- younger -- moms of younger girls between the ages of two to five we've seen the scores jump significantly as they've enjoyed much of the purposeful play messages that exemplify the brands positioning statement. So that's the answer to your first question.","As it relates to DC Superhero Girls, we are thrilled the early reads and in fact, it's shaping up to be one of the big fashion top brands of the year. The programming in place, the content being rolled out, the additional marketing at Warner Brothers, DC is working on with Mattel; ensures if you will, the consistency of this important new girls franchise and we believe that it will remain a top five brand fashion doll business for us in the future and we're really quite excited about it. In addition to that, as you know Wonder Woman is coming out with movie in the first half of 2017 and there is already a lot of buildup around that brand and the implications of that for the entire collection, so we're quite bullish on it.","Arpine Kocharian","That's great, thank you. And then I have a question to the team, sort of Walmart is making some aggressive price investments to generate same-store growth; it seems like part of this dollar re-investments are going to come from both suppliers and Walmart, this is obviously your largest customer. As we look into '17 could you frame what this could mean for the Toy Isle and for Mattel perhaps? Thank you.","Chris Sinclair","Arpine, it's Chris. Walmart continues to be a seller partner with us. We've been expanding space and merchandising and we're starting to do a lot of experiential things to test that out with them. We are frankly not seeing anything in ordinance that's coming out in terms of your question related to extra economic pressure or whatever. We're actually working quite well and trying to manage the line effectively for margins for both sides. So we have nothing but very good thing to say about partnership and how it's unfolding.","Arpine Kocharian","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tim Conder with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.","Tim Conder","Thank you. I just wanted to continue on a little bit the Barbie international component. Richard, if -- you alluded to that the international just in general would lag the U.S. as far as you guys looking at wholesale versus retail. And international -- correct me if I'm wrong, is 60%, 65% of Barbie; so we're seeing that disproportionately reflected and driving that wholesale. Is that part of the dynamic also here?","Richard Dickson","No, not quite actually. Well, that the percentages you've got, you've got right but the catch up in international was really just a function of the ability for us to execute programs a little bit faster in the U.S. As you recall, again, the three segments that we've really been concentrating on have been Fashionista which at an early rollout in the U.S. with significant PR and marketing which points the international markets have lagged. The I Can Be segment which had an enormous amount of mom-directed marketing if you recall, that piece of communication rolled out in the U.S. earlier and now is rolling out significantly around the world.","And the last piece which is Dreamtopia, which is gaining more and more distribution if you will from a content perspective in the international and getting traction. So all of it has been really kind of timed around programming and I think that what you're seeing is just the rest of the world catch up to you what was the beginning of the trend in the U.S. and now we see a really complete picture of great global momentum for the brand overall.","Chris Sinclair","Tim, just a little bit of a follow-up too on that; if you look at the numbers we've actually reached pretty nice equilibrium on Barbie now in the third quarter. And it's being frankly driven by a snap ad [ph], both the North America and international. So last year as you know we were kind of out of balance the other way, I think it's come back. And actually the third quarter was pretty much on the number of POS and shipping it both sets of geographies.","Tim Conder","Okay, very helpful, thank you. Any comment gentlemen early on here with the American Girl POS and WellieWishers as the first full quarter and then there -- anything very early on here with the Toy [indiscernible]?","Chris Sinclair","Tim, I'll take a stab at this one, Richard can jump in. But it is early days, I think we're feeling very good about the take on Wellie's, that looks like it is helping to build the base. The distribution build has just frankly started through late September and the TRU enfolds. Early reads by the way certainly very positive on both fronts but I think a lot will play out over the coming next couple of months. We start the content with Amazon as you know next week, and I think the distribution will be in full force by this month. So right now a lot of is kind of the buildup but the underlying business seems to have picked up with the addition of WellieWishers.","Tim Conder","Okay, okay. And then more so Kevin or whoever wants to take this; as we looked at '17, you've given us some goal that you guys early on are still targeting, that really hasn't changed since the beginning of the year but if we had this sort of parse between gross margin and SG&A, given that you're going to have the Wonder Woman, given that you're going to have Cars 3; would it be fair to say that maybe you'll get little more leverage on SG&A relative to gross margin as we -- if we look at what's really going to be driving 17 operating margins on a year-over-year basis, '17 versus '16?","Kevin Farr","I think that's fair, I think the increment sales we've talked about that Cars have an incremental $350 million, that will give a scale both on gross margins and SG&A but I think also with regard to the cost cutting, we're going to continue to lean into our supply chain, as well as into SG&A but I think you're -- the conclusion is in ballpark.","Tim Conder","Okay. Gentlemen, thank you and congratulations.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Your line is open.","Felicia Hendrix","Hi, thanks for taking my question. For my first question, I apologize if you already said this but I don't remember hearing it; so did you mention what U.S. point of sales was in the quarter? I know you said global.","Richard Dickson","It should be in the document, isn't it; but I can tell you the North America number sort of -- it excludes the principal stuff, 2%, North America. And down modestly with just the system there.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay, thank you. So just speaking on the topic of gross margins and Kevin you kind of gave color and we could have backed in to kind of what you need to see for the first quarter and kind of highlighted that it's challenging. But just given all of those -- given all the inputs, the puts and takes to get to that number for the fourth quarter, take into consideration if there is challenging, I was just wondering how comfortable are you with your full year gross margin outlook? What could go wrong?","Kevin Farr","Yes, I think with regards to -- we don't control things like Forex and there is a lot of moving pieces like mix but we look at it, we feel pretty confident with regard to the 48.5% target and we are working hard to achieve that and it's difficult to predict but we are working on a lot of the moving pieces including Forex mix and incremental revenues, and we also expect to improve mix from our girl's properties, American Girl, Barbie and Disney for DC Superheroes; there is going to be a smaller impact from the Disney Princess. And then we do see incremental flow-through from our supply chain and other cost saving initiatives.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay, that's helpful, thanks. And then just getting to American Girl, I was just trying to understand how the branded -- kind of an apple-to-apple basis so, X WellieWishers and it's the new distribution initiative?","Chris Sinclair","Probably just to modestly better than it has been trending before you put all the incremental stuff in there -- it would be a fair way to think about it Felicia. Some of the Wellie impact -- I mean it's kind of hard to separate out how much is cannibalization but I think that's probably a fair way to look at things.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay. And then just finally and I'm sure you're probably going to talk about this more in your Investor Day but I was wondering if you could just give us a road map for the improvement in Monster High. I know it's something that you guys have been working on since the transition but can you just kind of help us understand how to think about that going forward a bit?","Richard Dickson","Sure, Felicia its Richard. We've been very transparent in our efforts to get this brand back on the right track and as I have mentioned many times, our encouragement is really based on engagement that we see with girls having with the brand and frankly, new consumers coming into the franchise; we have significant web traffic, increasing content viewership and great brand loyalty; despite our POS challenges it still is one of the top fashion doll brands in the world, and we are still trying to find that base business. There are a lot of success stories within that mix of business for Monster High, Mini's are doing very well and some of the new products that we're featuring out is also doing well.","There is -- as I mentioned the DVD which is the origin story, there is refreshed packaging and content that is also included this year. We recently announced a partnership with Lady Gaga, we're coming out with a new zombie Gaga and have partnered with her to feature a new character within the Monster High franchise. There is actually going to be a music video associated with that character that will debut on Nickelodeon. There is an increased amount of media associated with that piece of context as well as other forms of new engagement that we are pretty confident on. We are taking our best swings at sort of reviving this business.","So when you come out here we'll certainly give you more detail in product and marketing, and hopefully share some continued improved results on the franchise.","Felicia Hendrix","Great, that's very helpful, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gerrick Johnson with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Gerrick Johnson","Good afternoon, I have two questions here. First, Forex impact on gross margin in basis points please, if you can provide that? And second, are you gaining share? Is your POS keeping up with overall industry growth? The POS is good but how strong is the industry right now?","Chris Sinclair","Let me take the share one, I'm going to let Kevin take the margin one. If you strip out Disney Princess and look at our base performance, we are -- I would say holding and in some cases gaining share.","Kevin Farr","And on your second question regarding the gross margin impact of Forex the negative impact of Forex on the year-over-year gross margin rate was about 130 basis points for the quarter which was significantly less than what we saw in the first half of the year.","Gerrick Johnson","Great, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Trevor Young with Jefferies.","Trevor Young","Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just to expand on an earlier question actually, could you provide some details around when you began to ship into Toys of Russ and Cole for American Girl? Was it kind of midway through the quarter? Was it just strictly September after the press release?","Chris Sinclair","No, it was September and probably the back half of September for most of the setup.","Trevor Young","Okay, great. And then shifting to free cash flow; it looks like free cash flow year-to-date hasn't been as strong as last year, primarily driven by working capital. Is that mostly on the AR side of things?","Kevin Farr","It's a little bit on the AR side as well as the inventory. Inventory is up about $40 million and again, we continue to work on tightly managing important capital and our accounts payable is actually up too. So overall working capital is up but again we've got a plan as we get through the fourth quarter to tightly manage that and hit our $800 million to $1 billion year-end cash targets.","Trevor Young","Okay, so kind of performing in line with your expectations so far?","Kevin Farr","Yes, we're pretty much in line with where we expected to be given that we started the year with $80 million less in cash. We did have a write-down of cash, delayed demand as well due to devaluation, and again all that is on-track to deliver $800 million to $1 billion in cash at year-end.","Trevor Young","Great, thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Linda Bolton-Weiser with B. Riley. Your line is open.","Linda Bolton-Weiser","Thanks. So just to stick on the working capital topic, thinking about next year with your higher earnings that we're expecting for next year; you should have better cash flow unless the higher revenue growth is going to require more working capital investment. And then, so can you just comment on kind just in a very rough way what you generally expect on that? And then secondly, can you think -- talk about how you think about prioritizing share repurchase potentially next year versus dividend increase? Thanks.","Richard Dickson","Yes, I think with regard to cash flow next year we expect to have cash flow next year that's greater than 2016 as we have incremental revenues and as we approach more normal to operating profits margins, so that should exceed the amount that we have to pay the dividend. And then with respect to prioritizing that excess cash flow on share repurchases or other investments in the business I think again we'll be looking at that at the time we generate the cash and look at what the best alternative is with regard to investing in emerging markets or investing and buying other brands or actually investing in ourselves and buying back our shares. So we'll make that determination when we get to 2017.","That said, I think when you look at increasing the dividend I think we're really looking to get back into overtime which we think will grow into it at 50% to 60% dividend payout ratio and get our yield back more in line with the S&P500 consumer goods companies.","Linda Bolton-Weiser","Thanks. And then can I ask a few Christmas's ago when you had some of this execution across the company what are the issues? Was that you didn't anticipate shifting to online sales from bricks and mortar and you didn't strategize correctly and you spent too much on bricks and mortar investment. Can you -- I think Richard touched on that but what are the specifics things you've done to make sure that you're prepared for that continued shift to online purchases of toys?","Richard Dickson","Linda, I'm not quite sure where the comment was that we over invested in brick and mortar but we've been pretty aggressive for the last year and a half here building up our e-commerce capabilities and starting with our own sites, as well as some -- strategic partnerships with major operators out there. We've hired some terrific folks in that arena, we're doing -- I think a stellar job with people like Amazon, with some of the big players in China starting to move around with some of our Omni-channel folks in Europe and places like that. So I think we're actually doing a great job on the e-commerce site to be honest with you and we've continued to invest obviously heavily with our brick and mortar customers on building out the business there, we're working with them on their Omni-channel efforts as well. So I think we are feeling pretty balanced about this at this point and I don't think we're feeling we're under or over investing it at this stage.","Linda Bolton-Weiser","Okay, thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Swartz with SunTrust.","Michael Swartz","Good afternoon, guys. I just wanted to follow-up on Monster High, just maybe from -- looking at it from another perspective I guess, I'm sorry, not Monster High, American Girl; and just some of the distribution gains -- I mean, how should we think about just the shape of the year now that you have a part of that business in wholesale going through wholesale and some retail partners. And then secondly, how do you ensure that I guess from a cannibalization standpoint, that you have your fixed cost structure around your -- kind of direct restore model in the right place?","Richard Dickson","So our expectation as we've said for American Girl would be a rebound on the core business in the fourth quarter. As we've said much of the surgical reworks of the brand and relations architecture and product marketing, and even in store execution services and so forth; really should start to hold in the back six weeks to eight weeks of the year. WellieWishers certainly is a major new introduction on the brand at a price point in particular a fresh aesthetic appealing to a younger girl. We can't necessarily guarantee that there won't be cannibalization, we're studying the brand and its performance very carefully. At this point we're pretty pleased with it and we anticipate that we'll continue to get some traction.","As Chris mentioned, a lot of the marketing and new content that we're launching with American Girl is yet to be seen, in fact this week we've got at the sales group, WellieWishers, Melody, the girl of the year character is going to come out of the next week I believe. At the end of November, we have Mary Allen [ph] which is also another character that Amazon is going to be featuring; so we anticipate that in the next couple of months we'll see a nice rebound if you will on the overall franchise. And early days on our brand extension reads but we continue to be pretty excited and pleased not only from a volume perspective but frankly exposing the brand to new audiences and new ways through these partners that have been carefully crafted, strategically with the brand group and our retail partners. So we'll have a lot more to update you on the results of course and perhaps when you're out here we can give you more detail on that in the Analyst Day.","Michael Swartz","Thanks, Richard. And then maybe for Kevin, it looks like you haven't changed your full-year expectations, I think revenue came in well ahead with most people are looking for. So I mean would that imply that sales in the fourth quarter would be down year-over-year in a sense, is that -- I guess why would that be the case if the momentum behind us -- I guess in the POS side of it [ph]?","Kevin Farr","Yes, I think when we say this we expect incremental revenues in the fourth quarter, a little bit higher than historically too relative to the third quarter. So that's -- I think what we've stated here couple of times.","Michael Swartz","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line or Eric Handler with MKM Partners. Your line is open.","Eric Handler","Yes, thanks for taking my question, two questions for you. First, can you talk about your licensing business a little bit in the sense of how significant is it at this point? How much growth are we seeing year-over-year and where you -- how high you think you can get with this business? And then secondly, a number of entertainment publications have listed a Barbie movie for May of next year through Sony. And just wondering it's been very quiet in terms of everything other than the script. Wondered if you could get some comments on that?","Richard Dickson","Okay Eric, I'll take the question and my friends here can fill-in if they wish. From a licensing perspective there is really two components to our licensing business; there is certainly the licensing in business which is the Disney's Universal Nickelodeon's of the world where we make and manufacture and market their toys associated with their properties. And as we've reiterated, that has been a big strategic focus for us to regain relevance in that community, and I think its evidenced by the recent awards if you will of some of those properties mentioned. So we are very, very bullish around our renewed relationships in the entertainment community and then some extending to Microsoft and other forms of partnerships that we're getting really pronounced in; and I would say we're projecting significant growth over the next several years in that space.","Then of course there is the licensing outfit which were better known as consumer products where we've -- over the years enjoyed some great business out of our own branding license out. That business frankly is a little bit of a catch-up if you will, so the core Toy business and in particular, the Barbie licensing business which is generally been a pretty large engine for us of great revenue, margin and profit is in catch-up mode. And as we see the brand gain more and more traction and relevance, particular on the core side, we anticipate and see the traction not too far behind on the Barbie licensing front.","I will say one of the challenges of course we have had in consumer product is -- has been Monster High, and that's been certainly a challenge for us as well although there are some pretty terrific categories out there that maintain traction, continuity, we're doing a lot more work in that space as well. Generally speaking, again during our time here at Mattel if you could join us, we'll certainly add a lot more color to the consumer product business and the strategies that we have going forward.","Eric Handler","Okay. Just as a quick follow-up to that before the Barbie movie question; from what you're seeing this year from Barbie, from Thomas, and the other head entertainment properties -- how much of the growth has been from the consumer products business? It's pretty negligible or is this something that's really starting to grow significantly?","Chris Sinclair","Yes, I think it's really been driven by the Toy business.","Eric Handler","Great.","Richard Dickson","On the last piece which was the Barbie movie question; I think perhaps why you're not hearing anything is because we don't have anything to share as of yet. We continue to work closely with the creative partners at Sony and various other experts in the industry if you will to craft what we believe should be an epic Barbie story. And when we have further information around what that is and when the release date will be for that movie, we will certainly be excited to share that but at this point there is no news.","Eric Handler","Thank you.","Chris Sinclair","Operator, I think we probably have time for one last question.","Operator","Absolutely. Our last question comes from the line of Drew Crum with Stifel. Your line is open.","Drew Crum","Okay, thanks, good afternoon everyone. So Kevin can you remind us how Cars and the theatrical release here impact some of your own vehicle brands like Hot Wheels? And the separately juts a progress update on Brazil, it looks like Latin America was left bad in the third quarter relative to the year-to-date so that function of Brazil getting a little better or is it the steel raw strength that you're seeing in Mexico? Thanks.","Kevin Farr","Okay, well Drew I'll start the chat and then Chris will -- I mean -- well, do you guys want to take this one or. Okay, sorry the first question is associated with cars. So generally speaking, we see obviously the whole vehicle category driven by a contest filmed like Cars. Hot Wheels in particular has currently great momentum as you know and the extension of that particular franchise using licenses to drive its relevance has been very useful. We've got some great licenses within Hot Wheels that continue to fuel and drive growth that we anticipate will continue to keep that brand and in that world pretty fresh and exciting. Cars really will bring a lot of attention to the vehicle category. Generally speaking, it will grow the entire category itself, it will certainly be the dominant voice in the vehicle category but there is a lot of on rebrand in vehicles; say blaze and the Monster machine from Nickelodeon that addresses our younger audience for vehicles; and certainly we have Hot Wheels and now we'll have cars. So we're really looking at it as a category leader anticipating that the category itself will grow significantly and certainly cars will be the leader of the trend.","Chris Sinclair","Drew, let me quickly just hit on you question on Latin America, it's really kind of a combined story. Brazil has gotten a little better, and obviously the foreign exchange has improved which has helped some of our programs, made it stronger at this point. So Brazil is doing a bit better but still challenged but the rest of the southern cone and Mexico are performing extremely well. So given the scale they are more than compensating for any of the weakness we still have in Brazil but essentially all elements are looking better than they did.","Drew Crum","Okay, great. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's Q&A session. I would now like to turn the call back to Martin Gilkes for any closing remarks.","Martin Gilkes","Thanks again everybody for joining. There will be a reply of this call available beginning at 8 P.M. Eastern Time today. The number to call for the reply is 404-537-3406 and the passcode is 82398434.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Drew Vollero, Senior Vice President of Corporate Strategy and Investor Relations. Please begin.","Drew Vollero","Thanks, operator. As you know, this morning, we reported Mattel's second quarter financial results. We provided you with a slide presentation to help guide our discussion today. The slide presentation and the information required by Regulation G regarding non-GAAP financial measures is available on the Investors & Media section of our corporate website, corporate.mattel.com.","In a few minutes, Bryan Stockton, Mattel's CEO; and Kevin Farr, Mattel's CFO, will provide comments on the results, and then the call will be opened for your questions.","Certain statements made during the call may include forward-looking statements related to the future performance of our overall business, brands and product lines. These statements are based on currently available information. They are subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. We describe some of these uncertainties in the Risk Factors section of our 2011 annual report on Form 10-K and our 2012 quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and in other filings we make with the SEC from time to time, as well as in other public statements. Mattel does not update forward-looking statements and expressly disclaims any obligation to do so.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bryan.","Bryan G. Stockton","Thank you, Drew, and good day, everyone. Looking at our second quarter results, we executed well and delivered solid performance despite the backdrop of a very challenging global economic climate that's driving volatility in input costs and currencies, as well as creating a very cautious global retail environment. Additionally, we faced a difficult sales comparison with the release of the Cars 2 movie last year. We met the challenge of delivering a comparable level of sales by focusing on our priorities, including growing our core brands, evergreen entertainment properties, our most recent franchise, Monster High, and key international markets.","For the first half of 2012, we experienced solid progress in core brands and markets. Overall shipments were up for the quarter, resulting in improved alignment of shipments, consumer takeaway and retail inventories for the first half. And I believe we are well positioned for the second half and the all-important holiday season. While we continue to absorb the impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar, our international business, including countries such as Brazil, Mexico, the U.K., China and India, is growing when you exclude the impact of currency.","I am optimistic about the growth prospects for the global toy industry. For perspective, about 1\/3 of the global toy category is in the U.S. While NPD data shows the U.S. total toy category down mid-single digits through May 2012, that trend is not consistent across all categories. Most of the categories in which we play are outperforming the total category growth rate through May 2012. Additionally, Mattel continues to gain share in important categories such as infant\/preschool dolls and vehicles during the same time period. NPD data also indicates that Europe, despite its recent economic challenges, remains relatively stable through May 2012, reinforcing our belief that the toy industry holds up well in the tough economic times. Using NPD data, that represents about half of the total toy industry. And our global and market experience, we continue to see overall global toy industry growth due to positive demographic trends and toy spending in emerging and developing markets.","As I've said on several occasions, one of Mattel's greatest assets and points of difference is our diverse portfolio of brands, countries and customers. And for the quarter, we experienced strength across all areas. While still early in the year, we experienced good momentum across many of our core brands: Barbie, Hot Wheels and American Girl, as well as strong growth in our Monster High franchise. And we saw positive momentum across a number of our licensed entertainment brands: Disney Princess, with the new movie Brave; Batman, The Dark Knight Rises; Disney's new Jake and the Never Land Pirates; and WWE.","Let's start with the Barbie brand, which experienced a strong second quarter. According to NPD through May 2012, Barbie continues to gain doll supercategory share, both in the U.S. and the Euro 5. We continue to see strength in Barbie's core fashion lines and this year's spring entertainment, Mermaid Tale 2, which was also a growth driver in the quarter.","Addition to spring entertainment, we did an extensive brand campaign that's been activated across toys, apparel and accessories in more than 70 countries. The campaign invites girls of all ages to see what happens when they play with Barbie. This May, we launched our first older-girl content with Barbie's Life in the Dreamhouse with 15 episodes to give girls a glimpse into Barbie's life with her sisters, pets, friends and, of course, her boyfriend, Ken. The campaign launched in 21 languages on Barbie.com and on YouTube and, since early May, has generated 5 million views across the website and YouTube globally. Feedback with older girls has been incredibly positive.","Staying within the doll category, Monster High continues to perform very well as the #2 selling fashion doll through May 2012, according to NPD. On Friday, April 13, Monster High's computer-animated film, Escape from Skull Shores, premiered on Nickelodeon. Rolling out throughout the year, the film will be shown around the world on a variety of key broadcasters.","And finally, Disney Princess did very well this quarter, and we're encouraged with the early performance of the new movie, Brave. The American Girl brand continues to perform well due to the momentum of the 2012 Girl of the Year, McKenna, and we've been very pleased with our performance at retail, including the recent store opening in St. Louis.","Our Hot Wheels brand also made significant progress in the second quarter, not only at retail, but also in the cultural marketplace. As many of you know, 2 drivers for Team Hot Wheels recently set a Guinness World Records title at the X Games Los Angeles for successfully racing through a 60-foot-tall double vertical loop, which was a recreation of the classic orange track, emulating our spring TV driver, Double Dare Snare. The life-size orange track set defied gravity with a first-of-its-kind, 2-driver challenge. The publicity from this event has generated more than 2.2 billion global impressions and counting.","Staying with vehicles, the Cars line continues to perform very well as an evergreen property. As we've always said, our entertainment strategy continues to be: Partner with the best and be the best partner, which includes, not only licensing of exciting and current movie releases and properties like Batman The Dark Knight Rises, Disney Pixar's Brave and Disney's Jake and the Never Land Pirates, but also evergreen properties like Disney Princess, WWE, Dora the Explorer, Mickey Mouse Clubhouse and more.","For Fisher-Price, overall shipping was positive, including Fisher-Price Friends. We continue to see encouraging signs of progress on the fundamentals of repositioning the Fisher-Price core brands. As I've said before, 2012 remains a transition year as we continue to strengthen Fisher-Price on a global basis and focus on communication building blocks like television advertising and an expanded digital presence while preparing to launch new packaging and more innovative products for 2013. In fact, during the quarter, we've relaunched our website in the U.S. designed precisely with today's moms in mind. International versions of the new Fisher-Price.com design will be rolling out through the summer, reaching 38 different markets in 33 different languages. Fisher-Price Friends also launched a new line of product to support the hit Disney property, Jake and the Never Land Pirates. Early reads of POS and shipments are encouraging.","As it relates to HIT Entertainment, we are very pleased with the progress we made welcoming this very talented team to the larger Mattel organization. Thomas & Friends is performing well at retail, and we're making good progress in preparing the launch of the wood line for 2013. We're also very encouraged with what we see from Mike the Knight, both in the U.K. and the U.S. And as a result, we are investing in a second season of Mike the Knight content and are planning a full consumer products and toy line rollout over the next 12 months.","Looking beyond revenue, Mattel achieved solid overall second quarter results because we continued to complement our focus on brand building with a disciplined approach and an emphasis on costs and gross margins. We continue to work very hard to manage our overall basket of costs, including commodities, currency and labor, as well as optimize our sales mix of countries and brands to deliver gross margins consistent with our long-term goal of about 50%. And we remain on track to deliver our Operational Excellence 2.0 savings target of $175 million.","So we finished the first half with positive momentum. That said, we have much work ahead of us to succeed in 2012. Looking ahead, we believe we have the opportunity to continue to build momentum as we roll out our innovative products and brand-building promotional programs around the world.","First, we are well positioned in the dolls category. For fall, the Barbie brand is releasing its first musical in 7 years with Princess and the Popstar. From an innovation standpoint, the brand is blending the best of digital play with fashion play with the launch of Barbie Photo Fashion doll, where girls can take more than 100 digital pictures with Barbie and display those images as a T-shirt design on the doll.","For Monster High, we're introducing more content, dolls, new characters and segments throughout the line. Monster High is launching a new extension to the Create-a-Monster line, which is a line that allows girls to customize all parts of the doll, including the face, through the application of body\/hair [ph]. And Monster High is releasing its first DVD, Ghouls Rule!, in the fall through a newly created Universal DVD alliance.","In American Girl news, a McKenna-themed video, McKenna Shoots for the Stars, was released on DVD on July 3 and aired on NBC's Family Movie Night last Saturday, July 14th. We're also opening 2 stores in the second half: Houston in September and Miami in October. And on September 4, American Girl is launching a new historical character, Caroline Abbott, who's story takes place in 1812. In the third quarter, Mattel will support the platinum DVD release of Cinderella with a broad line of dolls, accessories and fashions to maximize this historic event. And in time for the holiday, the DVD of the Disney Pixar film, Brave, is slated to be released.","In the Wheels aisle, we'll be introducing a brand-new Hot Wheels segment called Ballistics [ph], which are balls that transform into cars. These are completely unique to the market. We'll continue to focus on building and aligning the Fisher-Price brand behind the Joy of Learning campaign, both with television advertising and the new digital support programs.","As we look forward into 2013, we're also working on other building blocks including enhanced product innovation, new packaging and expanded retailer support. Our newest top-5 brand, Thomas & Friends, will launch its fall entertainment tentpole, Blue Mountain Mystery, set to be released in September with strong support at retail.","And when it comes to the digital space, I think about the role of digital in 3 ways. First, digital serves as an excellent delivery system for brand building with consumers, whether through websites, apps or engagement. Second, and perhaps in its most powerful form, it serves to amplify existing play patterns. Our new Hot Wheels activity product, which launched exclusively in Apple Stores at the end of June, is a great example as it allows boys to play out the classic Hot Wheels play pattern right on the iPad, making play more portable and dynamic. We'll have an entire portfolio of Mattel activity products, supporting Mattel brands and Fisher-Price this fall. And third, digital is a source of intellectual property. We continue to see success with the analog execution of Angry Birds and are adding to our line of digital [indiscernible] this year.","While we're happy with where we're positioned with our customers, looking ahead, we will continue to work with them to manage shipments, consumer takeaway and retail inventories. Toys remain an important holiday driver for retailers across a number of channels and store types, and we're confident that we have the momentum, the products and the marketing programs in place with our retailers for the all-important holiday season.","Overall, we delivered a good quarter and a solid first half, and we're focused to execute well as we transition from the preseason to the season. From a headwind's perspective, we don't expect the second half to look much different from the first. We anticipate a challenged global economy that could continue to drive fluctuations in both input costs and currencies and a continued cautious global retail environment.","Nonetheless, we have the power brands like Barbie, Monster High, Hot Wheels, American Girl, Thomas & Friends and Fisher-Price that kids and moms want. We have a slate of evergreen entertainment properties like Batman, Disney Princess, Cars, WWE and newcomer Jake and the Never Land Pirates that balance out the portfolio. And we have a strong track record of successfully executing in the all-important holiday season.","And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Mattel's CFO, Kevin Farr.","Kevin M. Farr","Thank you, Bryan, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter performance continues to demonstrate the strength of our portfolio brands, countries and customers and our discipline to deliver solid, profitable results to our shareholders.","In the second quarter, Mattel delivered a 20% increase in operating profit and a 19% increase in net income. These strong results were anchored by gross margin gains that offset a tough entertainment comparison, considerable currency headwinds, turbulent economic news and a cautious retail environment. Core brands performed well in the quarter with positive sales growth in Barbie, Hot Wheels and American Girl. Monster High was also a standout in the quarter, and we're encouraged by the initial sales of Batman and Brave. Our international portfolios demonstrate continued strength despite a tough global economy and foreign exchange rates that worked against us. Brazil, Mexico, Eastern Europe, China, India and the U.K. all had strong growth, excluding the impact from foreign exchange. That said, we know that our great portfolio of brands in countries is only as good as our execution, and we continue to focus on our need to deliver against key business drivers.","We have 2 key priorities in 2012: the successful transition to our new North American division structure and the integration of HIT Entertainment. Let me give you an update on each of these.","For the quarter, the North American division focused on new retail executions and deepened its relationships with its customers. We saw tangible results in this improved alignment as we grew sales, as well as increased NPD share across many categories.","With HIT Entertainment, we continued its integration into Mattel. As you know, we acquired HIT with the goal of growing its brand portfolios, and we have made good progress in adding its organization and core competencies in licensing and content development to Mattel. We continue to leverage Mattel's global infrastructure to grow the HIT brands across the world, and this is very evident as we prepare for the launch of Thomas entertainment this fall with Blue Mountain Mystery. For the first time, this will be a retail tentpole event with coordinated marketing programs across consumer products, content and toys. This launch strategy emulates our successful go-to-market approach that has worked well for Barbie fall tentpole events. And we continue to prepare for the launch of the Thomas wood line in 2013. In the second quarter, we began showing the lines to our retailers, and it was well received.","In addition to these key priorities, we continue to execute on our Operational Excellence 2.0 cost savings initiatives, delivering an incremental gross savings of $23 million for the quarter. As we announced earlier this year, we've increased our goal from $150 million to $175 million for 2012, and we will use some of the program's savings to reinvest on strategic growth initiatives.","Let me give you a quick update on some of these investments. One of HIT Entertainment's newest brands, Mike the Knight, continues to show promise, recording strong ratings, both here in the U.S. on Nickelodeon, as well as in Western Europe on stations like CBeebies in the U.K. and Super RTL in Germany. Accordingly, we are greenlighting a second season to begin airing later next year. And with this ratings and distribution success, consumer products will be hitting the shelves, primarily in Western Europe, later this year. Fisher-Price will be the global toy manufacturer for Mike the Knight, with the first item scheduled to launch in the U.S. and Canada in fall 2013.","We're also making investments to grow core bands faster or yield additional cost savings. For example, given the consistently strong results of the American Girl brand, we continue to invest in improving online and retail distribution business model. Our newest American Girl store in St. Louis opened in April and is exceeding expectations and will be followed up with 2 new store openings in Houston and Miami this fall.","On the information technology front, we are investing in upgrading American Girl's e-commerce infrastructure to provide further growth and potentially leverage it to support our other core brands. This technology should allow us to better align with how consumers are buying products today while improving Mattel's overall global capabilities to market digitally.","We're also investing in new product life cycle management system to improve our design, development and manufacturing processes while providing greater cost transparency. When fully implemented, this system should help us to continue to deliver against our gross margin target by improving design and toy value and potentially help to offset future input cost increases.","And one final example we mentioned on our call last quarter, our investment in our new subsidiary in Russia has already begun to contribute to our international growth. The incremental SG&A spend increase investments I just described is around 70 basis points year-to-date and should yield significant payback down the road. The additional savings from our O.E. 2.0 savings will continue to fund these investments, as well as other investments such as the launch of new franchises. As we've shown with Monster High, we can bring new franchises to the market for a modest investment. We are currently investing in a new franchise that will be launched in 2013 that we'll tell you more about later this year, and we continue to evaluate other ideas for future franchise launches.","So now let's go into the detail around some of our results for the second quarter. Starting on Page 4 of the slide deck, you can see that our worldwide gross sales there were roughly flat for the quarter as growth in our North American region was partially offset by our international region. Based on the latest NPD data, we gained category share in both the U.S. and the Euro 5. And retail has continued to tightly manage their inventories due to concerns about consumer spending and the uncertain global economy. We worked closely with our retail partners to ensure that shipping, consumer takeaway and retail inventories were better aligned across our portfolio of brands. As we enter the second half of 2012, we're pleased with the current state of both our inventories and those of our retail partners.","Turning to Page 5 of the slide presentation, you can see the sales by brand. Worldwide sales for Mattel girls and boys brands were down 1% for the quarter, impacted by currency exchange and a tough entertainment comparison. There was strong growth in our core properties, with Barbie sales up 5% and Hot Wheels up 11%. Monster High contributed to drive growth in our girls business, while Disney Princesses, Batman, Cars and WWE remained strong evergreen properties. Worldwide Fisher-Price sales were up 2% for the quarter, aided by the addition of HIT and good performances in Disney properties like Jake and the Never Land Pirates, partially offset by declines in other brands. American Girl continued to deliver strong results with sales up 3% for the quarter. Our Girl of the Year, McKenna, is performing extremely well, as is the My American Girl line. And we continue to see good momentum in our retail operations, especially with our new store openings.","On Page 6, we highlight the performance of our North American region, which includes American Girl in our North American division, which consists of operations in the U.S. and Canada. Overall, sales for the region were up 1% despite a tough entertainment comparison.","Our international business, seen on Page 7, continues to show strength, remaining relatively flat despite currency impacts. We're current [ph] with our performance in Europe, where revenues were down 2%, including a 10-percentage-point unfavorable impact from currency. In Latin America, revenues were down 1%, including a 13-point unfavorable impact from currency, with strength across the entire region. In Asia Pacific, revenues were up 1%, including a 4% unfavorable impact from currency, with growth in India and China in local currency.","Now let's review the P&L, starting off on Page 8 of the slide presentation. Gross margins for the quarter were 51.3%, 340 basis points higher than last year. To date, we've benefited from favorable product mix, including lower sales of royalty-related entertainment properties, our price increases and O.E. 2.0 cost savings, partially offset by higher input costs. As expected, the HIT acquisition also had a positive impact in margins this quarter.","As seen on Page 9 of the slide presentation, for the quarter, selling, general, administrative expenses increased approximately $20 million to $351 million. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expense was 30.3%, up 180 basis points compared with the prior year rate of 28.5%. Legal savings, the positive impact to currency and O.E. 2.0 savings partially offset the impact of HIT, higher employee-related expenses and the strategic investments that we discussed earlier. Excluding the HIT acquisition and integration costs and HIT's ongoing SG&A, Mattel's SG&A is down slightly year-to-date in absolute dollars.","Page 10 of the presentation summarizes the performance of our Global Cost Leadership initiative and continuing efforts in our ongoing Operational Excellence 2.0 program. As I mentioned earlier, we delivered incremental Operational Excellence 2.0 gross savings of $23 million for the quarter. We're on track to deliver the $175 million in cumulative savings by the end of 2012.","Turning to Page 11, operating income in the second quarter was $131.4 million or 11.3% of net sales, up 190 basis points compared with last year's second quarter despite flat sales. The increase in operating income was driven by strong gross margins, partially offset by higher SG&A.","Turning to Page 12, earnings per share for the quarter were $0.28, driven by improved operating income that was partially offset by higher interest expense. As we did last quarter, we want to give you some additional information that will help you to continue to understand the impact of HIT on our business in 2012. We continue to expect that the acquisition should not have a material impact in our business in 2012 but should be accretive to our business going forward. We expect operating profit for the business this year to be offset by acquisition and integration costs, as well as intangible amortization and interest expense.","Page 13 outlines both the estimated integration and amortization costs of HIT. For the quarter, acquisition and integration expenses were $1 million, and we expect these expenses to total between $25 million and $30 million for the year. These expenses include acquisition fees, consulting fees, severance and IT infrastructure costs. In addition, we also incurred about $1 million in expenses related to the amortization of intangibles. For the year, we expect these expenses to be about $5 million to $6 million.","As you can see on Page 14, for the first 6 months of the year, cash flow used for operations was $61 million compared to $227 million last year, driven primarily by improvements in accounts receivable and inventory. Year-to-date capital expenditures were $107 million, up $5 million from last year. For the year, we continue to expect to spend about $215 million to $225 million in capital as we make investments primarily to increase capacity in our own manufacturing facilities, expand our retail operations at American Girl and to fund the upfront costs of acquiring software, hardware and system design work, primarily through our strategic IT projects. Year-to-date, cash flow used for financing activities and others decreased mainly due to the prior year payments on long-term debt borrowings.","So to recap cash flow for the first half of the year, we increased capital deployment through the acquisition of HIT Entertainment and our higher quarterly dividend payments, which were partially offset by the improvement in operating cash flow and fewer share repurchases. As a result, our cash on hand at the end of the first 6 months was $372 million, down $46 million from the prior year.","Looking forward, we continue to have a strong balance sheet in a business that generates consistent cash flow which we'll continue to deploy to enhance shareholder value. Today we announced our third quarter dividend of $0.31 per share, reflecting the annualized dividend of $1.24, which represents a 35% increase to our 2011 dividend of $0.92. We remain committed to our capital deployment strategy to maintain $800 million to $1 billion in year-end cash, to maintain a year-end debt-to-total-capital ratio of about 35% and to return excess fund to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","In 2012, we expect to end the year with cash and debt levels consistent with our capital framework, and there will be 3 key drivers for cash deployment in 2012: the acquisition of HIT Entertainment for $680 million; an increased dividend payout to an annualized dividend of $1.24 per share, which will return approximately $430 million back to shareholders; and capital expenditures of about $215 million to $225 million, reflecting increased investments in company growth initiatives. The balance of excess cash will be deployed over time opportunistically for share repurchases and targeted acquisitions.","So in summary, we are pleased with our strong quarterly results and recognize that we have more work to do since we are just entering our peak season. We continue to have momentum in most of the same key areas that drove our strong financial performance in 2011. And we remain committed to executing our growth plans for key brands like Fisher-Price and key retailers around the globe. We believe that our fundamentals are strong, and the investments made this quarter will allow us to continue to create value for our shareholders.","That concludes my review of the financial results. Now we'd like to open up the call to questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Gerrick Johnson of BMO Capital Markets.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I was wondering if you guys can talk about currency and how it impacted your income statement. Particularly, it looks like it helped gross margin, and if there is any benefit from hedging activities and where that might have fallen.","Kevin M. Farr","Okay, Gerrick, with regard to overall -- with regard to ForEx in our results, there was a 5% unfavorable impact to our worldwide gross sales. And there was a 2% unfavorable impact to EPS. So that was the overall impact to gross -- to our operating results. With regard to the ForEx and hedging, we do -- given the significant manufacturing and marketing operations outside the U.S., we hedge about 50% of our transaction exposure as we look out over the next 12 to 18 months. We use this strategy for our transaction exposure designed to protect the downside and take advantage of opportunities in the market if possible. Now I won't comment on the impact of foreign exchange specifically on gross margins, but I can provide you with a good rule of thumb for estimating the impact of ForEx to sales and EPS for the second half of the year. All else being equal, a good rule of thumb is every 1% change in the U.S. dollar index should impact annual EPS by about 1% to 2% and impacts revenues by about 0.5 percentage point. And with respect to -- if you look at it, with respect to ForEx for the first half, basically for the quarter and the first half, foreign exchange has minimal impact on gross margins.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. When you guys do report a benefit or, let's say, a loss from hedging, what line does that fall in?","Kevin M. Farr","To the extent that -- well, it falls into gross margin if it replies to hedging for inventory.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. Great. That makes sense. And one more for me. Brave toys, where are you filing those? Are those in entertainment or in the girls -- Other Girls segment?","Kevin M. Farr","It's in Disney Princesses, so it's Other Girls.","Operator","The next question is from Tim Conder of Wells Fargo.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just a couple of pieces here. The manufacturing, you mentioned that, that's really going to be one of your ongoing focuses here of investments, and you've mentioned that before. Can you kind of give us a little bit of a framework where you stand on the portion that you will own of your own manufacturing by -- at the end of '12 and '13? And then in relation to that and HIT, how was the integration of the diecast and plastic business going? On plan, ahead of plan? If you could just give a little bit of color there.","Bryan G. Stockton","Tim, it's Bryan here. Let me start with our -- our overall manufacturing strategy has been pretty consistent over the past decade, and we like where we are. We are about 50\/50 in terms of what we produce internally versus what we use with outside vendors. We think that gives us a couple of distinct advantages. Number one, we really have our fingers on the pulse of what's happening in the toy industry, with issues like labor costs and testing and things of that nature. And because we have such dynamic and powerful brands like Barbie, it also gives us a kind of scale to be able to support a dedicated operation for that. So we like that strategy. We don't see that really changing drastically in the future. So I think you can look forward to that. As it relates to HIT, we're pleased on a number of fronts with where we are with that. As I've told you before, it's a tremendously talented organization. One of the things we've been working on is trying to see how we can work together on things like content production, content creation, content distribution. We're happy with that. And related to your question about bringing their products in, we will be bringing the diecast into our plants. As you know, we had a very strong presence in diecast operations. So we're always looking at it at the scale and opportunities to bring things into our plants, where it makes sense, but we'll probably stay about 50\/50 long term.","Kevin M. Farr","Yes, and I think with regard to that, we're on track to bring the diecast manufacturing into our plants effective 2013. It really shows what we've been doing over the last couple of years of really sweating our existing asset base with regard to our plants. We've been working on productivity improvements through low-level automation. We've been using Lean to make us more efficient. That has freed up floor space. And as we've freed up that floor space, we are making investments in plant expansion, not new plants, really getting more out of the plants that we have through investing in expansion in things like fashion doll capacity and diecast capacity.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, okay. So the diecast will be on -- will be in-house at the beginning of '13, just to clarify there. And then the plastic, is that already in-house or that also on the same timetable?","Bryan G. Stockton","That's where the line is a little more complicated. We're -- we'll be looking at the best use of our assets regarding plastic.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, Bryan, in relation to all the manufacturing and so forth there, you gentlemen talked about your gap to price increase. We're hearing from some other industries that towards the back half of the year, and I would think more for the toy industry it would be fourth quarter and beyond, that assuming commodities stay where they are and transportation costs, with diesel,everything has come down, could you potentially start to see some little bit of a tailwind from that, say, fourth quarter and beyond given everything else is pretty well already locked in?","Bryan G. Stockton","Well, if you can predict what the costs of commodities are going to be in the second half, come see us later today. But it's going to be a very dynamic environment, we think, in terms of commodities. Kevin, do you want to comment?","Kevin M. Farr","Yes. Just thought you'd like to talk about where we're at, at the half. In the first half, gross margin rate is 51.2%. It was up 250 basis points from the 48.7% in the first half of 2011. And as I said, the key drivers were favorable product mix, including lower royalties related to entertainment, our price increases and O.E. 2.0 savings, partially offset by higher product costs. And in the first half of the year, we're really benefiting from lower royalties in Cars shipment, which were significantly lower in the first half of 2012, as we expected. The favorable impact from lower royalties expected to be less pronounced in the second half of the year, via higher sales of Batman, Brave and Cinderella, as well as the fact that our royalty-related entertainment business is a smaller portion of our total business in the second half of the year. It also had a positive impact in gross margins for the first half, but given the modest seasonality of their business, we expect less positive benefit in the balance of the year there, as well as we continue to operate in an inflationary environment as economy slowly recovers and input costs continue to rise. And although commodity costs have come down recently, our input costs have increased in 2012, including higher overall raw material costs, Chinese and Asian labor rates, Chinese currency, tooling and freight and distribution costs. And we're currently entering our peak production period which requires us to continue to procure raw materials and other input costs. And as you know, the majority of our input costs can't be hedged. So at this point, it's impossible to predict our future input costs through the high volatility in commodity costs and foreign exchange rates. So our priority continues to be to sustain the progress we've made delivering gross margins at least 50%, which we've achieved for the last 3 years.","Operator","The next question is from Margaret Whitfield of Sterne Agee Capital.","Margaret B. Whitfield - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I wondered if you could comment on what you're seeing in Southern Europe. You mentioned the U.K. was strong and what the outlook might be. For Kevin, that second quarter tax rate was lower than the first. What should we expect for the year? And Bryan, I wondered if you could comment on your strategies for the wood lines since you've shown it to retailers and gotten some of their feedback.","Bryan G. Stockton","Margaret, let me start first with Europe. Where we always start when we try to assess what's going on in any given geographies, we start with the category POS. And as I mentioned in my comments, we're very pleased to see the toy category essentially flat in Europe. And again, we think that's another positive sign that this category tends to be fairly resilient to economic crises, and Europe has certainly had a lot of unease in terms of economics lately. So things vary by customer, by country, but generally, I would say retailers there are cautious as they are here. They are supporting brands that have momentum, which we have. And I think they, too, are looking forward to a positive holiday season. Let me comment on wood, then I'll turn it over to Kevin to wrap up your questions. Now our plans for wood are, we're going to do what we always do best, which is make sure we have the best product and we have the best packaging. We translate that into strong retail execution across the globe and support it with what we like to call statements and stories, whether that's in the form of DVDs or advertising or some other way of engaging the brand with consumers. So I would say we're just going to do what we do best, and we'll make it a success. Kevin?","Kevin M. Farr","Yes, finally, Margaret, your question on the tax rate. The tax rate in the second quarter, both 2011 and 2012 benefited from some discrete period items, which is a timing issue from the perspective of the full year tax rate for both years. For 2012, we believe the worldwide effective tax rate will be around 22% to 23%.","Operator","The next question is from Robert Carroll of UBS.","Robert W. Carroll - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just a quick question on the commentary for the POS, your retail inventories and the shipments. I know earlier when you guys said that things have -- the alignment has improved in H1. I mean, does that imply any sort of, I guess, bounce back during Q2 relative to what is seen during Q1?","Bryan G. Stockton","Yes, I think there's a couple of things going on. We look at our business really kind of first half, second half, and there are a lot of dynamics in the first half. We're always dealing with the timing of Easter and how good was the -- or bad was the carryover from Christmas. So the first quarter can be a little bit choppy, and I think we experienced it, and I'm sure others in other industries may have as well. What we see is we see a lot of activity, I'd say, at retail engagement, particularly in the post-Easter period. And you've seen our POS, essentially almost across the board, start to pick up positive momentum, which we think is good. Retailers seemed to be responding to that, as well as to making sure that we're well positioned for events like the movie Brave and Batman The Dark Knight Rises. So there's a lot of good things going on out there, so we're feeling like we're in better balance exiting the first half, and we're carrying some momentum into the second half.","Robert W. Carroll - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. So I mean -- I guess just to clarify that, so I mean, if we were still working on Q1 and then we're in better balance, like so there may have been -- obviously, we're getting into the more important season of the year. But I mean, it may have just been a little bit of a bounce back to get things back in line.","Bryan G. Stockton","No, I would say given the level of caution that we see across the board with most of our retailers, retailers are buying what's selling. And that's why I say I was pleased to see our POS begin to pick up more positive momentum in the last half of the quarter. When you have strong POS, that generally helps in the shipping area, so we felt good about that. So I would say we're getting in better balance, and we're feeling pretty positive right now.","Robert W. Carroll - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. I guess, one other, I guess, somewhat follow-up to that. You guys had cited a North American reorganization as a reason for some of the strong recent performances in retail in terms of deepening relationships and share gains. I guess, anything more granular you guys could give in terms of recent wins, or how that's helping, or how it can continue to help going forward?","Bryan G. Stockton","Well, this new organization was put in place, as we've always said, to drag decision-making closer to our retail customers and our consumers. And I think what you're seeing is that there's not a silver bullet in here anywhere. It's just a stronger alignment with our customers, stronger execution of great plans with our customers, and I think we're beginning to see the benefit of that through the second quarter. There's a lot of work ahead of us in the second half. So this organization is off to a great start. We have a lot to prove with this organization and our customers in the second half. But we feel like, as Kevin mentioned, this is one of our big priorities, and it's off to a solid start.","Operator","The next question is from Felicia Hendrix of Barclays.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just a quick follow-up to the last question. Just on point of sales, you said that it picked up kind of at the end of the quarter. But in the quarter, was it up?","Bryan G. Stockton","Well, what I would say is that our POS is generally in line with our shipments. Overall, when you look at the first half, so we're, I think, actually feeling pretty good about this, especially with the exiting momentum. We're seeing strong improvements in Fisher-Price, for example, in the last half of the quarter. So I would tell you that we're feeling like we're pretty well aligned and well positioned for the second half.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Great. And then actually while we're on Fisher-Price because that was one of my questions, you did discuss some of the data points. Just wondering when exactly we should expect to see the benefit of your restructuring. Is it more next year or do you think it will be sooner?","Bryan G. Stockton","Well, this is something where we always are very careful about what we say about Fisher-Price because Fisher-Price is still gaining share of the total toy category, in the infant\/preschool category in the U.S. and in Europe. So the brand is still successful. What we believe we're trying to do is we're trying to help this brand achieve its global potential. And that's why we're working so hard on the building blocks, like the advertising and the digital space in our website, as well as working on other things for next year. So as you recall, we've always said this is a mom-driven brand, which tends to respond a little more slowly than a kid-driven brand. So I would hope that as we continue to work on these building blocks, that we'll begin to see some improvements in the near future.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just finally on Other Girls, it seems like it was mostly Monster High, but I just wanted to confirm that because, obviously, Disney Princesses and Brave was in there. So 2 parts: one, was it mostly Monster High? And then second, how should we think about the back half shipments for Other Girls, especially given how strong it was in this quarter?","Kevin M. Farr","Yes, I think when you look at Other Girls, the key driver of that was Monster High. We did see benefits from Disney Princesses, but that was the key driver. With regard for the balance of the year, we're not going to project what we're going to do there, but we do see a great trajectory with regard to Monster High continuing. And with respect to Disney Princesses, we do have the Cinderella DVD release in the second half of the year. And we have momentum in 2012 behind both those brands, which is very similar to the momentum that we're building off of coming out of 2011 into 2012. So good momentum in overall fashion dolls, and particularly in things like Monster High and Disney Princesses.","Operator","The next question is from Linda Bolton-Weiser of Caris.","Linda Bolton-Weiser - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just kind of thinking about some of the long-term objectives you have. You've done a really great job in the last few years on both O.E. 1.0 and O.E. 2.0. And so I'm kind of wondering what your rough thinking is going forward after 2012, when O.E. 2.0 is completed. Most of the big, high-quality consumer product companies, like Colgate or Kimberly-Clark, kind of report to analysts on annual productivity, cost cutting. Some of them even give how much productivity was in gross margin versus SG&A. And your cost reduction seemed to correlate, the calculation was about 2% productivity in the last few years annually. And most of those other companies have a little bit higher, more on the order of 3% product -- annual productivity, even higher for some companies. Are you going to transition to thinking of annual productivity in that way? Or do you plan another multi-year restructuring program that's very discrete? Or can you just give us some idea about your long-term cost reduction goals?","Bryan G. Stockton","Well, I guess, let's say, I think we've been very focused in on improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the business over the last couple of years. And we started out in 2009 and '10, and we've delivered cost savings initiatives. And to date, with both our Global Cost Leadership Program and now we've been executing O.E. 2.0, we've delivered over $350 million of savings to date. And we're on track to deliver under O.E. 2.0 $175 million of savings cumulatively at a run rate coming out of 2012. And we do have a culture of continuous improvement, trying to be more effective and efficient, and that we do see more opportunities in things like packaging in the supply chain. So we'll continue our focus in on really improving our effectiveness and efficiency, and that should result in continued cost savings as we look out to the future.","Linda Bolton-Weiser - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","Great. And then can I just ask you about HIT? You had said, I think, last call, and maybe you said something again this time about $0.07 of integration cost maybe roughly for the year, and I believe there were $0.04 in the first quarter and very little in this quarter, if I remember what you said. So is that still accurate that you expect maybe $0.03 more for the remainder of the year? And any idea how that will break out between the third and fourth quarter? And is HIT's seasonality of sales and profit, like operating profit, like similar to the overall company?","Bryan G. Stockton","Okay. So on the seasonality, it's a little less seasonal than we are. Our seasonality is about 1\/3, 2\/3, first half, second half. With respect to the integration and deal costs, again, in the slide deck we provided you today, we reiterated our expectation is to have $25 million to $30 million of integration and restructuring charges. I'm not going to get in the timing of third quarter, fourth quarter, but we would be looking to later in the back half of the year.","Linda Bolton-Weiser - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","And then in Monster High, I mean, that's done really great as a new franchise you've developed internally. Our store checks indicate that there's actually like shortage in some of the big retailers of certain SKUs that are just not on the shelf. Are you experiencing any supply shortages there? And then secondly, in terms of the new franchise for next year, would you be able to say is that going to be a boys or a girls property?","Bryan G. Stockton","Great questions. Monster High is selling extraordinarily well, and I'm sure there are pockets out there somewhere where there's a little dislocation in inventory, given the high demand that's being created by all the great marketing efforts that are out there. And we're operating the plants. If we could go 28\/8, we would, but we're operating almost 24\/7 to make sure that we supply all of our fashion dolls because we do have momentum on Barbie, on Disney Princess and on Monster High as well. So we're working very hard on that. Regarding the next property, as I mentioned, we're not really ready to talk about that. When we see you all in October, we're planning to tell you a little bit more about that. I can tell you that it will be either a girls or a boys property.","Operator","The next question is from Eric Handler of MKM Partners.","Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Just trying to dig in to your gross margin a little bit more. If you took out your hedging gains that you got in the quarter, how much of an improvement would you have actually seen in your gross margin?","Kevin M. Farr","I think I said earlier that when we look at first half results, both for the quarter and for the first half, foreign exchange had a minimal impact in gross margins.","Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Okay. So the hedging gains was actually quite -- was rather insignificant then.","Kevin M. Farr","From the perspective of the growth improvement, the gross margin rate had a minimal impact.","Operator","The next question is from Mike Swartz of SunTrust.","Michael A. Swartz - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","A question around some of the investment commentary you made earlier in the call. I think you said that there's about 70 basis points in incremental SG&A spend year-to-date. How should we look at that for the full year? I mean, is that a good number to kind of run rate for the year? Should it be more than that, less than that?","Kevin M. Farr","We really don't give guidance. I think with regard to the first half, that's been the run rate. And with regard to really the second half of the year, it's probably a good way to estimate it. But again, we continue to look at opportunities to invest in strategic growth initiatives that are going to have a good payback.","Operator","The next question is from Sean McGowan of Needham & Company.","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Two questions. One, can you give us an update just on where things stand regarding the appeal, the Bratz issue?","Bryan G. Stockton","Sean, because it's ongoing litigation, I'm not going to go into a lot of detail about it other than to say that, as you know, the appeal has been fully briefed by both sides in the Ninth Circuit. The next step is an oral argument before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. No date has been set yet for the oral arguments, but we anticipate it should occur towards the end of this year possibly or the first half of 2013.","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then we'd start another meter as to how long that will be until that decision is made?","Bryan G. Stockton","Well, as I think we've said before, the cost of appeals is significantly lower than...","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","I didn't mean the cost meter, I meant the time meter. Like that just starts another, whatever, months of process until a decision is made after the oral arguments?","Bryan G. Stockton","Yes, it's -- as you can imagine, it's a complex process. And we could see the appeal carrying on in through 2013 or even '14.","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Wow. Okay. And then Kevin or Bryan, if could you give us some indication of what the impact was of revenue from HIT. What would Fisher-Price have looked like without it? And is all the revenue from HIT in Fisher-Price?","Bryan G. Stockton","Well, we're not going to get into splitting hairs on Fisher-Price, but I think Kevin has given you some numbers before on the size of HIT. Kevin, you might want to review those again.","Kevin M. Farr","Yes, I think with respect to the full year, I think, we've -- when we parted [ph], they we're doing about $180 million of revenues. And we think for the full year, that the revenues are going to be lower due to 2 major factors: the Fisher-Price royalty payment on plastic and diecast products will no longer be recorded as revenue but a reduction to royalty expense; and 2012 will only include 11 months of operations. So we expect both of these adjustments to be lowered by -- result lower revenues by $30 million to $35 million for the year. And if you look at those numbers, and I think we've given you before that the first half, second half is a little less seasonal than Mattel, and our first half, second half is 1\/3, 2\/3. So I think you'd get back to a number for the first half based upon that. With respect to Fisher-Price, if you do exclude HIT, it is down, and you can see detail on core in Friends in the information that we provided you.","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And HIT is tracking to your expectations?","Kevin M. Farr","So far, so good.","Operator","The next question is from Michael Kelter of Goldman Sachs.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask about the U.S. toy industry trends overall. As you mentioned, MPDU [ph] is down mid-single digits through May. And while you guys are taking share and growing internationally, I wanted to understand your view on what's going on with the domestic toy market. Some people are concerned about secular -- your shift in play patterns for younger children, away from traditional toys and games. And I was just hoping to get an understanding from your perspectives, whether there are screeners for that idea or whether you have any evidence that the slowdown is driven by something else, and what that something else might be.","Bryan G. Stockton","Michael, thanks for the question. I guess our point of view is we're still positive about the toy industry even in the U.S. despite sort of a slower start to it this year. We look at the categories that we compete in, and those categories are outperforming the overall average growth rate for toys. This is an industry, as you know, that responds to innovation. And when you look at the growth, for example, in fashion dolls, we believe what's driving a lot of the category growth is all the great activities on things like Barbie and Monster High and Disney Princess. So there's a lot of branding things that we believe we're doing. We need to have strong retail execution. Our customers still believe it's going to be a positive holiday season. So we've not heard anything nor have we seen anything that would indicate there is some sort of secular decline in the toy industry. If there was, I think you'd see it more consistently across other countries as well. And one of the things that we try to do, as we always talk about, is our portfolio of brands and our portfolio of customers and our portfolio of countries, that we work very hard that when we have kind of a bit of a rough patch from a category standpoint here the U.S., we're working even harder in places like Latin America and Eastern Europe and Asia to drive our revenues.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Is there any risk given the slowdown, overall, in the industry that retailers might stock less toys or shrink the square footage overall over the near or mid-term? Is that something that you're dealing with? Or is that taking it a step too far?","Bryan G. Stockton","Well, I would ask retailers directly that question. I don't think we're in a position to really comment on what they're thinking. But as you know, we work very closely with our retailers far in advance. And we're planning on having a good, positive holiday season, and I think they are as well, and there is nothing that we're seeing or hearing that would indicate otherwise.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then one other quick question. The advertising and promotion line is down in dollars, about 5% year-to-date. Is that something that you're just realizing in the savings of nonworking media? Or is there a shift, and you'd be spending more in the back half than you had in the first half? Or what else is going on that's driving that line item down?","Kevin M. Farr","Yes. I think the fact that HIT hasn't been integrated into our operations and they do less advertising because it's more of a license business, and their licensees do advertising, I think what we've said is we target 11% to 13%. And over the last couple of years, we've been at that lower end of the range, and we expect at the end to be at the lower end of the range. In the total year, HIT won't have that much of an impact on the total rate. And we will be making the same amount or more impressions this year than we did last year. So no real change in our global investment around media. We are trying to get more for the same amount of money with regard to impressions, and we're looking at new media opportunities in other ways to connect with consumers, particularly on things like Fisher-Price, where we know digital is a place to be because that's where mom's at.","Operator","And the final question is from Drew Crum of Stifel, Nicolaus.","Andrew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So I think there was a question asked on overhead, and maybe I want to ask it in a different way. I think you mentioned that x HIT, you're seeing that line down year-to-date. Do you see that as sustainable? And maybe you can talk about some of the factors that would move that line item in the second half or through the balance of 2012.","Bryan G. Stockton","Yes. I think with regard to our O.E. 2.0 savings, that we've been looking at opportunities to save costs, and I think we've been successful over the years. When you look at it for the balance of the year though, I think you have to think about the fact that there's going to be a drop off in legal savings going forward as we begin to count [ph] non-trial time periods. I think you also need to think about the continued hit in the acquisition and integration expenses that we talked about that will be in the back half of the year. One of the things that you really need to focus in on is the ongoing SG&A associated with the HIT organization. We acquired HIT for its capabilities and content licensing, and that infrastructure is in place. We are, over time, going to take the back office functions and integrate that to our back office functions, but that's going to occur over time. And then I think we continue to see with respect to our employee-related expenses such as merit increasing, increases in rising benefits. And we're going to continue to make investments in growth that we've talked about earlier. So we're going to continue to tightly manage our costs. We're going to -- as we've talked about earlier, we're looking for ongoing opportunities to reduce costs across the supply chain, in things like packaging. But we're also going to be making appropriate investments in SG&A to grow the company, consistent with our goal of growing over the long term at a mid-single-digit rate.","Andrew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And if I could sneak just one more in. There was a question asked earlier today about the ad and promo line, and you addressed that with respect to entertainment, the mix there. There's been a lot of change or, I guess, ratings declines, viewership trends downward in some of the key kids cable networks. Is there potentially any benefit there to make goods flowing to you guys in the second half? Any opportunities there to see that line item lower as a percentage of revenue?","Kevin M. Farr","Well, we're constantly working across all of our countries to monitor our media plans and media execution. And there's always a portfolio of networks that are over-delivering, under-delivering, et cetera, so we work on that almost on a daily basis in each of our operating units, both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. So that's just something we kind of just do as a matter of course.","Bryan G. Stockton","Yes, I think our immediate plans are to get the same impressions, so we'll be out there getting the same impressions this fall and working with our media partners to achieve that.","Drew Vollero","Thank you.

(Operator Instructions) I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference call to Mr. Drew Vollero, Senior Vice President of Corporate Strategy and Investor Relations. You may begin, sir.","Drew Vollero","Thank you, Kevin. As you know, this morning we reported Mattel's 2014 second quarter financial results. We've provided you with the slide presentation to help guide our discussion today. The slide presentation and the information required by Regulation G regarding non-GAAP financial measures is available on the Investors section of our corporate website, corporate.mattel.com.","In a few minutes, Bryan Stockton, Mattel's Chairman and CEO; and Kevin Farr, Mattel's CFO, will provide comments on results, and then the call will be open for your questions.","Certain statements made during the call may include forward-looking statements relating to the future performance of our overall business, our brands and our product lines. These statements are based on currently available information, and they're subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties, which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.","We described some of these uncertainties in the Risk Factor section of our 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K and our 2014 quarterly reports on Forms 10-Q and other filings we make with the SEC from time to time as well as in other public statements. Mattel does not update forward-looking statements and expressly disclaims any obligation to do so.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bryan.","Bryan Stockton","Thank you, Drew, and good day, everyone. We've always supposed the first half of the year as the preseason, where we do a lot of work preparing to execute in the all-important back half of the year.","Going into 2014, we knew we had to build a plan using realistic revenue assumptions that focused on optimizing the middle of the P&L. And because we exited 2013 with the lack of momentum on our core brands, we also said, the key to success in 2014 would be to improve POS, by focusing on product and brand innovation, improving the execution of our advertising and trade spend and by leveraging our tailwinds.","One important second quarter headline is, of course, the acquisition of MEGA Brands, which gives us the opportunity to grow MEGA Brands portfolio of brands, while leveraging our brands in the fast growing Construction and Arts & Crafts categories.","And while our financial results to date reflect the cost of the acquisition and a tremendous amount of work preparing all of Mattel to execute in the second half, we feel we have made significant progress across a number of initiatives that will help us reach our 2014 goals and better position us for this year and beyond.","Specifically, we focused on five things: improving POS; reducing Mattel-owned and retail inventories; testing the insights from our spending mix model work to develop more optimal media and trade spending programs to accelerate POS in the second half of the year; shifting advertising and trade spending to the back half of the year, where it will be more effective; and managing SG&A expenses; and we've made progress against all five.","Our global POS has improved. And while we have a lot of work to do, we feel we're heading in the right direction. Global POS for the first half ended relatively flat, with the U.S. slightly down and international markets up, with POS performance stronger than shipments on almost every brand in the portfolio.","This is a marked improvement in POS performance over the past two quarters. And our U.S. POS results would improve even more, if MEGA Brands POS were included in the calculation.","We made significant progress in reducing the year-over-year seasonal growth in Mattel-owned inventories, which were down by $100 million, excluding MEGA Brands for the first half of 2014 relative to yearend. Retail inventories have also improved. They are down mid-single digits in the U.S. with only some pockets of inventory remaining in certain international markets.","We successfully validated our spending mix model results for Barbie in the quarter, and as a result we'll be expanding the model across our key brands. Based on this validation, we've decided to increase advertising spending in the second half to levels higher than planned to build momentum for these key brands.","We shifted advertising spending under the second quarter and into the second half, where it can be put to better use by aligning with the consumer's new path to purchase. This shift also helps to fund expansion of our spending, based on the results of the spending mix model. And we held SG&A spending flat, even with the cost associated with the MEGA Brands acquisition.","Despite this progress, the financial results for the quarter did not meet our expectations. A key challenge to improving our topline shipments and our overall results remains to be core brand momentum, and while POS has being improving, it's still well below where it needs to be on key brands like Barbie and Fisher-Price.","Also in the quarter, revenues and gross margins were impacted, as we continue to cleanup and clear our pockets of owned and retail inventory. And revenues in the second quarter were impacted by the shift of advertising and trade spend to later in the year.","In addition, the acquisition and integration cost, amortization and the required fair value inventory adjustments related to MEGA Brands, also had a significant impact on overall EPS for the quarter.","Let me briefly speak to some of the P&L results for the quarter. Revenues were down. Results on our Adult portfolio were mixed, with solid single-digit POS growth outpacing shipping, which was down in the quarter.","We continue to see strength in this portfolio, which now features all of the top buy properties in the fashion, doll and accessory segment in the U.S. per NPD. However, growth driven by Frozen dolls is beginning to be offset, as we are seeing declines in Monster High shipping and POS.","Looking at performance by brand, the star of the portfolio in the quarter was our line of product supporting Disney's Frozen, and we are continuing to chase demand here. American Girl had another quarter of solid growth, with the Girl of the Year, Isabelle, continuing to exceed our expectations. And we successfully launched the shop-within-a-shop concept at two Indigo stores, one in Toronto and one in Vancouver, Canada.","Ever After High continues to look like a solid single at this point, as it continues its global rollout. It is now the fifth highest selling property in the fashion doll and accessory segment in the U.S., according to NPD, trailing only Barbie, Monster High, Frozen and Disney Princess.","Barbie shipping was down, however, POS remains better than shipments and POS trends had been improving throughout the year. And Monster High remains the number two doll in the fashion doll category per NPD, but the brand is coming up against some very challenging comps. And while shipping and POS are substantial on an absolute dollar basis, both are trending down versus prior year. Specifically, recent POS trends in Monster High are down mid-to-high teens. If these trends continue, Monster High may ship from being a tailwind to a headwind.","And while our Infant and Preschool portfolio was down, we're seeing improving trends in global POS, which is outpacing shipments. We did see pockets of improvement at Fisher-Price, including Baby Gear, where POS is positive year-to-date and building momentum. And we continue to improve our consumer awareness campaigns, particularly our digital advertising.","Shipping was down significantly in North America, where we're working through high-retail inventory in our Imaginext and Little People brands, but we're seeing improving shipping and POS trends in most of our international regions, which is a key focus for Fisher-Price.","Our Friends business overall was soft, primarily due to tough comps for certain license properties. Thomas and Friends are seeing very strong global POS trends and positive sales within our international markets. Our Boys portfolio was down driven by tough entertainment comps with last year's second quarter shipments of Superman and Turbo as well as the exploration of our Angry Birds license.","These were partially offset by our global launch of BOOMco, our differentiated product offering in the blaster category. And MEGA Brands continues to see solid single-digit POS gains, driven by its preschool and boys construction lines, and shipments were in line with expectations, both lower than prior year.","And while we continue to work to deliver margins in line with our near-term objective of low-to-mid 50s, second quarter gross margins were below our expectations and we're impacted by a series of headwinds, some related to MEGA Brands, that Kevin more speak to in a few minutes.","Advertising spending is lower, as we shifted spending from the first half to the second half of the year. And as I mentioned, we continue to be financially disciplined, managing SG&A spending and continuing to leverage our OE 3.0 programs.","Our second quarter results also demonstrate our continued commitment to disciplined capital deployment. In addition to completing the acquisition of MEGA Brands, we also declared our third quarter dividend, reflecting an annualized dividend of $1.52 per share and repurchased approximately $100 million of Mattel stock.","Looking beyond the quarter, I am particularly encouraged by some important strategic developments that should benefit our business over the medium and long-term. First, the toy business is doing well in 2014, up between 3% and 4% in both the U.S. and Europe, according to NPD. This continues to validate our belief that innovation will drive growth; and that toy and digital play book, share time in a child's life.","Next, we are just starting the integration of MEGA Brands into the Mattel family of companies and continue to see tremendous potential. American Girls expansion into Canada by a partnership with Indigo stores, utilizing a shop-within-a-shop concept is also doing very well, far exceeding expectations to date. Early results are encouraging and we're evaluating the potential to expand the brand further in Canada as well as to other markets.","And finally, we made a number of organization moves that support our how-to-grow strategies to structure the business and place key talent at positions to grow more profitably on a global basis. Geoff Massingberd, who ran our international business, now leads our MEGA Brands business in Montreal Canada, and will manage the integration efforts as well as execute the global growth strategies.","Tim Kilpin, with his extensive experience in brand management will replace Geoff as our Head of International Business, where he'll have the opportunity to leverage his brand now and to grow the business globally, and to differentiate our brands in many international markets.","And Richard Dickson, rejoined Mattel as our Chief Brands Officer. Richard has extensive consumer brand experience and also led the revitalization and successful expansion of Barbie, a few years back. Richard will oversee worldwide brand strategy for Girls and Boys brand portfolio as well as for the Fisher-Price portfolio.","We're confident that these moves will continued to drive long-term value for the shareholders, and will support an ongoing culture of innovation, creativity and excellence, that will continue to fuel growth throughout the portfolio.","As we look to the second half of the year, we're focused on driving POS higher, particularly on core brands. Our top priority remains to improve POS, so we have strong product sell-through and exit the year with momentum in our brands for 2015.","And we'll approach the second half the way we always do, making decision to support our long-term goals, while balancing the impact they'll have in the short term. In 2014, we believe we have the product and brand innovation to drive sales. And we believe we have the right insight, governing and giving our spending mix model to drive advertising efficiencies and improved retail execution.","Product and brand innovation are key to improving POS, and we have a number of initiatives in place to deliver in the all-important holiday season, including new product from Mattel brands, like the Barbie Fashion Design Maker, the Monster High Monster Maker and the Hot Wheels Street Hawk; new product on Fisher-Price, like the Laugh and Learn Smart Stages line.","And a new product initiative from American Girl, with the re-launch of its flagship historical line now called, Be Forever, which will feature more focused character assortment, including the beloved Samantha coming back from the AG archives. In addition to this year's American Girl expansion into Canada, we'll be adding new retail stores in Charlotte, North Carolina and Orlando, Florida and will continue to roll out our new omni-channel marketing program.","We will also be launching a new Thomas direct-to-consumer initiative, where the Thomas brand will leverage the American Girl infrastructure. This will include an exclusive Thomas catalog and online shop as well as a premium shopping environment at select specialty retailers around the country.","We'll have a number of new entertainment licenses coming out in the second half of the year, including Disney Planes: Fire and Rescue, Dora & Friends: Into the City, Julius Jr., Mia and Me, Minecraft, and of course our Hot Wheels diecast Marvel and Star Wars licenses. We'll benefit from the global roll out BOOMco, the continued roll out of Ever After High and the acquisition of MEGA Brands.","And we have a significant amount of new content for our brands, with four major DVD releases in the second half for our Girls portfolio, including Barbie and The Secret Door, Monster High Freaky Fusion, Ever After High's Thronecoming and American Girl's Isabelle Dances Into the Spotlight.","And we'll continue to hand new webisodes and social media as well as website enhancements to support all of our core brands and Monster High. There is a new Hot Wheels DVD release, featuring Team Hot Wheels: The Origin of Awesome and another strong fall DVD released for Thomas and Friends called, Tale of the Brave.","To maximize the effectiveness of these new innovations, we're working to optimize our media strategy across the globe. We now have a roadmap to follow with our spending mix model. We have shifted spending to later in the year, to give us more flexibility and funds in the holiday season, aligning our spending with where and when the consumer shop.","We'll continue to work closely with all of our retail partners and look to leverage trade spending. And we'll also look to invest additional moneys to drive consumer engagement on core brands and Monster High on proven platforms like digital search, content and live events, just to name a few.","So as we look to the third quarter, we see continued challenges from some of the current headwinds, including steep shipping comparisons for Monster High, pockets of high retail inventory in certain international markets and shifting of advertising and trade spend into the fourth quarter, as we align with the evolving consumer behavior.","As we move forward, the organization is keenly focused on executing the fall season. We'll make the right decisions and manage the business appropriately, with the goal of ending this year with positive POS momentum and lower inventory, so we can enter 2015 with momentum to drive topline and bottomline results.","We continue to focus on our commitment to grow with financial discipline, our commitment to our capital deployment and investment framework, and our commitment to deliver our total shareholder return objectives.","Thank you for your time today and your continued interest in Mattel. And now I'd like to introduce Kevin Farr, our Chief Financial Officer. Kevin.","Kevin Farr","Thank you, Bryan, and good morning. Bryan outlined a number of initiatives that will help us achieve our full year 2014 objective to improve POS. And while some of these initiatives are impacting our short-term financial results, we believe we're making the right decisions to manage the business for the long term.","This morning, I want to briefly talk about our acquisition of MEGA brands, before we get into the slide presentation. We have already outlined a strategic rationale for the acquisition with you. With the deal now closed, we're very excited to begin to execute on the opportunities we see to grow and improve the profitability of MEGA Brands business on a global basis. We see tremendous potential for this business.","Construction and Arts & Crafts are now are the two fastest growing NPD toy categories. Combined, the categories are over $10 billion in sales globally, and prior to the acquisition Mattel really did not have a direct presence in either category. The more we participate in these categories, specifically with MEGA Brands, the more opportunities we see for Mattel on a global basis.","As anticipated, the acquisition will be dilutive to earnings in 2014 as we expect profits from the business will be more than offset by acquisition and integration costs, as well as non-cash inventory fair market value adjustments and amortization expenses related to the acquisition. We continue to believe the acquisition will be accretive to operating income in 2015, with a full year of operating leverage and reduced integration and amortization expenses, and increasingly accretive, thereafter.","Specifically for the second quarter, most of our efforts were focused on closing the deal and getting the integration efforts underway. We are pleased with the progress to date on the integration. We have included a page in the slide deck outlining these related costs. The current business performance is consistent with our expectations and we will update you periodically on the opportunity and our progress on leveraging and growing the business globally.","Now, let's review our first quarter results starting on Page 4 in the slide deck. As you can see on Page 4, our worldwide gross sales were down 8% for the quarter and down 7% year-to-date. Sales were impacted by our efforts to cleanup retail inventories, as well as a strategic shift of advertising and trade spending programs to the second half of the year. And while we see improving POS trends, we still have a lot of work to do.","Turning to Page 5 of the presentation, you can see the brand perspective on sales. Worldwide sales for Mattel Girls and Boys brands were down 5% for the quarter and 9% year-to-date.","In the Girls business, declines in Monster High and Barbie were partially offset by strong demand for toys related to Disney's hit movie Frozen and the global launch of Ever After High. In the Boys business, Hot Wheels sales were down slightly for the quarter and entertainment was down with tough entertainment shipping comparisons due to last year's Superman movie and Max Steel, partially offset by solid demand for Disney's Planes and our initial global launch of BOOMco.","Worldwide sales for Fisher-Price Brands were down 17% for the quarter and down 12% year-to-date. Lower sales in the quarter were driven by declines in several Fisher-Price Core brands as well as tough prior-year comparisons for some Disney and Nickelodeon license entertainment properties in Fisher-Price Friends. Finally, we were encouraged to see international growth in Baby Gear, Laugh and Learn as well as continued international growth with Thomas and Friends.","American Girl continues to be strong with sales up 6% for the quarter and year-to-date with continued strength in the Girl of the Year property and solid results from its new retail stores. And with MEGA Brands transaction completed in April 30, we have added another revenue category to our portfolio, Construction and Arts & Crafts brands. The early business results for MEGA Brands are in line with our expectations.","As it relates to MEGA Brands outlook in general, we anticipate MEGA Brands revenues on an annual basis to be lower than the historical average of about $400 million, driven by three factors: first, the acquisition was completed in April, so Mattel's results will only include eight months of revenue from MEGA Brands in 2014; second, we expect lower international sales due to transition of many distributor markets to Mattel subsidiaries; and third, we expect to divest selective non-strategic lower margin product lines in the arts and crafts category.","On Page 6, we highlight the performance of our North American region. Overall sales for the region were down 8% for the quarter and down 5% year-to-date. Our international business as seen on Page 7 was down 9% for the quarter and down 8% year-to-date. We continue to be encouraged by strength in emerging markets in Russia and China. Softness in our core brands and some pockets of high retail inventory continue to impact our sales in Europe and Latin America. And softness in Australia and India impacted overall results in our Asia-Pacific region.","Now, let's review the P&L starting on Page 8 of the slide presentation. For the quarter, gross margin was 46.4%, down 490 basis points from last year's record of 51.3%. About half or 240 basis points is due to MEGA Brands, which includes an 80 basis points or $8 million acquisition-related fair value inventory adjustment that should wind down by the end of the third quarter.","Excluding MEGA, our gross margin in the quarter declined by 250 basis points. A little less than half of that decline was related to impact of lower volumes on our fixed cost manufacturing base. About a quarter of the decline related to our efforts to cleanup inventories. And the balance of the decrease primarily related to changes in mix, mostly due to our gross portfolio.","For the most part, the increase in our product cost will be consistent with our expectations and we continue to expect to offset inflationary pressures with our price and actions that were effective January 1, 2014, and savings from our OE 3.0 program.","On a year-to-date basis, gross margins are down 420 basis points to 48.5%. About a-third or 130 basis points for the year-to-date decline is due to MEGA Brands, with 40 basis points or $8 million related to the fair market value inventory adjustment.","Excluding MEGA, gross margins year-to-date declined by 290 basis points, a little less than half of the decline in the first half was related to our efforts to clean up inventories. About a-quarter declined was related to impact to lower volumes on our fixed cost manufacturing base, and the balance of the decrease primarily related to changes in mix mostly due our Girls portfolio.","We continue to estimate that the overall negative impact of MEGA Brands, excluding the inventory fair value adjustments, which should wind down in Q3, our Mattel's gross incomes will be roughly 100 basis points.","As seen on Page 9, selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter were flat and up only $15 million year-to-date. Our commitment to manage cost is evident in our SG&A results, where we balanced our investments to fund strategic growth initiatives with ongoing cost to run the business.","Spending in the quarter include $16 million of MEGA Brands acquisition, integration and amortization cost, which are partially offset by the absence of last year's asset impairment charge of $14 million. For the full year, our objective, excluding MEGA Brands, remains a modest increase in SG&A, including severance and ongoing strategic growth investments.","Page 10 of the presentation summarize the performance of our ongoing OE 3.0 program. For the quarter, we delivered incremental Operating Excellence 3.0 gross savings of $25 million. And we're on track to deliver our full year target of around $115 million in gross savings and our two-year target of cumulative gross sustainable savings of $175 million.","Turning to Page 11, operating income in the first quarter was $1 million and $7 million year-to-date. The decrease in the quarter was driven primarily by lower sales and gross margins, and the cost associated with the acquisition and integration of MEGA Brands.","Turning to page 12, our earnings per share for the quarter were $0.08, a decrease of $0.13 compared to the prior year second quarter. The decrease in EPS was driven by lower operating income, including the cost associated with the MEGA Brand acquisition, partially offset by lower non-operating expenses, lower tax expense including $0.11 benefit from discrete tax items and a reduction in share count.","For the full year, excluding discrete tax items, we expected our income tax rate will be approximately 21% to 22%, assuming no changes to the current tax laws.","Page 13 outlines the costs related to the MEGA Brands acquisition, including the estimated acquisition, integration and amortization expenses, which impact SG&A as well as the inventory fair value adjustment, which impacts gross margins. We've highlight both the actual cost incurred in the quarter and the estimated annual cost Mattel expects to incur in 2014.","For the quarter, these expenses totaled $24 million and we expect these expenses to be between $85 million and $95 million for the year. The acquisition and integration expense is $11 million, our primary cash cost, include such things as banker, legal and consulting fees.","For the year, currently, we expect these expenses to be about $45 million to $55 million. We also incurred a couple of charges in the quarter related to accounting rules that require that the opening balance sheets state assets at their fair market value.","About $5 million in non-cash expense is related to amortization of intangibles and inventory fair value adjustments of $8 million. For the year, currently, we would expect these non-cash expenses to be about $25 million amortization of intangibles and about $15 million related to the inventory fair value adjustments. The impact to the inventory fair value adjustments should wind down by the end of the third quarter, but the non-cash amortization costs and some integration costs are expected to continue in 2015 and beyond.","We discussed cash flow on Page 14. Year-to-date cash flow used for operations was $79 million compared to $286 million last year. The decrease is primarily due to changes in working capital. Cash flow used for investing activities increased to $525 million, due to the acquisition of MEGA Brands.","We also issued $500 million of additional debt in the second quarter and repurchase 2.6 million shares of stock for a total of $100 million. In June we paid out our quarterly dividend of $0.38 per share at a total cost of $129 million. Our cash on hand was $518 million, down from $823 million last year.","In closing, while we will continue to work through our current headwinds, we remain focused on execution in the all-important holiday season. Our goal is to enter 2015 with brand momentum to drive topline and bottomline growth. Specifically, our objective is to end the year with POS momentum in our brands and lower retail at Mattel-owned inventory.","Moving forward, we remain committed to growing our business consistently, growing it profitably and deploying the cash generated in value enhancing ways to reward our shareholders.","This concludes my review of the financial results. Now, we'd like to open the call to questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Steph Wissink with Piper Jaffray.","Steph Wissink - Piper Jaffray","Bryan, just one clarification for you, I think you mentioned that POS improved from the first quarter. Could you help us neutralize the effect of that Easter shift from March to April, is POS still sequentially improved, if you net out that Easter shift? And then Kevin, one for you, on the gross margin, I think you mentioned 48.5% year-to-date with the near-term objective still on that low-to-mid 50s range, it does imply a pretty substantial acceleration with the second half. So could you give us some of the drivers that you see in that gross or product margin line that we should be thinking about for the second half?","Bryan Stockton","If I take Easter out, it's the same answer. So in other words, the POS will look even better, if we didn't adjust for Easter in the second quarter. So it's adjusted for last year and this year's timing. So I think that's one reason why we feel pretty positive about our progress and why it's better than Q4 last year and Q1 this year. Kevin?","Kevin Farr","And then with respect to your question on gross margin, with respect to gross margin, our near-term objective continues to be delivering gross margins in the low-to-mid 50s range. And when I say near-term, I mean the next couple of years or so. As you know, we don't give guidance, our second quarter gross margin declined by 490 basis points to 46.4% versus 51.3% in 2013. And about half of that as I said or 240 basis points is due to MEGA Brands, which includes an 80 basis point acquisition-related fair market value charge that should go away by the end of Q3.","When you look at Mattel's underlying business, excluding MEGA, our gross margin in the quarter declined by 250 basis points and the things that drove that were a little less, and half of the decline was related to the impact of lower volumes on our fixed cost manufacturing base, about a-fourth of the increase is related to our efforts to cleanup inventories and the balance of decline is primarily to change the mix, mostly due to our Girls portfolio and performance.","Consistent with prior quarters, input and labor cost increase remain headwinds, but we've offset tailwinds with pricing in our OE 3.0 program. As we look forward to the second half of 2014, predicting our gross margin is very challenging due to the complexity of all of the moving pieces, including volatility of market-based cost like input cost and foreign exchange.","However, I'll provide a few comments regarding the items that impacted our first half gross margins. First, in the near-term MEGA has a lower gross margin, which will continue to have a negative impact for the balance of the year, including a $7 million acquisition-related fair market value inventory adjustment yet to come.","Second, excluding MEGA, the change in mix continue to be a headwind and gross margins going forward, and we continue to see current POS trends in Girls portfolio with respect to Barbie and Monster High. Third, the impact of efforts to cleanup inventory should be less of an issue going forward.","And fourth, the impact of lower volumes depends upon your assumption regarding sales for the balance of the year. And finally, we do have some tailwinds in OE 3.0 cost savings, primarily the packaging initiative, and we continue to work on manufacturing efficiency programs, which I said should be a tailwind in the second half.","Operator","Our next question comes from Felicia Hendrix with Barclays.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays","Can we just quickly, one quick question, for the Mattel-owned inventory that you cited in your release and your deck, the $100 million. How much of that is left for the remainder of the year?","Kevin Farr","Again, as we ended the year with about $100 million more of inventory than the prior year, and when you look at the end of June, if you exclude MEGA, inventory were essentially down about $100 million. The actual number is about $98 million. So we're flat with the prior year with regard to Mattel-owned inventory, so most of the issue with regard to Mattel-owned inventory is behind us, as we exit the second quarter.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays","So that gives you kind of a clear slate heading into the second half.","Kevin Farr","Yes. I think that's a fair conclusion.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays","And then, Bryan, just a bigger picture question for you. When addressing the slowing revenues, you've discussed several times now, the need to make additional advertising and marketing investments, and so better align that with the consumer. And I'm just wondering in your view, and if maybe you can give us some more color, what you're hearing from the retailers, how much is of the slowing revenues at certain lines, particularly in Barbie, is due to marketing versus innovation? So just wondering that? And then just wondering also what you're doing internally, so that you could have your finger more in the pulse of what the consumer wants?","Bryan Stockton","That's a great question, and I'll try to keep the answers brief as I can. I could speak for hours on that. Let's first start with how we're thinking about advertising and supporting our brands. We know that innovation is key to the success in this business and we also know that spending the right amount of advertising in trade is important. So as we think about the year, we've spend a lot of time thinking about what happened last year. Recall last year we said, a number of the promotions that historically worked, did not worked to the degree that they had before. That's why we decided to launch this initiative to look at our spending mix with a very sophisticated model.","That's given us some good insights into what we would say is the ever evolving consumer path to purchase with both online and brick and mortar opportunities to buy. And we took the insights from that and we started validating the results that we got from that study in the second quarter. And I would say that the validation was a success, and as a result of that, and again remember this is all done on Barbie, we're doing a couple of things.","Number one, it gave us the confidence to reinstate the advertising that we had decided to cut earlier in the year, so we're adding more advertising back into the plan for the second half. We think that's important. And we're going to continue to look at opportunities to do even more of that, in our brands like Fisher-Price and Monster High. And the reason we feel good about it is, one, the validation; and two, we know this model is telling us where to do it and when to do it. And so that's why we're shifting even more money into the fourth quarter, where we think it will be more effective.","So I'll start with, I think we're a lot smarter about our spending than we were last year and we feel pretty confident about that. And that's why you'll continue to hear us talk about, we're going to spend more than we have planned this year, we think that's a good thing. And because of the, I would say, the more immediate nature of the way that we're doing this testing, we can learn quickly and modify our spending up and down as needed.","In terms of innovation, I'd say, I think we've got some pretty great things going on. I mentioned in my comments, the Barbie Fashion Design Maker, Disney's Fire and Rescue, Planes was a huge success last year. We think it's going to be solid again this year. It's way too early to make any calls on BOOMco, but BOOMco is getting some pretty positive reviews, if you look on online for reviews on it. We talked about the Hot Wheels Street Hawk. I talked about that fact that we're excited for the first time in our company's history over Star Wars movie and Star Wars with our Hot Wheels license.","And on Fisher-Price, we talked a lot about Fisher-Price, about the communication and innovation. And we showed you the Imaginext Rover last year. We're getting good pick retail with that. And the Smart Stages with Laugh and Learn. So I think we've got some good products. But I tell you with the organization changes that we put in place, is we're really trying to create a culture of innovation. Geoff Massingberd is a great leader and he is going to do a wonderful job at MEGA Brands to integrate them into Mattel and drive growth there.","I tell you one of the reasons I am excited about Tim taking on the international assignment is Tim is great at connecting brands and countries. And that's really I think the next phase of growth force in the internationals to make that connection and I think that will give us more insights as to what we need and we've had some successes. The Soothe & Sleep Seahorse is one success and we want to replicate more things like that. That's by the way, the Soothe & Sleep Seahorse in China.","And then lastly, I'm thrilled that Richard is coming back. He has got a great history. You all know the success he had in driving the success of Barbie. And Richard I think is going to drive a culture of innovation and competitiveness, what I think is appropriate for us. So there is a lot going on. But I'd say, we're smarter in spending. We think we've got innovative products and we're creating a culture of innovation.","Operator","And next question comes from the Greg Badishkanian with Citigroup.","Greg Badishkanian - Citigroup","Just on MEGA Brand. This $0.06 impact is that all inclusive? Or were there some inefficiencies or extra costs that were not included in that? And then the second part is just, for MEGA Brands, what do you think the topline, when we start to see the topline synergies, because I think those could be pretty significant, but obviously it's going to take time for you to be able to implement some of your marketing and advertising strategies for them?","Kevin Farr","I'll cover the first one with regard to $0.06 charge. It really relates to the charges that you see on the slide and those are integration and acquisition expenses. They are the amortization expense and they are the fair market value inventory charge.","Greg Badishkanian - Citigroup","And was there anything else, do you think that maybe impacted results or is that pretty all inclusive.","Kevin Farr","No, I just think it was just, what's included is really the operation, the ongoing operations that is the normal operations for the quarter.","Greg Badishkanian - Citigroup","And then synergies?","Kevin Farr","I think with regard to sales synergies, I think this year a lot of the opportunities with regard to sales synergies of putting our brands on their platform, we won't see that this year. As well as we're moving through, as I said integration of their international distributors in Mattel, that's probably going to happen early 2015.","So from a synergies perspective, topline, more to come next year, I think from a bottomline perspective, we'll see a little bit of synergies in the back half of the year with regard to SG&A, but more of that will also come on line in 2015 as we incorporate them in our full year results. But the real synergies here is growing their brands globally, on their platform, as well as putting our brands on their platform and participating in the great category of Arts & Crafts and in Construction. But we are moving quickly to integrate, given the opportunity here to grow this business on a global basis as well as the competitive nature of these categories.","Operator","Our next question comes from Drew Crum with Stifel.","Drew Crum - Stifel","So Bryan, I want to ask about the fashion doll business, and Disney Princess, specifically. How are you guys viewing Frozen in the back half of the year, once you lap this, around the theatrical release from a year ago? Do you see it as a tailwind still? And do you think that the success of Frozen in anyway is having any impact on Barbie and Monster High? And then, the related question is, where are you with respect to renewing the Disney Princess license?","Bryan Stockton","Sure. Well, I love to talk about our doll portfolio, because we have brands number one, two, three, four and five in the U.S. and one, two, three, four, six in the international, so we like that. Frozen is a huge success. We are thrilled to partner with Disney on that. And as you can imagine, part of the success with this movie is the fact that the age segmentation is actually a little different. Usually a Disney Princess movie is kind of the younger girl in that three to five age range. Frozen has got broad appeal and the demographics of Frozen look a lot more like Barbie.","So as I look at the success of Frozen, is it having an impact on our Monster High and Barbie, as we always say, it's very difficult to say. You can certainly imagine as popular as Frozen is that there is some Monster High girls and some Barbie girls who would want to play with Frozen dolls and we think that's great, because we've got the portfolio for it. So that's difficult to say.","Frozen is continuing to grow. We're working very hard to literally chase demand on this. It gets greater and greater every week. So we're working very hard in Asia to produce what we need to satisfy the demand. But what I'll tell you is this is a portfolio, and one of the things that happens with our doll portfolio, I'm sure like some of your own portfolios, is every year there is some brands that perform a little better than expected, some brands that perform a little less than expected. And as things continue to evolve with Frozen, we have other things on our portfolio that we feel good about.","Ever After High, we talked about that being a solid single. That's continuing to pickup momentum, particularly as we expand in new markets. When I talk about Barbie POS, it's not positive yet, but I can tell you that we're feeling pretty good about the momentum that we're seeing in Barbie and the improvements. And there is a lot of good stuff going on with Barbie, for the fall. Again, we like this Fashion Design Maker a lot.","American Girl, Girl of the Year is doing quite well. These two shop-in-shops and Indigo stores in Canada are doing quite well and piquing our interest on what else we could be doing in Canada. So this portfolio is always moving around. The key for us is to keep driving POS growth for the portfolio. We did that in the second quarter. We had solid selling high single-digit POS growth for the overall doll portfolio. So we like that a lot.","Kevin Farr","And just following-up on the Disney Frozen question with regard back-half comps, really when you look at last year, it was only launched domestically, international was really Q1. We've been chasing demand, so we'd expect that in the back half of the year, we'll have the benefit, the fact that the brand is hot and it is global now. With regard to your question on licensing on the Disney Princess's, licensing generally are short-term, a few years, they come up every few years and really we don't get into the details about renewals on licenses.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gerrick Johnson with BMO Capital Markets.","Gerrick Johnson - BMO Capital Markets","I want to ask a little bit more about American Girl, up about I think it was $5 million in the quarter. How much of that is incremental from Canada? And then also American Girl has the biggest direct impact from the Easter shift with school vacations shifting into April. So how should we look at American Girl, if we adjust for that Easter and what would that look like?","Bryan Stockton","Well, I'm not going to get into details on American Girl in terms of some of the things that you're asking about there. But what I would tell you is that, as it relates to Easter, American Girl is all like the rest of Mattel business, if you adjust for Easter, POS is strong and we like where we are. Canada is a success, but these are small-ish shop-in-shops. So I don't want to get into the detail of how much that is.","I'll tell you American Girl, the secret has been, great product, great marketing, store expansion, and because of our success in Canada, as I said, we're evaluating other opportunities in Canada. We have talked about international for a couple of years on American Girl, and it gives us I think some confidence that maybe we should get a little more serious about thinking about some other countries. Like Canada is a more natural first step, obviously for language and cultural reasons. But we like where American Girl is and they've been proven performer over the past few years.","Kevin Farr","Yes. Again, on a comp basis, I think year-to-date it's up mid single-digit. The Girl of the Year is very strong. We're re-launching the flagship historical dolls in last half of the year. We also have two new stores coming. So we've got a lot of momentum and we've had a lot of momentum around American Girl over the last few years.","Gerrick Johnson - BMO Capital Markets","And Kevin, maybe some comments on payout ratio and the target there? What level you're comfortable with? I have a feeling this is going to be a topic. I'm going to be fielding a few questions on over the course of next couple of days. So maybe you can help me out on that one.","Kevin Farr","We've had this long standing capital investment framework. We've had ended 2013 with a strong balance sheet. And we're at the high end of our $1 billion and our 33% total capital. We do as you indicated, prioritize dividend as a key metric in delivering total TSRs of top-third to top-quartile. Our payout ratio is between 50% to 60%. And we also target a dividend yield comparable with top-quartile. And at this point in time, our payout ratio is based upon last year's 6%, dividend increase was about 58%.","So we still have room to grow there. And this business due to its portfolio of brands, its portfolio of markets and portfolio of customers delivered strong and consistent cash flow. And we have an opportunity to continue to deploy capital consistent with the investment framework. And so far this year, we've also repurchased 3.3 million of shares for $128 million, with the average price of $38.39. And we've also bought MEGA for $423 million.","Operator","The next question comes from Sean McGowan with Needham & Company.","Sean McGowan - Needham & Company","A couple of questions here. The Fisher-Price Brand, would you say that that your performance is significantly below that overall category or do you think the whole category is seeing similar headwinds? And then I have a couple of quick ones on MEGA Brands.","Bryan Stockton","Sure. Well, let me get started here, Sean. I would tell you that we're encouraged by some of the early progress we're seeing on Fisher-Price and I know we've talked about this for a couple of years, and all of us were disappointed that we haven't made more progress on it. What gives me, I think more confidence, is what we're seeing in Baby Gear. We showed you some of the innovation in New York in February. That's been in the market, the market is responding, we have more innovation coming.","And then we've always said on Fisher-Price that if we can get the branding and the innovation right, it works. And this is I think the broadest evidence that that works. And so our team in both New York with Friends and in Buffalo with the core business are working very hard to try to bring more innovation in what's going on.","As I think about the category, the category is continuing to do okay in some preschool. We always get a question, gee, is there something going on with tablets. Tablets is not impacting Fisher-Price. The tablet business is actually down I think, the last time I looked at NPD data. So it's not any new thing like that. We need more innovation. We need to get the positioning out there. I mentioned the digital ads, I don't know if you've seen them, but they are very, very good. We're getting good response to it.","I'll also tell you, in my comments, I talked about international. International is still the number one growth opportunity for Fisher-Price. And with our new global brand team structure, we are doing a lot more work in local markets, like China, like in Eastern Europe, like in Brazil, for example, to really get the product lines right. And you see it on the Core, you see it on Thomas, our Thomas business is good. The POS is up. A part of it is wood. A part of it is the better execution that we talked about, for example with content placement.","And the other part is we've got what we call the emerging consumer line in places like China, where we really worked hard with local management to try to come up with the right combination of benefits and pricing to get the brands launch. So we're still optimistic. It's been a longer road than any of us would like, but I think we're making progress.","Sean McGowan - Needham & Company","And then a couple of quick things on MEGA Brands. First, should we assume that this is all the level of detail that we're going to get in terms of how the two main categories go? And second, can you flush out a little bit more of your comments on distribution agreements? So are you just assuming that you're not going to be shipping to the existing distributors, because you know you're picking on winding those agreements or if they decided they're not carrying the line anymore?","Bryan Stockton","So let me start with the second part of your question, and I'll let Kevin do the first. We've done enough of these acquisitions over time to understand what happens with the distributor network. They've done a terrific job for MEGA, as they have with some of our other acquisitions. It takes time to unwind these and get these businesses folded into the Mattel business system.","Some things happen quickly, some things take a little longer than we like, but the whole push is to try to get these integrated as quickly as we can, because we know we have this fantastic global footprint with our international business, and our U.S. business and the sooner we can get them in, the sooner we can grow this business. You want to take the first part, Kevin?","Kevin Farr","Yes. And just to add to the distributor, only [ph] 32% of their businesses is international. So we see this as a big opportunity. And we, as I said earlier, want to move through this as quickly as possible. It's a case-by-case business, I think impacting sales it's more from the distributor perspective, they are concerned about being left with inventory.","So as I said, it's a case-by-case activity, and each of our local markets is working through it as quickly as we can. With regard to reporting, we have added new revenue line that details out Construction and Arts & Crafts. We'll be reporting that on a regular basis.","And again, I think the opportunity is to grow this brand globally, so you'll see that and be able to track that. And then obviously, you see the impact of the 100 basis points that we think in the future, excluding these fair market value adjustments have on our gross margins. This is a great category with great profitability profile.","And as we look forward, we should expect that we should be able to improve our gross margins and operating margins under this business by applying our manufacturing capabilities and our global scale and procurement, as well as continuing to leverage Mattel's global infrastructure to drive more profitability business.","And when we look at the profitability in this category, particularly Construction, we like the bottomline profitability. And we'd like to move MEGA more in line with that over time, and make it a strong number two player in the construction and a bigger player in arts and crafts.","Sean McGowan - Needham & Company","But will you be sharing with us within that line, how much construction is up or down? The way you do with some of the other brands, within a bigger category, but you called out an individual brand?","Kevin Farr","Certainly from a revenue perspective, as far as the detail below revenues.","Sean McGowan - Needham & Company","No. I mean like within that line, that you're putting in one of the line, Construction and Arts & Crafts, would you say, construction was up X or down X or is it only going to be that one line?","Kevin Farr","I think as dictated, it depends upon what the results are to the extent that its material, and that we think you know it, we'll disclose it. So I think we'll use our judgment. But again, I think we try to be pretty transparent in what's moving and that would include within the construction category and the arts and crafts category.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tim Conder with Wells Fargo Securities.","Tim Conder - Wells Fargo Securities","Let me start with a couple of clarification questions. Kevin you were talking about the inventories earlier, what are the total inventories here? You reported $885 million on the company level, what are those x MEGA, I guess, this is the first question on clarity? And then, Bryan, the second clarity question would be, was second quarter international POS down or was it up also? You said on a year-to-date basis international POS was up.","Kevin Farr","Let me cover the first one. I think what I've said is that if you exclude MEGA, we're essentially flat with last year. And if you do the math, that's about $87 million of MEGA inventory that was added to our second quarter results.","Bryan Stockton","And then regarding POS, what I've said is that the U.S. was down slightly and international was up. So we are feeling good about some of the momentum we've got in international.","Tim Conder - Wells Fargo Securities","During the second quarter, specifically?","Bryan Stockton","Yes. And recall also in international, Easter is not a big gift giving holiday, so there is less Easter impact in international than you would see, for example, in the U.S.","Tim Conder - Wells Fargo Securities","And then MEGA, just to kind of continue on the prior question a little bit. Kevin, would you anticipate the growth in operating margins on MEGA approaching Mattel corporate here. Again, you had said over implying the way I would take it, '15, '16, probably somewhere in that area, '16 area, but is that a fair directional way to go with it?","Kevin Farr","Well, again, I don't think we would give guidance with regard to MEGA. I look at the category dynamics, and if you look at the construction category dynamics as a leading player. It's a quite profitable business. We do see a great opportunity to grow MEGA's business and also improve the profitability. I think part of that is growing it and getting scale.","I think second is putting our brands on their platform and getting the premiums from our brands to hit the gross margin line. We do intend to put more advertising behind it to create consumer demand. And then this would basically be leveraging our existing scale. So therefore, we think there's a big opportunity over time through innovation, our brands, global scale, and continuing to working on the manufacturing efficiencies and automation with respect to their global manufacturing operations. So there is plenty of opportunities to improve the profitability of MEGA.","Tim Conder - Wells Fargo Securities","And then lastly, in Monster High, the rolling-over is that faster than expected? And again, saturation, Frozen, the factors, the comparables obviously are difficult, but any other factors that are maybe popping up that you had not anticipated?","Bryan Stockton","Well, the way we think about Monster High is it's still a very large brand. It's the second largest brand in the fashion doll business. It's got broad appeal. It's got a lot of depth of engagement from a girl's stand point. We know that this is a brand that response to innovation and stories. I think the Monster makers, one of the most innovative products that we've in a while. As I mentioned, there is a lot of competitive activity out there that might be impacting Monster High.","I'll tell you we have our eye on it, because as you recall on the fourth quarter last year POS at Monster High was strong double-digit. Softened a bit in the first quarter and POS performance this year has really kind of caught our, in this quarter \u2013 I'm sorry, it's really kind of caught our attention, so we're paying a lot of attention to it.","But I'll also tell you that we're doing a lot of things to support Monster High. I've talked about some of the product. We've get more characters to coming up, more content, I talked about the fall DVD. I also mentioned that as a part of our spending mix model work, we are going to spend more on advertising and trade on Monster High in the back half, as we are with Barbie and the rest of our doll portfolio, because we know how important that is.","So I think the challenge for us is we've had a great ride on Monster High. We're thinking about how we shift this brand from what was a high-growth brand to an evergreen brand, where it will still have growth, but perhaps at lower levels. So we have our work cut out for us on this one, but I would just say we're being mindful about the current situation keeping our eye on it. We're not jumping to any conclusions, but we're really trying to understand what's going on. And we should have the capabilities to do that again, since we had brands number one, two, three, four and five in the U.S.","Operator","Our next question comes from Linda Bolton Weiser with B. Riley.","Linda Bolton Weiser - B. Riley","Sorry if you've talked about this, but I was just curious if you had said if Frozen dolls are cannibalizing just your regular Disney Princess line at POS? And then was your Disney Princess sales up or down in the quarter? And then secondly, just curious about Richard Dickson coming back to the company, and I seem to recall that before, when he was instrumental in helping grow Barbie, that he had a more narrow focus in his management responsibilities where this time it seems like he has a much broader responsibility.","So I am just wondering, how quickly we can expect some of these key fashion doll brands to turn around. I know you don't want to give projections, but would we expect Barbie to start to grow again next year or are you getting any early reads from him that it might be a longer fix in terms of brand strategy?","Bryan Stockton","Well, let me start with Disney Princess. It's always been a solid and important part of our portfolio. And as I mentioned in my comments, Frozen is doing quite well. There is a lot of competition as I said in our portfolio because we have brands one, two, three, four and five in the U.S. or one, two, three, four, six in Europe. There is a lot of movement around, and so it's very difficult to determine what the impact is.","Our job is to continue to grow the overall doll portfolio and keep it all pushing forward. So that's the hard one, but we're thrilled to have Frozen, we're thrilled to be a great partner with Disney and look forward to continuing that partnership.","As it relates to Richard, as I recall in a meeting with you back in February, you were asking who that fellow was and would we ever consider bringing him back, and we listened to you, and just so he is back. But no, Richard was running Barbie at the time when he was with us a few years ago, he did a terrific job, went out to Jones as you know, and did a terrific job there.","We have always thought highly of Richard and we're thrilled when he was interested in company back. And so what his job is today is he is really trying to run the strategies for our Girls portfolio, our Boys portfolio and Fisher-Price. And so you can imagine as a strong brand leader, Richard is looking across the entire portfolio. He also knows, as we all do, that the Girls portfolio is one of our most important portfolio. So he is taking a look at that.","So I'm not going to give any crystal ball looks into what Richard is thinking, but I can tell you he is engaged, he is been here I think about three weeks. Tim is fully engaged in international now, which I think is terrific, so we can get a stronger bridge between the brands and the countries. So I think in terms of leadership, this is a really great leadership that's going to drive innovation and more growth.","Operator","Our next question comes from Eric Handler with MKM Partners.","Eric Handler - MKM Partners","Two quick questions for you. First, when you look at the Fisher-Price business particularly, Friends. A year ago, Thomas was doing really well, and you say, Thomas continues to do very well. Licenses were very strong. You had added Jake and the Never Land Pirates, and I think there was couple of other licenses that you added, Mike the Knight -- well, Mike the Knight is not a license, but you had some other licenses, I think they are quiet doing well. And now we're seeing very weak shipping, I guess for that Friends business. Can you talk about some of the dynamics going on within the Friends business? And then secondly, you talked about a number of categories are showing improvement in POS. Can you just sort of help us reconcile that with some of the NPD data? And are you keeping in line with NPD in most of those categories?","Bryan Stockton","Sure. Let me start with the Friends, Eric. Our Friends portfolio is something we're quite proud of. As you recall, we have a lot of very strong brands in that portfolio. And couple of years ago there was a lot of new launches from Disney, for example, some new BBC properties, and so we benefited from the launch of those and now we're competing against some pretty stiff comps against that. So that's a challenge that we're always going up against.","Offsetting that would be, we've got the launch of Dora and Friends: Into the City! Dora is a really important of the Nickelodeon portfolio. And this is we think great, Nickelodeon is going to put a lot of emphasis behind it. It's Dora and Friends, and since we're pretty in the doll business, any time there is a star like Dora or Barbie and there's friends involved, that's always good for business. So we think that's good.","Julius Jr. is something else. It's been a great show on the Nick. And we're going to be launching that in the fall. So that's a portfolio that has some ebbs and flows to it, driven a lot by the quality of the entertainment. So we think we've got a couple of interesting properties in the fall.","Now, as it relates to POS, we look at POS in a number of ways, we look at POS in terms of dollars, we look at POS in terms of units. And what I would tell you is that both measures are important. We're seeing progress on all fronts. And I think what's encouraging to us is that when we look at our POS relative to shipments, POS is outpacing shipments.","And we like that a lot. That I think reflects a lot of the hard work we put into clearing out inventories at retail. And the key to this for us is to make sure that when the stores convert to fall, both in the U.S. and the international, we've got clean inventory, the shelves are filled with all the great products we've got planned for the second half. So we like where we are in POS. And we're looking forward to the fall.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Swartz with SunTrust.","Mike Swartz - SunTrust","Just wanted to touch on gross margin and some of the commentary around. I understand that you don't give annual guidance, but your expectations of low-to-mid 50% gross margin. Can you just clarify, I guess what's your expectations in the near-term is in terms of product mix?","Kevin Farr","Well again, I think with regard to the product mix, I told you about the tailwinds, which were Frozen and Ever After High and American Girl. And I think we've got headwinds with regard to the Barbie, which have been getting a little bit better from a POS perspective. And then Monster High, we've seen that go from a tailwind in 2013 to what it's looking like in the second quarter, a headwind, which could impact our sales and our margins in the second half.","But as Bryan said, we are working very hard in putting our effort behind Monster High. We intend to advertise more. We've got innovative product line for the back half of the year. And we're working very hard to turn this brand into an evergreen brand. And we still have a lot of consumer engagement around it and a lot of great things happening at retail this fall with regard to Monster High.","Mike Swartz - SunTrust","But is it fair to say that we shouldn't see wholesale trailing POS by such as wide of a gap in the back half of the year?","Kevin Farr","Again, we're not going to give you guidance on what we think is going to happen with POS in the second half of year.","Mike Swartz - SunTrust","And then just with kind of, broader general question, just in terms of how retailers are looking at if the holidays, and understanding we're still in July, but as they get ready to reset their shelves in about a month or so, I mean, are they allocating more or less space to the just broader toy category overall?","Bryan Stockton","Well, I would say the retailers still know the toys are important part of the holiday mix to attract customers into the store. We think that's important. As I think about our broad global customer base, I haven't heard of anybody doing some significant cut in space for toys. I think what's also important as in a real shift is what's going on with online, because there is a lot fewer constraints in terms of SKUs carried and inventories and things that are online. So we're working very hard.","Recall, last year on average about 15% of toy sales were online. You might expect that's likely to grow this year. So I think we're well-positioned as an industry and the industry is growing. I think Mattel is well-positioned with the initiatives that we have in place. And we're looking forward to partnering with all of our retailers around the world to deliver a solid '14 and get ourselves ready for an even better '15.","Kevin Farr","Yes. So brick and mortar, I think overall we think there is not any change in shelf space. I do think if you look at year-to-date results for the toy industry, it's holding up pretty well, it's actually up low-single digits. So from that perspective, we don't see a change or headwinds there. We do see opportunities in the online area, as both brick and mortar retailers, and obviously pure eRetailers emphasize toys, and the trend has been, that's been a growing trend, as Bryan has said.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jaime Katz with Morningstar.","Jaime Katz - Morningstar","I know you guys talked a little bit about how international is still really important, but could you talk about maybe what areas underperformed and how you feel you can better connect with those geographies going forward?","Kevin Farr","I would say, I think we feel pretty well-connected in international. International is facing the same kind of challenges that we talked about on the U.S. pockets of inventory that we had to work through. Monster High is slowing down a little bit. So I think that's kind of broadly where we are in international. What I would tell you is that, our goal there is to get prepared for the all-important holiday seasons in the second half of the year, and they're working very hard to that as they always do.","So we're keen on international. If you think about it, the demographics favor more international growth. There is more customers growing in international. POS remains positive in international, last year and this year. So we feel very good about it. We still like the big countries, in Western Europe like France and the U.K., Germany, Italy, Spain, for example, those are important.","But we're also investing quite heavily in the future of international, which is Russia and China. We were very successful in both markets last year. I mentioned, I think in an earlier answer that our global brand teams are spending time in these markets to make sure that we are get the right product in these markets, at the right price and right play value and culturally position well, so that we can have more successes like the Soothe & Sleep Seahorse in China. So we're still very bullish on international, and I'm pleased to have performed it so far.","Jaime Katz - Morningstar","And then lastly, did you guys offer any color on your sort of initial reaction for BOOMco or do you have any insight to that?","Bryan Stockton","Well, as I mentioned earlier, it's early on BOOMco. I think we've been on shelf in the U.S. maybe two weekends, I think this is weekend three coming up. It's been in France, Belgium and the U.K. for probably five, six weeks. So it's way early. We like and appreciate the retail support that we're getting on the launch, that's terrific.","If you go online or look at some of the product reviews that are out there from all sorts of folks, the product reviews are we think pretty positive and I think reflect the differentiation that we have in this category, and we think that's important. So it's too early, and we'll I'm sure update you more at the end of the third quarter.","Drew Vollero","Thank you.
